I've seen videos of Dr. Peterson on YouTube where he answers questions that people submit - maybe from Patreon or YouTube's own payment system. How often does he do that, and where?

The reason I ask is because I want to ask Dad a question. With all the emails he gets, there's no way he'll be able answer if I ask that way. I want an answer, though, so I'll pay for his attention if I have to.largely thanks to Dr Peterson's lectures, I have finally started facing a dragon of a creative project that paralyzed me for too long.
A Podcast
In my podcast I interview the creative people who shape or influence their communities through their craft.
Do you or someone you know fit that criteria? Have you started a free speech club? Do you have a band that's engaging an audience in a direction of self improvement? Do you run a blog? A community garden?
I don't care your medium, if you or someone you know is using their creative action to build community I want to know and maybe interview you. 
I'd love to interview JBP but I'm pretty new at this and I imagine he's booked up for a while :PJordan Peterson always talks about great men working extremely hard and focused all the time. How can this happen? 

I've been trying to increase my productive hours for many years now. I'm now able to work most days For 3+ hours before I can barely do any more work. I should get this to at least 8 to increase any chance I have of getting what I want.

Who has increased their productive hours per day?It's something that seemed obvious as a preteen, when I looked at my high school's cliques. I noticed that the way people talked would not only identify them, but it was also how they instinctively grouped themselves. They would make up words, or take old ones, and give them a new meaning that was theirs. These words echoed in the group.  
It's like, repeating a term with a certain cadence represented a shared idea or manner.  

It's not that I thought ill of those around me, or that it wasn't sensible to copy each other to fit in. But I didn't want to share their manners nor ideas, I was very obsessed with my sense of individuality. I still am.  
As a result of that, I didn't fit in. I still don't fit conventionally wherever I go, because I create language barriers for myself. I don't identify my tribe, so to speak.

As I became older, I found more and more disgrace with terms that didn't reflect what they were meant to, along with poorly constructed words. These built up from niggles like "Guesstimate," to larger mish-mash greek-latin disgraces like "Democide," and the term "Cisexual/Cisgendered" which, although uniquely latin, would have the same meaning as Homosexual, as Cis has a meaning of staying on one local side.  

It became more apparent that people would create clever-sounding words without much care for the conventions necessary to construct them reasonably. When this occurred I would immediately raise suspicions as to the nature of its creation, and refuse to use it.  

I became familiar with 1984 which inflated my ego a bit. And Peterson's words on how speech is effectively a method of thought spoke deeply true to me. It was one of the things that made me interested in the man.

To bring this into the modern context, I refuse to use terms like Normie, Cis, Patriarchy (in political context), Mansplain, Cuck, Soyboy, ((Echos)). Sarcastically, in jokes, I have. But I'm ridiculously careful not to let it go beyond the odd joke. If you embody a joke, you quickly become the character you're playing.  
I've seen people around me buy into running jokes, such as unremitting racism in the style of /pol/. Whilst I find racist jokes funny, and I encouraged it in some of my friends, it slowly turned out the jokes were either coming from somewhere deeper or had taken them over. To use some Nietzshcian/Jungian terminology, I believe that if you play a character long enough, the Persona will envelop the Self. I don't have any explanation as to why, I simply recognised the pattern. They too, would say, "These things I used to think I was joking about are now my actual opinions. Memes became real."

I know leaving my thoughts here will seem kind of like a cliff hanger, but I'm leaving them here so they can be judged openly. I know that these thoughts come from a lot of teenage pretension, but I still believe them into my 20s and have only had them reinforced. I'd appreciate someone making me less certain of myself.I'm fascinated by Peterson (and Rogan) applauding the merits of an only meat and greens diet.  
  
Diet seems so confusing to learn about since it seems like you can always find conflicting advice from "diet authorities".  
  
I'm curious if anyone knows of any dietary information they consider the best out there or that works for them personally.I think the two would have a lot of common ground to discuss things but both seem to have fundamentally different approaches.I think a lot of you guys will become huwhite advocates if Peterson accepts. Today my friends and me will listen to Jordan Peterson‚Äôs speech in Los Angeles CA, 
Will sort myself out üëè 
I heard there might be some antifa if there are they need to clean their rooms first I will post the links and excepts of the transcript below with the section removed by the AP bolded. 

Why do you think the AP would do this? To me it seems obvious they wanted to remove any positive mention of Christianity. They wanted to remove references to the way Christians are targeted by Communist. They wanted to gaslight the public by creating a false reality for an event most people won't remember. Just think about it, in a year, two years people will go back and watch this clip and have no idea that lines were secretly removed. People will be convinced that since this is video it's proof of reality. 

For me, it makes me wonder what else has been given this treatment? If any of you are disturbed by this I hope you will share it with your friends and family. The manipulation of reality to remove mentions of Christians and Christianity is so flagrantly on display here. No one will know what they did though.

[Trump details Si-Jeong Ho's escape from North Korea](https://youtu.be/jVkj3U1MsZo?t=316)

Transcript of AP video of the SOTU segment on North Korea with censored portions of the speech in bold:

&gt;But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.

&gt;North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.

&gt;We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening.

&gt;Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.

&gt;We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies.

&gt;Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June ‚Äî horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.

&gt;Otto's Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight ‚Äî along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto's memory with American resolve.

&gt;Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho. In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves ‚Äî permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. **His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians. He had ‚Äî and he resolved to be free. Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death.** Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most ‚Äî the truth. Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.

I have to do a Rhetorical Analysis for my Critical Thinking class and I want to do one the Cathy Newman Interview. If anyone written up a complete transcript of the interview or has a link to it, then could you please send it to me? Thanks!Stickied Announcement link (Not the AMA itself :)!): https://np.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/7sye9p/stephan_kinsella_ama_thursday_february_1st_7pm/

Bring a friend!

Previously there were a couple AMAs with Stephan Kinsella on /r/libertarian: https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/search?q=stephan+kinsella+ama&amp;restrict_sr=onIt really should be called r/postmodernism&gt;"In the book (200 Year Together) Solzhenitsyn documents the overrepresentation of Jewish individuals in the NKVD and the Bolshevik leadership. He claims that the ethnic hatred these individuals had for Christians played a role in the Holodomor. Jewish individuals had faced persecution in Ukraine prior to the Bolshevik rise to power. These individuals exacted their revenge on the Christian Ukrainian population. The result was the death of 4 million Christians. 

&gt;The line of good and evil cuts through the heart of every human. One cannot simply say a given ethnic group is evil. Every individual must struggle with the good and the evil in their own heart. That being said, it is important to understand what motivates groups to commit atrocities against other groups because the previous century has been filled with groups killing other groups. 

&gt;Like the Bolsheviks, Jewish individuals are overrepresented in the ownership and senior staffing of the US news media. The news media also is inexplicably hostile towards Russia. If the current war mongering against Russian Christians is in any motivated by the same ethnic hatred that motivated the Holodomor we must face that truth honestly.

&gt;If Jewish individuals hated Christian Ukrainians enough to starve millions of them to death could the same thing happen today? 

&gt;Could Jewish individuals use their positions of power to seek out revenge against places like Europe and Russia that have a history of expelling Jews?"

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAqcge10Mfc) | [the question](https://pewtube.com/user/CustomerService/rdw36SM)I have seen comments about how the aired clip was only 5-7 min and everyone was glad the full interview was published. I am really curious how they put spin on it on TV. 

Does anyone have a link to what was aired? 

Google has not been much help. I think its a common pattern that most people notice very early that you can predict a persons political stances on a multitude of different things by knowing their position on one thing, to a high degree of accuracy. 

Someone who is against gun control is more liekly to be against immigration, abortion or increasing minimum wages. 

But thats not the point those are political issues. What baffles my mind is that people on the left vs people on the right disagree on science too. 

I was scrolling the sam harris sub and a video was posted criticizing the "lobsters and humans both have heirarchies" where a biologist named pz meyers sctutinizes jp's claim and flings an barrage of ad hominem attacks at jp calling him stupid for even claiming something soo false, ignoring the fact that he missed the point. Here I was watchign a video of a biologist say that heirarchies are a human construct wtf???

I get that this biologist has a political left leaning and if he had left leaning political stances I would be fine, but why the fuck are people on the left and right disagreeing on science?. 

I'm tired of "scientists" saying things like males and females are biologically the same and other politicized bullcrap wtaf 

it seems to me that the only things the left adn right can even agree on nowadays is basic human pleasures and experiences like pizza tastes good to both the left and the right but with the insane polarization going on nowdays soon the left and right might evolve to beocme two seperate species.I turn 18 tomorrow and I'm a scared but excited lobster. Whats the best advice you've heard that will help me slay the dragon (roughly speaking)? These rock stars didn't choose their worst fans, their enemies brought those fans and imposed them.

I had this realization watching a recent [Benjamin Boyce video on Lindsay Shepherd](https://youtu.be/mhXZCY-YhPk), which featured an SJW nutjob blaming Shepherd for her followers, and pretty much literally calling her a Nazi.  When she pointed out that "Nazi" was unsupported and even contradicted, he went back to 'then how do you explain your followers'.  REEEEE.  I'll set aside the obvious issue that there is no proof she is actually a darling of fascist extremists, and use her case to illuminate the idea here:

Shepherd never asked for these followers, and nothing she said would have ever attracted them.  The insane SJW's first declared her their enemy, viciously and without justification, even in spite of her protests to be on their side.  They martyred her, flagrantly, and this was all ***their*** fault.  Then, in response to the actions of the SJW's, some of their pre-existing real enemies adopted Shepherd as a justification for their enmity (which is true), and a symbol of their enmity (which is us-vs.-them tribalism / group think).  This, in spite of the explicitly condemning views of Shepherd towards any "right extremists".  This had nothing to do with Shepherd, any of these followers that actually exist were thrust upon her by the SJW's alone.

Some people will say "the rock star does not pick their fans".  You could say actual rock stars do, in a very real way, by deliberately choosing to market to them, and that means they will get the customers they sought.

But what is happening here is different.  This wasn't the "rock star" not choosing their fans, it was the rock star's self declared enemies, bringing along their own opposition, and the rock star merely being caught in the crossfire.

This is all very obvious in the case of Lindsay Shepherd, and any claims that she was the instigator because she posted the vid that brought the publicity, must be dismissed as reprehensible, incoherent and paranoid propaganda.  There is really no way AT ALL anyone can claim Shepherd asked for any "extreme-right" followers.  The most you could say is that in going to media, it is inevitable that any attention one gets will attract followers that one doesn't want, and that includes every kind of crazy for every kind of reason.

The case is perhaps less obvious for Jordan Peterson, but still as real.  We can at least see that he chose, of his own free will, to take the necessary stand, obviously prepared and willing to endure the inevitable fight.  He put himself together, put his life in order, and stepped into the breech a powerful hero for honesty, wisdom, and the high quality knowledge and thinking needed to achieve it.  We could try to say the SJW's made him do it, but the war is eternal, and we must not sink to joining the collectivists in their own games of group think and blaming individuals for the sins of their groups.  We must stick to blaming individual SJW's for their own personal and concrete reprehensible behavior, and we must own our own personal choices to stand up and fight the overall ideology we see as having emerged, rather than saying we were forced to fight group upon group.  Peterson owns his own choice to join the fight.

And all that having been said, there is still no reasonable way to assign blame to Peterson for the fact that some awful people will follow him in spite of what he says, all because the SJW's declared him their enemy.  Yes, Peterson declared them his enemy from the start of his battle, but he also began and continues that battle with an unending honest attempt at negotiation, because he never actually wanted to have to fight in the first place.  This isn't a battle for glory, it's a battle to stave off hell.  His SJW enemies are incapable of a civil response, desperate for enemies to justify their campaign, eager for a witch hunt every day, and their vicious and unfounded attacks on him did effectively martyr him, and actually continue to do so.  None of these things are his fault.  To the extent a few awful people will inevitably "follow" him (not what he actually says mind you), this is ***obviously against*** his own positions.

The SJW's will conflate this shit and blame the people they attack, but that is just one more distortion we must expose them for.  This is why it is important that we recognize and speak to this ever present tactic of blaming people for "their" followers.  The public does eventually see light, and it becomes increasingly embarrassing for spastic SJW's and news reporters alike to use such obvious ploys, ultimately blaming their own victims.

At the end of all this, I offer a ray of hope: a good surfer might ride the hundred foot wave that sprang from the six foot wave they masterfully climbed onto.  They might stay on their board, and land on the beach, unmolested by the sharks (that they didn't create) that infest the waters.  I'll try to be ready with a towel and a well earned drink in hand if he makes it, but I'll also be holding whatever life ring I can muster in case he falls.

Sharks on all sides, stand strong and don't let the terror distract you.Has anyone else read ["The Way of Man"](http://amzn.to/2GsMS0C) by Jack Donovan?

It's hardly as academic or philosophical as Dr. Peterson's work, but I think much of it would resonate with his fans.

Basically, according to the author, the core masculine virtues are strength, courage, mastery, and honor. These virtues are, in a sense, amoral and tactical. They apply to men in a street gang as much as they apply to a police officer.

I found it really interesting and was wondering if anyone else has delved into Donovan's work.

In case you're interested, I posted [a longer summary](https://thegreenpill.net/2018/01/31/do-you-have-these-four-manly-virtues/) of my main takeaways from the book on my website, The Green Pill.

This is a line from Arthur Miller's play, *the Crucible*. Has anyone seen this movie? What do you think of it?

I find it hugely interesting that in the early part of the movie Proctor is pointedly referenced immediately in the event the Devil is mentioned. It's curious because in popular opinion Proctor is regarded as the hero of the story but is it actually a popular misconception, is Proctor the *source* of the events that enveloped the community and so the Devil incarnate? It's never explicitly stated but it's heavily inferred and I think that here perhaps is where the moral of the story lies.

Streaming The Crucible by Authur Miller. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucible_(1996_film)The [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses) are a cult that evolved from one of the many shards of [Millenialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennialism), [Fundamentalist, Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_fundamentalism) cults that were created after the [Great Disappointment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Disappointment) in the mid-late 19th century.


Distinguishing features of this group's beliefs and behaviors include: 


-Refusing life-saving blood transfusions because of a tortured interpretation of the commandment against ingesting blood found in the Old Testament and referenced by the Apostle Paul in the book of Acts. [JW mothers are at many times greater risk of dying as a result of blood loss during labor because of this.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jehovahs-witnesses-blood-transfusion-death-quebec-coroner-1.4401101) 


-Regulations concerning many details of a person's private life. This includes, but is not limited to, proscriptions against the wearing of facial hair, strict standards for style of dress (tight pants are considered a conduit to homosexual behavior), oral and anal sex, masturbation, close association with non-cult members.


-One day, very soon, God will kill every man, woman, and child on the face of this Earth who is not a Jehovah's Witness. The survivors will be tasked with cleaning up the unimaginable hellscape that would be created as a result. The JWs have falsely predicted the end of the world multiple times.


The Watchtower, which is a group of corporate entities used by this cult in order to operate worldwide, is being investigated and/or sued by individuals and governments all over the world because of their role in covering up an epidemic of sexual abuse against children. Notably, the [Australian Royal Commision](https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/case-studies/case-study-29-jehovahs-witnesses), a special investigative body, gathered evidence and took testimony in an investigation concerning the safety of children in various religious institutions in their country. During the course of this process they discovered upwards of 1,000 cases of abuse that were not reported to the authorities. Remember, this was limited to Australia.


Members are discouraged from reporting abuse to authorities by Elders, senior men in the congregation analogous to clergy (though they claim they are not clergy when it suits them).
This introduction is merely a peek into the nightmare world that I was born into one fateful winter day. Eighteen years later, I left the cult. The price of my departure was to be shunned by almost everyone I had ever known growing up. 


I have not spoken to my mother, my brother, or my surviving grandparents in years. I have to hear about their welfare through third parties, some of whom may as well be anonymous to me.
For the past ten years of my adult life, I have lived without the support of most of my nuclear family. I have struggled against chronic depression, anxiety, nagging guilt, resentment and self-hatred. I have taken unnecesary risks with my life. I have abused substances. I have engaged in risky sexual behavior. I have endured economic hardship.  I have resisted suicidal ideation, and continue to do so. I will struggle with these curses for the rest of my natural life because of the trauma I suffered as a result of being raised in an abusive, broken, cult controlled home. 


I have had to somehow piece together a complete human being from the empty shell of a boy that I was when I entered the wide world on the fateful day that I stood straight with my shoulders back and told the truth. I told my family, that I no longer believed in "The Truth". 
Many young men and women do not survive this process. It is common for people who have been "disfellowshipped" to end their lives because they cannot bear the anguish visited upon them by having their entire support network ripped out from under them because of a difference in religious belief, a moment of weakness, or even petty politics. 


Mine is not the only family destroyed. Every year, thousands of families are ripped apart because of the evil that this organization propogates upon the face of our precious Earth. 


I said all of that, so that I can now say this. 


When you accuse Jordan Peterson of being a cult leader, you spit on me and all of these people. You curse the damned, those of us who had no choice but to be born into hell. You shit on our souls, we who have dragged ourselves out of the underworld by sheer force of will, watching our brothers and sisters die all around us, or even worse, turn back to the place they came from.


I emplore you to consider the [BITE model](https://freedomofmind.com/bite-model/), which is a tool you can use to help you determine if a person, or a group, is excercising Undue Influence on other people. Learn about the psychological mechanisms behind cult mind control. Apply this information and these tools to Jordan. Apply them also to other influential people and organizations. Take upon yourself a reckoning of the facts. Think critically and carefully. Use your best judgement.


It is with supreme confidence, and my sincerest hope, that those with honest hearts will find that they regret ever having used such a contemptible slur against a man who has helped a victim of childhood abuse and cult indoctrination find a reason to go on living for just one more day, one day at a time. 


Do not let yourselves become slaves to anyone, not even yourself. Resentment is a poison that will destroy you, body and soul. Does he say that there's only one meaning that is true about a text? What the author intended? What's his philosophy when dissecting literature?I would like some serious replies. What is the rational for all the negativity around Prof. Peterson?The first thing that caught my attention was JP's  firmness in his stance against c16. This came at a time where I was struggling with my previous alignment with the left. That began when my brother was vilified and crucified via Twitter by a feminist girl he was crushing on and all her terrible feminist friends after he expressed shock and anger to the extremely weird response good crush gave him after he asked her out. It was something along the lines of her being triggered by him being to presumptuous or something... I believe he said something like" I'll see you  at said time " instead of asking when was good for her and she took at as some mysognistic power grab. She then accused my brother of writing creepy poetry about her which they all then ridiculed him for. My brother writes poetry about girls in the same vein of the poets Verizon poetry mainly about girls in the same vein of the poets he admirers. he enjoys the recognition because he's pretty good and the response he gets from artsy girls. I terrorized my little brother when we were little like really bad and he's basically afraid of Life . he's afraid to try anything this is like the one thing he's ever been confident about. So then trying to use his poetry against them really bothered me. I couldn't understand how someone could I think my brother was some sort of abusive misogynist woman degrader
.. especially anyone that knows him in any way at all. This got me thinking about how many other people had been maliciously and inaccurately portrayed and vilified and the whole thing started to unravel from there. I was mainly just disgusted and annoyed with leftist nonsense but JP open my eyes to the potential Danger.

I'm a failed musician and I can't really go back because ever since I got off of drugs the first time I've lost it. I had nothing to live for, I really didn't find life worth living. But as I watched more Jordan Peterson's stuff I felt alive again. I don't know why but I can confidently say that this man has made me see but life is actually worth living again. I would like to affect even one person in the immensely positive way that he's affected me. That is my new life goal and I feel like I should start by becoming as well read as I can on my own. I've always done well in school I was in all the advanced placement classes but I just didn't care about any of it because I was too infatuated with music.

So where would someone like me, not really a person who has a hard time reading but who just has not read much of anything, start this journey towards being well read. Who should I start reading what work. I'm really trying to work from baby steps up because I don't have anyone walking me through the material. Thank you for your time and any suggestions you haveI've heard JP address this argument a few times and while his conclusion is right, the reasoning is wrong.

JP's take on a key post-modernist position is:

(A)There are an infinite number of interpretations of any given phenomenon therefore (B) there is no reason for privileging any one interpretation over any other [and possibly (C) therefore the act of privileging one interpretation is an extension of colonialism or some similar nonsense ]

His response to this is that there are only a finite number of valid interpretations which are consistent with the data and therefore (A "There are an infinite number of interpretations of any given phenomenon") is incorrect.

This isn't quite correct and the reason for that is a confusion around the use of the word 'infinite'. There *are* an infinite number of valid interpretations of any set of data **but** it is a **bounded infinite** set. It is not true to say that **all** interpretations are valid.

The post-modernist position actually falls down at (B "there is no reason for privileging any one interpretation over any other") because it is false. There is a very good reason for privileging the (bounded infinite) set of interpretations which are consistent with the data. There are also good reasons for picking the simplest explanations.

An analogy in mathematics is: It is true to say that there are an infinite number of [Real Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number) between 0 and 1. That does not mean that all Real numbers are between 0 and 1.

This is a tricky mathematical point but as JP is a fan of precision I though he should know (although I have no idea how to share it with him.)I wanna torrent the audiobook. anybody know if there is audiobook? No money.I bought a book that is a collection of essays by jung but I still don't have a complete outline of his philosophy. I mean, I feel like I've got it. Clean your room. Take responsibility. Bear your cross. Yet for some reason I can't stop listening to every damn interview and lecture the guy does. It's becoming a problem actually.I did a search for "Jordan Peterson" about a week ago on my NPR One app, although it's frequently hard to stomach the way the news is presented by their "reporters" it provides an outlet for audio from all different podcasts (Rogan is listenable through this app). 

Anyway I began listening to this episode and it was just tough slogging from the get go. The way the two voices frame Jordan Peterson's perspective on the now infamous C16 is much like the rest "he refuses to call people by their pronouns", they later go on to do their best in articulating JBP's stance that it's more than that, that it's a road to the destruction of the West, an Orwellian nightmare etc. but the damage was done, they came out of the gate misrepresenting the guy. Several minutes in, the presumable host of the podcast makes the first claim that he finds Peterson to be a "boring" thinker and again several minutes later after referring to Peterson as having an army instead of a more apt metaphor like "students" or "followers"-of course with the use of the latter word it might open my opinion up to be ensnared by one suggesting he's a cult leader- he calls JBP a "lazy thinker who draws sweeping generalizations", he hasn‚Äôt done the reading says the host. In reference to the TVO debate, the guest on the show at one point says it‚Äôs not a good idea to have people who disagree on ‚Äúbasic principles‚Äù sit down and have a conversation because that will never get anywhere. Yes, what we need in this world is more echo chambers.

Having been a philosophy major and continual student in my life and having grappled with the likes of Nietzsche, Jung, Dostoyevsky, general religious texts etc.  its remarkable that anyone could pin Peterson as a shallow intellect. Yet its always the same and articles disparaging an individual who has clearly, and positively affected people‚Äôs lives keep popping up on my news feed. Hopefully the Newman interview serves as a mile marker for this ongoing conversation since JBP handled himself in such a princely fashion, hopefully the legitimacy of this man‚Äôs intellect is addressed rather than what has occurred up until now. I don‚Äôt imagine Peterson has built his home on sand, such is the reason why his message endures in a storm of paltry waves.
Hey guys ladies and everything in between,

Just wanted to put out the reason I think I‚Äôm so attracted to Peterson (and his teachings)(maybe I‚Äôm deeply closeted).  Anyway...

Simply put, I think he saved me from acting out the nihilism that was plaguing me night and day.  Specifically when the lights went out, complete and total despair ensued.  

But I couldn‚Äôt escape that on my own.  JP helped bring religion/Christianity, responsibility and meaning into my life so that I don‚Äôt feel hopeless and suicidal anymore/as often.  Sometimes I tear up thinking about the place I was in and how I was treating myself and others.

Is that why you all are so attracted to him too, because he saved you from the ‚Äúpit of misery‚Äù and now you feel you can lead a meaningful life?



The last two months I have focused intensely on my schedule. And that is the sole thing that I have focused on here.

However, now since the last week, my work load was pretty low, and I got to enjoy my new found confidence and energy without exhausting myself elsewhere.

Instead of just focusing on a schedule, now I get to observe my environment proper. I see my parents constantly worrying about my income and how I will get through the day. I still haven't touched the udacity courses and that has put me back a bit.

Also, I have a couple of friends who bring me down and are un supportive but who have a dominating demeanor. Being very regular with exercises and running has ensured that I my own aggression and domineering nature has returned. This has just happened in like a couple of weeks.

There was a time when I was meek, constantly afraid, being easily dominated by others. And now, I can stand up to other people and defend my views and my actions properly. I felt REALLY angry for two days when a friend of mine joked about my sex life - and it made me rethink his arrogance and uncooperative behavior. He often dominates people by shouting and being aggressive - he thinks he is scientific in his thinking but he hardly converses or lets his opinions be challenged. I felt that if he did that even once now, I could beat him up to a pulp. I felt those tremors in my body, and I felt that anger. And I am closer to integrating the shadow now.

If anyone is down and out right now, I think this is a pretty good story and transformation in just 55 days. I started some time in 8 December and look where I am right now! 

It's JUST 60 days and the change is palpable and my will has increased. I can run 14 kms at will and push myself to run 5 kms in 27 minutes. 

More over, I am feeling as confident as when I felt when I was on SSRIs. However, unlike SSRIs, I don't have to fear any crash.

There's a lot more to think about now - I am much more confident about doing a future authoring, and I have to do Past Authoring again to dig deeper into my past. 

I will also do understand myself and Present Authoring. 

I entirely intend on purchasing the book, however my card isn‚Äôt functional currently. I plan on writing a persuasive essay on cleaning your room, so I think it would be a helpful resource. Thanks! Hey guys! 

We have had such discussion here and we have /r/SYO and /r/sorted currently operating.

However, the sorting yourself out process is such a complex topic that we can't get the subreddit moving fast. A normal subreddit is just people sharing memes and episode discussions and news.

What we are aiming at with these subreddits is a little more compples and needs a critical mass to get started.

What can we do about it?

Well, we can take a growth hacking approach. We can focus on getting a few people a week, and getting them to return once in the week. We could collaborate with other subreddits about getting disciplined.

We can have weekly surveys about the bad habits that people have. And also the sort of weekly aims that people are having.

We can aim the discussion not just on the person but also on their environment and have an effect that allows the users to formulate clear thoughts. Weekly goals, past authoring, present authoring, under stand myself, future authoring will give people clear ideas to handle themselves. This can be supplemented by a community that tracks the minutia and how everyone is feeling.

We can have weekly threads about : dealing with porn, giving up silicon valley freebies, building an exercise routine, meeting women, learning to schedule properly, giving up ego and thinking win win, handling conflicts, formulating arguments and so on...

There are so many possibilities, but one man can not handle something like this.

We have to collectively build such a subreddit and a list of these resources and a culture that gets us going.

So, buckos, unite! 

Sort yourself out, and then help others sort themselves out and let's see where all of this goes! Who knows if this is the positive feedback loop that is operating on a societal level, where individuals sorting themselves out is now helping other individuals sort themselves out systematically who will then go out in the world to change it for the better!



some remarks from last night's event downtown LA:

* the event was sold out week &amp; a half ago, &amp; attendance reflected this. line for admission went around the block right up until the "show" started. no open seats. crowd was massive when the event let out. 
* demographics defied what has now turned into traditional wisdom on JP's audience. broad age range, LOTS of couples, pretty even men to women ratio. fair amount of older folks out with their 20s/30s kids. quite a few young parents, some of them with their (surprisingly well behaved) infants.
* JP has gotten exceptionally good with his "primary" material. he's one third comedian, one third evangelist, one third spoken word artist &amp; one third academic lecturer (yes, that implies 133% efficiency.) timing, intonation, delivery &amp; fluency all contributed to an engrossing two hours even though none of the content was new.
* a significant majority of the audience appeared new to JP. there were audible reactions to territory familiar to those who have already exposed themselves to the personality &amp; maps of meanings courses from early 2017, or his long-form interviews.

i recorded it all, but the quality is dismal since i had balcony seat. for those interested, i can PM or post a link.

thoughts from anybody else who attended?
I just recently discovered the genius who is Jordan Peterson. Incredibly, I found out after the fact that he is born and raised in the same area as me. I've been searching, but I haven't managed to find anything about him discussing his own experiences growing up in our region. If anyone could point me in the right direction that'd be great.Personal, not political message.

I found that Peterson added something to the old saw about "eating a bear(one bite at a time)" that really unlocked it for me.

When he talks about not being your own slave and negotiating with yourself, he talks about reducing your responsibility until it is something that you will actually accept, as opposed to forcing yourself through, or deceiving yourself that you will do more than you actually will do. It really, really takes the pressure off of action.

I've found that you really can't fake it either, not I'll tell myself I'm only committed to taking one bite of the bear, but secretly I'll still stare at the bear and get psyched out by it. Instead you really, actually focus on the one bite. And then the next one. And when you're truly tired of eating the bear you'll negotiate a reasonable break.

By turning each small increment into a negotiation, and being honest, it makes each positive choice you make something that is, by itself, genuinely low risk and takes far less energy. I've found myself more capable of stringing together positive actions, more capable of actually "eating the bear".

Adding the element of negotiation, accepting my own weakness, has really unlocked a trite saying into something usable. 

I think it's fascinating because it's paradoxical that my confidence (or strength) has increased by really making peace with own weakness. You can't negotiate with your own weakness until you accept that it's there, and you won't negotiate with that part of yourself if you treat it with contempt. It really is like he says in the book, a "Hey buddy, can you help me out" kind of conversation. It's bizarre.

As a result I've found over the past few days that I got a lot more done with a lot less stress than I would have normally.Looking for a spare code or someone willing to share the new years special. DM me!I find this injunction from Peterson on Carolla's show difficult to integrate.  The fact is, raising kids is so bloody demanding and taxing on your time that I can hardly imagine doing all the things that would fit the above criteria.  Really, I've had to actively let things go.  Most of the top five things that would make me thrilled to be alive are simply not possible now.  Simply balancing the demands of child rearing, household management, and work are beyond the available resources of time and effort- even they have had to take hits.  I can't imagine making life thrilling in addition to that.  I have no idea how to actually take his advice on this.  But it sounds like a swell idea.


Can anyone help refine this injunction with appropriate caveats and maybe some personal testimonials here?And no one is the slightest bit surprised.

You can view it yourself by going to the "Community" tab on his channel.

*demonetizedI think it's fair to say that Peterson's work is astonishing on this, and it must be remembered that each traits act simultaneously on your character, combinations can be funny or odd I guess
Each traits was subdivised in two, now some of them left me doubtful particularly :

-Politeness 

How do you define this one in every day life ? It's about respect and manner or so ? Never really knew what this means

- Enthusiasm

Okay we all know what it means, but the measure of this trait still, I don't know where to put myself in, I'm either moderately low or average... How do I tell ? Looking at the description didn't really helped me out determine.
I think I've been fairly enthusiastic in my teen years before I hit depression for one entire year, then now I cannot figure out where I stand naturally on this, it's like if half of the questions about it are now tricky questions, I've changed a bit (not too much tho) due to life events so now I'm fluctuating in some trait, one of them being the enthusiasm.

How do you properly evaluate yourself on this one ? 

Thanks in advance !!
Hello.
TL;DR: Is there a "Clinical psychologist for dummies" ?
So I've become an avid J.Peterson admirer in the last year. 
At first it was to see what he was about. I wasn't exactly a SWJ or a Liberal, I was just thinking that it wasn't that big of a deal to use some pronouns. I found out that I was a very foolish person, and still am.
So I listened and what I heard made me want to listen more. And now it has come to the point where I took his advice and ordered me some of the books he referenced. And now I'm a bit worried that I might be to dumb to understand them. Especially Im talking about two books: 1) Modern Man in Search of a Soul by Jung  and 2) The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.
So I'm asking you guys if there is a way to ease myself and my brain into the subject of clinical psychology to "prepare" me for these books.I 'discovered' the big5 personality test a few days and did them few times, [the results](http://tinypic.com/r/ofrhwi/9) don't vary that much tbh. I've decreased my neuroticism a lot by 'sorting myself out' (but obviously not done yet), 'cleaning my room', meditation, excercise and forcing myself to be social. This ties into my increased extraversion over the years, new social situations don't make me nervous like they used to. I'd still consider myself introverted by nature. I'm very artistic, love discussing ideas and very scientifically minded. Conscientiousness is my 'dragon' so to say, I've been making and abandoning schedules for years now, I like making them, it's the promise of new possibilities I think. The problem is I don't reserve as much time for artistic persuits (='futile' says my Ego) because they don't result in me getting a new better paying dayjob I need to persue my art and travel more.

I've been fired from jobs (IT tech support) more times than I like to admit. At the interview I'm a persona who can get through most interviews by lying through his teeth about his ambitions and goals in life and charm the interviewer. At my current job my manager still can't believe she made an error in judgement by hiring me lol, she was always right about her candidates she said. I've been degraded from tech support to order entry, because I fail to show any drive or enthusiasm, but the ambition and commitment they expect I just can't do it anymore. I admit I'm also deeply unhappy about being single for very long, so a lot of my time and energy goes into persuing women ('cold approach') with little success. [I'm 40 now](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7mczwb/at_40_have_i_really_failed_in_life/) ....

I have a goal (well paying job in Webdev, not tech support) but low C makes keeping a schedule difficult and my dayjob drains me and causes anxiety. My 'work persona' is falling apart because it's not ME, if this makes sense. At this point I need stable job that doesn't require any ambition but pays the bills to enable me to make Art, my bliss. I'd become a plumber if it were up to me.So guys I‚Äôve known about JBP for a while now through his first JRE. I kinda let go a while ago but really got balls deep into JBP after the Cathy Newman interview. After listening to a few things I just feel as though his thought process is so much more complicated and light years ahead of mine that I find myself wanting to understand but really getting tangled up in the vast amount of information he gives of in one sentence.
Not just this but the concepts he put forward, especially with the words he uses (you don‚Äôt here these words in normal conversation) are really difficult to get your head around and try and understand his whole premises.
I know I‚Äôm not the only one struggling with this because JBP is a cyborg and we are lowly humans. Any advice on how to make it easier to wrap my head around his ideas? Or even resources where his ideas are regurgitated into easily digestible pieces??Quick question/thought. I'm shorter than the average male in the United States, which, statistically speaking, is a turn off for some women. Despite that, I'm still in the process of sorting myself out and cleaning my room. The question becomes, what other skills/traits/behaviors/etc can I cultivate in order to rise in the dominance hierarchy, despite being vertically challenged? Thanks!https://www.twitch.tv/h3h3productionsI can't afford to get the book anytime soon but I'm interested in what you guys think about it.So I started listening to Dr Peterson about a year ago and I've made a lot of progress sorting myself out. But as part of that I started actively seeking medical help and it's led to a diagnosis of Bipolar. I've also realised that listening to his lectures is a good way to trigger a manic episode. 
So now I'm kinda stuck...What do you think? I joke my friends and i came up with while talking about himI was outraged about this news.

https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/fury-lorry-ploughs-through-perus-11951429

The truck driver, and the truck itself, should have been showered with a hail of bullets, but the Peruvian judge let this moron go scot free. Such kind of act is a crime against humanity, for which this truck driver did not belong, but Peru's national IQ is 85, enough to call that country a country of morons, and its 'judge', with a probable IQ of maybe 100, thought the value of this moron's life was more important than the value of the Nazca lines which cannot be replaced.

Some people think people under the IQ of 85 (whjich is about 45% of the whole world) should be sterilized ; I think 115 is a better number.

And, I think that at some point, the sooner the better, it is important to stop treating people under a certain IQ as normal people, but something less than that.

It might be cruel, but the world is suffering from the ravages of lower-IQ people, such as the incident above. 

(I don't care if I get banned over this. Somebody has to say it, and if it is me, so be it.)I dont know how to get his attention. Twitter maybe?Looking for 2. Willing to pay a 50% premium. He specifically stated that "you would grow up bitter" and I was just trying to find the video as I have already spent 30 minutes looking for those words in some of his "highlights" of his talks.

**I remember it being in a highlight and the entire clip was about it**

It is NOT from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjfClL6nogo

EDIT: "You grow up bitter and resentful"Hello my name is Charles, and I have a question about personality. Before I ask my question here are my results: 

Agreeableness: Low (15th Percentile)
Compassion: Low (16th Percentile)
Politeness: Low (21st Percentile)
Conscientiousness: Low (13th Percentile)
Industriousness: Exceptionally Low (2nd Percentile)
Orderliness: Typical or Average (54th Percentile)
Extraversion: Very Low (9th Percentile)
Enthusiasm: Very Low (8th Percentile)
Assertiveness: Low (18th Percentile)
Neuroticism: Very High (91st Percentile)
Withdrawal: Very High (93rd Percentile)
Volatility: High (84th Percentile)
Openness to Experience: Moderately Low (30th Percentile)
Intellect: Low (14th Percentile)
Openness: Typical or Average (57th Percentile)

(What the hell does this all mean??)


So I'm 18 years old and have have some sorts of early enlightenment. I exposed myself to large amounts of knowledge over the past 2 years and changed from left to right during the first year of the Trump Presidency. Before that I was left-leaning but was red-pilled gradually. It changed me in profound ways.

I feel like this personality test reflects my past self and my efforts to change and become a better person. I'm very anxious and depressed, most duly to my ongoing porn addiction of 5-6 years. I don't know if I am bi-polar or just radically changing, going thru the underworld. These results kind of make me worried but at the same time it was not so much of a surprise.

When I was taking the personality test, I noticed that there would often be two thoughts that pop up. One being the person that I am now. The other being the person I know I should be, and am trying to change myself for the better for. I would be caught up between these two things and not sure which one is the most accurate for the purposes of this test. Maybe the former would have been best.  

So am I just changing my personality and this is just the result of going through the chaos of it all? Or am I bi-polar and challenging two personalities. I want to believe in the former but am curious to what you all think. Thanks for reading.  















I have seen a lot of his material but I haven't seen him address cosmetic surgery. My understanding is that cosmetic surgery is good because it moves you up the dominance hierarchy and then there is the positive feedback loop kicking in.

So why not do cosmetic surgeries after understanding the risk profile? Especially to someone who is on a negative feedback loop because of his physical appearance, wouldn't cosmetic surgery be godsend?

Is there a way to ask him directly? The only way I know of is by becoming a patron on Patreon and asking in his Q&amp;A.
Anyone having trouble loading his daughter's blog? 

I wanted to read up on what she has to say about diets after listening to the Joe Rogan podcast.This post may not be pertinent enough to qualify for discussion here, and I understand why. Feel free to delete it.

But while I'm not the biggest fan of Peterson, I feel like he and his fanbase may have some ideas on my issue.

I'm autistic and have always had a very hard time making friends. Im 17 and have been depressed for the last half a decade.

I spent some time just feeling sorry for myself, but lately I decided I should actually try and fight back. Ive been doing more things (volunteering for a political campaign, getting involved in Model UN) and those things can provide some respite. I find I'm at my happiest when I'm A. Discussing ideas I find interesting and B. When I feel like I'm succeeding with someone socially (which often but not always involves A). I feel like I belong and I'm seen when I'm succeeding socially (which doesn't happen often).

But I've recently come to realize that unless I'm doing something I find pleasurable, I feel like absolute horseshit. I feel tired, depersonalized, and brain foggy. This tends to be worse in the day and get better in the evening but not always.

How do I not feel like shit if I'm not doing something pleasurable? I feel like I require constant stimulation to not feel awful. I know everyone has highs and lows, but I know the average person doesn't have a baseline of depression. How do I get to that point? Is it my social isolation? But even when I succeed socially I eventually find myself feeling apathetic and bored. This happens a lot less when discussing politics (which im obsessed with) but still. Like the high wears off.

My therapist told me to use coping skills. I certainly will try more, and I do like meditation. But I have a desire to understand why this is happening to me. Why do I feel like shit when I'm not being stimulated? If I get natural stimulation more consistently will my baseline rise, and I will naturally just not feel awful during times I'm not being stimulated? What need am I not fulfilling?"Just a warning this is an opinion piece, and how I perceive JP's dialogue in general."

I've noticed that a lot of people that post on this sub tend to be Christian or tend to be more Conservative, and I'm surprised that this place hasn't become a hotbed for rational liberals. Not that I'm complaining about about conservatives being on this sub or anything. 

I very much disagree with plenty of things Jordan Peterson has to say. I think that if someone asks me to call them by their identified gender, surname, or whatever I will absolutely accommodate to their preferences and make a point to remember that they want to be referred to as that. I also agree with JP in that C-16 is absolutely admonishing free speech. 

I absolutely hate bigotry and racism, but unfortunately it's a part of free speech. The same free speech that allows you to say how you are feeling about a certain subject without fear of being arrested or persecuted for your own beliefs. 

I also disagree with conservatives in general, but why can't I try to rationalize why they may have that viewpoint without being completely ostracized by people who I ( Until recently) thought to be intelligent human beings?

Why can't I agree with parts of what Jordan Peterson says, and then have to be filed as a bigot or racist ( or be told I conform to all of his ideas if I only agree with some)? 

I couldn't care less about his bible verse talks, or even his self help books on how to be a better person. These are I'm sure helpful to many people and I'm not trying to offend anyone, but that's not what I have been that interested in with JP

What I relate to is his incredible logical explanation on every subject he speaks about and it has only drawn me in more to watch his interviews with others. 

I thought that with this new age of the internet, where people could become educated in what was actually happening in this world, that we could move to a state of absolute realization. Where people could ACTUALLY know what was going on around us. Instead it's created this grand canyon of a divide where people on both ends of the scale focus on oppression. And there is this small group of people who are trying to make sense of all of this insanity by just trying to state scientific knowledge on these subjects, or being rationally critical of far end ideas. 

It should absolutely be okay to agree with some points that someone is making, and be cautious with others.

I'm tired of this culture that just plugs their ears and yells at the top of their lungs and calls you an oppressor until you walk out of the room.  

Another thing that I've noticed is that JP is directing his speaking with males who identify with the Alt-Right quite a bit and I think it's one of the best things he could ever do. From my observations he's taking a lot of angry, misguided men and sending them in a way more positive direction. It makes me so mad that the media is trying to focus on JP's ALT-Right ties and making it such a negative thing. It's so gross to me. 

I don't have to agree with all of Jordan Peterson's ideas to be a supporter. I fully support him. For the most part I thing he's doing the right thing. 

From a Liberal Atheist. 

EDIT:

I hope this can be a sub, where people who differentiate politically can work together to bring some more sanity and realism into this world. I think this is a very small ( Important) part to bringing rational thinking back to the mainstream. So i hope we can all work together in this endeavor to understand this is more important than fighting over left/ right, or religious beliefs.

How do you properly evaluate yourself on this one ?

Thanks in advance !So for the longest time I've had an upstairs neighbor who is very loud. We called the landlord to complain. It kind of worked for a while, then the noise came back. I let it go day after day after day, but the resentment was building in me. I hear them arguing, laughing, singing, dropping shit, etc...and not in a way that's just the sound of someone living above you.


After some time I figure well it's my fault for not saying anything, so I wait until the next inevitable big bang. It was big. I'm angry, but I know from listening to this guy argue with his girlfriend that he's big and he's possibly unstable...part of the reason for my hesitation for so long.


But I decide to use the momentum of my anger to go upstairs and tell him to keep it down. I'll be honest with you guys, I was shaking. I felt like a bitch. I knock on the door and hear "WHO THE FUCK IS THAT...?"

He answers, I say (shakily) "hey man, can you just keep it down a bit?" 

He says "what do you mean, when I open the reclining chair? That was like a one time thing"

I say "no it's been going on a while, like when you drop stuff and..."

At this point I'm embarrassed from my stammering....so in an awful attempt to explain my stammering I *try* to say:

"Look man, I have some anger issues, it's nothing personal I just I get annoyed when I hear all these loud noises and I wanted to say something now before I did something stupid like yell or blow up or something"


Fucking stupid, I know. It was weak. I was truly just nervous but didn't want to appear weak. That's what I get for not telling my truth....


But the real problem is not just that I mispoke...because all I managed to stammer out was "Look I have anger issues and..."


And this dude's eyes got wide as dinner plates. Turns out my anger issues are *nothing* compared to this dude's.


"YOU HAVE ANGER ISSUES, YOU COME AT ME WITH THAT? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE COMING AT ME WITH THAT? 


(This guy is a vet. I now believe he's legit got ptsd. He goes on)


"IVE ALREADY FUCKING KILLED THREE PEOPLE. IVE BEEN BLOWN UP, GIVE ME A FUCKING EXCUSE. GIVE ME A FUCKING EXCUSE NOT TO FUCKING KILL YOU RIGHT NOW. NOT TO THROW YOU OFF THE FUCKING BALCONY. IM LOOKING TO SPILL SOME FUCKING BLOOD. GO AHEAD, GIVE ME AN EXCUSE."

He's very much in my face, got me up against the wall. His girl is trying to calm him down. 


I've been in arguments and fights before but this was something else. I could not reason or talk to him. His eyes looked like he was on acid. He was not a fucking human.


I fucked up and I feel like a fucking moron for what I said. I mispoke so bad. But I was nervous. It went so badly and now I don't feel safe.


I descalated as best I could. I brought him down from %210 to %190 by trying to calmly explain myself, then I left. 

I lock my flimsy wooden door while he's still going off, talking about how I better have a gun and better not fucking look at him if I see him, more threats.


Fuck guys. Fuck. I don't feel safe in my own apartment. I learned a BIG fucking lesson on choosing my words carefully. On calming the fuck down before confronting someone. At the same time, I can't help but feel like a more stable person wouldn't of reacted like that even if I came off as agressive.


What's done is done though, lessons learned. What is my next move here? 


Bonus bit: my girlfriend's parents said to call the police and just tell them what happened. They sent some cops down. The neighbor upstairs tells them I said I came at him with "I have anger issues". They all chuckle, and wish my fucking neighbor *good luck on his state trooper test* or some shit. 


This psychopath is trying to be a *cop*. What the **actual** fuck!!!

Update: I'm deleting my account. Too much personal info on it. I will still be checking this topic.


Thank you very much for all the replies. They have been very helpful.Isn't it a bit hypocritical that JP says on Joe Rogan that no one from the left dares debate him, yet people from the alt right always offer to debate him and he declines. 

I mean whats going on here. I'm pretty sure he knows enough to dismantle any form of identity politics since avoiding thats, what he studied for the last 40 years. 

Like the alt righters are *reasonable in thinking they are* correct  when they say that their views are legit because JP just won't debate them. ( he has been offered 3 times) 

*edit*
https://youtu.be/f-wWBGo6a2w?t=2h5m13sEDIT:

I removed the part about me hitting rock bottom and all that because nobody likes a sob story, am I right? Just gets downvoted anyways.

And I am not looking for advice or a handout, neither am I telling you some story about that there are no credit cards where I'm from (even though I don't have one) or that I'm just looking for a free alternative (which resulted in people offering their spare accounts).

So, instead, I'll just politely ask again:

Could I please have a spare account, please?
Some of you seem to have them and are willing to share them and I'd really appreciate it. Thanks![Here's a great review about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjzbiKnyAv4)

The plot is literally about a journey into the underworld to rescue a parent. It's done so well, music and art style. If you're a fan of JP definitely check it out because it's use of archetypes and spotting them is an absolute joy.

It also gets **Incredibly Dark** so if the children's show look puts you off don't worry...I don't know what to make of my results. Can you help me understand?

To me this this paragraph comes down to this: "If you believe your boss is evil, that's just because you are communist and stupid". Only after listening to this section several times, I realized that he is technically correct, but uses some rhetoric trickery. This entire section is based on this strawman: (see highlighted)

Not all CEOs are psychopaths, but many of them are. 

According to a quick google-search: 

&gt; The study of 261 senior professionals in the United States found that 21 per cent had clinically significant levels of psychopathic traits. The rate of psychopathy in the general population is about one in a hundred.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/13/1-in-5-ceos-are-psychopaths-australian-study-finds/

___

I believe this goes even farther: A central critique towards capitalism is, that it encourages psychopaths, and especially psychopathic behavior in companies. 

By making this argument he  implicitly promotes AnCap/deregulation. If you continues his thought, you'll find that companies are led by good (=non-psychopathic) people and therefor regulations are not required. (I am not entirely sure that this is what he was aiming at though)

I believe he made this argument  to gain favor with the crowd he's talking to. But in doing so he lost all credibility for me. 

I only noticed this manipulation, because I was aware of the study. If I hadn't, I would've agreed with him, as I have agreed with everything he said so far. 

Now I'm aware, that he is not entirely honest. I will continue listening to him to understand the conservative point of view, but I'll stop believing anything he says (which I should have in the first place). 


Apart from putting my shoulders back with a straight posture is there anything else I can do?I want to learn more about what JP discussed in his Cathy Newman interview. I don't want to take his word on it. First it was Cathy Newman and now it is John Semley from Globe and Mail claiming the 'army of JBP trolls' are sending him death threats or calling him obscene names. 

How much of this is real? And if real how much comes from actual JBP followers vs SJW types trying to create a narrative?

What could or should be done (if anything)? 
On the one hand, we don't want people like that to be used as evidence of JBP followers being trolls and in the other any attempts to address the claims of harassment are used by SJWs as proof of the problem. Perhaps whenever claims of harassment are put forth the public should just demand proof. I don't know, just looking for some thoughtful comments from the community. Long story short, my dad's fiancee's kid at 18 made some not so smart decisions and landed himself in prison. He's a relatively bright kid, and is trying to spend the remaining year in prison reading as learning as much as he can to unfuck himself the best he can.

Anyways, he doesn't have access to a computer and I bought the self authoring program x 2, and while filling it out this morning, realized it would be a big boon for him to be able to fill something like this out.If any one of you has been doing GTD, then you must know what a MindSweep is!

After so many days of forcing myself to get up and work, and be regular with exercises and all this stuff combined, I am feeling better now.

During the last 50 days, I had to sit and work on something, and purposefully ignore everything else that demanded my attention. I felt like I was in darkness, and that darkness demanded sunlight, but I focused only on one thing at a time. So there was tension, there was a willingness to move towards light, but I kept that movement off because I did not want to be carried away!

Now, now that I have a lull period and a full day's worth of schedule, I can finally get everything off my head and think about it all.

So, I launched up an app and made a list of everything that I have to do and jotted it down. Now I will have to think about it all and decide what needs to be done about it.

But this is going to be far better than any of my other recoveries! This time, I feel in control, I don't feel restless or have a nagging anxiety that tells me something is off. I feel a sense of certainty.

Unlike before, I am NOT heading off doing something because I feel like doing it at the time. Unlike before, I am not selecting something to work on without any basis thinking eventually I will figure it out.

Also, a friend recently commented that I have lost a considerable amount of weight and that there's a certain glow about me :-) Good, no?

Then read the 4 hour body: I feel I can get back to optimum body fat percentage and in no time at all!

So, all of this is exciting stuff. And today, I did something wonderful that I had never done before: Planned an evening a long time in advance!I‚Äôm curious if anyone attends a church that have referenced or said anything about Jordan Peterson. IÔ∏èt seems like the mainstream (evangelical) Christian Church is on the decline based on many studies IÔ∏è have read. With JBP pouring meaning into the bible and gaining large amounts of positive response and viewership, IÔ∏è would think some churches would be taking some notes and trying to reiterate what he is saying. Any suggestions on books by Carl Jung that describe some of the archetypes? I'm writing paper contrasting the hero and the shadow and need some corresponding literature. I've been binge watching Professor JBP for the last 4 months.I watched MoM 2017 thrice, and currently reading through  12 Rules (audio+ebook).
What I notice about myself is that my inner voice is sounding more and more like him.(before JBP I was following David Fester Wallace and before that Ayn Rand and my plan is to do the same with other _heroes_ I would encounter - as an exercise to reflect and understand from their works)

One part of me feels good about this exercise as-I am paying more attention to how I use my words, and I see the effect it produces when I talk to people around me.That part of me holds on to the idea that-you are motivated by those ideas which resonate with you,and its natural for you to integrate these ideas into your own life and make them your own-I write daily on the things I read so as to improve my thought process.

But there is this other part of me that tells me-"you are borrowing other peoples ideas and making them your own-maybe you are too stupid to think on your own,Maybe you should stop reading all together and write.that part of me makes me feel as if I am betraying myself-I am sacrificing my ingenuity ,and becoming more and more pretentious with each book I read.

What is your take on this?

"the things you hear aren't going to destroy you. The thoughts you have about what you hear will. Your negative thoughts will drive you down to the point of hopelessness."

I saw it in this post https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/7umf5c/my_grandpa_just_shared_some_wisdom/ and i really liked it. More context in the original post.I was watching the Rubin Report with Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson, and at some point both Shapiro and Peterson scoff at the idea that the country was founded based on enlightenment principals. They assert it was founded on Judeo Christian values. This is something that comes up allot, but I'm just not sure why. What parts of Judeo-Christian culture value the following aspects of our government:
1) The Freedom of Speech
2) The Right to Bear Arms
3) The Separation of Church and State 
4) Not being forced to house a soldier
5) Federalism
6) Separation of Power (Checks and Balances)
7) Democratic republic (2 legislative branches, and democratically appointed executive)
8) Civilian controlled military

Here is a link to the discussion:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRPDGEgaATUAlso, why isn't the damn thing ( full interview) uploaded yet on H3? Snippet-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyVuxTIxHzY I've wondered what might be the various factors that causally contribute to the well known tendency of rural populations to tend conservative, and urban populations to tend liberal. With many exceptions, I think it's applicable to both politics and lifestyle. 

A theory of mine, which is based on nothing substantive, is somewhat related to JBP's observations of hierarchies in nature, i.e. the lobsters. Roughly put, it is as follows: Rural populations are more exposed to nature. The reality of dominance hierarchies and natural order are plain to see in nature, for those interested in seeing it. Thus, the desire for equal outcome, evisceration of personal responsibility, dependence on others and the state for personal welfare, all of which are incompatible with conservatism, are just simply absurd and untenable in a rural lifestyle. 

I think the further one is removed from the artificiality of urban centres the more the importance of personal responsibility, for survival and fulfillment, becomes apparent. To take a cliche example, a farmer learns through blood and sweat the important of hard work, self-dependency, and individual responsibility. They become core to his essence. 

Other examples include the observation of wildlife. The pretence of equality, in capability and outcome, is so completely foreign to their lifestyle to be laughable. If, you know, wildlife could laugh. Or had the enough time off from fighting for survival and reproduction to meditate on equality of outcome. 

I don't mean to suggest this is the only relevant factor, or that's it's necessary really significant. I've just been thinking about how the time I spent growing up in a rural environment affected my thinking, and how the last substantial part of a decade I've spent in a city has affected it in different ways. 

Curious about your thoughts on this hypothesis! Does it make sense? Is it absurd? I'm looking for a video.  I believe the video was of Jordan Peterson and he was talking about how Lenin invented the term "Political correctness" and how "Correctness" is good and as soon as you put the term "Political" in front of it it changes the term to evil.  Thanks!I'm trying to create a more air tight argument on why bill C16 is bad and what a lot of people get wrong about it, so I can share it with friends and convince them that Peterson is no joke. In doing this, I made a write up that sites specific bills, laws, and white paper that comes out of official (generally government) sources only. This is what I have so far. Did I get anything wrong? Is there anything missing? Any lawyers out there who want to give me their 0.02? Here it is:


It starts with the Canadian Human Rights Act (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/H-6.pdf) which states that its illegal to discriminate on the grounds of race, sex, and some other things. It creates a quasi-justice system via the Canada Human Rights Commission and Tribunal that accepts complains from Canadians when they are allegedly discriminated against and can decide, based on a set of rules set by the act, if it is discrimination. The tribunal can fine the discriminator(s) and, if they don‚Äôt pay, this can be resolve in the Federal Court, which has the full force of the law (including jail and/or taking the fine out of wages). This also makes organizations liable for the harassment &amp; discrimination that their employees may commit.

Then, bill C16 amends the law to include gender identity and gender expression in two ways (https://lop.parl.ca/Content/LOP/LegislativeSummaries/39/1/c16-e.pdf). First, it added gender identity and gender expression to the list of things that people can‚Äôt discriminate against by the Canadian Human Rights Act. Second, it amended the criminal codes so that a crime could be elevated to a hate crime based on discrimination by gender identity and gender expression. According to the Canadian Justice Department‚Äôs website‚Äôs FAQs on the bill (http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/pl/identity-identite/faq.html) the definition of gender identity and gender expression is left purposefully open. Courts, judges, lawyers, ect‚Ä¶ can use existing laws in Canada to figure out what these terms mean, such as the Ontario Human Rights Commission, which is listed specifically on the DOJ‚Äôs website as an example of how the ambiguous terms would probably get interpreted (http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en). Quote from the FAQ: 

*  ‚ÄúIn order to ensure that the law would be as inclusive as possible, the terms ‚Äúgender identity‚Äù and ‚Äúgender expression‚Äù are not defined in the Bill. With very few exceptions, grounds of discrimination are not defined in legislation but are left to courts, tribunals, and commissions to interpret and explain, based on their detailed experience with particular cases.
* Definitions of the terms ‚Äúgender identity‚Äù and ‚Äúgender expression‚Äù have already been given by the Ontario Human Rights Commission, for example. The Commission has provided helpful discussion and examples that can offer good practical guidance. The Canadian Human Rights Commission will provide similar guidance on the meaning of these terms in the Canadian Human Rights Act."

So, we can look at the OHRC‚Äôs many white papers on the topic for possible interpretations of the law. Include in this is the document titled ‚ÄúPolicy on preventing discrimination because of gender identity and gender expression,‚Äù which is 62 pages long. (http://www.ohrc.on.ca/sites/default/files/Policy%20on%20preventing%20discrimination%20because%20of%20gender%20identity%20and%20gender%20expression.pdf). For a shorter example we can look at this here (http://ohrc.on.ca/en/questions-and-answers-about-gender-identity-and-pronouns) where the OHRC discusses ‚ÄúWhat does it mean to be transgender and why do pronouns matter?‚Äù where they explicitly say ‚ÄúThe law recognizes that everyone has the right to self-identify their gender and that ‚Äúmisgendering‚Äù is a form of discrimination.‚Äù More quotes:
* Our lawmakers and courts recognize the right to freedom of expression, and at the same time, that no right is absolute. Expression may be limited where, for example, it is hate speech under criminal law.
* The Supreme Court has also found that some limits on free speech are justifiable to protect people from harassment and discrimination in social areas like employment and services. On the other hand, decision-makers have said that freedom of expression is much less likely to be limited in the context of a public debate on social, political or religious issues in a university or a newspaper.

As many individuals discuss this law, the leading argument against the opinion that bill C16 is an overstep is that it only effects criminal code so the only time people can be found of discrimination based on misgendering someone if when it is an aspect of a crime one is already guilty of and the crime is elevated to a hate crime. This is false. Bill C16 alters the Canadian Human Rights Code, which allows individuals to be fined for discrimination (regardless of breaking the criminal code) AND the grounds for discrimination are based on the OHRC‚Äôs definitions of gender expression and gender identity, which blatantly says that misgendering is a form of discrimination. 

Another argument against C16 being an overstep is that it probably won‚Äôt limit public debate, but it already has limited public debate. We can see in two examples (Jordan Peterson and Lindsay Shepherd) that more than one university has interpreted the law such that they are liable for their professor‚Äôs and TA's lectures, so they must discipline their staff so they break this purposefully vague law. 

As a final note, the OHRC also specifically says that their interpretation of misgendering as grounds for discriminating someone via gender expression and gender identity includes cases regardless of intent. Quote from the 62 page white paper (http://www.ohrc.on.ca/sites/default/files/Policy%20on%20preventing%20discrimination%20because%20of%20gender%20identity%20and%20gender%20expression.pdf): 

* "Discrimination is not always direct and is often hard to detect. The claimant must show on a ‚Äúbalance of probabilities‚Äù (more likely than not) that adverse or negative treatment happened. The analysis should be flexible and look at all relevant factors in the situation including circumstantial evidence as well as the full impact on the affected person or group. While there may be evidence of ‚Äúintent,‚Äù this is not needed to prove discrimination. Gender identity, gender expression or other protected characteristics need only be one of the factors in the negative treatment for discrimination to exist."

This quote also outlines that conviction for discrimination is not based on the ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt‚Äù but instead ‚Äú50 percent plus a feather,‚Äù not dissimilar to many of the requirements for conviction under the United State's Title IX Sexual Discrimination policy (depending on the state and university. One example from Alaska (https://www.alaska.edu/voice/2017/July-2017/system-news/sex-discrimination-policy/)

* The preponderance of evidence standard, defined in Board of Regents regulation as ‚Äúmore than likely than not that alleged conduct occurred,‚Äù is used in Title IX investigations. The preponderance of evidence standard is typically described as 50 percent plus a feather. This is a less challenging standard than the legal system which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction. Violation of the university‚Äôs policy will result in discipline of the offending party, including the possibility of separation from the university.


Ive watched all of his stuff and ready to move on. Any tips?So I've been having a debate with an atheist about their assertion that religion and politics are essentially the same thing. Essentially, that religion is inherently political. I tend to disagree with his view. 

I would say that they are separate and that religion can be used for political purposes and vice versa but that it's not inherently political by itself.

Would you agree or disagree and why?Hey there, 

Been interested in Jordan for a while and so I decided to get the 12 Rules of Life. I'm really enjoying it so far but there seems to be a mistake on Page 46 within Rule 2. When talking about the snake in the Garden of Eden, Jordan writes:

'Even had all of those been banished, however (in some inconceivable manner, by some primordial St. George)'

This is surely a mistake, right? St. George is the patron Saint of England who fought a dragon (as Jordan actually talks about on many different occasions.) Being Irish I know that the Saint that banished snakes is actually the patron Saint of Ireland, the irrefutably more famous Saint Patrick.

I searched in vain for references to Saint George and banishing snakes but to no avail. Obviously, it's a minor mistake and doesn't undercut his point at all, I just find it strange that such a mistake was made in this book and by Peterson himself. Unless, of course, I'm missing something?

Thought I'd drop it in here anyway! Hoping to hear if anyone has anything to say!I'm the one who wrote what is in the screencap of this post: reddit.com /r/JordanPeterson/comments/7ukla4/what_the_altright_actually_thinks_of_jordan/

I don't know how I could prove this to you, but I wrote that.

Ask me anything. In fact, debate me.

For the record, I think Jordan Peterson is starting a dangerous cult, and that his theology is antichrist. He is now putting himself forward as some kind of prophet that has visions of the future. I would rather not debate you on these particular points, I just want you to know what I think your cult leader so you know where I stand, in addition to what is written in the screen cap.

Additionally, I don't consider myself a member of the Alt-Right, and I don't like the purported leaders of that movement, either. I see the Marxists / Alt-Right as a false dichotomy.

Debate me.Where do I leave my question for his Patreon Q&amp;A? Pardon my ignorance. After listening to Jordan Peterson's podcasts on Joe Rogan and Rubin report it is apparent that Peterson's psychological perspective is rooted in the concept or beliefs and meanings. Peterson also seems to be interested in self-development as he has developed a self-authoring program and his principles seem to guide his audience toward developing a life guided by meaning. Peterson has often referred to meaning as the highest guiding principle even over happiness. 

Thomas Metzinger, a well-known university psychologist in Germany, is involved in interesting academic studies studying consciousness, ethics, and virtual reality. His theoretical standpoint is that the concept of a 'self' is false and is constructed through an internal construction of perceptions. Therefore, belief or meaning is constructed through attributing value to objects or perceptions according to internal or societal projections. 

In my understanding, Metzinger's theories have developed as a result of meditation and scientific experimentation rather than Peterson's analytical study of Jung and historical/religious/archetypical symbols that seem to apparent in the human psyche. 

Peterson's view on meaning being greater than happiness seems to precede his notion of momentary suffering for future happiness. One could argue that Peterson's approach to psychology has more similarities to philosophy as there is a greater emphasis on meaning. I am interested in why Peterson chooses to value meaning over happiness/self-content/fulfillment when theories like Metzinger's seem to advocate that concepts of no-self and deconstruction of the ego are more beneficial to self-development.There's an attempt by the molocks in /pol/ to entangle Jordan Peterson in an Anti-Semetic row. To anyone who's interested in keeping this sub untarnished by the feces that /pol/ is swimming in I'd ask you all to avoid engaging in anything related to /pol/, the Jews, Israel or Zionism.

Ecclesiastes 3:1

Everything in it's appointed time

Edit: I'd also ask anyone who can given the continuous time zone Reddit is available in to periodically reiterate this, unless the mods are feeling generous and are willing to sticky it

Edit 2: u/Anonymous13812 is a new user who has made one of the threads I'm talking about. Weirdly the top comment keeps getting saged in favour of u/Anonymous13812.I'm sure you've all been in the position where you wish you remembered when Dr. Peterson mentioned a topic in a YouTube video. But skipping around a 2.5hr video trying to find when he said it isn't a feasible solution, especially given his lecturing style of giving different examples to tie back to the topic being discussed.

To help with this I started making a simple caption searching [tool](https://yts.thecompewterlab.com/index.html).

I wrote a brief description of it [here](https://thecompewterlab.com/#/youtube-search), which includes a link to a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouQHzDNTxkY) demonstrating its usage. 

It works great with videos which have captions enabled by default (most if not all of Dr. Peterson's), and it will attempt to search captions of videos which don't. So I can't promise it will work with all videos, but the videos which appear in the search results should be working.

I'd love your thoughts and feedback. If you find a bug or have ideas let me know!Hello fellow-buckos,

I am one of those "found-him-recently-binged-lectures-he-is-changing-my-life" types. While I am really enjoying all the great content that comes up on a nearly weekly (sometimes more than weekly basis), I am concerned for Jordan's health. It seems like he is going 100%, from podcast to broadcast, interview after interview, now with a popular book release, without getting much of a break for himself. This concerns me, as I don't want him to push himself too far (even Jocko Willink needs recovery days). I am not sure what a solution would be, maybe a two week break? I just can't imagine he's had much time to rest or reflect (or drink water), and this makes me concerned, as I don't know if he knows his own limits or realizes that it's okay to take time off for himself. As his fame seems only to be escalating at this point, I feel like this is a valid concern. What are your thoughts? I just spewed this out and followed it to the uncomfortable mental stalemate of the last few lines. If anyone has any thoughts regarding a solution to the conundrum it may save my sanity (no pressure!)
------  

In ideal circumstances a man will choose to marry a particular woman when he determines that she is the highest representation of his relative position in the collective reproductive dominance hierarchy that is likely to be available to him in at least the medium term, with one possible variable being the man‚Äôs ability to sacrifice the present in the interest of a potentially better future, or his relative inability to do so, which would lead to him settling for a potentially less ideal future in the interest a more satisfying present.  
&amp;nbsp;

So the man should feel like he is as close to the top of the hierarchy as possible. This results in increased serotonin and dopamine, among other positive mood neurotransmitters.  
&amp;nbsp;

When his wife commits adultery; especially when it‚Äôs unforeseen, he is thrown into chaos and no longer knows what is real with regard to many essential beliefs about his position in reality.   
&amp;nbsp;

This is likely common to both men and women.  

&amp;nbsp;
For a man, however, his self worth is evolutionarily tied to his position in the dominance hierarchy with regard to procreation in a symbolic ‚Äúbattle‚Äù he is engaged in with other men.   

&amp;nbsp;
I‚Äôm not sure what the difference is for women, but I know that is true for men firsthand.  

&amp;nbsp;
So he has lost the battle, but his last maneuver or move in that battle likely took place immediately before wedding vows were exchanged. The length of time between those vows and the discovery of infidelity may be an important factor in determining the shock of the revelation.  

&amp;nbsp;
Either way, he is ‚Äúsucker punched‚Äù after the final bell has rung.  

&amp;nbsp;
This violation of the rules of the game is perhaps why he focuses his rage at the other man more than his wife in many cases.   
&amp;nbsp;

The other man didn‚Äôt fight fair, and his wife is engaged in a hierarchy he‚Äôs not a part of.  
&amp;nbsp;

However, there is some degree of perverse awe of the other man for his ability to infiltrate the game and win a round, even unfairly.  
&amp;nbsp;

That reality can have different effects on the male brain.   
&amp;nbsp;

One is the physiological tendency for a defeated male (of almost any species) to retreat, retire and surrender. Not without resentment and rage, but without a belief in his ability to retaliate or reestablish his position. This is the toxic progression of depression and anxiety, which seems to actually affect brain matter and neural pathways in a permanent way. This can be seen in many corners of the animal kingdom.  
&amp;nbsp;

The other option would be aggression and expressed rage. This seems to ultimately be the most healthy response, but also the least likely to occur for many psychological and cultural reasons. However, I believe it is the secret wish of all men in this position.  
&amp;nbsp;

So what is the way forward for men who are cheated on by their wives? Obviously physical or other abuse or retaliation is rife with many pitfalls and penalties. Perhaps in earlier human history it would have been seen as more prudent, as it seems to be in more traditional societies (I may be acting out of Neo-Victorian blindness on that point.).  
&amp;nbsp;

To climb up a dominance hierarchy, one needs neutral proof of his ascendancy (or lack thereof) along the way. He can generate a fair amount of opportunity for that proof by taking responsibility (which runs counter to first instincts) for himself first, and then his marriage and family and the world around him. By acting in alignment with truth and preparation (which unchecked by self care and upward progression toward goals can breed anxiety) he gives himself the best chances for understanding reality to the highest degree and reaping the most positive results possible.  

&amp;nbsp;
With specific regard to his position in the reproductive hierarchy, however, there are many mines buried in his path. A less civilized man might seek the comfort of other women to derive a sense of his desirability and chances for regaining his position, however that, presumably, does not preserve or strengthen his marriage.  
&amp;nbsp;

How does a man both preserve and strengthen his marriage and reestablish his position?  
&amp;nbsp;

Sacrifice seems to be tied to positive future outcomes if done in truth. But can a man sacrifice knowing where he stands in relation to other men (especially the ‚Äúother man‚Äù) and still progress up the hierarchy?  

&amp;nbsp;
If he cannot, can he sacrifice preserving his marriage in order to find out where he stands? Is there any way to do that without divorce or his own acts of infidelity?  

&amp;nbsp;
It seems he cannot trust his wife to be the symbol of his position any longer, so who or what can?

This guy presents some genuinely well thought out argunents against JBP. All the Peterson haters are jumping on it. It would be good for him to be able to see this so that they could be addressed.**tl;dr Those who hate wisdom, love death.**

8 Does not wisdom call out?
    Does not understanding raise her voice?
2 
At the highest point along the way,
    where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
3 
beside the gate leading into the city,
    at the entrance, she cries aloud:
4 
‚ÄúTo you, O people, I call out;
    I raise my voice to all mankind.
5 
You who are simple, gain prudence;
    you who are foolish, set your hearts on it.[a]
6 
Listen, for I have trustworthy things to say;
    I open my lips to speak what is right.
7 
My mouth speaks what is true,
    for my lips detest wickedness.
8 
All the words of my mouth are just;
    none of them is crooked or perverse.
9 
To the discerning all of them are right;
    they are upright to those who have found knowledge.
10 
Choose my instruction instead of silver,
    knowledge rather than choice gold,
11 
for wisdom is more precious than rubies,
    and nothing you desire can compare with her.

12 
‚ÄúI, wisdom, dwell together with prudence;
    I possess knowledge and discretion.
13 
To fear the Lord is to hate evil;
    I hate pride and arrogance,
    evil behavior and perverse speech.
14 
Counsel and sound judgment are mine;
    I have insight, I have power.
15 
By me kings reign
    and rulers issue decrees that are just;
16 
by me princes govern,
    and nobles‚Äîall who rule on earth.[b]
17 
I love those who love me,
    and those who seek me find me.
18 
With me are riches and honor,
    enduring wealth and prosperity.
19 
My fruit is better than fine gold;
    what I yield surpasses choice silver.
20 
I walk in the way of righteousness,
    along the paths of justice,
21 
bestowing a rich inheritance on those who love me
    and making their treasuries full.

22 
‚ÄúThe Lord brought me forth as the first of his works,[c][d]
    before his deeds of old;
23 
I was formed long ages ago,
    at the very beginning, when the world came to be.
24 
When there were no watery depths, I was given birth,
    when there were no springs overflowing with water;
25 
before the mountains were settled in place,
    before the hills, I was given birth,
26 
before he made the world or its fields
    or any of the dust of the earth.
27 
I was there when he set the heavens in place,
    when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,
28 
when he established the clouds above
    and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,
29 
when he gave the sea its boundary
    so the waters would not overstep his command,
and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.
30 
    Then I was constantly[e] at his side.
I was filled with delight day after day,
    rejoicing always in his presence,
31 
rejoicing in his whole world
    and delighting in mankind.

32 
‚ÄúNow then, my children, listen to me;
    blessed are those who keep my ways.
33 
Listen to my instruction and be wise;
    do not disregard it.
34 
Blessed are those who listen to me,
    watching daily at my doors,
    waiting at my doorway.
35 
For those who find me find life
    and receive favor from the Lord.
36 
But those who fail to find me harm themselves;
    all who hate me love death.‚ÄùHi Everyone,

I am making this post on this subreddit because I don't think there is a better place to share this than on a board dedicated to sharing knowledge that helps improve the lives of people. This board is also a product of the influence of Dr. Peterson, who is a psychologist, and since my issue is a psychological one, I think I am in the right place. I also have the feeling that there would be more psychologists and psychologists in the making on this sub that on majority of the subs on this website. The reason I'm making this post is because I need advice as well as informed insights on my condition.

I am a heterosexual male, I'm 23 years old, and just like the topic indicates, I am an extreme sexual sadist. I qualified my variant of sexual sadism as extreme because it is extreme. In fact, from what I've read, it's the most extreme form of sexual sadism - Erotophonophilia. Erotophonophilia is term used to refer to a form of sexual deviance or paraphilia, where a person derives pleasure from watching another person die. My sexual deviance doesn't end there. I'm also a necrophile. So besides deriving pleasure from watching someone die, I also get aroused when I see a dead person, but not just any dead person, it has to be a dead female, by dint of my heterosexuality, and this also applies to my erotophonophilia. So to put it simply, I am a guy who gets turned on when he witnesses a woman's death and also when he sees a dead woman. 

What I described in the above paragraph is just me scratching the surface of my sexuality. The true nature of my sexuality goes a lot deeper than what I described. Right from when I was a child I always liked seeing women die. As I grew older and approached puberty, the enjoyment I derived when I watched women die in movies, cos this was the only avenue by which I experienced such, metamorphosed into a sexual attraction. I'd also add that during this prepubescent stage in my development, I always imagined the death of females that I knew, the likes of my relatives and classmates. It excited me to imagine them die because for some mysterious reason, I enjoyed the idea of them dying, especially by the hands of someone else. Then after imagining their death, I imagined playing with their corpse, particularly fondling and posing it. Looking back at myself at that stage of my life, it's a bit surprising how I was able to not feel bad about my thoughts, because I was actually imagining the death of people that I liked, and I wasn't bothered at all by it.

When I hit puberty, a lot changed. I began to realize that I always had a strong erection whenever I witnessed women die in movies or when I read about it in a book. This sort of freaked me out because I was certain no one that I knew or anyone for that matter, was aroused by the kind of thing I was aroused by. I also realized that I achieved the same level of arousal when I thought about the death of a female. But I wasn't just thinking about the death of a female, I was imagining myself killing her. And I enjoyed the thought. I still do.

My first sexual experience occurred when I was watching a movie alone in my room. I was 15. It got to a scene where a pretty lady was strangled to death by her husband. I could see the horror filled expression on her dead face and the empty stare in her eyes, and as I beheld that image on the TV screen, I immediately felt this intense gratifying sensation spread through my body and focus itself around my thighs, and almost instantly, I ejaculated. This marked the beginning of my addiction to violent/sadistic material.

I soon realized that I didn't have an affinity for normal sex. Porn, as was distributed online, never interested me. I just didn't understand why people found it arousing. Even nudity wasn't particularly arousing. I'd admit that I always found the cleavage of a woman attractive, but never the full unclad breasts in display, especially when it was displayed alongside her unclad body. I could tell that a woman was attractive, by her physiognomy and her body structure, and the more physically attractive a woman was, the more likely I was to want to see her dead. But the beauty of a woman wasn't what actually aroused me. What aroused me was the possibility of beholding the death of that beautiful woman, preferably by my hands, and the enticing prospect of having her gorgeous dead body all to myself. 
Sex was never in the book as far as I was concerned. Unlike most necrophiles, my goal was never to have sex with the dead bodies of these women. I occasionally entertained the thought, mainly because everyone around me was hyping sex, but I never felt like the desire for sex was programmed into the machine of my sexuality. I still don't.

I am quite a good looking chap, and over the years I have noticed that women tend to find me attractive. But despite this, I didn't enter into a relationship until I was 20. I just didn't see the point. I had female friends but none of them were very close. It's not that I wasn't sexually attracted to any girl, but it was that the fact that I was sexually attracted to a girl, meant that I wanted to kill her, and since I couldn't, given how difficult it is to carry out a murder successfully, I just didn't approach any of the women I found attractive.

My first sexual encounter with a female was when I was 20. I met this really interesting girl who had the kind of face and body that I found exquisitely attractive. Few days later we were alone in her room and we started kissing. For some reason, I enjoy kissing and foreplay, but I always prefer to assume the dominant role. So we kissed and exchanged passionate touches, took off each others clothes and next thing she was on top of me, riding my partially erect penis. The longer my penis was in her, the less erect it got and after few seconds, it went completely flaccid. It just couldn't get up. I tried to sit her in a doggy position and penetrate her from behind, but my penis didn't get erect. I embarrassingly put my underwear on as she stood up and went into the bathroom. To be sure something wasn't wrong with me, I immediately tried to imagine killing her as she emerged from the bathroom, and unsurprisingly, I had an erection. So the lesson I derived from this experience was that the only way by which I could obtain gratification was through erotophonophilic or necrophilic avenues. 

Currently, I still have my desires. I'd even argue that they are more intense than ever. But along the years I've learned to master them. I feel the urge to kill every attractive woman I see, but I have the wisdom to not act on those impulses. This might seem like a scandalous thing to say, but I don't really care about anyone to the point of refusing to harm them just because they are human beings with feelings and emotions. I've noticed that my level of empathy, for some reason, has been decreasing in proportionality to my increase in age, and it's gotten to the point where I'd say it's almost nonexistent. But I've spent a great deal of time evaluating the possible consequences of taking the life of another human. I've concluded that the temporary gratification I'd derive from killing an innocent girl is not worth the short and long term consequences. 

So this is the story of my deviant condition and I need some advice from you guys. I also need some psychological insights about my condition, especially in the area of possible curative measures. This doesn't mean that I am actually interested in being cured. In one of Dr. Peterson's Maps Of Meaning lectures he mentions that Antisocial personality disorder cannot be cured through therapy. And I find that interesting because I've always been of the same opinion, given that I express certain traits that are associated with the disorder and I just laugh when I hear people suggest therapy as a curative medication for ASPD. So this made me wonder if my condition can be cured through therapy.

Dr. Peterson has said that a person is only truly moral when they are consciously aware of their capacity for evil and have developed the self control to restrain from acting out this evil. And this profound statement made me think: Does my refusal to kill in order to satisfy my desires make me moral? Or am I only moral when the motivation for restraining from committing evil is internally mediated and not externally mediated?

I would really appreciate your responses.

What do you people think about possibility of this red wing collectivist philosopher debating Jordan Peterson. Wouldn't it be some next leve thing? Dugin is maybe little crazy, but also very intelligent and sophisticated. To see a conversation of two totally different positions would be quite enriching. If you never heard about him, he lays quite profound philosophical layer for right wing collectivism, and against individualism but from very traditional viewpoint. But what is interesting is that he literally hates liberalism (for some good reasons) and his from super different background than most of Jordan counterparts, he is also deeply religious but in quite interesting postmodern way. Dugin considers himself traditionalist, you may know him as "Putin Rasputin", he was debating for example Francis Fukuyama. I know that he is know mostly from political world but every thing he says about politics has roots in deep philosophy. I wonder if this two speak to each other what would come out of it. It would be good or bad idea? Any thoughts? (Sorry for my bad english)I was hoping this sub could help me understand what they find compelling about Peterson's infamous argumentum-ad-Homaridae. First I'll briefly outline my understanding of Peterson's argument and then I'll provide a few quick points as to why I'm not convinced.  

Peterson's argument as I understand it:  

1. Lobsters and humans share a common evolutionary ancestor  
2. There are observable similarities between the nervous system of a lobster and that of a human, like the presence of the neurotransmitter serotonin  
3. Lobsters exhibit dominance hierarchies  
4. Hence, dominance hierarchies in humans are part of our physiological evolutionary nature, and not socially constructed  

-  

I mean there's so much going on here it's hard to know where to start but the most obvious place is that the conclusion simply doesn't follow from the premises. What bearing does a hierarchy appearing in an animal we have an evolutionary link to have on the question of whether human hierarchies are "natural" as opposed to "socially constructed" behaviour?   
It seems that Peterson has essentially constructed an Ad Hoc theory, working backwards from the original position of wanting to find an evolutionary justification for dominance hierarchies and cherry picking facts with this in mind. For instance, if Peterson was being intellectually consistent, I contend that he would also have to conclude that other social interactions of lobsters are just as important to our understanding of "natural" human behaviour as their hierarchies are - for instance, the fact that they cannibalise each other in confinement, or that they mate with several short-term monogamous sexual partners over the course of their lifetimes. Of course, he does not draw attention to these points, in the former case because we know that humans do not literally eat each other when shut in a room together (unless they are starving), and in the latter case because such a conclusion would be inconsistent with Peterson's own insistence that you get married, and thus have only one monogamous sexual relationship for life. In other words, Peterson ignores *logical* conclusions that can be drawn from his premises either because they are easily falsifiable or because they are personally unpalatable to him. Doesn't seem much like an objective truth-seeker to me.  

There is also the point that the neurotransmitter serotonin is practically ubiquitous, and can be found in the nervous systems of organisms that are not known to exhibit dominance hierarchies, including microscopic organisms much higher up the evolutionary tree than lobsters. Why does Peterson not even consider these cases? I repeat; it is because his theory is ad hoc - it explains what it is designed to explain.  

I am open to having my mind changed. If I have misunderstood Peterson's premises - and I feel I must have, otherwise his argument would surely not seem so self-evidently absurd - then please do explain to me exactly how.JBP said in his own words clear as can be:

Criticism, Digging, Disagreement, Debate, Discussion **IS ENCOURAGED BY DR. PETERSON.**

This subreddit should NOT downvote dissenting opinions. Rather you should UPVOTE them.

That is the **"only way to discover what is true"** to paraphrase Jordan Peterson.

What is currently happening in this sub is antithetical to Jordan Peterson's teachings. 

Please people. Lets make this sub a reflection of JBP's classically liberal beliefs. Jordan talks a lot about the different traits that people have that might cause them to be more inclined to be left and right wing people. Orderliness = right wing, inefficiency (he used a different word) = left wing. 

However, when I look at the US the left and right wing camps seem to be broken up more by geography, age, identity group etc. If biology had any significant effect I would expect a more even distribution.

Is anyone able to shed some light on this?I bought 12 Rules on a whim based on all the publicity surrounding Jordan Peterson. It's the first book of it's kind that I've ever read.

Nearing the end now and it's been highly enjoyable. What I appreciate most is the unpretentiousness in which it is written. Does anyone have any recommendations for similar "entry-level" books on the subjects discussed within?

ThanksHello, ideologues and heroes alike!
While I'd like this to be brief, I may go off on a tangent here so please bare with me.

Over the past little while I've observed the birth and propagation of the Cathy Newman quote we've all come to know and love; while this has been quite entertaining to watch (and re-watch) in its original format, I've (and I'm sure others have) become acutely aware of the manner in which frequents to this subreddit have grown to use it in the short time since.

What I've noticed, from my own humble (and often incorrect) standpoint, is this phrase being used to halt all attempted paraphrasing (often of their own opinions) in the comment section of many threads; while this slogan has a time and a place (where it may be used effectively), I'd just like to remind you all that not only does it have an atmosphere of ad hominem rhetoric to it but it can also rub off as lazy if not used carefully.

What I'd like to see (without anyone thinking I'm trying to sensor their manner of speech or compel them to use an alternate phrase) is for people to become a little more aware of the context in which they use their mottoes and nomenclature in the future [Rule #10], because many of you come off appearing as though you have nothing substantial to contribute to the conversation as a result (which is of course often not true [Rule #9]).

TLDR; Be careful with your memes, buckos, and be honest in your speech. Thanks!I'm surprised this hasn't been discussed in more depth by Peterson in any of his talks and even more surprised that, at least in the interviews I've watched, he is never directly asked about meditation and his views on it.

From listening to Peterson I have gathered that he believes there are two fundamental truths that underpin the human experience: that life is suffering and that there is malevolence in the world. He also emphasizes how significant it is to find meaning in the face of these truths. Now the four 'noble truths' in Buddhism, which really form the foundation from which the rest of the philosophy flows, all relate to the truth of suffering. Desire is looked at as the primary cause of suffering and meditation practice forms the cornerstone of the path away from suffering. In meditation we're able to recognize how ceaseless desire ultimately leads to more suffering and how this cycle continually repeats. This is, in a nutshell, the key teaching of Buddhism.

It seems to me that because Peterson and 'the Buddhists' are starting at the same basic premise that you would expect to hear him talk a little bit more about the practice of meditation and it's possible benefits. Not to mention the science behind meditation and how it's been shown to positively change the structure of the brain.

Is there a reason that you can see that Peterson does not discuss meditation or have I missed an interview/lecture where he does go into more detail regarding his views of the practice? I remember seeing a short video where he kind of dismisses mindfulness as a fad in response to a viewer question but he doesn't go into much detail. Also, although it may be a fad in the west this really says nothing about what he might think about the actual value of the practice.It seems Peterson (as of late last year) has finally gone and done it - he's used the term "Cultural Marxist" (albeit parroting the thoughts of a viewer):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jef2C4T1_A

So this is just a reminder that The Frankfurt School "Cultural Marxists" in fact [critiqued Identity Politics](https://konspektikaust.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/nancy-fraser-rethinking-recognition/) (Nancy Fraser), [critiqued Post Modernism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/#9) (Jurgen Habermas), and [critiqued Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry) (Theodor Adorno).

...yet every right-leaning youtube "documentary" on "Cultural Marxism" cites The Frankfurt School as being the masterminds behind these things. When in fact they disagreed with them (as the links above will attest).

Please if you're going to critique Identity Politics do it head-on, by name. It will make things a lot easier.

P.S For those interested I've summarized Habermas' critique of Post-Modernism [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7jrlgu/the_j√ºrgen_habermas_frankfurt_school_critique_of/) and I'm considering doing a similar post on Nancy Fraser's critique of Identity Politics.I've noticed that JBP uses this phrase a lot in Maps of Meaning and while speaking quite frequently. I've never heard this phrase used before. It's *somewhat* but not wholly self explanatory. It seems as though he's implying that some force will eventually (or inevitably) construct a complete understanding, or analysis, of the entirety of existence to analyze it. Does this underly some bold claim that I've missed or is it just an expression to aid a hypothesis?https://youtu.be/HQtUGMXqoD4?t=1143

Let's have some fun ! Answer this and see what are your scores Hey folks

Lots of people called me a hypocrite for the fact that I support Trump , The wall and even the travel ban while being a refugee myself . But what the hell ? Trump shouldn't be a benefit to me for me to support him , All he needs to do is protect America and make it great again , That's what I told those people , But then I got called "A dummy who can't exploit for his benefit"

Looks like standing up for something and having principles don't mean much in the age of moral decay ...

Here's my short story :

I was born technically a Muslim , My family loved Christ and practiced Christianity in secret due to fears from the government , I was a confused teenager , Visited a church for answers , Later I got arrested , questioned , insulted , beaten and tortured for the simple fact of visiting a church

Years later I got expelled from my university due to my political and religious views , From Christ to Trump , From corruption in my government to blasphemy against "Prophet" Mohammed just by criticizing what he did and stood for

Now here I am , living as an Asylum Seeker in Turkey , UNHCR already denied my asylum claim , I'm guessing because I criticized Islam a lot and called it and its prophet what it really is

"A toxic political supremacist ideology"

I am in a state of limbo , Stuck in an Islamic country extremely hostile towards Christians ,I might get arrested again for supporting Trump in Turkey , And NO I can't shut up , because one thing I learned from Jordan Peterson was , "Speak your mind" if you want peace of mind "Tell the truth" he said

So that's what I'm gonna do , But that might cost me my freedom

So I'm asking for your help and insight , All I need is to get out of here , Settle somewhere I can speak my mind without the fear of persecution

I am not looking for a single dime of welfare , I will work from day 1 , I am a capable programmer , web designer , graphics designer and game developer so I will pull my own weight and then some !


I just might be the thing Trump said U.S. needs , Refugees who could be of benefit to American society

I don't know what to do , UNHCR is extremely corrupt just like its mother organization the United Nations , It's filled with Christian hating Muslims giving out all the resettlements to Muslims and leaving Christians to rot in third world Islamic nations

What should I do to have a chance at resettlement ?

Should I email senators ? Should I email the White House ?

As you can guess , I'm pretty much hopeless , Hence coming crying on Reddit to get help

PS : The remnants of the torture I endured are still on my back I'm sick and tired of being a victim and playing the victim card , I just need to get back on my feet and get out of this victimhood mentality , Hopefully with your help :)

PS#2 : Jordan's work is the thing kept me alive in Turkey and prevented me from going insane during this madness 

PS#3 : I submitted this thread originally on /r/The_Donald Hi everyone I'm Spencer. Just wanted to introduce myself, and say what a great subreddit I think this is. Just started reading 12 Rules, finding it to be more than I hoped for. 

I'm a single father, and life is good. Only getting better from here. 

A good combination of reasonably high social class and good IQ thru selective breeding is the recipe for success.

In the old days, self-made people of higher IQ were sometimes mated to 'throwaway' members of the upper class, like Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd (who had lots of psychological problems). And, lo and behold, Lincoln's line died out 100 years later. For whatever reason, his descendants failed to reproduce.

Class does not die easily. The saying of 'shirtsleeve to shirtsleeve in 3 generations' does not come from a vacuum.

What happens is people not from the correct class marrying into the upper class might reproduce, but their progeny are shunned by higher classes, and even if they do marry the correct class, there are unlikely to be offspring because the mate , in their subconscious, do not consider such people as their equal. So the line dies out within 2 or 3 gen.

But, if they mate with higher-iq but lower class people, they are shunned even more. They become some caste of their own, and like Trump and Kushner, become rich but not that influential. Trump becoming a President does not admit him into the Upper Class - we will see what happens to his progeny in 100 years. They might be rich but they would not be running anything other than their own turf.

A bad combination is higher-IQ people in lower classes. They know they can never equal the higher class, and are there as a tool. So they tend to be angry and rebellious. And, since they would not  be able to improve their bloodlines too much because of the reasons I described above, their bloodlines will be diluted by lower class genes and regress to the mean, leading to 'shirtsleeves in 3 gen'.

Social register, the yacht club, things like that will survive the Singularity.

Although IQ is important in today's world, in the end social class and the Establishment do have the final laugh, as the  genes of the lower-class but higher-IQ people die out because the upper class would not reproduce with them, or because they would have to reproduce with inferior people who will eventually regress them to the mean.The exchange at the end of the interview is pretty amazing. Here it is from 24:35:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54&amp;t=24m35s
I've recently found this sub after Jordan Peterson's Channel 4 debate with Cathy Newman. I‚Äôve been watching his lectures and he brings up a number of truths that I‚Äôve been too afraid to address. Namely personality, IQ &amp; life outcome. I‚Äôm sure this has touched a nerve with many here, as there are direct links to IQ tests in the side bar. 

I‚Äôll preface what I‚Äôm about to say with some background info on myself. I‚Äôm not successful. I‚Äôm not smart, the opposite in fact. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever read a whole book in my life. I have reading difficulties, it takes me 20 minutes to finish a page. I dropped out of school at 15 because I wasn‚Äôt smart enough to pass the 10th grade. And at almost 25, I work in a low effort, repetitive job with no future prospects and no high-level skills. I‚Äôve done many stupid things and I will continue to do more stupid things. 

I say this because, in an effort to understand myself, I‚Äôve been doing a number of IQ tests. The result of which has shocked me. While these are only 20-45 minute tests, from what I‚Äôve read they are at least able to give a ballpark figure. I scored 143 on the [Mensa Norway test](http://test.mensa.no/) and 161 on [This test]( https://www.uv.es/~buso/iq/index_en.html) based off the [Mensa Newzealand IQ test](http://nzlweb.com/index.php). However, I‚Äôve read that these tests are only good up to 145, so I think this one can be reliably thrown out. That being said, I only score similarly on tests that are based on pattern recognition. The tests involving patterns are much easier for me. On tests involving math I score around 118-124. I‚Äôve never liked math -- I stopped paying attention to it in grade 8.  

According to Peterson, IQ and life outcome correlate somewhere around .53 (I‚Äôve just learned what that means). Conscientiousness, is also a high predictor, which amazingly I‚Äôm in the 85th percentile of. While i can accept this, I‚Äôm sure there are some other marginal factors that, under the right conditions, can be more pervasive. Like neuroticism, although apparently, I‚Äôm only slightly above average. 

So with that said, I can‚Äôt take the results of these tests at face value. There is no way I‚Äôm in the 99.8-99.9th percentile.  I am average, at best, in everything I do *and* what I do is not hard. I don‚Äôt think these tests are at all representative of my cognitive abilities. If Peterson is correct on the inheritability of IQ (which I trust he is), then there‚Äôs even more cause for concern. My lower-class blue-collar family members are not that smart, and we all admit this (Albeit with some humor). We're janitors, gardeners and military people. 

I recently read an interview on VOX with Stuart Ritchie, an intelligence researcher who refuses to learn his IQ, even after being tested. This is something I sympathize with, especially after taking these tests. While in Stuart‚Äôs case he may have been more concerned in regards to his limits, if these test results are anything to go by; they‚Äôd make me even more ashamed of my failures. Thankfully, I don‚Äôt think my test results are anything to go by.

I‚Äôd like to hear if people of this subreddit share my concerns for the accuracy of these tests. Or if not, why?Which artists--from painters to musicians and authors--are carrying on the Western tradition? 

I've been wondering who our generation's Tolkien or Lewis may be, and I've gotta say, I don't think we've produced one. Hollywood, the most prominent of our age's art forms, is more focused on recycling old ideas than producing anything new. *50 Shades of Gray* isn't getting an opera any time soon. Nor do I think "modern art" is going to be gifted to future generations; the best thing I can say about it is that it's vapid. At least that way, it isn't *necessarily* bad. Part of me thinks that video games will assume the role these previous mediums played. A more pessimistic part of me thinks that art is terminally ill, but what do you guys think? 

I was going to begin a project where I write subtitles for every lecture in Maps of Meaning and Personality and Its Transformations and I was wondering if anyone else would like to do this with me. I know there are lots of started people out there that would love to do this since they are high in orderliness and conscientiousness.

I think it will benefit everybody and make a huge impact if we can do this since these subtitles can be afterward translated in other languages ( I would love my parents to listen to this but they are not English speakers )

What do you people say?He's mentioned it before and I'm wondering if it's in the works.Hi everyone,

I'm listening to the latest H3H3 podcast and I heard dr. Peterson talk about his collection of Soviet relics (if memory serves me well, I think he said something with '400 pieces', but I fell asleep last night by then).

I also remember him talking about it in one of his vlogs or maybe a Patreon Q&amp;A, but that was a little while ago. I'd love to see the works he's got!

I've been reading *The Gulag Archipelago*, and though I severely dislike communism, I love the artwork they made and many well-made pieces are frequently posted in /r/PropagandaPosters.

I don't know how to contact dr. Peterson, I don't have Twitter, but I'm fairly certain he visits this subreddit, or the meme sub once in a while, because I've seen him post a couple of memes that I think originated from Reddit.

Cheers!

P.S. Perhaps post flairs would be a nice addition to the sub. What do you lot think?In the title I reference [this](https://youtu.be/v1E0xsiYMr0) video, you could watch it and realis the channel has 3.1 million subscribers alltough it's much less watched than expected, this video still garners more than a 100K views. Another example of his thought can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo2HnIlgpaQ)

Both Peterson and de Botton have quite the large following, peterson you're all familiar with here, and a lot of you probably as well with botton, through the pretty well established [school of life](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog). Both, however, have very different ways of dealing with interpersonal relationships. 

Because of this, I think a discussion between both of them could have a lot of merit, but I'm unsure how such a discussion could be orchestrated. Any tips/suggestions on how to make this happen?I had the pleasure of attending Dr. Peterson‚Äôs sold out show at the Orpheum Theatre in LA. I had no idea there was a sub for him till now. 

I was sitting there just taking in every word he said, and throughout the whole speech/lecture my brain was having mini explosions due to revelations about the world. I loved that feeling. I forgot what that feels like because i have a tendency to think i already know everything. But when he talks it‚Äôs like i can literally feel my brain expanding with more curiosity and wisdom. 

I am not a very good reader. I have his 12 Rules but I am going through it very slowly. I love how it also makes me have mini brain explosions too. I know he has mentioned Jung, Nietzche, Freud etc as inspirations. I know these guys are geniuses but is there a consensus to the first book to read from these guys or similar alike? I crave that feeling now of realizing i don‚Äôt know anything about the world. 

..so what you‚Äôre saying is .. i need book recommendations. Hello, I‚Äôve been working unrelenting to undo a lot of the trauma from my upbringing over the past ten years or so. I‚Äôve excavated a lot of internal toxicity and been severely depressed on/off over the last decade. Though I do see the light at the end of the tunnel and I feel significantly more stable, though I stil relapse some times. 

I just bought the Self Authoring Suite a couple days ago and maybe that will answer my question. At what point will I feel like I‚Äôve sorted myself out? 

I know that‚Äôs a highly subjective question, but as it stands right now I‚Äôm kind of avoiding dating/relationships until I feel stable and whole. I‚Äôve also found no matter how many monsters I slay or mountains I climb it still never feels like it‚Äôs enough. Thanks for reading!You're biting off more than you can chew.

‚ÄúIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.‚Äù

Who among you can really claim to know yourself, let alone know the Jews?From a 1937 letter by Orwell:

&gt;After what I have seen in Spain I have come to the conclusion that it is futile to be "anti-Fascist" while attempting to preserve capitalism. Fascism after all is only a development of capitalism, and the mildest democracy, so-called, is liable to turn into Fascism when the pinch comes. We like to think of England as a democratic country, but our rule in India, for instance, is just as bad as German Fascism, though outwardly it may be less irritating. I do not see how one can oppose Fascism except by working for the overthrow of capitalism, starting, of course, in one's own country.

From his 1946 essay [*Why I Write*](http://orwell.ru/library/essays/wiw/english/e_wiw):

&gt;Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, *against* totalitarianism and *for* democratic socialism, as I understand it.

From his 1947 essay [*Toward European Unity*](http://orwell.ru/library/articles/European_Unity/english/e_teu) (emphasis mine):

&gt;**In the U.S.S.R. there prevails a sort of oligarchical collectivism which could only develop into democratic Socialism against the will of the ruling minority.** Into Asia even the word ‚ÄòSocialism‚Äô has barely penetrated. The Asiatic nationalist movements are either Fascist in character, or look towards Moscow, or manage to combine both attitudes: and at present all movements among the coloured peoples are tinged by racial mysticism. In most of South America the position is essentially similar, so is it in Africa and the Middle East. **Socialism does not exist anywhere**, but even as an idea it is at present valid only in Europe. Of course, Socialism cannot properly be said to be established until it is world-wide, but the process must begin somewhere, and I cannot imagine it beginning except through the federation of the western European states, transformed into Socialist republics without colonial dependencies. **Therefore a Socialist United States of Europe seems to me the only worth-while political objective today.**

He even says the Soviet Union isn't socialist!

So, Orwell is clearly a socialist. Why, then, does Peterson ‚Äì a self-proclaimed classical liberal ‚Äì like him so much?

To me it seems that there are three possibilities:

1. Peterson is ignorant of Orwell's political views.
2. Peterson is aware of Orwell's political views, but is choosing to ignore them, and to interpret his writings ‚Äì the ones where his support for socialism is less explicit, such as *Nineteen Eighty-Four* ‚Äì in a way different from the way Orwell intended. This seems unlikely, however ‚Äì isn't Peterson arguing *against* the "postmodernist" idea that any text can be interpreted in any way you like?
3. Peterson is aware of and accepts Orwell's political views and the intended interpretations of his writings, but is choosing to ignore them so as to mislead his audience.

What your thoughts on this?

EDIT: One quote that I forgot to include is: *["the only regime which, in the long run, will dare to permit freedom of speech is a Socialist regime"](https://www.marxists.org/archive/orwell/1938/why-ilp.htm)*.I recently turned 25, male, and was pondering over my life so far. I feel like not having grown as a person much since 15. Let me elaborate.

My scores: low Extraversion, low conciostness, low agreeableness, high openness, very high neuroticism.

Recently, I have experienced some health crisis, and a repeat of pursuing symptoms just like at age 15 happened. Went to hospitals multiple times, had all kinds of tests, doctors started telling me that it is not diabetes, not thyroid issue, not some rare syndrome I read about and it is probably anxiety, depression and I am in need of therapy for at least couple of years. I recently went to a psychiatrist and she happened to be the same I met 5 years ago, when in a crisis of choosing a field to study. She basically said that my situation is quite severe and would suggest intensive therapy sessions and keeping a strict regime: lots of what JP preaches.

The only good thing I have is a job, that is interesting but despite that, I just never cared about any job position I ever had. After having fallen ill in December, I was away for two weeks, then came back and negotiated to continue working and go to doctor's appointments. They even let me to fly to a different country and work from there while attending medical needs. However, I feel like my team lead and manager, while preaching to be understanding, might have already decided to fire me in one month when probation ends, and it really stresses me out. I would lose health insurance, therapy sessions and source of income. I work in a country where I have no friends and my family is 3000 km away.

I know this was long but it seems to me that I might be mentally ill, and being already 25, I still do not have a girlfriend, friends, my career is creeking at the seams and am feeling a useless human. I was told by psychologist that such type of people are perfectionist, have sensitive nervous systems and need strict routine and take care of themselves. I tend to let myself go in crisis, my perfectionsism is questionable because of being lazy and I just feel like 60 years old at 25.

I work really hard those days to produce a project and will book meetings with manager to discuss my performance and if it can be changed in a month before decisions are made. I don't even clean my room, and was disgusted of a mess it was. I did not clean it for two months. It is clean now but it is not making me feel better. I listened to lots of JP but don't act on it.it sounds really feminine to me. i think you guys need to quit looking at porn and lift some weights. I have seen a few of his videos regarding religion and the bible and i was wondering if he has ever tackled this topic.

[Scan](http://oi63.tinypic.com/5nlwde.jpg)I've heard Peterson say it, but I can't remember where - I would like to find that reference again. It must've been from one of his Lectures.

The context is that one of the tragedies of human nature is the opposite effect of time on male and female sexual appeal.Jordan Peterson talks about the impact of wasting time so I was wondering, what are the most easiest ways in which people waste time and how would you fix it?Big 5 assessment https://imgur.com/gallery/j7ab4Bit of an odd post here. Less of a direct question more of a 'help me connect the dots, if there are any' if that makes sense...?

I came across a chapter opening quote in "Children of Dune" which reads: Natural selection has been described as an environment selectively screening for those who will have progeny. Where humans are concerned, though, this is an extremely limiting viewpoint. Reproduction by sex tends toward experiment and innovation. It raises many questions, including the ancient one about whether environment is a selective agent after the variation occurs, or whether environment plays a pre-selective role in determining the variations which it screens. Dune did not really answer those questions: it merely raised new questions which Leto and the Sisterhood may attempt to answer over the next five hundred generations.
        -The Dune Catastrophe
          After Harq al-Ada

My thoughts went to Dr. Petersons descriptions of women being prominent in the selection process and his description of the selection process in general. My brain wants to relate the two somehow but I'm not even sure I understand the significance of the above quote let alone Peterson's explanations about the female's role in the process. I decided to outsource it. Does anyone else see some parallels or implications here? Or is my mind grasping at straws trying to unify two of my favorite things?

Also, this was written a while ago and Frank Herbert, while knowledgeable, is a fiction writer at the end of the day. How accurate are the musings of this fictional character in regards to how we actually understand natural selection today?...for setting yet another unrealistic expectation for men, almost as unrealistic as He-man. Only, a different kind of a muscle is meant to be worked out!

As a listener of the opposite gender, I have sooo much trouble going through dating now!! xD I absolutely can't connect with guys on the same level. Need to hold back most of the things I would want to say, to not come out as pretentious. 

it's so funny, I learned so much. Thanks to him I am much more conscious now, seeing things to which I would probably be oblivious about before. It helps me a lot at work, and in daily communications.

Yeah yeah the title is a joke. So far, I can't think of anything negative to say about the guy. I tried to go through some "JBP critiques", but it's mostly very bad argumentation, that deserves only an eyeroll.


**Have you guys felt any changes to your daily life aswell already?**I am aware that most probably don't believe that, but in my past discussions here I have encountered many people who think that there's a decades long communist plot to weaken the West (using feminism and progressivism I guess) and Peterson himself has kinda implied that (well not exactly that, but he has at least said things to attract people that actually believe that)

I'm an ex-communist and very familiar with communist beliefs so I believe this should be discussed. If you believe there is actually a communist conspiracy, can you expand on your views so that we can discuss it?On one of Jordan's talks with Joe Rogan (I forget which), Jordan basically says (I'm paraphrasing) *"Take an overweight man who wants to lose weight.  You go to the gym.  Well no, you go twice then you stop.  You can't just tell yourself what to do, you have a nature!"*

That hit me like a tonne of bricks.  And honestly I'm still not 100% sure why.

I'd love to ask him more about it, but well, you know we can't do that! He's a bit too popular to reach.

So what do you guys think of this quote?  "You can't just tell yourself what to do, you have a nature."I caught JP on Joe Rogan and visited his self authoring website.  It‚Äôs intriguing, and seems like something that could help me through a difficult patch of life I‚Äôm in right now.  

But $30 is a lot of money to me right now.  Can anyone give me some feedback on your thoughts on the value of the program?  12 months ago I would drop $30 on dinner but now $30 means an awful lot to me.Wisdom has built her house;

Does Ben begin but then stop himself from saying "My wife's a doctor"We all know that JBP is a well-spoken and intelligent man (obviously). However, I'd like to know what you all think is his weakest point that he could improve on. As a big fan of dragons as mythological creatures, I get a little irked at how Peterson refers to them. Of course, I know what he means, and I can separate the cool flying-lizards on Deviantart from the epitomes of all that is evil of medieval myth.

However, I was wondering if, by some means, there was art for those who get triggered by that sort of thing? Say, a dragon safe-space? With a room full of big, scaly-beasts crying and calling Peterson a Nazi?

If this doesn't exist, I'll make it, soon. If it does, link please!Fill in the blanks see if we can get front page of reddit. So what do you do when you discover Jordan Peterson and realise that your the biggest problem in your life. You then want to make a change for the better, like start telling the truth and clean up the mess that is your house. 

But you are finding it difficult to make a change as old lazy habits repeat themselves and your loved one has no difficulty pointing out your flaws.

Compounded by the issue of having your masculinity beaten out of you as a child then you just avoid conflict because you are impotent. 

P.S I know I am bitch but I am trying to not be resentful, usless wretch. Its a hard and depressing realisation.I occasionally listen to this podcast for a good laugh but also to hear from very left wing intellectuals. They're pretty critical of JP and I think a lot of it is fair, even though both sometimes fall into the same crap that I see on blogs (he's against trans rights, he's dangerous, wants to return to the past, etc). Thoughts?I'm interested in Jung's idea of the shadow and the neccessity of integrating it. 

Are there any texts or resources I can look into to find options on how to explore the idea emotionally?It's fine to defend Peterson and engage with people who would mis-label and misconstrue him.

But primarily stay focused on his message what he is actually teaching and offering.

Falsehood and libel can be done endlessly, becomes it comes from projection and lies. It has no substance, so you can't stamp it out, and engaging with it will just divert and drain you.

Stay focused on telling the truth, not defeating lies, which don't truly exist by definition.

See ya gents. Keep cleaning your room.I ask this because I've recently scored this on a proctored IQ test. And I'm still in doubt about it. When I was in Elementary school, multiple teachers at different times tried to recommend me to the Gifted Program in my school and I failed the tests( which were usually standardized). Furthermore, when I was in middle school, I was diagnosed with ADHD. Most of my life I could not do well in school, so when I was given this result from the test, I was really surprised and want to know more about it. Thanks for your help in advance.This question was posed to me by my roommate (Todd) as I was telling him how JBP wants us to rescue our father from the belly of the beast. I think he mistakes this advice as the typical conservative cry to bring back the "olden days". Since there has been such a large history of Christianity and many sects, where should one start? Old Testament? New? 


My guess that JBP would answer liberal approach to this; that no version would necessary stand above one or another and that a pragmatic or subjective choice would suffice. 


I'm not happy with my answer, and have started JBP's ["Maps of Meaning Lecture"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tQOlQRp3gQ&amp;list=PL22J3VaeABQByVcW4lXQ46glULC-ekhOp) to help find an answer. Perhaps someone might save me through 20 hours of lecture.  
Hi all,

I've come across a fascinating book that talks about high level spiritual things from a scientific perspective. This book is intriguing as it talks about many similar things to what people in mystical states mention such as seeing into parallel dimensions and interacting with beings from other worlds etc.

This book is called Zhuan Falun and it is from the Buddha Law School of Cultivation however it is not Buddhism the religion or Daoism the religion, it's something more profound. It seems to me to be more of a spiritual science as many of the terms and concepts in the book are talked about in a scientific down to earth manner instead of flowery mystical prose which I found very refreshing.

Now here is where it gets interesting, this book talks about the following things:

‚óè Other Dimensions - Levels Of Dimensions spanning into the microcosm and also outwards into the macrocosm

‚óè The Soul - It talks about people having a Master soul and a subordinate soul which is hidden from you but is at a more advanced level then you, it states some people have more then one Subordinate soul and some are of not of the same sex as you i.e males having a female subordinate soul etc.

‚óè Microcosmic worlds - This concept was very far out but it talks about there being worlds within you, countless worlds. Similar to our world with life , water, animals etc. An analogy is zooming an an atom within one of your cells and realizing at that level of magnification it is just like our solar system. Then zooming into a single particle in that world and finding out it too is a vast world, apparently the level it can go onwards like this is beyond imagination.

‚óè Supernatural Abilities - In the book they mention that everyone has them it is just that they have atrophied. It goes into depth about this topic. Some abilities that are mentioned are precognition, retrocognition and remote vision.

‚óè The 3rd Eye - Talks about how at the front part of our pineal gland there is a complete structure of an eye there. Modern science calls it a vestigial eye but in the cultivation world they say this eye just naturally exists like that and it can be activated allowing one to pierce through this dimension and see other dimensions. It talks about how there are many levels to this 3rd eye and it goes into great depth about it.

‚óè Thoughts - This part was amazing. It talks about how a human brain is just a processing plant. How the real you is actually your soul, it's like your whole body and brain is just a vehicle and that the true commands are issued by your master soul, but this master soul is very tiny and it can switch positions while inside you and it can also expand and shrink. It can move from your brain to your heart and to other parts of your body and it is 'he' who calls the shots. Your brain is just the factory which your master soul sends his cosmic commands to which then create the forms of expression and communication we use such as speech, gestures, etc.

These are just a few things that are covered but there are many many other things which blew my mind when I read it because of how it resonated with some of the mystical experiences people sometimes have, especially the multidimensional nature of reality and how all of them are hidden in our day to day perceptions of the world.

If this sounds interesting to anyone you can grab a copy of the book here:

http://en.falundafa.org/eng/pdf/ZFL2014.pdfI had a long day. Good recreational activities that were unplanned.

Yet, I managed to com back, and do my exercises as scheduled.

I think that was a sign of good commitment. :-)

I still have to do a full GTD and find out my projects and everything; but that's the story so far.I remember Jordan mentioned it in one of the videos I've seen recently. I believe it was four or five words, and when you hear them, you can be certain you're dealing with a post-modernist / SJW. I believe the context was school.I'm really enjoying reading into Jordan Petersons clinical perspective on mental illness and how to alleviate its symptoms. I particularly liked the lobster example which gave good evidence. However as I've read his new book more it's been getting increasingly relient on a religious perspective and it's kind of ruining the book and what I thought it would be about. Are there any atheists that are reading this book and have been able to bypass this?Whenever you open a thread here on Reddit that contains 1000+ words, your knee-jerk reaction might be to close the tab and move on. I'm guilty of that myself. In this case, however, if you've been on the cusp of falling victim to this rather insidious strategy, I recommend you keep on reading.  
  
If you've been paying close attention, you've probably registered the nature of attacks on Jordan Peterson. They come in waves. First, they tried the *transphobe strategy*. It didn't work. Then, they tried the *sexist strategy*. That didn't work either. Last month's trend was the *racist strategy*.  
  
It's becoming increasingly apparent that the flavor of the month is the claim that Jordan Peterson is a cult leader. This, one has to admit, is incredibly clever, because it's supposed to function as a deep psychological assault. It sows a seed of self-doubt. Once the seed has been sown, the payload should go something like,  

**(a)** "Oh, I do suppose I like him quite a bit. Oh yeah, he is earning quite a bit of money. Yes, my life has changed since I started listening ..."  
  
**(b)** "Have I just been brainwashed? Am I just a blindly following cult member?"  
  
Credit is due where credit is due. This is rather ingenius. Nobody wants to be a part of a cult. Nobody wants to feel manipulated and deindividualized. If the seed of doubt is sown, the payload should elicit a fear response. Even if the payload does not fully succeed, it might lead a fan to, at the very least, take a large step back, in fear of the possibility that they *might be in the brainwashing process*.  
  
So, let's take a good hard look at what a cult actually is, and do some comparisons.  
  
Because there is little consensus regarding the term itself, I had to search quite a bit to find something which wasn't impossibly abstract. I found this one, which I believe to be quite accurate:  
  
*A typical cult has a charismatic, unaccountable leader, persuades by coercion and exploits its members, economically, sexually or in some other way.*  
  
**[Charismatic]** Well-spoken, highly-educated. Let's play devil's advocate and check this one off.  
  
**[Unaccountable]** Complete miss. Peterson argues for his points very openly and tells everyone who listens to hack at it if they find anything wrong. He is also very open about his own faults. 
  
**[Persuades by coercion]** No point in spending time on this one, as it simply does not apply.  
  
**[Exploit: Economically]** Peterson has never asked for money. He opened his Patreon, and people flocked to it in support. It was never solicited.  
  
**[Exploit: Sexually]** ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
  
**[Exploit: Other]** I'm trying my best, but I really can't think of anything. Can you?  
  
Now let's take a more holistic approach.  
_______
One of the key components of the *cult strategy* is the claim that Peterson's ultimate goal is to destroy social justice and progress (in the positive sense) by brainwashing his followers with pseudo-meaningful word soups. Essentially, you have been dazzled into a trance by a masterful manipulator who seeks to exploit your waking dreamstate, placing you in his vanguard against human rights and progress. To accomplish this, he subversively labels the enemy *post-modernism* to give you a target. Once again, it's quite ingenius. Who the hell wants to take any part in that, right?  
  
**[Destroying justice and progress]** So, once again, here is the claim that Jordan Peterson is actually an avatar of the patriarchy who wants to oppress minorities. However, through his 9001+ IQ, he has invented a tactic nobody has ever thought of before, which is the strategy of *acting like an egalitarian who wants to strengthen individuals and eliminate group conflict for four decades*. What a sly fox he is.  
  
**[Brainwash]** I include this one because it's one I've seen thrown around. The biggest problem with this accusation is that very few of Peterson's ideas are truly his own. He draws on concepts, theories and syntheses from Rogers, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Freud, Jung, Heidegger (and many more) and extracts out the information most relevant to living a respectable, meaningful life. He is not making any outlandish claims, and most importantly, unlike a prototypical cult leader, he is not selling comforting lies to lull you into a deadly embrace. Much on the contrary, Peterson's message is more like "get off your ass, stop blaming everyone else, do something productive." If you were a cultleader who wanted to seduce vulnerable people into your cult, is that the type of message you'd sell? TL;DR: This is a load of piss.  
  
**[Exploiting post-modernism]** This one really does require a post on its own, because it could almost qualify as a different strategy. This one is also particularly popular on Reddit, especially in areas like /r/badphilosophy. Regardless, let's run through some of the most important points.  
  
Basically, the claim here is that Peterson is a paranoid maniac who blames everything on post-modernism (which he misunderstands). This is untrue from the get-go. Peterson's qualm with post-modernism is that as a philosophical school of thought, post-modernism was an attack on objectivity itself. This is not some misconstrual: subjectivism is actually the *integral axiom* of post-modernism itself. As such, Peterson rightfully attacks post-modernism (as have many other intellectual powerhouses before Peterson) and points it out as a link in a longer chain that lead to the current subjectivist, social constructivist, group identity madness we are seeing today.  
  
In order words, the *post-modern* component of the famous *post-modern neo-marxist* term refers to the part of the an individual which has dispensed with rationality and objectivity. It really isn't more complicated than that (of course, his opponents would like to have you believe that it is).  
_______
So, are you really just a poor angry white male brainwashed into a subversive, facist cult? I think the real clincher here is that just by writing this, someone could accuse me of the same thing. I wouldn't be surprised if I was named his primary disciple. Third time: this shit is ingeniuous.  
  
Jordan Peterson has rocked the boat. He stuck his neck out in a time of cultural nuclear war and by some miracle he's still succeeding. I really do think *war* is an appropriate term here, and as such, there will be deceitful strategies, as we have already seen. However, identification is defusion.  
  
In closing remarks, ask yourself what feels more right. Are you a mindless victim to a manipulative mastermind who is exploiting you to destroy human rights and re-establish the imperium of the patriarchy? Are you just a brainwashed footsoldier?  
  
Or are you someone who, for a decade or for longer, has been incrementally fed up with the perpetual assault on rationality, common sense and objectivity? Are you someone who recoils when you see that the universities are too busy coddling and steralizing the future generations to properly educate them? Are you someone who is so tired of ideological false dichotomies that you could pretty much collapse on the spot? And finally, have you, like millions of others, recognized a man who might actually be capable of restoring order in a time of chaos and untruth? 
  
If the latter is true, then do the only thing the man has ever asked of you: Get off your ass. Stop blaming everyone else. Don't be a victim. Do something productive. Do something meaningful. In the end, it's the least cult-like thing you could possibly do.
  
  _______
**TL;DR**: The "cult" claim is just the latest wave in a sea of desperate attacks on Jordan Peterson. This time, however, instead of attacking the man himself, they are going after his fanbase. The strategy is to sow seeds of fear and self-doubt, with a varying payload. Don't fall for it.

I have a question to which I've yet to find a satisfactory answer and I thought some of you might have grappled with it.

Setting your house in perfect order seems before you criticise the world seems right to me.  We can see plenty of examples in my own life of people who have directed their anger and resentment outwards without even attempting to rectify their own internal problems.  We know where that leads.

The issue I'm grappling with though is that history seems to be littered with great men (and women) who have achieved incredible things without getting their own house in order.  Winston Churchill has an alcoholic depressive with many obvious faults yet his achievement were monumental.  John Kennedy is an even more stark example - his house certainly wasn't in order.

Are they outliers?  Do great men sometimes achieve great things depite not having their house in order?  Would their achievements be even greater if they had managed that?  

My thoughts are not remotely ordered yet - what do others think?Why are so many people at the top of their respective religious hierarchies celibate? For example, Jesus, Catholic pope, Hindu and Buddhist monks, and others. If religion is a metaphorical expression of values of a dominance hierarchy that is meant to improve fitness in terms of reproductive appeal and mating success, then shouldn't the paragons of a religion be fathers who have many children? The top male lobster gets the top female lobster and makes lots of baby lobsters!Mine are that I'm not convinced on man made climate change and the HIV-AID's hypothesis. Im in college studying arts and as you can imagine some stereotypes fall in line. People often get so flustered when I disagree with them. I don't condemn as *How to Win Friends and Influence People* states for good reason, but how can I show these people it's any inefficient way to operate?
*edit* I am trying to persuade people to be understanding, not so much preach the clearly better path. I want to improve these peoples life. So if any of you could give me a line that communicates calmly to the angry impatient side of people in a poised way, that'd be incredible.I heard Jordan said this on multiple occasions, that you‚Äôre not your own slave, that if you want work done, you‚Äôd better negotiate with yourself and give yourself something you want. But somehow when I sit down to schedule my day, I do sort of schedule an ‚Äúall work no play‚Äù day. when I‚Äôm scheduling, this is sincerely what I want!

How do you guys negotiate with yourself, and what are you pleasing yourself with?Basically, I‚Äôm a big fan of JBP but I‚Äôm stuck on what topic to pick for my persuasive essay. Unusually, my teacher strongly advised against ‚Äúanything right wing‚Äù. Granted, JBP isn‚Äôt right wing but he has called himself right-leaning. So I was looking for some advice on a topic to write about that a very left wing marker wouldn‚Äôt strongly disagree with. It‚Äôs weird I know, but I‚Äôm just looking for an accessible argument with a counter-argument (albeit a small one) that I could write about. Thanks again!Do you think this will ever manifest itself? Peterson mentioned at one point that he would very much like to debate Dawkins. I think it would be a great conversation. I've seen some very insightful comments and observations on this board but much of it is gleeful derision of popular misapprehensions and sour condemnation of JP's detractors. I see lots of criticism and outright hostility toward the putative Left lamenting their reluctance to engage in constructive dialogue. It strikes me as ironic that this is the case with each side seemingly so enthralled in dragging the other side down that no one is actively trying to build a relationship, bridge or lay out some neutral ground on which a dialogue could begin. (except for JP himself)

It dawned on me in another comment I made that before you can hope to change a person's mind you have to accept them for who they are *now*, not for who you imagine they could be if they'd only hear your enlightening advice. You need to get a sense of the frequency and so perhaps a means by which they can stop merely 'hearing' you and begin to *listen*.

Someone did a copypasta taking the piss of Rick &amp; Morty fans and I don't think anyone noticed, or I didn't see that anyone did but I had to agree it could be appropriate for this sub sometimes. Because here's the thing, you can only really **begin** to realistically think of yourself as **potentially** intelligent when you recognise and acknowledge how little you *actually know*. And one more thing, Knowledge=/=Intelligence.

Learning only begins when you realise how little you know and start listening, followed by thinking, followed by questioning.I'm currently watching the "Marxist Lie of White Privilege" talk that was recently posted, and I'm having an honest hang up.  Perhaps y'all can illuminate me.

My family owned 80 slaves in the southern US before the Civil War.  I've spent time at our former plantation.  I've seen the ledgers of slave ownership.  My grandfather sold his portion of my family's land to fund my father's college education, thereby resulting in his ability to move up his chosen hierarchy and provide for my well being.

How is this not the very definition of white privilege? I agree with most of Dr. Peterson's critique, but I have directly benefitted from the horrors of slavery.

While the argument of ubiquitous white privilege may be a tougher sell in a place like Canada, the history of the United States is woven with countless instances of tyranny for the specific purpose of the social dominance of one race across generations.

I'd love your input.  I'm just trying to make sense of it all.Hello all! Thank you so much for sharing your information about your results. I have been a long time reddit reader and believer in the emergent properties of how it influences society on the whole but I had not felt the need to share anything until recently in my life. I am a 38 year old male and have reached the upper echelon of my profession but have always considered myself as a bit of a Candide. I have noticed more often than not that people who grew up in my age group and were from a "conservative society with a classic liberal upbringing," tend to not engage with people online or in real life for that matter simply because of the time benefit/cost ratio. I also have noticed that it is people like me who were taught to "never get a big head" and "be content" are in essence a major part of the problem because of our unwillingness to put forth our ideas for fear of the result i.e. others accusations of wanting attention, having a superiority complex, forcing our beliefs on others, etc... I wanted to post my results in order to have some skin in the game and to start actively engaging in discussions to possibly contribute a positive change to this growing trend of "classic liberal" principals that are inciting a great shift in the world's conscience. I am so hopeful for humanity in the last few years as a result of the growing convergence of science, religion, and sociology. Peterson is the greatest inspiration to me in these last years since I became aware of him and he has been a major factor in my life by sorting my sometimes incoherent thoughts into order and as a result my career and life is better than ever. To give a little context of my life and profession, I am an artist from a small town of roughly 1300 in the US midwest. I speak 5 languages because of my job and have lived in 8 countries in the past 15 years. I travel the world but mostly the US and the EU 8 to 9 months per year. I am married and have two sons. I found the results to be quite accurate once I really digested them. Like many, I do find it hard to admit my shortcomings such as my low orderliness but I must say that results like this create a much better flowchart for areas of my life that I need to improve. Here are my results:

Agreeableness: Moderately High - 68%
    Compassion: High - 88%
    Politeness: Moderately Low - 32%

Conscientiousness: Typical or Average - 59%
    Industriousness: Very High - 91%
    Orderliness: Low - 16%

Extroversion: Exceptionally High - 98%
    Enthusiasm: Exceptionally High- 96%
    Assertiveness: Exceptionally High - 96%

Neuroticism: Typical or Average- 53%
    Withdrawal: Moderately Low - 36%
    Volatility: Moderately High- 68%

Openness to Experience: Exceptionally High - 98%
    Intellect: Exceptionally High - 97%
    Openness: Very High- 95% 

p.s. thank you for reading and I have unfortunately never been known for my brevity. ....However I knew this exists so any arguments of professionalism or integrity went out the window. https://youtu.be/Pk1yAVOVJsgIt's Day 58 today. Life has been going great. A few weeks ago, I was totally out of whack. Now, I feel better and more confident.

YET, there are some things I am not yet doing. I am not in control of my finances, my rent, my next cheque, a four year or five year plan and a marriage plan.

I also realized that I could be a really good professor.

That apart, one of my biggest issues is time slipping away! It just passes me by if I don't measure it. That is important.

Also, gave up on beer, and replaced it with cheap wine. Need to stay off the fats.

I run regularly, and consider myself useful if I run 12 kms a week. I met a schoolmate who runs a mile in 5:45. That's a high standard for me, because I couldn't do it at 6:15.

So, things are going well - and I need to establish focus. Also want to finish past authoring, present authoring and future authoring well.
Please allow me to introduce myself

I'm a man of wealth and taste

I've been around for a long, long year

Stole many a man's soul to waste

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ

Had his moment of doubt and pain

Made damn sure that Pilate

Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you

Hope you guess my name

But what's puzzling you

Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg

When I saw it was a time for a change

Killed the czar and his ministers

Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank

Held a general's rank

When the blitzkrieg raged

And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you

Hope you guess my name, oh yeah

But what's confusing you

Is just the nature of my game

(Woo woo, who who)

Just as every cop is a criminal

And all the sinners saints

As heads is tails

Just call me Lucifer

'Cause I'm in need of some restraint

(Who who, who who)

Woo woohttps://imgur.com/a/UdDVJI've been going through JBP's 12 Rules, and the section about telling the truth and not lying has resonated with me. I've noticed in my life that I have a tendency to agree to additional responsibilities out of a desire to seem helpful and agreeable and to please others, even when the responsibilities are more than what I can effectively budget time for, or when the tasks are not things I find meaning in. I tend to let myself become "locked in" to such responsibilities out of fear of letting others down by ripping off the band-aid. The result is that I fall into patterns of quiet resentment against those who have approached me with that additional work, and end up seeing them as an unwanted/illegitimate authority figure. In this situation I find myself wishing just for "permission to quit" where they (or some external force) can get me out of having to do the thing.

Anyway, due to listening to that chapter of JBP's book, I've just disengaged from a sort of free-work side hobby project that was consuming more mental real estate than was worthwhile. It was something I've known for some time I should have disengaged from and I finally was able to have the impetus to do it.

Has anyone else here dealt with similar issues? What things do you do to help keep from overextending yourself, and how to know when it's actually good to disengage and when it's better to stick with something?I recently got into watching Dr. Peterson's lectures and my views are shifting but not where people might think. I'm very liberal and despite his impact on the way I percieve things in the political spectrum, I feel almost as if he's confirming my beliefe in being a left-wing libertarian. Which people might think is odd considering his fan base is so right-wing it's almost comical. To be honest, politically he seems to agree with my ideology far more than the right in terms of free speech and personal freedoms. I also think his views on healthcare and government further prove him to be more left-wing than he is right-wing.

Is he a left-winger that the right gets along with? 
Is he a right-winger with occasional left leaning opinions?
Why is he so heavily associated with the right?

The campus-cult has been discussed among my friends but I was finally approached today in an abnormal fashion (relative to the commonly recounted encounter), and as such, fell into the sales-pitch trap. For the minute I listened, I tried to keep a straight face as I was assured that "woman creates," and therefore, there is a "Mother God."  

I've only ever heard of this cult within the last two months, I don't know if WGS people fall for this... I don't know it's popularity. However, the members obviously don't understand the Judeo-Christian relation to nature.



I have been using it since quite some time now, and just finished 33 21 day streaks!Has anyone tried this method to increase conscientiousness, or to modify any of their other big 5 traits for that matter? 

Auto-suggestion is explained very nicely in this vid:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ6lisqYKQQ

Put simply, it's a little like brainwashing yourself into new habitual behaviour. Through conscious repetition of a new action, it's suggested that you can instruct your subconscious mind to adopt this new action as a habit. It's through a combination of goal card affirmations and enacting the new desired behaviour that eventually this behaviour can become automatic. 

I fell on the 0th percentile for conscientiousness on JP's big 5 test (no really, just writing this post feels like a monumental effort). I'm diagnosed Inattentive ADD and take stimulants for this, which basically have given me a glimpse into an alternate reality of what it must feel like to be a naturally conscientious person. However, as soon as it wears off, I'm back to my sloth-like self who views any expenditure of mental or physical energy that isn't strictly necessary to be worse than death itself.

In short, I want to FEEL like being productive naturally. Fighting against my lazy nature tooth and nail through sheer will power isn't a workable solution, and neither I fear is taking amphetamines in the long run. Has anyone in a similar position tried auto-suggestion and experienced real changes from it?


I'm posting this from a throwaway because I always expect wrath when I implicate my own level of intelligence on the internet. It creates this natural tall poppy situation. 

Anyway, what are the unique challenges that smart people face, and what are the right solutions to those problems?

I'm making an assumption here, but I think one of my problems is somehow tied to intelligence. One thing that I tend to run into is being bored with the menial tasks. If I chose the activity myself, that's one thing. I can power through workouts and work sessions. What I really have struggled with are powering through menial tasks that have been assigned to me by others. I find better ways of doing the task, and I find better ways of accomplishing the goals of the task. I ultimately end up placing higher priority on the goals of the task than the task itself, and I take the situation into my own hands. For tasks that don't allow for freelancing, I'm directly hurting myself and the judged success of the task, but I cannot help myself. Or, I should say, I haven't helped myself. It's easy to say 'try harder', but I was hoping for a deeper response than that. I already know that. I'm looking for anything extra to add to my analysis.

I actually made the connection between this problem of mine and intelligence because of [a presentation on career choices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu__97bVyOc). It lays out categories of jobs according to intelligence, and I realized my biggest failures have been in the jobs that were below my IQ category. Granted, I know IQ is not intended to measure individual differences in intelligence (it's population-level), but I'm accepting it as a proxy for something in this case.

I don't lack conscientiousness or industriousness, and I am very smart (queue the /r/iamverysmart links), but I am not currently very outwardly successful. I blame my lack of self control, but in analyzing my choices, it's true that I've put myself in some situations that weren't challenging enough. On the other hand, the normal paths towards very challenging careers (engineer, scientist) I've also put off because the entry levels were still too boring and too inflexible for what I wanted to do. Peterson says that entrepreneurs can't be given an algorithm to follow; they have to break rules to find ultimate success. I relate to this. I feel that some of my rule breaking has been beneficial, but I'm a little stuck in life at the moment. Can I fully parlay my own chosen path into victory, or do I need to accept defeat and return to the accepted methods. The latter would mean 'trying harder' at the menial entry level shit that takes me to engineering/science, or it would mean 'trying harder' about liking my current path (programming), which is much more interesting than say truck driving, but it's still not as stimulating as I would like. (Please spare the computer science rhetoric; most programming positions are not heavy in theory, and to get one, I'd most likely have to choose the former option that I mentioned earlier by going to school and getting a high level degree).

TL;DR - It's the risk that Peterson talks about at the end of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE. How do you manage that risk, as a creative person? 

Also, at 1:20, he explains why it's so damn hard to evaluate yourself if you believe you can exist as an outlier. "Stepping outside of evaluation structures" is exactly what I have done in my past.In this video Peterson talks about the verse from Christ about the 'meek shall inherit the earth." Where does this translation come from? 

https://youtu.be/BGtcO63X_-MPeterson has said in several places (including the most recent Joe Rogan podcast) that in this biblical phrase "meek" is misunderstood or mistranslated. He points to biblehub as his source for the idea that "meek" in this context means something like "those who have power but have sheathed their swords" (I'm paraphrasing, not quoting). But I looked on biblehub and didn't find anything like that:

http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-11.htm

Can anyone point me to where on biblehub he is getting the evidence for his claim?In a fairly recent interview, JP has a pretty funny line about how ridiculous it is that his Bible series is popular. He states it something like "I applied for a loan to rent a theatre to do 2.5 hour talks about the bible aimed at 18-35 year old men" or something, and it was presented in a very humorous way. Does anyone remember which interview (and even better, what part) he talked about this? Thanks in advance.I got into the Big 5 after Jordan made an appearance on a Podcast I frequent. I've been more out of it lately, Negative behavior and attitude. The Big 5 seemed like a good way to discover where I'm at mentally.

Hey everyone, 

Just trying to a link to the writing format that JBP referenced in the latest H3H3 podcast? Can anyone point me in the right direction?One of the hardest things I have had to learn from JP is the eternal usefulness of hierarchies in social organisation. This is because I formerly idealised the libertarian idea that each individual was sovereign, and any structure one participates in strictly voluntary, and thus a collection of independent minds can *only* be a specialised network, not a hierarchy of authority. 

I still mostly hold this view. But I've come to recognise that hierarchical organisation is both universally useful (and thus hard to improve on) as well as deeply embedded into our biology. 

Before I used to view most hierarchies as either useless or evil. I tended to see formal hierarchies as a mostly useless individuals being given power of others, and so avoided them whenever I could. Whenever given the opportunity to construct hierarchies, I always attempted to make them meritocratic, confronting the traditions who usually filled the spots and did not reward competence. 

Now, after learning things from JP I see that most hierarchies are not corrupt power hierarchies. But that most are of competence (like the most skilled doctor being given the hardest case) or of knowledge (like the most published professor being given the smartest students to mentor). 

However, I still see many hierarchies as useless or evil. And knowing now how strong a motivator it is for most people to climb status hierarchies of society, I find JP way too forgiving on corrupted hierarchies, or those who simply produce bad results. 
**
It seems to me that it is of the outmost importance that hierarchies are made so that they reward behavior that has positive externalities.** 

For example, increasing in status: artists who product art people enjoy, scientists who discover and share useful new knowledge, or entrepreneurs who build useful new tools. Those are all the kinds of positive externalities we as a society would be better off if people pursued. Even if they only did it to climb the status hierarchy. 

While others, like purchasing expensive status symbols are downright wasteful. Not to mention rewarding bullies with power in formal hierarchies. Knowing that hierarchies are universally useful, does not excuse bad ones. 

**TL;DR. Most hierarchies are good. Some are bad, or even evil. How do we deal with the bad ones, encourage the good, and how do we differentiate between them?** 
As a former atheist, I find myself finding more and more beauty and useful wisdom in ancient religious texts. 

I know fully buy into the interpretation of old religious texts as essentially evolved wisdom, dealing with universal problems and solutions to them. 

However, as I keep finding incredible truth and wisdom in most texts I look closer at. I find myself wondering: if all of this is so true, what about those things about Heaven and God. Could they be true as well? 

And by true, I mean that they contain evolutionarily learned truths in narrative form, on how to act as an individual. 

The hypothesis I am brewing is that many of the useful wisdom, like order versus chaos, is close to life versus entropy, and is actually a deep discovery of the constituent elements of reality as science has found it. 

Could it also be that the discovery of God is similarly a discovery of something which is not identical to, but very close to it. That we have not invented God because he was useful, but like with order and chaos, discovered a constituent part of reality. 

Thoughts?

Any kind souls to please explain how does it work and whether or not it brings you any improvements in life?Islamicate (adj.): of regions in which Muslims were culturally dominant, but not, properly speaking religious

Hi, I'm planning on writing, mainly for meditative purposes, about how Dr. Peterson's message might be applied to the Islamic world. My main concern is scriptural literalism, extremism/fundamentalism, apologetics, narratives of victimhood (due to post-colonial inferiority complex), etc.

I would like you to share your opinion on these topics, suggestions on further topics and discuss them with me. Non-muslims or those outside the Islamic world are welcome to give their input too. Thanks. I'm really curious after hearing him on h3h3's podcast mentioning that there's a wave of young men who need to grow up.

I also saw this clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ER1LOarlgg on youtube.

As someone who feels like a bit of a man child I really feel I could benefit a lot by reading or watching what he has to say. I've checked Peterson's playlists on YouTube, but can't find anything specifically for young men. Could someone please let me know where I can find this? Thank you!I really hope some therapist/coach sees this before it gets flooded down :)

Peterson has said on many occasions that meaning is possibly the most fundamental experience. Align your life with meaning and it will be so interesting you can almost not bear it. Meaning is also intrinsically tied to action: it is the thing that motivates you to act. To find proper meaning is probably what will make the difference between us crumbling and flourishing, both as individuals and as a species. Helping people find and shape meaning in their life is thus one of the most important things we can do today. Psychotherapists and certified life coaches (the ‚Äúprofessionals of meaning‚Äù) have a unique opportunity in this domain. I'm reaching out to you.

I've been fairly active in this subreddit since I started the self-authoring suite almost a year ago. I have been slowly reading Peterson's recommended books and sharing my thoughts and questions here. But, as a MSc in Computer Science with a background in online psychological interventions, I wanted to do more. As some of you probably have heard already, I have been building a platform for people who want to sort themselves out following Peterson's vision: sorters.club. In the frame of ‚Äúscratching my own itch‚Äù I built something that would help myself in my endeavors of

* Reading the great works of the past, write and talk about them, and sharing this intellectual pursuit with others
* Tracking my own goals and keeping a journal of my sorting efforts
Meeting and having conversations with other sorters with the same interests

Meanwhile, Peterson has tweeted about the platform, a few hundred people have subscribed, and the mods of this subreddit have added it to the sidebar (thank you). As a few, not many, people use it regularly (a few of which I can now call friends), I feel about this platform as a rough prototype, a seed of what it could become: a place where people can come together and craft meaningful lives.

I want to improve this platform, by orders of magnitude. It is open source and free, and will always be for everything people can do in a public profile (because sharing is caring and an enrichment of this young community). But I want to have something to offer to people who are willing to support the platform and intensify their sorting. One example would be allowing patrons to keep some of their sorting efforts private, or share them only with select friends. But I would like to go beyond that to active support of people who want it. Here's where you, the professionals, come in. I'm thinking about things like online interventions on the platform, written/spoken coaching or counseling sessions.

That would be the "easy" part. But beyond that, I want to explore with you the psychology of meaning, and ways we can use this amazing tool which is the Internet to help people find and align with meaning. I'm talking examining the research, developing systems, tools, and services that are the real deal (self authoring suite level stuff). If you find this opportunity exciting let me know.

Oh, and yes, a partnership with Peterson would be amazing, but I'll give that its time. The man is busy and getting many opportunities. I'll let my actions speak for themselves.Do you use the ol' pen and paper, google calendar or some other applications?

Just to bring order into the chaos, I always kept my to do list in my head and always forget things. Never was a list maker och excel fanatic. But I feel now I need to start making things more concrete and more orderly. 

So I ask you, how do you go about the planning of your time?I have been listening to Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris for a long time. Years. Sam had me thoroughly convinced that free will is an illusion. It makes perfect sense when you realize that if you were born with my brain and body to my exact parents, you would be me. Simple right? That implies the ‚Äòme in me‚Äô is related solely on my brain, my genes, and my environment. That means that to be me and have my same history, all you have to have is that. This also implies that the future is determined by the exact same thing. Genes, and MY brain. It really can‚Äôt be argued once you look at it that way. 

However....Jordan Peterson has been slowly chipping away at this concept for me recently with his idea that consciousness is inherently special. I also am now convinced. I used to believe AI would be sentient and have feelings. However, I realized one day playing a video game (funny enough) that if you take a character in GTA for example and simulate them, you end up with the kind of random people in the video game. They react with fear when a weapon is pointed at them, they have conversations with each other, and they can be killed. This does not make them alive. They are simply simulated. At what point does this simulation stop? If I continued to simulate each and every neuron in the brain it would seem as if the character is alive but in reality it is still just a good simulation even if it was undetectable. It would be no different than a low level simulation. How do the lights turn on? That‚Äôs exactly what we are. Super advanced consciousnesses that have our lights on. But how? Shouldn‚Äôt we simply be a program that is also lifeless. Are we? Is this feeling of being alive an illusion? I don‚Äôt think so. It feels very real. But how? How is it that we can be consciousness? Jordan claims that consciousness is divine and I really can‚Äôt come up with another explanation for it. I know that DMT can produce the kind of trips that seem to cause people to understand this problem at a fundamental level. I‚Äôve never tried psychedelics but I‚Äôm definitely open to it. Is there another way to get an understanding of this? Thanks guys. If the humanities in university have been hijacked by the radical left and expect me to attend gender studies courses in place of a legitimate search for human knowledge, is there anywhere left to get a real humanities education? Or must it be done without the helping hand of a credible institution whose aim is to educate? I don't want to waste my time at a university just to endure bullshit. Are there any niche schools that still have integrity?I've known about Jordon B Peterson for a couple of years, saw many interviews and clips here and there on Youtube, but I don't know much about his beliefs or ideas in depth.
Listening to him and people talk about dragons and saving ones father and be the hero etc. without context is a little confusing.

What is a good starting point on his Youtube channel to get a foundational understanding of his beliefs &amp; ideas?

Thank you.**Background:** I'm the typical JBP fan.  Was not on a good mental trajectory, started listening to JBP's lectures, changed my outlook, seen the benefits.  I'm almost finished with his book and that's already helping me in unforeseen ways.

However, I am currently in the throes of a dilemma. Backstory incoming.

Me, my girlfriend, and some friends have been living in a rental house for the past 2 years and are currently in the process of moving out.  The plumbing has been a constant pain for the entire time we've lived there (toilets always breaking down, water pressure issues, shower and bath barely worked by the end).  The landlady has been less than helpful. While she's tried to fix the issues I mentioned, she's done a poor job of it, often leaving us without the services we're paying for.

Now, as we're moving out, she's bringing up every possible excuse she can to keep out deposit, even after we spent the weekend fixing all of the things we had broken (as is fair).

We've been reasonable, nice, and willing to negotiate throughout these two years and are still trying to do so now.  However, it seems she's (unsurprisingly) being unreasonable and will keep our deposit regardless of what we do.

**Here's my dilemma.** My mind is telling me that the time for reasonable negotiation is over, and it is now time for vengeance.  Naturally I'm not talking about anything violent or illegal, but maybe something like shellfish hidden somewhere to really screw with her.

I am concerned that this may "corrupt my soul", though.  Normally, such actions would give me that niggling moral pause, Socrates' daemon advising me against the act so to speak. But this time it feels like the right thing to do! It's only my conceptual moral trepidation against revenge that's giving me pause.

Was wondering what you all thought about this. Is revenge ever justified? Is it justified in this case? Any advice on dealing with difficult people? What does shellfish smell like after 3 weeks hidden in a handrail?

Thanks in advance!

**TLDR:** Landlady is being unreasonable.  I've tried to be nice.  Now I want revenge. Is revenge ever justified?
Piecing together what he has said and now reading his 12 rules here are some questions lingering in my mind.

I recall JP stating that there are many steps toward being a true Nazi (perhaps levels not steps) but does he think the same way about the far left and his concerns with where they may take us? And if not does he explain why the far left threat is more immediate than a far right threat? Or perhaps I'm looking at it wrong?

Next is his value on where evolution has taken our biology over it's run through time. I definitely think it's worth considering it's effect and role but I'm getting an impression that he says we should act a certain way because it's evolutionary what we are used to yet we are the first creatures with a brain capable of countering   what may have been historically evolutionary useful. How does one reconcile what parts of evolution we maintain and go with the flow and what parts we actively try to change or shape? Furthermore where will evolution take us going forward and are we not exceedingly changing the hold nature has on us? 

I'm trying to get a better understanding on his view points and as I continue reading his book I'll try to keep notes of parts that confuse me (if any) like his first rule did.After a doing a search for "socialism" on this subreddit (to see if I could find Jordan Peterson's perspective on the socialist Scandinavian countries), I was surprised at how many posts used the exact term "socialism/communism", like they are interchangeable. 

Jordan talks about the "precision" of language and I'm not sure how one can reconcile the evils of communism (in the former Soviet Union, as only one of many examples) and the relative success of socialism as practiced currently in the Scandinavian countries.  

While I know Jordan does not believe in seeking happiness as the only goal in life, the World Happiness Report lists the top 5 happiest countries as Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, and Finland.    

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report

Some of the categories include "GDP per capita" and "healthy life expectancy", which are objective in nature. Another category is "freedom to make life choices", which seems congruent with Jordan's worldview. 

I'm sure there is a spectrum of socialism like there is of capitalism (since the U.S., for example, does not practice pure and total free market capitalism and we also do not have a pure democracy, but, rather a democratic republic), but, I would love to hear your thoughts and maybe someone would  ask him about this during one of his Patreon Q&amp;As.

ThanksAs someone who is primarily interested in psychology (clinical psychology student), I have a raging intellectual hard-on for JP. Thanks to the videos discovered on his channel, I have reached an all-time high level of inspiration. 

Naturally, I'm here in the subreddit now to keep up with anything JP-related. 

---

That brings me to my point: my initial impression of this subreddit is that it is rather political.

JP's talks about how political orientation is related to traits, and there is no right answer to whether society should be "more open" or "more closed", because the line is moving and the differences in political orientation is good for society. Also, dialogue with "the others" etc...

With this in mind, I thought this sub ought to be very open-minded. 

However, the comment sections and one specific post where a user "admitted" to being a liberal atheist or whatever, I've gotten the impression that there is a right-wing bias among the users. 

Unless my observations are just wrong, how is it that the sub attract people with right-wing political orientation?

--- 

**TL;DR** JP talks about so many interesting topics, how come the subreddit seem so politically focused? *Red Dwarf* is a BBC sci-fi comedy show that's been around since 1988. Last year, they released Series 12, and in it was a particularly amusing episode that poked a little (a lot) of fun at the culture of not being critical.

In the episode, "Timewave" (12x03), the Dwarfers encounter a ship from the 24th century (The Enconium (sic)) in which all forms of criticism are forbidden by law.

Each member of the crew is allowed to express themselves without any fear of criticism; however, the displayed art on the ship is childish, the crew do whatever they want (even while the ship hurtles on a fatal collision course toward a moon rich in Helium 7), and the captain wears the most ridiculous outfit.

In the end, the Dwarfers teach them the benefit of criticism, (well, not in the end, end), and they ship avoids the fatal collision.

If you're a fan of quirky Brit humor, I highly recommend it (and, to a lesser degree, the previous episode, Siliconia, in which all Mechanoids are not created equal, unless they have the same model number).He once said that a person can reach heaven one step at a time, but also a person can do the opposite and reach hell one step at a time as well. And so he talks in the many videos on youtube how to not end up in hell, and instead make it more probable to end up in heaven (metaphorically, of course).

Does anybody here have a resource where he talks about what to do when a person is already in hell. When they are already all of depressed at their life, suicidal, bitter and resentful of themselves and the world, feeling lonely, addicted to things, has no career etc. 

Personally, I am already in my own personally created hell. It can only get worse if I am in the same position, but just older. So am looking for JDP vid for advice.

I've heard a number of his own responses like the BBC4 interview and on Rogan's podcast - about how the ideologies are the same, but I'm interested to hear it broken down further?

What are the steps that would have to happen to go from something like the compelled speech laws in C-16 to the slaughter of millions of people?

I feel like he's trying to guard against something like that ever happening again, but I don't understand how it happens. How could it happen in Canada today (over the next number of generations)?I'm not all that familiar with Peterson's work. Is there somewhere that breaks down his opposition to using non-standard gender pronouns, the idea that it is fuelled by Marxism,  and that Marxism by default will take us down a road of state tyranny.

ThanksOn the JRE Peterson said he will not be teaching MoM the same way again  Also, he now seems more interested in reaching larger audiences simultaneously while providing an equally engaging curriculum. How is he going to do this? I know he‚Äôs mentioned competitive writing, but what else might a ‚ÄúMaps for the Masses‚Äù entail? The writing might be for his online university now that I think about it. Watching MoM starting last January was one of the best experiences of my life, and if he continues to build on it I think the sky is the limit![The National Post reports](http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/ontario-public-broadcaster-to-investigate-allegations-against-prominent-host-steve-paikin) that Steve Paikin, host of TVO's *The Agenda*, has had allegations of sexual harassment levied against him by former Toronto mayoral candidate and CEO of *Woman's Post* magazine, [Sarah Thompson](http://archive.is/r7pNH).

People familiar with Dr. Peterson's work will likely already know who Steve is. [JBP's appearance on *Agenda*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kasiov0ytEc) was both the first real forum that explored his actual thoughts on compelled speech and C-16 in any depth, a portion of which was shown by graduate student and TA Lindsay Shepard and lead to the [recent freedom-of-expression uproar at Wilfred Laurier university.](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2017/11/15/suppressing-tvo-video-stifling-free-speech-is-making-wilfrid-laurier-unsafe.html)

TVO, for its part, appears to be taking the most responsible route available to them -- they say they are starting an investigation, but given the current state of evidence (and the dubious history his accuser has of attempting to manufacture outrage for political gain) that his position and role at TVO will remain unchanged for now.Im curiois how he feels and what are his thoughts about how often people have mostly meaningless sex. If anyone could link me to a lecture or paper id be really appreciative.I'd really like to read this for myself but cannot find the sources when I search on Google. I don't want anyone to search for me but if anyone knows off the top of their head that would be great.I, like most of you, have noticed a rise in Jordan‚Äôs social media presence, and the positive influence he has had on people in the last year. I can‚Äôt help but think if the trends continue, he could potentially develop more of a mainstream news media attention and his reach will continue to grow, thus, allowing his ideas to further spread. I even wonder if the day would ever come where Jordan began making appearances on late night talk shows, which, like PewDiePie, are viewed by millions on YouTube, thus furthering his influence. If the overwhelming majority of the feedback he receives are positive and the further his ideas are spread, the more likely people are to re-examine their views and western ideals are saved. 

   With that being said, in this age of identity politics, degradation of masculinity, rise in animus possessed women, delusions of equity, denial of science, the indoctrination of postmodernism and neo-marxists ideas in Universities and everything else Jordan is shining a light on; Can Jordan Peterson‚Äôs rise in public awareness save traditional western values? Or do you think even if he rises in popularity among mainstream media they will intentionally shun him?
I wonder if it's purely coincidental that Jordan Peterson consistently (almost exclusively) recommends books by authors who were antisemitic, sometimes virulently so, while also relentlessly attacking such Jewish constructs as postmodernism, cultural marxism, and marxism/bolshevism in general (we have all of these beautiful things entirely thanks to Jewish meddling). 

Carl Jung 

Martin Heidegger 

T.S Eliot 

Fyodor Dostoyevsky 

George Orwell 

Aldous Huxley 

Alexander Solzhenitsyn 

All of these men were critical of Jews and Jewish influence (as were, frankly, the vast majorities of -nonJewish- intellectuals and thinkers within the Western world up until the mid-20th century) and all of these men have been recommended frequently by Peterson; some of them he's been so influenced by as to base most of his personal philosophy, writing, and teaching on their works - I'm thinking of Dostoyevsky, Jung, and Solzhenitsyn in specific. 

How do you think Peterson reconciles his belief that antisemitism is a kind of 'spiritual sickness' with the fact that nearly all of the men from whom he's drawn influence were possessed by that same sickness? Is it plausible that Peterson is, himself, well-aware of the JQ, but simply unwilling to engage with the idea because it would destroy his reputation and career? I was thinking of the widely circulated video clip where a person takes the stage to ask him about Solzhenitsyn's book '200 Years Together'. Instead of answering the question Jordan walks away, pretends to look pained, and then comes back and says "I can't". Well, can't what? Can't lie about his true opinion on the issue? 

What do you guys think? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmZmDNRDb2c

This paragon of decency seems to think the law is an ass and, presumably, reckons himself to be an authority on Law. The definition of hate speech he is sensibly ridiculing is totally appropriate in that it is designed to prevent hate speech before it happens, it is not designed to define it after the act. The law as it stands would cause someone intending to utter anything insulting or offensive to pause for thought. If a person reports it as a crime it will be a case of one person's word against another and perception of 'intent'. What is bound to happen is that the accused would deny intent but this isn't possible now.

You say it, you take the consequences. You don't say it, the peace has been preserved.

This twat is a barrack room lawyer, nothing more. He reminds of the prosecution in Idiocracy.

*Source: Jordan Peterson's Facebook feed.Haha I don't come to reddit often but I had to share this with others intimately familiar with JBPs work. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb1EuGTa5BA

I'm not even sure what to make of it other than the fact that because Jordan Peterson won't go after the jews that he has no credibility in their eyes. And the comment..... oh gee the comments. 

UPDATE: No idea why the account of the original video is gone. However this video here is one of the things it circled around. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqtPsEXZTec

Also don't know how any of this relates. But I was watching the Weinsteins livestream on The Rubin Report and saw a couple Pepe's in the chat just over and over saying **"I can't do it" - Jordan Peterson** Roosh V seems very extreme with some of his views. What is your guy's opinion on "game" and such?I think it's odd that I haven't seen or heard anyone from the Left condemn JP for his stance on group identity when he himself speaks of White Identity as if it is an Objective fact that it exists. Identity politics began in the Classical Period in Europe with competing Imperial Powers, colonialism and the White Man's Burden.
This is pulled from his psych 230h class, I figured it would interest people here who would like to become better writers.

And which pot are you in? I try to make myself stronger by delaying gratification, or at least limit it. Whether I'm binge watching TV shows, watching porn, playing video games or simply browsing the internet; I try to tell myself "In 1 hour I'll stop. I'll only do this for 1 hour.". It's very hard to do in the moment, and often times I'll fail at controlling my impulses. Sometimes I waste entire days doing these activities. 

I often justify it to myself by saying "Tomorrow I'll begin a new. Things will be different tomorrow.". I admit that I do this all too often, and I feel so weak when I fail to control myself. I feel like an addict. I feel like a pleasure monkey. We live in a world where pleasure is always at our fingertips. It's *so easy* to put off our responsibilities and to pursue pleasure, especially when we're stressed; JP talks about this; he says that when we're under stress our willpower is weakened and it becomes easy to succumb old habits.


Do you think it's better to give yourself, say, 1 hour to pursue pleasures, and then attend to your responsibilities. **Or is it better to** complete your responsibilities first, and then allow yourself some pleasure as a reward? When I attempt to do the latter it's always very challenging because the pleasures that I'm delaying are always on my mind as I'm trying to work. While the former allows me to seek pleasure first and then work, but the downside is that I sometimes I cannot stop myself when I begin the pleasure activities.


Do you practice something similar? Have any tips to share? At this very moment, I want to watch porn then play video games and ignore all my responsibilities. It's so difficult to resist.I even watched my youtube history but couldn't find it... hours of videos :[ but I do believe it was relatively recent, &lt; 1 week.If not, it's war, baby!!!Yesterday I listened to the JRE Episode with Steven Pinker. He is a really fascinating guy in my opinion. I generally prefer podcasts with academic people.
I am just curious if you guys could maybe recommend a few Podcasts by academics?So, I've been following Dr Peterson's work for almost 20 years now, I saw him on TVO's Big Ideas in his lecture on Slaying the Dragons Among Us and have been captivated by his ideas ever since. 

It spoke to me for a number of reasons, one of the major ones though is the fact that I'm one of the creative types he often talks about who struggles to monetize his work and his lecture where he broke down a children's story into so many psychological, mythological and historical parts really spoke to me. It showed me that there was so much that you could pack into even the simplest of stories and it just made sense.

I had always believed that the world was more complicated than it appeared to most people and as I've continued to listen to his lectures and eventually his YouTube channel, and gained a lot of insight into myself and what it is that my creative work should represent. 

See, I've always been a big fan of superheroes. Ever since I was a kid, they spoke to me and Dr Peterson helped me clarify why that is. I identified with superheroes because of a deep seeded desire to make the world better and the lack of a father figure in my life. Superheroes were something that I could aspire to be, if not in abilities then in morality and ethics. I have always held myself to the kinds of standards that they represent, sometimes to a fault. That kind of belief system doesn't always work in a world where the right thing isn't always clear, but Dr Peterson's work has helped me maintain that standard even when it was hard to do so. He helped me see that the world has its heroes, they just don't all stand out in an obvious way like the ones I identified with. 

Then something interesting happened to me. About 10 years ago now, I was walking down the Danforth in Toronto and I happened upon this couple who were fighting. The woman had a baby with her and they seemed to be fighting about partly the kid but also other things and so I stopped, concerned about the kid's safety. After a while, I attracted their attention because I was just standing there watching them in case the toddler got in any real danger. The guy got up in my face, thinking I was trying to take his woman from him, which of course I wasn't. I explained to them that I was concerned about the kid and that they should probably stop fighting so the baby didn't get hurt. 

Eventually, they agreed and walked away from each other. I never saw them again. Something about that experience stuck with me and when I described it to people later, they characterized it as heroic. Of course that hadn't occurred to me at the time, I just wanted to help them. I started thinking about Dr Peterson's ideas more and more and I thought, what if there was a superhero whose job it is to help people with the smaller problems of the world? Someone who wasn't saving the world from disasters and world domination, but from the smaller moments which cause so much trouble in the bigger moments, like the one I encountered. 

And so I created Buckethead, a story about a guy who gets a bucket stuck on his head and decides to become a superhero. His powers don't help anyone. There's no rampant crime to clean up or natural disaster to avert, and of the villains that do exist they aren't looking to dominate the world. He goes around rescuing cats from trees and helping old ladies across the street, saving them from the little things. I even wrote the experience that inspired it into one of Buckethead's adventures. 

It's taken me 10 years to fully flesh out and realize the character but it's finally coming together. I am starting the idea as a comic book and I've found myself an illustrator to help me bring this concept to life. We recently had a launch party for the first issue and we're working on more. 

It would mean a lot to me if you all could find a way to get this story to him. 

Issue 0 is [available for free](http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/IAmTheBucket) at lulu for anyone who wants to take a look before buying in.

The artist and I have created a [Patreon campaign for the comic](http://www.patreon.com/IAmTheBucket) so that we can bring it to as many people as possible. 

Primarily what we're looking for at the moment is help with printing costs for each issue so we can give it to people who support us and sell it at events.

Thanks so much.For example, I need to apply for scholarships next academic term. Why would I disclose that I'm male when applying for STEM field scholarships for females?

Wouldn't it make logical sense to legally change my gender to female and then claim discrimination if the scholarship isn't given because they see I'm (obviously) biologically male? 

Is this the path that society is headed down?I‚Äôve been listening to the partially examined life podcast, a philosophy podcast, and it seems to me that there are a number of arguments in favor of post-modern modes of thought that draw directly from Nietzsche‚Äôs writings. 

Particularly in his essay ‚ÄúOn Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense,‚Äù where he makes the case for the construction of truth through language. Sounded very post-modern to me and I wonder how Peterson would respond to that. Basically virtue signally, and a fallacy
Check out @profmusgrave‚Äôs Tweet: https://twitter.com/profmusgrave/status/960535918666010624?ref_src=twcamp%5Eshare%7Ctwsrc%5Eandroid%7Ctwgr%5Edefault%7Ctwcon%5E7090%7Ctwterm%5E0Did anyone film the LA talk? I asked the 4th question and was so overwhelmed by the experience I can't recall much of what was said üò≠üò≠üò≠everyone who hates jp seems to be fairly active in this subreddit. what's up with thatFirst off I appreciated the first chapter of the book very much, it is very illuminating and ties together a great many things coherently.

However, I find the "pull your shoulders back" solution a little lackluster. Not saying it's wrong, but I am skeptical that it's enough to produce a big change. So this thread is about additional activities that might be adept at moving the ol' lobster-status-meter.

I'm going to put forward: boxing. For the following reasons:

* It's well known that boxers have good physique, this could be of psychological importance.
* Boxing will condition your nervous system and adrenals more than some other sports, I guess.
* Boxing will make you more confident about standing your ground. In this regard, I'm not sure if the physical and the verbal are truly separate, so I'd suggest that it may help with both.
* Boxing will increase stamina, endurance, etc.
* Boxing has a tyrannical dimension, because it is training physical violence, albeit in a controlled fashion.

I havn't done this, I intend to try. However, I'm going to take it easy, try to enjoy it, because I think the expectation of becoming truly proficient in boxing would cause anxiety.

Any other strategies?I may posts these from time to time seeking clarity within the book.

Can someone explain to me the ties between the opening (page 33) "Why won't you just take your damn pills" and it's following explanation that ends on page 35?I realize that I'm taking a risk by asking this question since I am naive to this topic. I will probably get down voted but is okay. I am wondering if the idea behind the zeitgeist documentaries where they talk about living in abundance is similar to the idea of Marxism Socialism or communism? To clarify what is meant by living in abundance I'm specifically referring to the elimination of the monetary system due to having the technological advances where the need for humans to work and make money is no longer relevant because every thing is in abundance. I have seen a LOT of concern trolling lately.

Most of it takes three forms.

One is just bringing up "concerns" over how much money he makes.

The other involves insinuating there is a "cult" of some sort.

The third, most nefarious one is "your behavior is not living up to JBP's standards" or some variant thereof.

Now, don't get me wrong. There is occasionally a use to this sort of dialogue or calling out. If someone really needs correcting.

However this is not what I'm seeing. I see a lot of these accusations thrown around on incredibly minimal "evidence" - and more than anything, used as an argumentative weapon.

It reminds me of [this meme](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1454/52/1454525623669.jpg)

This is Alinsky 101 - hold your enemy up to their own standards.

The problem is, they are not THEIR standards...so they don't really understand them. They are AGGRESSIVE about holding "us" up to them, but since it's not really an honest attempt, and they don't actually grasp the nuances of the values since they are not "their own" values, it's not really productive.

Remember, this is all divide and conquer shit. Take actual legitimate points and hyper-emphasize them to use against the people in this community.

I have seen people raise "free speech concerns" over being DOWNVOTED. Like, "I guess you guys don't value free speech after all. Jordan would be disappointed"

This is cancer. It is not productive discussion. It is sowing discord, diverting the discussion, and basically shitting up the place.

Very few of these people like or care about JBP. In fact they hate him. Usually their post history indicates this.

Actual fans of JBP and his message, if one of your fellows on here does need some correcting in their behavior, do it gently, and not as a weapon, and not too eagerly. Don't turn this into a "holier than thou" competition.Greetings, JBP fans new and old. I noticed that it's been a bit since there was a big discussion on this topic, so I thought I'd get one started. Please post the results of your test as well as any observations you have on your results. Worthwhile info might be age, race, sex, as well as perhaps IQ and any pertinent mental maladies. None of this is necessary, though, share as much or as little as you like!


For the sake of putting on a good show for the new subscribers here, I would encourage anyone who posts a first-level comment to respond to at least two first-level comments.

Thanks!He's coming to Australia in a couple months, sold out in most places, tickets went on sale today for my city, 4 hours later they sold out.  I actually had a reminder on my phone but was too busy at work to notice it.

Man...Well at least I have 12 rules on the way (it had sold out nationwide here too!)

It's crazy how popular he is now, I'm so happy for him, I just want to see him once!Alan is more spiritual/new agey, eastern religion but i enjoy them, more JP then Alan but they remind me of eachotherSo the tickets for JBPs final talk (of this tour) went on sale today for Brisbane, Australia. The ticket sales were locked up in minutes and confirmed sold out within the hour.


Rock star status confirmed.I am a conservative sophomore that goes to a liberal arts school in Minnesota. I'm an acting major and in my acting class was assigned to do a 3 to 5 minute monologue based on one time I discovered something, and INSTANTLY thought of doing it on how JBP has helped me. It's the least I can do, for all he's helped me. I may even do it for the school's monthly decently high quality talent show like event.

Wish me luck! :) The link leads to the study‚Äôs media summary: http://bit.ly/2Be3Hwv.

I know Dr. Peterson has talked about issues closely related to this. Do you know where they are? 

Also, why do you think this would be true?I‚Äôm trying to implement Rule 4, because I realize that even though I‚Äôm trying very hard to improvement myself, everyday I pick a slightly different direction to improve (because I don‚Äôt remember how I am yesterday exactly!). How do you keep track of who you were yesterday so you can focus on doing better today? What metrics do you measure? And how do you record it?

I feel like a lot of self improvement is subjective; I can‚Äôt quantify it exactly. Let‚Äôs say my goal is to be kinder. How can I tell how kind I am? What hard number do I put on it that isn‚Äôt colored by either conceit or self hatred depending on the mood that day? What are your implementations?Link to the thread 

https://reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/7vh3h7/cmv_jordan_peterson_is_not_racist_or_sexist/

I honestly don‚Äôt have the time to correct all the mischaracterisation of his views and that fac that OP changed his view and now think he‚Äôs ‚Äòracist‚Äô. 

I‚Äôd love to see Peterson himself reply to many of the comments. Hello reddit. Looking into the self authoring program I couldn‚Äôt figure out if the suite version included a personality test or if it is preferable to take the test from understandmyself.com. Is there a big difference between the two programs or does one overlap the other? there have been times in my life where i‚Äôve struggled with anorexia so i‚Äôd purposely not eat.

that was a long time ago, now my body is used to being starved for the majority of the day. 

things have changed, now i‚Äôm eating first thing when i wake up before i go to work and i‚Äôm noticing a difference, i have more energy and my confidence spikes when i stand up straight.

what do you guys eat for breakfast like peterson suggests? right now i eat a bunch of eggs with toast and some peanut butter. will that suffice? or should i start eating chicken breast?

i really don‚Äôt know where to start but i‚Äôd love some advice please.

thank you I‚Äôm pretty broke at the moment and was wondering if anyone would like to join me with the 2 for 1 Self Authoring Suite.  Error in title. It should say split[Timestamped Link](https://youtu.be/9HLXORVyq6s?t=508) ‚Äì You might need to watch the full 9 minutes to get the context or a few minutes before the quote (it's an awesome video, regardless).

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to the quote regarding the devil, Dr. Peterson [says](https://youtu.be/9HLXORVyq6s?t=432) that arguments like, "what difference is it going to make ten million years into the future," "...are hyper-rationalistic excuses for failing to bear the responsibility of living properly moment to moment, hour to hour."

&amp;nbsp;


This quote has been bothering me. I believe that life is inherently meaningless and that no matter what we do‚Äîname the most noble and elevated goals of any human to have graced the planet‚Äîit will eventually be for naught (this is me saying "God is dead"). Despite believing that, like Nietzsche, I think one has to create his/her own meaning, his/her own values‚Äî"become gods ourselves", as Dr. Peterson paraphrases it. So, I'm willing to bear responsibility but as a consequence of my own choices in the face of an indifferent universe by formulating reasoned values that I'm confident, to some degree, will bring my life meaning and make the suffering worth suffering (even though I know in the long run it's all meaningless, anyways).

&amp;nbsp;


I know there's a nuanced difference but where do Dr. Peterson and I differ? I don't *truly* understand what he is saying and would like help in understanding.

&amp;nbsp;

P.S. As an example: In my worldview, if a child was crying or in pain I wouldn't be like, "Hey, kiddo, it won't matter in ten million years, get up!" I would try to teach that child how to be stronger in the face of pain by being supportive so that if that pain would ever reoccur, that child wouldn't need me. The child would presumably find meaning in pain as a consequence of experiencing self-sufficiency (i.e., of not needing me; of becoming stronger) and continue to forge ahead in life. 

&amp;nbsp;


P.P.S. TL;DR: What's the difference between Nietzsche's method of imbuing meaning in life and Dr. Peterson's? Dr. Peterson says Nietzsche got it wrong. How so?

&amp;nbsp;


Thanks for the help!Unfortunately I have to be in the other side of the country for a surgery and I'm looking at a 6 week recovery time.

If anybody is interested in buying my ticket please private message me.I've been very much in to the idea of being able to work your way up in social status. I think that we as men (mainly men anyways) should work on ourselves just as women but here is the deal, they don't have to worry about their status because it doesn't matter to them as it does to us men. 

When i talk about social status in particular i always get the same answer from everyone i talk to (because i really like to talk about psychology and the mind). And the answers are something like "It's weak to think about it" or "you shouldn't be talking about that because you won't get it otherwise" like as if status by it self was something you win from nothing but chance, but i really don't think that is the case because you can gain social status and still be all the things you wouldn't see in a "high status man" when you think about such a man. I could see that in like mental health, because no one wants to talk about it nor do they ever want anything to do with it which is reasonable to an extent. 

What my point of all of this was: what should we do if you want to gain any type of status (or just social status)? 
I'm generally intressted. 

Please do keep in mind that there may be some misspelling in the text and please do share what you think about this, even if you feel like you could go crazy over it and try to kill me. :pAttention any London/UK-based JP fans - we have an event coming up - screening of part of the Jordan Peterson documentary 'Truth in the Time of Chaos' - and discussion with writer/journalist Tim Lott - author of two definitive profiles of JP in the Spectator and Observer - next Tuesday 13th. 

Tickets here: 

https://www.facebook.com/events/983366678469218/I am currently teaching a course called "Social Issues" as a component of the general education component of 2-year program specializing in blue-collar careers. For example, culinary arts, construction management, forestry, veterinary technicians, etc. 

The current class is 10 students. 9 males and one female. All under 20. Various programs. This class is a bit freeform/flexible given it's class size and generalized overall topic. 

Like many, I was introduced to Peterson through an episode of the Joe Rogan podcast. Specifically, episode 958. Besides being 3 hours (a tough sell for college students), it's also very schizophrenic in the issues it covers--in my experience, not the best for fostering discussion among a group of teenagers. 

As such, I am wondering if any JBP fans out there have any recommendations for shorter and more focused audio/video or readings I can assign to my students. If doesn't NEED to be JP, but related to his typical concerns would be great.

1) Must examine an issue of social importance...not just a personal issue. For example, I think his analysis of mass depression/anxiety through lack of purpose/meaning, free speech, easily coherent and cohesive comparisons of totalitarian attitudes, and tons of other items. 

2) Must be relatively in-depth about a specific topic as opposed to the intellectual meanderings typical of JBP. 

3) Appropriate level of difficulty for students aged 19-20 who often hated writing/reading/speaking based courses in HS. 

Looking forward to your responses. I know a lot is said about problems in liberal arts courses in colleges/universities and I appreciate any insight and discussion. 



Can someone comment the list of reasons as to why women need to mature/grow up faster than men according to J.B.P?I've heard Jordan Peterson talk a few times about great educational podcasts about history, politics and philosophy. Can anyone recommend any good ones?

Thanks for any help.In a discussion someone mentioned a decision of the german supreme court which was made last year. After a while I brought up my believe that what justices do is pretty much arbitrariness anyways and as an example I mentioned the USA's supreme court: The constitution hasn't been changed that much in the last 200 years and the SC interprets it differently that it did 150 years ago, depending on society's present situation. The other answered: "You can not compare the US justice system with our system." I think this was the strawmanning, because I didn't say that the systems are the same‚Ä¶ or did I? Implicitly I said that the supreme courts act the same (the German constitution is basically the same since 1949 and is re-interpreted over the decades, although it's text stays the same). Instead of pointing this out, I concentrated weirdly on why I compared the systems and why it's OK to do so; what I didn't want to originally, I just wanted to state that I *feel* courts and justices are interpreting the law without objective truth / rules. But he transformed the argument from discussing the supreme courts into discussing the whole system of justice, what made my point ridiculous, as the lower courts and the federal system is completely different‚Ä¶

**A little request:** Please don't focus on the question if justices are arbitrary or not, but on the question how I behaved and if this was strawmanning or not and what I could have done better.

Additionally the other started grinning at me, what made me aggressive. The grinning shows me: I don't take you seriously. What you say is funny. Just like Cathy Newman does [in this second](https://youtu.be/aMcjxSThD54?t=19m5s), when Peterson explains why blue helmets are cheaper.

I've had this situation on the weekend as well. Someone said there are no mental differences between men and women anymore. I tried to explain that evolution and testosterone etc. still influence our mind and tried to argue that people get overweight out of the same reason: because our genes are thousands of years old and make us eat as much as possible, roughly speaking ‚Äì and they laughed at me! Because it sounded ridiculous in their ears that I compare fat people with gender differences‚Ä¶

What can I do to be more convincing, more calm and to avoid being laughed at or strawmanned?

I think like Mr. Peterson I should take tame, listen very carefully and stay calm‚Ä¶ but that's hard when people mock you or a discussion is important to you.Peterson emphasises the importance of engagement with the everyday world to improve your individual situation. Worrying about political issues before you have sorted yourself out is a mistake. 

But, I think he exaggerates our ability to improve our situation as individuals. Our breadth of action is determined by the social environment we find ourselves in. 

I can imagine a social situation so intolerable that anti-social behaviour is the correct response. There are times when lying and evil, dissembling, might be the only way to improve your physical, economic circumstances. 

In order to be a good individual, in extremis, you have to be prepared to reject society, and die. I feel like there is a bit of a conflict between him advising people to be moral individuals, and him emphasising worldly achievement. 

I wonder what he would advise a citizen living in the Soviet Union to do. 
I've watched way too many of his videos. Now, I need to introduce JP to someone, and I don't know which one to link. What do you think ? I want of something short, at least less than one hour. Something oriented towards the danger of ideology, especially the myth of equity etc.At one point, Peterson claimed that there were two other books that are similar to his Maps of Meaning and listed their title.
Does anyone remember which books he meant or where he said that?Hi Everyone,

I'm writing this post in an appeal for truth help.

I'm struggling to maintain calm rationality in the face of being accused of being a typical hateful man scum. I am The Oppressor. This began as a mild issue which I chose to resolve by confronting X about her meddling and manipulating the otherwise peaceful environment. 

I won't go into massive detail because of time constraints. 

So here it is. 

X did a bad dumb.
I confronted her to get her story.
Screaming match ensued. 
I went back to my unit after telling X I was done with the conversation and not interested in any more of her bullshit. 
X went quiet than later came downstairs, forced her way into my room, told me she was going to kick my head in (lol) and with a smile on her face said that she would make sure I would go to jail for it as she would easily be able to claim that it was self defense. Bad news for her, there were 5+ witnesses of neighbors to her trespassing and threats to which she was oblivious of during her tirade.
A neighbor intervened when I began to push X up the stairs toward her own unit and out of my house. When my neighbor made his presence clear X's smile fell off her face and she immediately fell sideways pretending to be hurt and terrorized.

Later X called the cops trying to press assault charges. 
The cops interviewed all neighbors. 
The cops told me they would not pursue charges as it was a complete waste of everyone's time.

We are all in a building dedicated to transitional housing for people with a particular condition.

This building is made accessible to people like us through The Organisation (TR). 

TR also "provides counseling services" and monitors our integration back into society. 

On learning that the cops considered the issue a waste of their time, X threw a tantrum faking a mental break down, attempting to self harm in such a way to make it seem like I had caused her injuries. 

No one bought this shit and she was carted off to the nut house. 

They didn't buy her shit either and sent her home after two days.

X than went crying to TR about what a bad man I am.

TR hauled me into an interview about the incident. 

During this interview the councilor did not accept my side of the story despite the multitude of witnesses and the cops calling BS. The councilor also said that my neighbors were not valid witnesses as they do not live with me.

The councilor tried linguistic tricks to make me "admit" that I had more control of the situation and had no need to defend myself. I told this moron, no. That's not true. I had to defend myself as I was left with no choice and I would not be forced to apologies for it, I will accept whatever consequences happen as a result. 

I have questioned why I have been attacked and than targeted by the organisation when the witness statements plus the cops all support what I have said. 

At this point the councilor said something very very stupid. 
"She has her truth, and you have your truth. I'm not saying you're lying, or she's lying, I'm saying there are different truths." 

This has blown my mind.

Interview over and several days later X starts bringing boyfriends over for protection against the bad man downstairs, telling anyone who would listen about what a victim she is. 

I have questioned the qualifications of the councilor directly to the lawyer of TR, as when I questioned him about his qualifications he danced around it. The lawyer also danced around it, saying that the councilor was, "suitably qualified" and than the lawyer who is supposed to be equally available for my rights has been avoiding me at every opportunity since in what appears to me as a sexist fit.    
 
I have since learned that counseling is a "self regulating industry" which means that any old idiot can claim to be a councilor and as such are suitably qualified to deal with complicated mental health issues. 

I consider this dangerous as all hell.  

So my specific request is could you people help me work out a rational sane JP way of defending myself against what feels like the truth ministry lining me up to be eaten alive?

This "different kinds of truth" shit is normally something I could deal with easily but my brain is shutting down, and I'm stressed as all get out. If I defend myself against this woman, and the organisation, I run the risk of homelessness because they are holding that over my head as a threat.

Even if you could please comment with links of JP reading material in regards to this wonky truth language, that I can look at after some sleep that would mean a lot.

Thanks.

Hunter S. Thompson‚Äôs Letter on Finding Your Purpose and Living a Meaningful Life
In April of 1958, Hunter S. Thompson was 22 years old when he wrote this letter to his friend Hume Logan in response to a request for life advice.

Thompson's letter, found in Letters of Note, offers some of the most thoughtful and profound advice I've ever come across.

******************************************

April 22, 1958
57 Perry Street
New York City

Dear Hume,

You ask advice: ah, what a very human and very dangerous thing to do! For to give advice to a man who asks what to do with his life implies something very close to egomania. To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goal‚Äî to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself.

I am not a fool, but I respect your sincerity in asking my advice. I ask you though, in listening to what I say, to remember that all advice can only be a product of the man who gives it. What is truth to one may be disaster to another. I do not see life through your eyes, nor you through mine. If I were to attempt to give you specific advice, it would be too much like the blind leading the blind.

‚ÄúTo be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether ‚Äôtis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù (Shakespeare)

And indeed, that IS the question: whether to float with the tide, or to swim for a goal. It is a choice we must all make consciously or unconsciously at one time in our lives. So few people understand this! Think of any decision you‚Äôve ever made which had a bearing on your future: I may be wrong, but I don‚Äôt see how it could have been anything but a choice however indirect‚Äî between the two things I‚Äôve mentioned: the floating or the swimming.

But why not float if you have no goal? That is another question. It is unquestionably better to enjoy the floating than to swim in uncertainty. So how does a man find a goal? Not a castle in the stars, but a real and tangible thing. How can a man be sure he‚Äôs not after the ‚Äúbig rock candy mountain,‚Äù the enticing sugar-candy goal that has little taste and no substance?

The answer‚Äî and, in a sense, the tragedy of life‚Äî is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It‚Äôs not the fireman who has changed, but you. Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.

So it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle every day? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything other than galloping neurosis?

The answer, then, must not deal with goals at all, or not with tangible goals, anyway. It would take reams of paper to develop this subject to fulfillment. God only knows how many books have been written on ‚Äúthe meaning of man‚Äù and that sort of thing, and god only knows how many people have pondered the subject. (I use the term ‚Äúgod only knows‚Äù purely as an expression.) There‚Äôs very little sense in my trying to give it up to you in the proverbial nutshell, because I‚Äôm the first to admit my absolute lack of qualifications for reducing the meaning of life to one or two paragraphs.

I‚Äôm going to steer clear of the word ‚Äúexistentialism,‚Äù but you might keep it in mind as a key of sorts. You might also try something called Being and Nothingness by Jean-Paul Sartre, and another little thing called Existentialism: From Dostoyevsky to Sartre. These are merely suggestions. If you‚Äôre genuinely satisfied with what you are and what you‚Äôre doing, then give those books a wide berth. (Let sleeping dogs lie.) But back to the answer. As I said, to put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES.

But don‚Äôt misunderstand me. I don‚Äôt mean that we can‚Äôt BE firemen, bankers, or doctors‚Äî but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires‚Äî including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter.

As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this, he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal), he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development), and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks, he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires).

In short, he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. And it seems almost ridiculous to say that a man MUST function in a pattern of his own choosing; for to let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life‚Äî the definitive act of will which makes a man an individual.

Let‚Äôs assume that you think you have a choice of eight paths to follow (all pre-defined paths, of course). And let‚Äôs assume that you can‚Äôt see any real purpose in any of the eight. THEN‚Äî and here is the essence of all I‚Äôve said‚Äî you MUST FIND A NINTH PATH.

Naturally, it isn‚Äôt as easy as it sounds. You‚Äôve lived a relatively narrow life, a vertical rather than a horizontal existence. So it isn‚Äôt any too difficult to understand why you seem to feel the way you do. But a man who procrastinates in his CHOOSING will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.

So if you now number yourself among the disenchanted, then you have no choice but to accept things as they are, or to seriously seek something else. But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life. But you say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where to look; I don‚Äôt know what to look for.‚Äù

And there‚Äôs the crux. Is it worth giving up what I have to look for something better? I don‚Äôt know‚Äî is it? Who can make that decision but you? But even by DECIDING TO LOOK, you go a long way toward making the choice.

If I don‚Äôt call this to a halt, I‚Äôm going to find myself writing a book. I hope it‚Äôs not as confusing as it looks at first glance. Keep in mind, of course, that this is MY WAY of looking at things. I happen to think that it‚Äôs pretty generally applicable, but you may not. Each of us has to create our own credo‚Äî this merely happens to be mine.

If any part of it doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense, by all means call it to my attention. I‚Äôm not trying to send you out ‚Äúon the road‚Äù in search of Valhalla, but merely pointing out that it is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it. There is more to it than that‚Äî no one HAS to do something he doesn‚Äôt want to do for the rest of his life. But then again, if that‚Äôs what you wind up doing, by all means convince yourself that you HAD to do it. You‚Äôll have lots of company.

And that‚Äôs it for now. Until I hear from you again, I remain,

your friend,
Hunter
This is a long story that's being dramatically compressed to make it as easy to answer as possible.
I was trying to get with a girl. Got rejected. she got with some other guy who I perceive as being lower than me. And my indicators aren't wrong as other people have this opinion as well. 
It's been particularly bothering me why this occured? why this inferior/subservient/unattractive whatever other malevolent names I can think of has basically succeeded in genetic propagation while I haven't. Didn't make sense to me. so I approached and asked her she said because he was sincere.

So the reason for the post title "How important is the dominance hierarchy?" is because I can't understand why a female went below. Maybe I put too much value on it? 

Would like your opinion and advice.
Thank you 


 
&gt; [The thief acts upon] a habit of thinking supported by tradition and milieu alike: anything that cannot be exploited in some way is uninteresting -- hence the devaluation of the psyche.  
&gt;...  
  
&gt; In this respect our conventional system of education -- necessary as it was -- is not entirely free from blame of having helped to give the empirical psyche a bad name. In recent times this traditional error has been made even worse by an allegedly biological point of view which sees man as being no further advanced than a herd animal and fails to understand any of his motivations outside the categories of hunger, power, and sex. We think in terms of thousands and millions of units, and then naturally there are no questions more important than whom the herd belongs to, where it pastures, whether enough calves are born and sufficient quantities of milk and meat are produced. In the face of huge numbers every thought of individuality pales, for statistics obliterate everything unique. Contemplating such overwhelming might and misery the individual is embarrassed to exist at all. **Yet the real carrier of life is the individual.** He alone feels happiness, he alone has virtue and responsibility and any ethics whatever. The masses and the state have nothing of the kind. Only man as an individual human being lives; the state is just a system, a mere machine for sorting and tabulating the masses. Anyone, therefore, who thinks in terms of men minus the individual, in huge numbers, atomizes himself and becomes a thief and a robber to himself. He is infected with the leprosy of collective thinking and has become an inmate of that insalubrious stud-farm called the totalitarian State.  
&gt; ...    
  
&gt; The goal of [the individual] is a higher one than the fulfilment of collective ideals, which are all nothing but makeshifts and conditions for bare existence. Since this is the absolute foundation, nobody will deny their importance, but collective ideals are not by a long way the breath of life which a man needs in order to live. If his soul does not live nothing can save him from stultification. His life is the soil in which his soul can and must develop. **He has only the mystery of his living soul to set against the overwhelming might and brutality of collective convictions.**"  
  
-- *Mysterium Coniunctionis*, 1963 (pars. 194 &amp; 198)When you're eating, finishing studying, at night after work,... what are some mind expanding channels on youtube(not JP or anything like) that you watch? Like I tried Bloomberg to watch business world, but I don't like it that much. Anything like business/economics/finance, politics, computer science, psychology...To take things seriously.

That I can be serious as much as I want, which basically is always. And I can prefer serious activities instead of alternatives every time.

To be serious is to engage with life. It gives me a sense I am actively searching for meaning in whatever I currently perceive. Being serious is to consider things carefully to make them personally meaningful. The world is not meaningful by default, but we have to work on understanding it, and when we do, we are serious. For example it is evident Jordan has worked on understanding biblical stories, and he has discovered how they can be meaningful. He did it trough seriously considering them, not by being casual.

People occasionally have commented I am too serious, and recommended me to take things less seriously. Maybe people confuse depressed mindset with seriousness. After all I have been the depressed type earlier in life. People who are depressed often seem serious in some negative way - they are not lighthearted. Seriousness is not inherently negative however. I have come to discover by watching Jordan, it is about acknowledging there is something out there worth discovering or achieving, and then directing effort.

With goals, I find reason to be serious all the time. If I am not feeling serious, I am wasting my time.

Being serious, I find it easier to respect people, art-forms etc, because I actively try to understand the possible meaningfulness. To think deeply.

To be less serious would make life meaningless to me. I have often felt life to be meaningless. Now I see seriousness makes life meaningful to me.

I guess this goes had in had with taking responsibility and its role in a meaningful life (something Jordan talks about).Has anyone else read chapter 7 of 12 Rules yet?  I‚Äôm a fan and admirer of JP, and I‚Äôve greatly enjoyed most the book.  But while there are a few woo-woo bits earlier on, this chapter seemed to go off the rails in a weird, rambling, hard-to-follow way.  

I was raised Christian, so that‚Äôs not a new topic for me. And I studied political philosophy in grad school, so I‚Äôm not overwhelmed or put off by the references to Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Milton, etc.  But I wonder if anyone found this chapter especially hard to follow.  I almost feel like his editor let him down.  Can also be read on https://caveat1ector.wordpress.com/2018/02/07/existential-truth/

Context: having noticed the difficult dialogue between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris, I thought my input may help ameliorate the situation.

Basic causal chain:

Fundamental existence i.e. ‚ÄúGod‚Äù i.e. YHWH (‚ÄúI am who I am‚Äù / ‚ÄúI will be who I will be‚Äù) =&gt; (Physical) Universe =&gt; Evolution =&gt; Human biology / physiology / psychology / reward system (‚Äúutility function‚Äù / ‚Äúpreferences‚Äù in Economics)
[A person‚Äôs identity can be said to be fundamentally dependent on his preferences. E.g. I am biologically wired to like chocolate; it is an unchangeable / definitive part of me.]

‚ÄúObjective‚Äù morality can be derived rationally (without immediately resorting to ‚ÄúGod‚Äù), to the extent that human beings‚Äô (subjective) preferences overlap, so that everyone‚Äôs rationally derived optimal behaviour (‚Äústrategy‚Äù in Economics) i.e. what they should do to maximally please their reward system (maximise their utility function), can be described by a common set of rules / goals.
[Due to the great degree of similarity between human beings, this is fairly self-evident. I.e. ‚Äúpain is real‚Äù, as Jordan Peterson cleverly expresses in layman‚Äôs terms, and pain is real to everyone in approximately the same way. (Everyone subjectively likes chocolate, so that we can agree on the ‚Äúobjective‚Äù moral principle that it is good for man to eat chocolate.)]

When a common (objective) set of goals is agreed upon on the basis of everyone‚Äôs overlapping (subjective) preferences, we then have a sort of universally true utility function, from which optimal strategies (‚Äúlaws‚Äù) can be derived (e.g. via decision theory) to govern human behaviour. Everyone will want to ‚Äúobey‚Äù these ‚Äúlaws‚Äù simply because it is in their own self-interest (‚Äúself-interest‚Äù can include the interests of those around you, thanks to this human feature called ‚Äúempathy‚Äù).

Christianity, through its long continuous tradition, has managed to embody precisely the sort of ‚Äúobjective‚Äù morality that has resulted in the success of Western civilisation.
[Many people manage to see the beauty of the morality embedded within the bible, in spite of the irrational interpretations imposed upon it by the hordes of ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù teachers peddling their ignorant / wilful theological absurdities.]

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

With sufficient scientific advancement (especially in Economics / Psychology), people like Sam Harris might find themselves deriving via purely rational inquiry the same sort of morality already achieved through Christianity‚Äôs long history.
[Of course, this does not exclude the possibility that the pinnacle of moral enlightenment lies somewhere beyond what has been achieved via Christian tradition. (good ole intellectual humility)]

Analogous to how Engineers often find it more profitable to mimic the mechanisms that nature has developed through evolution, than to think up novel mechanisms from scratch.

So, as long as one retains rationalism / pragmatism as one‚Äôs guiding principle (epistemology / hermeneutic), then one may find that ‚ÄúGod‚Äù and Science both in fact agree on the same kind of ‚Äúobjective‚Äù morality.
[‚ÄúGod‚Äù (religion) got there first, though one day Science might catch up and exceed ‚ÄúGod‚Äù. Actually, that‚Äôs somewhat a false dichotomy ‚Ä¶]

Bonus: One key feature I find in biblical morality has to do with the simple contrast between short-term good and long-term prosperity; the morally upright way being the one that optimises long-term wellbeing.

For now, I‚Äôll leave the rest of the story to Jordan Peterson‚Äôs capable hands.

(Feedback appreciated.)I can see what he means when he talks about Neo-Marxism.  Feminism, some of the civil rights movement and trans activism all have elements of the oppressor/oppressed narrative which stems from the New Left of the 70s and a re-packaging of the old bourgeois/proletariat method of classical Marxist thinking.

However, I've always thought about post modernism as being linked to philosophical/moral relativism and the concept of personal and relative truth (usually at the expense of objective truth).  "You tell me your truth and I'll tell you mine" etc.  I've not seen JP say explicitly if he's referring to this and if so, how it applies to some of the left wing ideologies he's criticizing.  Certainly some left wing ideologies like feminism and trans rights do place great emphasis on the personal experience/truth.  So much so that we hear phrases like "Don't invalidate my experience" etc as if the experience is the defining factor in the truth of the movement.  Is this what JP means or is he referring to something else?

Perhaps someone could link me to some more explanation or unpack this a little for me?

Thanks!
Hi folks, first time post here. In the Myth of White Privilege lecture, Peterson talks about how the races are equal when compared to one another, but individuals aren't. Does anyone know where I can find any more explanation on how the races are equal to one another on average?? Thank you!Carl Jung died in June 61.
JP was born in June 62

Coincidence???
I think not.I've read chapter 11 of Dr. Peterson book and he mentions the smell of the unemployable. 
&gt;"Maybe I picked up some change in scent that night, when death hung in the air. Chris had a very bitter odour. He showered frequently, but the towels and the sheets picked up the smell. It was impossible to get them clean. It was the product of a psyche and a body that did not operate harmoniously. A social worker I knew, who also knew Chris, told me of her familiarity with that odour. Everyone at her workplace knew of it, although they only discussed it in hushed tones. They called it the smell of the unemployable."

Does anyone know that smell or have any scientific papers about the smell? Anyone have stories about that smell?From his wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan

&gt;Christopher Michael Langan (born March 25, 1952) is an American whose IQ was reportedly believed to be "between 190 and 210". In Morris 2001, Langan relates that he took what was billed as "the world's most difficult IQ test" in Omni magazine, and he gives his IQ as "somewhere between 190 and 210". As a result of his score, he has been described as "the smartest man in America" as well as "the smartest man in the world" by some journalists.

&gt;Langan has developed a "theory of the relationship between mind and reality" which he calls the "Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe" (CTMU). Influenced by the works of John Archibald Wheeler and Stephen Hawking among others, the work's central thesis is that reality is a self-processing, self-referential language, embodying a dual aspect monism and consisting of "infocognition", or information that resides in "syntactic operators" within reality. *

He wrote a paper recently titled "Metareligion as the Human Singularity" which some here might find really interesting. Its abstract:

 &gt;**Abstract**

&gt;*Based on the author's notes for a presentation to the Foundations of Mind group in October of 2017, this paper examines the role of metareligion in obtaining a favorable outcome for the human species as it approaches a Singularity with both Human and Technological aspects.*

It would be amazing if Jordan were able to talk with him i think it could be a very fruitful discussion. Chris has a bone to pick with Academia but Jordan isn't a typical Academic, and since he's a clinical Psychologist like Chris's wife he should be able to communicate with him effectively and navigate the conversation tactfully and with care. If you read Malcolm Gladwell's book 'Outliers", Chris is featured in it where it's learned that he had a very abusive upbringing which helped him to form a bit of a chip on his shoulder.

Itd be really fascinating discussion hopefully one day it happens. Hey I recently took the personality test and would like some ideas on what I jobs I might be able to get into. I'm also finishing my general education in college. I'd appreciate the insight as it could help me pick out a degree that would benefit me in the market , but also enjoy. 

My scores are:
Agreeableness 17/100
Conscientiousness 4/100
Extraversion 92/100
Neuroticism 9/100
Openness 92/100
The university is dead for more reasons commonly discussed on this sub.  The system of attending a brick and mortar campus for four years (with extended seasonal vacations and often no income interim) was never meant for the general populace and is beyond unsustainable in its current state.  It's not just ideology distillation and homogenization; professors inadequate for their position (often adjunct or TA) and dilution of rigor across disciplines has degraded the quality of higher education. Add to this the ghastly price tag of attendance and bloated administrators emphasis on turning a place of intellectual challenge into a place of customer hospitality, and it's hard to imagine the university surviving the next 10-30 years.

Meanwhile, there are great minds of our time with the ability to broadcast to millions.  It seems the state of academia is dire enough that these public intellectuals (who are continually driven out a la Bret Weinstein) could band together to become our professors in a new platform.  A new academy that not only saves the classical humanities from destruction but teaches applied STEM (which, IMO, many current universities inadequately do, particularly tech).

With a host of online colleges already in existence, the goal of an accessible, affordable, applicable, accredited new academy is attainable.  There are many defected and disgruntled academics, grad students, etc. but I am wondering if anyone here has concrete plans on contributing to create something similar to JP's vision?I find it hard I have opinions on some things, and this has made me a square.

I think I've become like this because I've played poker semi-professionally for 12 months or so now, and I've just been so used to being objective and not having opinions on things, but rather, studying and replicating the best strategies.

In the real world, I suffer socially as a result. So how do I restart the engine that allows me to think and find my truth/my opinion on things?Jordan Peterson's appeal to young men is widely noted, and lauded, but it does raise the question of how to expand the relevance of the message to women. 

Mothers of boys (way over 1/2 the population of mothers) are certainly more than a little concerned about raising admirable young men. Let's discuss here (hopefully with help from women) ideas for content that would appeal to them. (one video to look at as a minimal starting point is [the book for small children about problems at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QtOWpV8d_0). Of course, that's for a younger generation, but it's certainly a video with parental appeal) 

EDIT my general response to the comments so far: 

* what is good about the comments so far is that they are mostly "good" or at least "valid" ideas.

* what is not good about the comments so far is that they don't help hone a solution, they don't narrow, they widen the scope, and they miss the kernel of a good idea that was included as a hidden assumption in my original suggestion:

JP has invested years in a massive body of work which is showing real-world strong appeal to young men. He can't overnight rewrite it "for girls", that's too much work, and he doesn't have his natural advantage in that area (advantage being, he started working on his ideas as a young man himself) However, he does have experience with a wife in a marriage with a son and a daughter, i.e. as a late middle age man, I imagine he probably is "better at" engaging the attention of middle age women. Many of you will at this moment have the urge to point out that his material already appeals to girls, girls take his classes, etc. Yes: but girls are not flocking to his lectures. I'm trying to suggest a simple way to extend his franchise.

So, I'm going to hop around from comment to comment to point out where I think they "miss" the point of my original suggestion.School Of Life clearly has very different values then Jordan Peterson, so not sure if that bothers anyone here.  But i think their video on what your house says about you is a nice piece to Jordan's clean your room talk.    

https://youtu.be/HY-E7l_Gfe4 I've just finished reading The Happiness Hypothesis by Jonathan Haidt. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Jordan Peterson. They certainly think along similar lines. I have seen a lot of people who have been resentful for rather petty reasons. siblings resentful of others who make more money, and the like. I think I am a bit different of a situation, and I don't know what to do.

I have always wanted to be a pilot for the United States armed forces. I didn't care if I was flying fighter jets or cargo planes, I just wanted to serve my country. However, in high school. I realized I was red green deficient. This means the Military pretty much didn't want me for any job I could really be interested in. Pilot? nope. Weapons officer or NFO? nope. Munitions handling or aircraft maintenance? nope. You even have to have perfect color vision to be a media specialist. 

So, my dream was rotting in a trash can. However, even now that I am in college and am studying computer science, I am still incredibly jealous of those who can be fighter pilots. 

A few weeks ago I saw an ad for the Air National Guard, in which they pretty much said "look at this woman! she flies fighter jets for a living! so could you! Isn't that the coolest thing in the world?"

I didn't even make it through the entire ad. I was filled with a sort of rage I had not felt in probably years. All that disappointment came back as pure jealousy and resentment. That could be ME, but it could never and will never be. I am disabled. I am broken. I will never achieve my dreams. 

I have been thinking about this for a while now, and I don't know what to do. I want to be happy for all our pilots, and proud of them and what they do, but I just get so upset. I don't know how to reconcile these feelings. I know I have given up on that path already, and I am going down a different one. I am going to try and be a programmer, despite that not being what I really want to do most deep down. maybe one day I will make enough money to afford my own house and own my own airplane.

Does anyone have any advice on this resentment? I'm not usually a very bitter person, but I guess this subject really hit me where it hurts.Like many people I discovered him through that shambolic C4 interview, checked out a few clips and was instantly moved by everything he had to say on psychology and self-improvement in a way that might finally be the start of an upward trajectory in my life.

My question here is more focussed on some of the worldviews of his fans and perhaps the man himself, which is somewhat perplexing/troubling to me. A big part of his message that has resonated with me is about learning to let go of the deep-rooted disdain for I have for my own weakness and failure, so that I am no longer continually paralysed into inaction each day. Living life honestly, authentically and without succumbing repeatedly to your own self-loathing.

Now if living life in this way is such a crucial part of allowing the possibility of self-improvement into your life, why then would you carry that very disdain with you into your new and supposedly better outlook, and project it onto other people? And why would you hold any ill will towards those people who differ from you, when like you they are merely trying to live their lives as honestly as they can? There seems to be this expectation of conformity to a certain set of traditional conservative values that runs among his fans and even the man himself that directly contradicts the empowering message of self-improvement in the first place.

It just strikes me as odd that a man who's primary message appears to be to learn to let go of feelings of bitterness and hatred would attract any 'alt-right' or MGTOW individuals, because these positions are rarely rooted in little more than a delusion of rationality - while in fact being fuelled by an overwhelming undercurrent of bitterness towards anyone they feel isn't trying or doesn't have to try as hard as they do at life (and make no mistake, I am aware that this also exists on the left, you just replace 'feminists and trans people' with 'cis white males' as the object of disdain, but those are not a significant portion of JP's fanbase so are not relevant to what I'm asking)

I am really trying to word this in the least hippy-ish and most rational way possible, but I just don't understand why in learning to forgive yourself for your own shortcomings, eccentricities and perhaps occasional downright abhorrence, you wouldn't then apply this worldview to others. 

I am not looking to inflame. If I am wrong about his appeal to the alt-right, correct me. If you disagree with my interpretation of his message, explain why. If you identify as an alt-right JP supporter, share your viewpoint. I just want to understand. Thanks.I would have estimated that I had lower than average industriousness, and higher than average neuroticism, but it's pretty unbelievable to me that I had the lowest possible score on an objectively good trait and the highest possible score on an objectively bad one.

How do I go about correcting these? It seems rather hopeless. I have a higher than average IQ, which I guess is the only thing that kept me from failing everything I've ever tried, so maybe it's not entirely fucked, but I really feel completely unable to do anything. It's difficult for me to read even a page of writing without getting distracted or anxious about something.

Does anyone have any experience with improving certain elements of their personalities?Hi Everyone,

I find that I need the full weekend to lay in bed after a week of work just to have enough energy to clean my room. Does anyone have any tips on accomplishing your goals when you are extremely exhausted after work? (Probably have some occasional boughts of depression/PTSD I'm dealing with, as well). Thanks! Does 12 Rules For Life contain any content that Peterson hasn‚Äôt really talked about in his online lectures? As someone who‚Äôs watched way too many and can correctly predict his answers in interviews four out of five time, I‚Äôd be more interested in buying the book if it talks about stuff I haven‚Äôt heard him discuss before As I've posted before in this sub, my greatest influence is Hubert Humphrey. Humphrey stood for the worker, the farmer, the small-businessman, the poor rural, as well as urban members of society, etc. However, he supported capitalism (while providing a safety net and taking a stand against corruption). He believed deeply in Free speech, and when the communists tried to exploit and take over Minnesota's newly formed DFL Party in the late 1940's, Humphrey took the lead to kick them out. 

However, when I went to my Democratic caucus tonight, I found myself up against sjws and economic illiterate Democrats. 
The minimum wage discussion became:"We can't vote for the candidate who wants to phase-in a $15 minimum wage over a five to seven year period (which is what I stood for). Instead, there's a candidate who will Implement a $15 minimum wage, and more, as soon as possible." 

Also brought up was "We all know that the idea of two genders is a lie" ( I won't get into the origins of that one). 

I wanted to put this up here tonight because I still feel, as have always felt, a respect for "the Humphrey-Democrat." Moreover, I think that such respect is what attracted me most to Peterson--I was looking for the truth, the rational, after listening to lies thrown around by modern Democrats. 

 I'm very proud to be a Democrat but ashamed when being lumped into a group with these doctrinaire experts of exploitation (a similar critique Humphrey gave of the communists). 

 I know some will suggest but I can speak up, however, if I do, I know I'm taking the risk of not being able to have the support for the small things I want to get passed within the party. More importantly, I know I will just be scoffed at-- they have the numbers of brainwashed people. 

And so, my question: should I learn to get through it and stick with my party, should I call it quits; or should I be a Democrat as Kierkegaard was a Christian?


I misplaced the email and if I had an approximate date, I might have a better chance of finding it. Thanks, I know it was a few months ago.I've come across this passage from *The Sentiment of Rationality* by William James:

&amp;nbsp;

"Suppose, for example, that I am climbing in the Alps, and have had the ill-luck to work myself into a position from which the only escape is by a terrible leap. Being without similar experience, I have no evidence of my ability to perform it successfully; but hope and confidence in myself make me sure I shall not miss my aim, and nerve my feet to execute what without those subjective emotions would perhaps have been impossible. But suppose that, on the contrary, the emotions of fear and mistrust preponderate; or suppose that, having just read the Ethics of Belief, I feel it would be sinful to act upon an assumption unverified by previous experience,‚Äîwhy, then I shall hesitate so long that at last, exhausted and trembling, and launching myself in a moment of despair, I miss my foothold and roll into the abyss. In this case (and it is one of an immense class) the part of wisdom clearly is to believe what one desires; for the belief is one of the indispensable preliminary conditions of the realization of its object. There are then cases where faith creates its own verification. Believe, and you shall be right, for you shall save yourself; doubt, and you shall again be right, for you shall perish. The only difference is that to believe is greatly to your advantage."

&amp;nbsp;

If you are interested discuss the arguments for and against this conception of truth, seemingly the same or similar viewpoint JP expresses regarding truths which aren't always scientifically verified yet allow us to navigate the trials of life as if they are true. To what extent does our belief in something define its reality?I've just discovered Jordan Peterson in the last couple weeks and really like him. He mentions how young men have been really affected by his videos, and "telling the truth" is something that has really changed their lives. The idea of being truthful definitely feels right to me, but I'm interested in hearing you guys share any experiences from your lives that you might have had in trying to implement this particular idea from Jordan Peterson. Have you had any specific experiences that illustrate how more effortfully telling the truth has positively changed your life? I just want to see some examples of this in action. Thanks.I have been watching and following Dr. Peterson for a few years now and seems to be in sync with many themes that happen to exist within the philosophical context of Freemasonry. Most notably, grappling with a sense of the divine in a post-enlightenment society.  He is of course different, in the sense that he is both more naturally and directly political . However, "making good men better "or "putting more masonry in men ,not more men in masonry" and other clich√©s of masonic origin seem to match well with his own lectures of self development. 

Thoughts? Just throwing it out there on a relaxing ,not-so-busy afternoon.




CheersTesco in the UK are facing a 4 billion pound law suit because their shop workers (high percentage women) want to be paid the same as their warehouse workers (high percentage men).  Seemingly applying for a job in the warehouse for these individuals isn't an option so they're demanding the two jobs to be paid the same.  If that isn't a very slippery Marxist slope away from capitalism, I don't know what is.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42968342Everytime I check facebook there's a new update from JP. How does this happen? He can't be constantly on it.One scene in the office perfectly epitomises dominance competitions and their value to a capitalistic society.  Dwight is trying to impress Angela and he does so by trying to outsell a "Robot" and in doing so sells many more than he otherwise would have thereby benefiting the wider world. This is the value of the Masculine summed up in a nutshell. It may be a minor change, but it‚Äôs major for me. In his talk with Ben Shapiro on the Rubin Report, Peterson finally switched terminology from dominance hierarchy to competence hierarchy (or at least it was my first time hearing the switch). I think this is a very good change; one that I‚Äôve been wanting for a while. 

The word ‚Äúdominance‚Äù plays into the power games of neo-Marxism. Even when he explains dominance hierarchies using chimpanzees, he says that it‚Äôs not the most powerful and tyrannical chimp at the top, because he can be taken out by three half as powerful chimps. It‚Äôs the most competent chimp who takes care of the women and children and gains respect from the other chimps that sits at the top. The word competence seems much more appropriate.So, altough I've been a long time follower of petersons work I've only resently started sorting and I've come accross some problems I simply do not know how to deal with.

During last period I've had to do a group project with three others. Two of them were simply useless and/or clueless. One was assigned to write the report and had over a period of 4 weeks had only written 1/4th of the report. The end product resulted in a miserable failure. The other's task was to investigate methods to pre-process our data, except that he was so clueless he couldn't even get the program to work even tough he's a study-year ahead of the rest. 

Me and my mate ended up doing almost the entire project, but it ended with a result half assed. The writing wasn't even close to done near the deadline. The other two group members couldn't even run the program while given explicit documentation for every step what to do and how to troubleshoot. Moreso they only started working on the project at 11 am and left at 3 pm and were unreachable after that. I know I should have said something about it, but I felt so completely dumbfounded I couldn't. The person writing the report always said it was going fine but never posted what she was actually writing so we couldn't work with it or check or help and she didn't ask questions either. I believe the mark will be really low, but I've been surprised before, moreso I believe we should have a really low mark and fail the course and will most likely make protest if we *do not fail*. 

"Luckily" the period has ended and thus part of the problems are over. However the new study-period brings all kinds of issues to the table. The documentation for one of the programming language is entirely in spanish, the feedback we get on essays is so late you can't even use it for the assignment two weeks ahead and the third subject refuses windows support (,which I've already solved, by figuring things out myself over a course of 3 intensive days).

I probably have too high expectations, but these things have left me so depressed I've started smoking again and it's a repeating pattern at this point. 

I feel like I'm complaining too much if I say anything about it, which is why I'm posting here instead of talking to someone about it, but it's honestly driving me insane.

How does one deal with this?He keeps going around the house saying, "Mao, Mao". I've tried giving him treats but I think he wants to have a communist revolution. What can I do?*This is not a post advocating for drug use, just the details of my psychedelic intervention using JBP material. English is not my first language but Im working on getting better. 

I have deleted this post a few times but here I go, please feel free to ask me anything you want and I'll share.

JBP message didn't resonated with me before, I love psychology but I could not stand the guy. Also I considered myself an anarchist since I was 13 (mid 30s today). I'm a father, a husband and a mess of a person who always thought he was oppressed by the capitalist system, for being a minority, poor, etc. I'm very messy in very aspect of my life and I know I wasn't a proper role model for my family, everyone in my home was more "put together" than me. I have been hitting a wall for a long time, the type of depression where you can't leave your bed because life is so fragile that you know that something bad will happen and things will get worse. Suicide was not a real option but a topic that I really think about a few times. For me there was only one way to interpret the world.

The trip
I did 200ug LSD, 300mg MDMA, cannabis and some supplements to deal with the MDMA neurotoxity. I went to the forest during a snow storm and played  the 12 Rules audiobook which I had to stop on chapter two because it became too much (in a good sense). In my psychedelic experience JBP become for a moment the honest invested caring father I never had (mine died from a drug overdose and never raised me, see the paralels), because this guy really cared, and reached me in my darkness to tell me how to get the courage to start the journey of the mythological war of regaining my consciousness and my life. I understood how logic it was, I was and anarchist my whole life because I my stepfather who was the person who tried to bring order to my messy kid life, I resented him because he has always been of strong character. I rejected any form of order, yes, I had the whole concept of anarchy wrong too but that twisted concept was attached to my bones. I felt I was really ideologically possessed and had so much anger and wanted this thing to leave my body. Then I started crying like a kid alone in the forest, the memories from my childhood, came, the memories of all the bad things I have done to me and others because of my ideology and how my kids are adopting parts of that. I looked at myself on the camera of my phone and saw me but looking more like Gandalf, just me very old and told my self, "I'm coming from the future to tell you, put your life together today or you are going to regret it, do it now." Then I cried more and started to hyperventilate and stretched my body, my vertebras cracked and I felt this energy shocking my brain (whatever that was), I was only wearing a hoodie and shorts running through the snow and screaming "IM NOT DEPRESSED ANYMORE! THIS IS HOW IT FEELS BEING FREE! NO IDEOLOGY OWNS ME!", I don't remember living without being reactionary every moment, that wasn't there anymore. 

I avoided my family that day to be able to incorporate the experience which was the most profound of my life, just told my wife a bit about it. I feel lighter, I don't feel the anxiety on my chest, phone calls dont make anxious, I feel I want to become a real model for my kids, I know want to give my wife real reasons to be in love with me. I cleaned the whole house and now I can tell my kids with no remorse to take care of their mess too. I want to recover my finances and not keep avoiding everything, I want to fix my relationship with my step father and forgive him for sometimes execute his role in a tyrannical way, I want to forgive my mom for not making me stronger, I am calling myself of every bullshit I do. I haven't touched cannabis since the trip and I had a big dependency but I just want to be on my peak on every fucking aspect of my life. I rejected order and I am paying the consequence, nobody showed me that before. I see why some call Jordan the Archetypical father. I am ridiculously grateful with him because NOBODY had done this with me before and today my whole family happier and I have a new perspective in life.

I don't consider myself longer an anarchist on every aspect of my life, I have been conditioned for too long and there will always be some remains but now I see what I was missing. I told myself the lie that society was oppressing me for so long and it wasn't (not talking for others who really are oppressed). How I can repay, this psychologist what he has done for me? I will give money in the future to his patreon account so he can keep the good work even when bottom lobsters hate it (had to make the joke).

Thanks for reading me, this is like being born again. I accept any suggestion on how to move on in life now. I'll be doing the JBP writing courses as soon as I have money and I have been listening to chapter two over and over so probably there still a lot of more conditioning to break.

*lobster hugh*

*edit: fixing words, corrected the part where I mentioned that my step father was the figure who imparted order in my house, grammar was awful.I remember listening to an interview with Jordan Peterson, I think it may have been with Joe Rogan but I haven't been able to find it. 

He was discussing why the ratio of men to women has increased more in countries which have made the most effort to equalise the ratios, and likened it to twins with an abusive father, and how removing one factor of how a person behaves can make other differences more pronounced. 

Can anyone remember which interview this was from? I need to re-listen to understand it properly, but it was a really interesting point he made.I have a normal family, no physical or mental abuse between my parents or anything. Well I woke up today to my mom and dad yelling about my constant posting. I get out of my room to see my dad grabbing my computer and trying to toss it into a wall. I didnt even think it was more of an instinct but I ran head first like a human spear into my dads rib cage. Got him on the ground and his wind was already knocked out and started dropping bombs. Normally I would never do this to ANYONE unless I felt threatened but this was unreal to me. It all came to me as instinct. Well my dad has a pretty face now, stopped yelling at me for too much gaming but I dont think this is the end of it. My dad is gone right now but I have no idea what he is planning on doing. I would call the police for our safety but I don't want to get arrested for assault on my father. His face is really messed up and I know the cops wouldnt believe my story over his even though everything I did was fair. I dont know why exactly im posting this here more than just to vent my anger. I dont know what to do anymore. I have always had a good realationship with both parents but after today I feel it is all going to change. Shittt mang, what a way to wake up on a Wed morning. What would Jordan Peterson tell me to do?As far as I know, the Bible does say that monarchs are chosen by god himself, that we must respect the authorities and that we must "honor the emperor", but one of the 10 commandments is saying that we must not kill. Considering that every empire and every nation is built and maintained by killing the enemies of the state, how are the two concepts in accord with each other. How can you respect authorities and honor the emperor by partaking in his offensive wars and how can you not kill your enemies at the same time? Or even how can you be patriotic and kill your enemy in a defensive war and obey the commandment at the same time? Or another commandment about not stealing from others. Wars are filled with armies claiming the spoils of the defeated enemies, virtually every nation has been doing this. 

Is the Bible just another utopian fantasy like Communism? That is my own perception of the Bible, so I would appreciate counter-arguments to explain the contradiction between patriotism and Christianity.For a while now i've been trying to graps my shadow side. I know how much harm i could do if i really wanted to. But i still think i need to go more in to the dark. 

I've been liking the idea of "dangerous men who are civilized" yet i don't know how i or anyone i know would be able to use that for ourselves to grow.

What you think about that statement and how would you graps that around your own life? If you haven't already because then we would like to know how. 

May have misspelling. There's little if anything I disagree with Jordan Peterson about. I'm a fan. I've watched his Biblical lectures and am reading *12 Rules*. It's good critical thinking to see what the opposition to anything has to say, so I spent a little time in the /r/enoughpetersonspam to see what the objections to him were. One objection that keeps coming up Peterson's use of the term "Post-modern NeoMarxist". I'm not sure anybody *but* Peterson understands Post-modernism in the first place.

There will always be a large segment of the population that is so deficient in their *ability to think* that they'll latch on to any ideology that might buy them some power through tribal identification. They'll pervert the ideology to suit their emotional agenda, since they're too stupid to have any real intellectual agenda. If it sounds like I'm being harsh toward stupid people, it is because I am. They're a plague, a cancer on all constructive discourse. Everyone here should familiarize themselves with Dr. Peterson's lecture on IQ. The masses don't know how to talk about IQ nor do they understand it. (2017, Lecture 18, Personality and it's transformations https://youtu.be/D7Kn5p7TP_Y )

So, *currently* the idiots who are polluting public discourse are employing certain aspects of post-modern thought such as the infinity of textual interpretation to justify their attacks on things they don't like. You'll often hear this expressed as "you know, everything is subjective..." which is meant to take away from any facts you may have brought up in your critique of a thing. They've also twisted Feminism, which at it's core is merely the recognition that women need to be treated fairly, and used it to attack anything they don't like as "oppressive" or "coming from a position of privilege". Tomorrow it'll be another as-of-yet-unidentified philosophy. Whatever it is, you can bet that it will be distorted by simpletons so that they can feel better about life, emotionally. 

Critics of Peterson can attack post-modernism or Marxism endlessly, but those are just the nearest referents he's using to describe the low-wattage brains in culture. It's not the post-modern or Marxist thought that made them moronic; they were born vacuous and chose to co-opt various fundamentally flawed systems of thought in order to justify their emotionally fueled speech.

If Peterson just said "stupid people" every time he said "post-modern Neomarxist" he would be technically correct and then critics of his would have to come up with some new avenue of attack other than explaining either Marxism or Post-modernism in a way that makes Peterson seem like his understanding of these topics are in error (It seems as if his understanding of both ideologies is sound, or at the very least coherent). But if he did this, he would be labeled an "elitist". As a strategy, Peterson's critiques of the ideologically possessed would be strengthened if he put greater emphasis on how they *use* post-modernism and Marxism, rather than labeling them as members of a group. It's often the case that those who enact the ideologies don't fully understand the ideas which they are brandishing as weapons. From watching his debates and lectures, he seems to have a pretty central left view on things and dislikes the extremist SJWs. He also says he is a ‚ÄòClassic British Liberal‚Äô. 
On the other hand, news stories and his fan base would consider him alt right and conservative.
Could someone give me a reasonable answer. My "Jordan Peterson" Google Alert is becoming very much a list of uninformed hit pieces.  The SJW mob is mobilized and gunning, hard.  They are shaping the opinions of the 'sleepers' before they get a chance to hear the man.  By pure volume of BS, they will brand him an "alt-right" -ist not worthy of being heard.

JP can't fight this alone! He needs vocal support.  Letters to editors.  Counter-counter protests.    

This is fast becoming a war, and he can't fight it on his own.but then suddenly that voice change @2:23:34 kinda freaked me out

https://youtu.be/__WhjeNBtlE?t=2h23m30sIt'd be cool to compile a list with all the recent promotional interviews for the book all in one place. I've already heard several mentioned here (Rogan, Rubin, Jocko...) but I'm sure I'm missing several.Hi all, I discovered JP about 3 or 4 months ago, and since then I've been seeing his lectures and some other videos about him. There is nothing till now that I disagree with what he says, specially because he grounds everything with studies and logic, and that leaves me worried. Every time I agree almost blindly with someone or some idea, I try to stop, and get to the sources to check if its true or not, and for me, this happening right now, so can you help get the lecture, studies, etc that JP grounds his work? I wan't to be able to get to the same conclusions (or not) with the same info that he as access (if possible). 

I've already seen one study here that goes in the line of what JP says:

Thx for the help!I've been seeing so many people complain about Dr. Peterson's understanding of postmodern doctrine. I recently took a college class on postmodern philosophy and came to realize that very few people actually understand the philosophy.

I'm not going to write up a comprehensive history of philosophy starting from Hegel and Kant, or delve into the intricacies of individual contemporary postmodern thinkers like Derrida, Foucault, et al., since this is not an intellectual exercise. Instead, I'm going to contrast the most important beliefs of enlightenment and postmodern philosophy, since postmodernism is a direct reaction to the former. 

**Enlightenment**

* Knowledge: Objective knowledge is possible. 
* Truth: Universal truths exist independent of individual minds/societies.
* Reason: Reason is used to gain/justify knowledge of the world.

Goal: Progress is made by thinking rationally in relation to objective knowledge.

**Postmodernism**

* Skepticism: It's impossible to have objective knowledge (e.g. our senses are easily fooled). 
* Relativism: No absolute truths. They (the truths) are only social constructs based on gender, race, etc. created for the purposes of power. Language is a big source of oppression. (Structuralist beliefs are a bit more complicated.) 
* Rejection of grand narratives/theories/ideologies: Since postmodernists are relativists, they are opposed to single all-encompassing narratives. (This is humorous since all postmodernists are skewed to particular ideologies but are opposed to religion.) 
* Denial of reason/logocentrism: Reason is used by the powerful to oppress the weak. Emotions/experiences of the oppressed are more valid and grounded in reality than logocentrism. 

Goal: Progress is made by fighting oppression through the exposure of meta-narratives that are used by the powerful to oppress the weak. (Postmodernists love the word hegemony.)  

**Conclusion**

Many people I have encountered online disagree with Dr. Peterson because they don't think that postmodernism is itself a coherent movement (which is true in one sense at least). This is mostly due to postmodernism influencing the thought processes of so many different fields: Literature, architecture, history, feminism, economics, etc. Many think that they are refuting Peterson's understanding of postmodernism by saying "That's not true with regard to postmodern literature, etc." or "X postmodern philosopher didn't think Y so postmodernism does not include Y."  

There's also a tendency to conflate nihilism with postmodernism since it rejects grand narratives. So when Peterson says "Postmodernists believe Y" they counteract this by saying "Postmodernists don't believe in anything." But postmodernism is more a symptom of nihilism if anything and is fueled by ingrained nihilism. 

The driving force behind many postmodern attacks on Peterson is irony because postmodernism is drenched in the stuff. "Why even take this old white guy seriously? He's just part of the oppressive patriarchy." Most of the hit pieces I have read on him consist wholly of unsubstantial, ironic mocking. 

Finally, most people would never consider themselves "postmodern" even though they hold the beliefs of postmodernism in their minds. When they hear Peterson talking about postmodernists, they think he is attacking a phantasm, which in turn makes it easy for him to be criticized. It's really a fish in a fishbowl situation. 

What's my opinion on postmodernism? To borrow a phrase from David Foster Wallace: It's all just "postclever metaformal hooey."

TL;DR: Postmodernism is a direct reaction to enlightenment philosophy. There is no objective reality. Everything is a social construct mediated through language. Anti-grand narratives. Overthrow the oppressors.

This random postmodern paper generator is proof that postmodern academic work is unintelligible. http://www.elsewhere.org/journal/pomo/  

Also check out the book *Fashionable Nonsense* by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont. It's hilariously frightening what they were able to pull off. 

If you want to learn more about postmodernism, pick up some of the philosopher's books. But I have to warn you, it's almost all nearly impossible to read without reference guides. I would have never known what postmodernism is on my own without taking a class on it tbh.Does anyone know of any responses that credibly argue against the views of Dr. Peterson? I am especially interested in any arguments against his idea of "the marxist lie of white privilege". I have yet to find any.  Any articles/videos are appreciated. Thank you.Before discovering the doc, I always wondered why [Shit Reddit Says](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/) bothered me so much. I would only visit occasionally, but every time I did, I found myself repulsed by many of the posts I found. 

Their motto: "Free speech is a disease, and we are the cure" particularly bothered me. At first I thought "Oh, they're trying to be provocative and get a rise out of people." But after delving deeper, it became clear that many of the users there are DEAD SERIOUS about that mission. 

But how could that be? 

After listening to a few of Dr. Peterson's lectures, I had a minor epiphany. At the center of SRS is a rotten core of pure, unadulterated resentment. It's a group of people that look at their meager station in life and do nothing but lash out and blame others. It's the nihilistic wish to burn everything to the ground in the face of inequality. It's a place where the animus-possessed mob congregates to fuel their dark revenge fantasies.

Anyway, if you're ever curious about the unbounded capacity for human resentment, check out that subreddit.But what are some suggestions for improvement in regard to my personality? What are some pitfalls that someone with my results are likely to fall into?

Why is the cryptocurrency market dominated by men? 

I have been asking myself this question for a short while now. There are no social impediments to getting started. In fact, there are absolutely no parts in the process of investing that would display any form of social restriction.

a)	The only two tools that you need to invest are the internet and your own capital.
 
b)	This market is extremely new, which means one could not argue that historically women have been shunned away from investing in cryptos.

c)	Besides creating an account on the exchange of your choice, much of what an investor does is anonymous. Nobody is going out there exposing their names (and genders), what people care about is who makes the most profit (so that they can follow this person).

[So why is it that we can see a divide of as much as 96%/4% (men and women) in the crypto demographic surveys?](https://coin.dance/stats/gender)

Other sources on the demographics [1](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bitcoin-s-gender-divide-could-be-a-bad-sign-experts-say-1.4458884) [2](https://twitter.com/myetherwallet/status/921579075897933824) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6xm8oo/the_big_ethereum_survey_the_results/) I've been trying to find a video clip, it's from one of JP's earlier lectures. I deals with being the person people rely on at your father's funeral. 

Does anyone know where to find it? I haven't had much luck. When asked:

"Are you a Christian? Do you believe in God?"

He replied: "I think the proper response to that is No, but I‚Äôm afraid He might exist."


This why I never understood why people call him a Christian. I don't think he believes in a Supernatural existence like the Christian tradition says.

Thoughts?

Exceptionally low Consciousness (0th Industrious, 9th orderliness).  
42nd Neuroticism - very high withdrawl, very low volatility.  
Pretty average for the rest.

Admittedly, low C fits me like a glove. ADHD symptoms for most of my life, underachiever, easily distracted, chronic procrastinator.  

What I'm reluctant to accept though is low industriousness meaning I'm not judgemental to myself or others, because I am. Very much so.  High withdrawl, high anticipatory anxiety, plus guilt for not doing the things I'm anxious about. 

Any thoughts?Something puzzles me a bit: Peterson &amp; Co. really highlight the Individual - and I get that, and I get what they are reacting to in Marxism and in Postmodernism.¬†¬†Fine.¬†¬†But it‚Äôs puzzling why there is, so far as I have heard, no role for the culture or community.¬†¬†It was really painfully obvious when he spent so much time in the biblical series, on Cain and Able, and never mentioned one of the most important lines in the little story, the question of Cain, to God, ‚ÄúAm I my brother‚Äôs keeper?‚Äù¬†¬†Clearly not getting that the answer is and must be ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù was a huge part of Cain‚Äôs moral failure.¬†¬†But that was missed.¬†¬†Similarly, in the conversation with Rubin, Petersen mentioned that as a psychologist, his focus was the individual.¬†¬†OK, but I know that he must know all about the huge impact of ‚Äúfamily systems theory‚Äù in psychology - that people live in systems, and if the system is toxic or dysfunctional, then the individual is going to be continually affected negatively.¬†¬†And the same is true in society.¬†¬†In fact, the very existence of a Marxist society makes it really hard for the individual.¬†¬†Anyway, it seems that there is an aversion to talking about the effects of the group lest someone start saying the V word (victim).¬†¬†Maybe the pendulum is swinging quite far the opposite way.It seems that Dr. Peterson is fundamentally right in many ways, but what I think he wants to reveal is ultimately "Truth through Effort". What does this mean on a societal and archetypal level? Well, it basically means that while a tiger's primary mechanism for survival is it's teeth and claws, the species evolves to enlarge-and make more efficient-those traits. For humans, our primary mechanism for survival is our brain and intellect (our eons-long struggle with truth), thus meaning the human species evolves to make the brain more productive and efficient to realize the truth. 

In the Twelve Rules, the underlying theme is that individuals are made more put together when putting a constant effort and thought into their own lives, even the most simple task of organizing (making your bed, cleaning your room, telling the truth, etc.). This wets the stone that sharpens the blade of the mind. This means that while the individual human acts and makes mistakes, they will ultimately correct the mistakes that do not "work" if they are constantly sorting themselves out. 

Individuals are-as they should be-throwing things at the wall to see what sticks.

The wall in this metaphor is truth, and things being thrown at it are efforts to see what material is viable (sticks) with the truth. Dr. Peterson is simply showing through his lectures on the bible and myth that even though the truths are not empirical, they still stick to the wall. What is not viable in today's society that is present in ancient texts (such as not eating shellfish or pork) do not stick. Society has become more efficient in seeking the truth through constant effort, analysis, and re-analysis; of what has stuck 

Marxism does not stick, fascism does not stick, tyranny does not stick. Postmodernism attempts to say that any and all interpretations can stick (which is false, as JBP says). 

TL:DR (and conclusion) - Truth through effort. Seeing what sticks to the truth requires constant effort, and postmodernism is dangerous as it wants to devalue and say that the effort is meaningless, ultimately leading us astray from the truth.

Please feel free to chime in, this is my first long Reddit post.I'm halfway through a BA in political science and was hoping to become a professor but the job market for political science professors is insane ( [not to mention the expected decline of universities in general](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/15/hbs-professor-half-of-us-colleges-will-be-bankrupt-in-10-to-15-years.html) ).  I'm considering working for research institute or consulting but I'm not too familiar with either nor do I know how I would get into them.  I was wondering what jobs you guys think I might be able to do well in.  Here are my IQ and Understand Myself scores:

WAIS-IV: 123
Verbal:127
Perceptual Reasoning: 111
Working Memory: 111
Processing Speed: 126

Big Five:
Agreeableness: 71%
Conscientiousness: 3%
Extraversion: 16%
Neuroticism: 64%
Openness: 95% I have been wanting to use the suite self-authoring suite code for quite some time. I fell onto some hard times and was unable to work for a while as a result of a serious medical issue that left me hospitalized (and temporarily paralyzed) for almost a month. Thankfully I was able to recover and am nearly back to 100%. I still have some medical debt left from it though, hence the program sitting in my for about 3 months, and have not yet been able to bring myself to pull the trigger with so many other financial obligations on my plate. 

If anyone has an extra code, I would sure appreciate it if someone was wiling to share. If not, no worries though. I definitely see the value in it and will hopefully be able to save up from work in a little while. I see little as more important than investing in one's future and having creating one's own clear path.  

What is his opinion?I am not a university student, but I am eager to learn more about this landscape.

From what I gleaned, postmoderism asserts that "everything is a social construct mediated through language".

Fair enough idea, except that how do you think language arose in the organized (and/or hierarchal) system that it did?

I remember JP mentioning something in one of his lecturers saying that 'is there such a thing as 'up'" (he was referring to divinity and/or transcendence)

How can words mean nothing when clearly they are based off of "objective truths?"https://youtu.be/WHZjcfgk4CI?t=17m18sAgent Smith: Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization.

In reference to this, think "Men are not piano keys"!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97jBvbmY03gI just did the test, I got 13 Agreeableness, 2 Conscientiousness, 0 Extraversion, 98 Neuroticism and 15 Openess. I know having a high N makes everything a bit skewed, but this honestly surprised me, since I felt like I was improving. I don‚Äôt know what to think of this. I almost feel beyond hope.Does anyone know of such a lecture or opinion by Peterson? I was recently figuring out the difference between the two but I'm wondering whether there is actual phycological difference.
How far do you think online relationships can go? And again, can they be as strong as the ones that have been started online?I'm trying to work out if completing the Self Authoring program will help me with my career.  I don't actually have one and never have (I'm 42!) I've constantly 'worked' but never in anything I love. I struggle with issues surrounding working 'for the man' and cannot determine what I would like to do as a meaningful career.  Everytime ive discussed communism with someone whos pro C and knows more than me i get a replies like;

"Yeah your ideas of socialism and communism are a bastardized representation and im not doing this when you dont know anything"

Or

"I hate state dervied communism, thats not what is meant to happen"

As far as im concerned, i dont need to know all the nuance involved as i believe it to be utterly incompatible with human nature and can only be set up by force. One example that gets pushed is the anarcho communist system that got set up in Spain before the spanish civil war.

Can anyone suggest some good sources of information on this particular spanish example or enlighten me about it ?

Edit: im posting here as i dont think ill get proper replies in either capitalist or communist subs and i want to have the evidence to back up my points.Hey guys and gals, 

I have just speed read through the article: Mindfulness, Big Five personality, and affect: A meta-analysis. It does a meta analysis of the construct 'mindfulness' on personality traits. Specifically of interest may be table 1 in this article. It shows that mindfulness has a positive relationship with conscientiousness, openness, extraversion, agreeableness and positive Affect and has a negative relationship with Negative affect and Neuroticism. Of course you can debate in which direction the causality runs. i.e. whether people that already have these traits are more mindful, or whether people who become more mindful also change their personality traits. Furthermore, you can debate how to develop 'mindfulness'. 

I would like to share my experience with regards to mindfulness retreats. In total I have been on 2 10 day vipassana retreats. The first one was quite pleasant. I found that I became a lot more serious in my life. Woke up between 5-6 AM, went to the gym, took my uni seriously, started 2 bachelors degrees and quit the fraternity I was a part of. The second time was a lot harder, however it made me more problem solving focussed and made me take a little more rest in my life. So these retreats definitely helped me 'sort' out my life!

Within a few months ill be going for my third retreat. I feel like  I need this since after my graduation (and during the final part of my studies) I've been feeling scatterbrained and without a real sense of direction. So I am hoping to get this from both my backpacking trip and the retreat!

As a challenge I would like to invite you to go on a similar retreat. Since many people have complaints about not having 'the right personality traits' sufficiently on this thread, this may be of help and I am curious as to how you experience it!

Happy meditating!


PS: Yes, I know JBP calls mindfulness meditation a fad. However, quite a bit of research shows that it can positively influence you, so I don't really know where this stems from.https://escapefromorbit.wordpress.com/2018/02/08/secular-faith/

I‚Äôm an agnostic and I‚Äôd be lying if sometimes I was never dismayed by the fact that Jordan likes to talk about religion and sometimes even faith, because it‚Äôs like, how do we relate to that and how does it help us? I don‚Äôt believe in God. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm even capable of it. I spent a couple of days pondering that question and here is the result. Hope it‚Äôs at least thought provoking.Every other clip on youtube is a new JBP appearance.  Please make it stop.  Can't wait for the Peterson bubble to pop and everyone can see what a charlatan he is.Let me begin by saying I'm one of those evil misogynists who posts on /r/theredpill  - [Example](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/77drrs/the_consequences_of_men_failing_society_wide_shit/)

As a group, I would like us to try and unpack what Peterson said about men and women working together in the workplace. [Here](https://twitter.com/classiclib3ral/status/961461529555210240) is what he said for anybody interested. Yes, I'm sure there's additional context to what he said in that clip that's being left out.

Here are the points I would like to make, and I was wondering what all your thoughts are on this.

- Trying to maximise your appearance involves trying to make yourself look more attractive. When you're in the workplace, you want to maximise your appearance. The company wants clients to see clean and professional looking people. It helps you make sales. It helps leave a more positive impression on people you're networking with.

- Men maximise their appearance in the workplace also (generally speaking). Makeup amplifies feminine features and so it (usually) doesn't do men much good. But men still trim their beards,  get nice haircuts, possibly wear cologne, wear suits that help give an impression of having broader shoulders and more of a v-shape etc.

- Yes, women wearing heels and makeup make them more physically attractive, but the things men wear also make them look more physically attractive, so perhaps these cancel each other out. Some may argue that women put in more effort to look good and they should instead only put in as much effort as men. 

- Islam makes their women wear burqa's which we all agree is ridiculous. Yes, I'm aware that Peterson isn't arguing that women should wear burga's. He is, however, suggesting that we need to have a discussion about how women dress at work. This is one step away from telling women what they should and shouldn't wear. Based on gut reaction alone, I don't like the idea of that. Yes, there are workplace policies and social norms that people should abide by that relate to how you should present yourself. I recognise that whilst simultaneously having that negative gut reaction to this. 

- If you live in a bad neighbourhood and you leave your house door unlocked constantly, that would be pretty silly of you. If you were to get robbed, it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for somebody to point out how silly it was for you to leave your door unlocked. However, social interactions are 1000x nuanced then these sort of crimes. Men and women *do* have to interact with each other, it's perfectly fine to try and make yourself look more attractive, so this issue isn't black and white at all. 

- Women are the selectors. They decide who gets to propagate their genes and who doesn't. When Justin Bieber goes onto a talk show, the women in the audience lose their minds with excitement. When Keira Knightley goes onto a talk show, the men just sit and clap. Women view the top percent of men with reverence, but the corollary to that is that they view the bottom percent of men with disdain. They must be ruthless in this way to ensure only the right men procreate. Most men aren't reared properly and as a consequence they have the behavioural traits that indicate low status and a low position in the dominance (competence) hierarchy. As such, women as a whole are viewing men as a whole with disdain. Hence, all this discussion regarding rape/assault/harassment. Read more about this point [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/77drrs/the_consequences_of_men_failing_society_wide_shit/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7hgp7c/until_the_rivers_run_red/)
 
- If you read those two links I posted in my previous point, you'll see that I think this rampant sexual harassment hysteria is a direct result of men not acting right. If anybody got a chance to read those, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

- [Perhaps we should just have an annual harassment day instead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eAU0EadxEc)

In any case, I didn't quite agree with Peterson's suggestive questions surrounding these issues. I would love to see a big, hopefully civil, discussion surrounding his comments though. 

Fire away. 


 Since he talks a lot about the horrors of totalitarianism, and of humans as fallen and imperfect creatures, I would think he‚Äôs very attuned to the dangers of ‚Äúhubris‚Äù and Utopianism.  So I‚Äôm confused by his (frequent) references in 12 Rules to ‚Äúsaving‚Äù or ‚Äúperfecting‚Äù the world, and creating heaven on earth. 

Is there a video where he addresses this paradox directly? Peterson's rejection of identity politics makes no sense in the face of a program of diversification reducing Whites to a minority while fuelling the inherently collectivist identities of non-Whites.Leaving the cave for the higher plateau of realization wasn't a group/communal/organized or even "fun" event. This suggests that the modern university, with all its social engineering and collectivism, is not in the tradition of Plato's and Greek/Western philosophy. Professors, graduate students, and life-long-learners, not undergrads who are paying $$$ for indoctrination and "fun", are more similar to the man who left the cave because they learn on their own. They are doing the daunting work of breaking their own shackles and moving toward the garish light. Jordan Peterson and his supporters seem to fit in this category, roughly speaking.Is there a succinct, actionable list of things to do to move up the dominance hierarchy as JBP calls it?Disclaimer; All you armchair feminists, this post is not advocating for no makeup its simply about the why women wear makeup in the first place. Women can do whatever the fuck they wan't no one is saying wearing makeup is a bad thing either, but being aware of the subconscious reasons for doing so might help.

I think the whole " I wear makeup for myself" is the biggest load of bullshit I have to always hear, all the time. 

Its a good thing that JP brought this out into the open. The fact that women wear makeup to make themselves attractive to OTHERS, not themselves. This is something that always pissed me off and I am so glad JP said it, it just shows that this man is committed to the truth and not afraid to say things no matter how controversial they are. And I can bet my ineternet cred and say it that he is going to be flooded massively by hit pieces using this as leverage against him. 

Fuck it feels soo satisfying that a well an academic psychologist actually said what I have been thinking ever since I was a teenager. 

There are soo many lies we hear on a daily basis that we know is bullshit but we let it slide anyways, The fact that there is a man like JP out there speaking the truth at such a level gives my life meaning.

The above quote is in Rule #5, pg. 135 in *12 Rules For Life.*


Dammit Jordan, you say the literature is clear on this, but no footnotes or citations are given at this point in the book.  I want to know more!  Anyone know where to find this literature?


On a personal note, this gets my attention because it maps on to my life.  I struggled, *massively,* throughout school years and I wonder just what the hell was going on in my unconscious 2-4 years age period.This is such an obvious trick of editing, how is it people around here are falling for it?

Obviously his comment was something along the lines of. 

Banning hugging, what next why not ban make-up. 

That is if you were extreme enough to follow this abzurd line of thinking. 

You can be sure JP will be saying exactly that in the next few hours, but in the mean time don't fall for such an obvious edit.

With this test that Jordan Peterson created, which is a really good assessment by the way, I remember hearing him say that each sub-traits from the Big Five NEO IPIP (6 from each major traits) can be summed up in two facets for each trait of the Big Five personality

That's why I feel like I have to deal with with the description given to each facet result according to your percentile scores, either low or moderately high and that sort of thing

Okay now I must confess something I didn't really take the assessment, however I've took the one on workcoach and see in which categories each percentile I got on each traits would fall in by watching videos of Youtuber having taken the test

And now that I had a sight of it, let's see what's good and what's wrong with those descriptions

The description globally match the percentile, I've took the time to watch all the new videos on the self assessment report and while most of them were astonished it was merely by the result in percentile and not always the description given to it !
(Note : For example the amount of disagreeable people on YouTube hit the roof, and most of theses asshole don't even realize)

The description given to each score on the trait was globally accepted with still some relutance at certain point, because what Peterson and the other psychologist in charge of the creation of the project were trying to properly separate each level of dimension. For example someone moderately low in compassion at 38th percentile will simply not have the same description as someone who scored 41th percentile, who will be categorize as average, tho the difference is just about one question at this level.

And that same person might have fewer chance to agree on the global description than a moderately low person scoring at 23th percentile, and yet moderately low

So these are the flaws I wanted to point out because I was left really confuse by some elements of the description, they were relevant enough to pick up my atttention.

To explain that I've simply looked at the original version of the Big Five, the NEO IPIP ! Because 6 facets were avalaible (tho 6 was an arbitrary number to begin with) for each traits, and so I guessed Jordan Peterson and his colleague working on the assessment simply put depending on your percentile what could be the most relevant and general information you can have about your rating score defining by so the category to which your scores belongs, comparing to the global population. Having reduce it to 2 facets for each traits, the description is way bigger and some elements are true, while some are less, because we could subdivised each trait several time but what the point ? The advantages of having a general description is to be able to pick up you will say 

Just to say the more you disagree with your description, the fewer chances are you're not really on that category, OR AT LEAST, your waving toward the one upper or below while remaining in that category.

For example, let's not take the one little bastard you see on every youtube comment section hating who obviously score negative percentile on agreeableness, but someone moderately low.

37th percentile in compassion, man you're close to the average range

The description might feel a little wrong to you while you can accept that score more or less

Take someone at 27th percentile and chances are he'll recognize himself better in the description than the one at 37th 

Just to say that nuances occurs at a greater level I honestly think, please tell me in the comments if you share the same impression. Thanks for reading !
This is a genuine question, I'm hoping I can get some discussion out of it. Is there some sense in which group terms such as "postmodernists" still refer to individuals without generalisation?Isn't the oedipal situation when Son gets his way over everything, and dominates the mother-and she does everything for him. But Crumb's Mom - The Crumb brothers are all like scared puppies around her. They don't raise their voice, her word is final and she dominates everyone and situations. How is she an oedipal mother? I would be grateful if somebody helps me understand.Been very interested in this idea and would like to know where I could find this and what the paragraph in this particular book says precisely, as I'm also writing an essay for school for which I'll probably need this argument.

Trying this here because I've learnt that Nietzsche thought/said this from Jordan Petersons biblical lectures, I believe. :)

Anyone of you intellectual folks that could help me out?Hey guys

So I've seen some videos of Jordan Peterson talking about saying the truth. I didn't really understand what he meant. Did he mean to tell all the truth?

I have a small problem. Never kissed a girl. Lost my virginity to a prostitute. And as an 18 year old guy I get asked a lot the question if I'm a virgin. I keep lying because I am ashamed of telling people about the prostitute thing. What do you think? It's been bothering me a lot that secret.

Hey there Lobsterheads!  This fellow, Matthew Facciani, has expressed interest in debating JBP by proxy.  YOU are the proxy.  Your challenge is to win the debate with fact based arguments in the space below. Most upvoted wins. Good luck!
Hi
I want to ask a question to Peterson about religion and Darwinism. I'm a religious person and do strongly think that the Darwinism Evolution is accurate. My mind stumbles on one question "How to make Darwinism and religion compatible if we assume God created Adam and Eve ?". Peterson is a Christian and mentions a lot about the evolution and how the chimpanzees are our ancestors. I tried to message him on Twitter but couldn't find the button "Message" on his profile. I watched his lectures but can't watch all of them. Maybe you guys have the answer, or let me know a way to contact him on the question about Adam &amp; Eve and Darwinism.
Have a nice day. I'm not talking about the use of pronouns or government forced speech. What are his views on how it should be treated?

I'm just curious why doctors chose to treat it by changing the outward appearance instead of researching the brain and treating that.

From what I read so far we just have no idea how the brain develops identity, so surgery is just a more immediate "fix".

Also what are the ethical implications when we do discover how the brain develops gender identity and we can make the brain "match" the body's sex. Would this group of transgenders dissappear? Would it be considered wrong to say "I don't want my child to be transgendered".I ordered some take out for my evening at the beach, and the lady who operates the restaurant asked me if I was in touch with anyone who could help her out with hiring temps!

Then we had a long discussion about how people around here are lazy!

She seemed to trust me to be competent, and it probably had something to do with my posture!&gt;There are allegations that the United States (U.S.) supported the Khmer Rouge during the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War in order to weaken the influence of Vietnam and the Soviet Union in Southeast Asia. Details of alleged U.S. actions that benefited the Khmer Rouge range from tolerating Chinese and Thai aid to the organization (Henry Kissinger) to directly arming the Khmer Rouge (Michael Haas). The U.S. government officially denies these claims, and Nate Thayer defended U.S. policy, arguing that little, if any, American aid actually reached the Khmer Rouge. However, it is not disputed that the U.S. voted for the Khmer Rouge and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), which included the Khmer Rouge, to retain Cambodia's United Nations (UN) seat until 1982 and 1991, respectively.[1][2][3] Furthermore, an investigation by the United States Department of State acknowledged that U.S. material support for the Khmer Rouge's CGDK partners indirectly benefited the Khmer Rouge.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_United_States_support_for_the_Khmer_Rouge


&gt;The most damaging element, for Britain at least, of Ta Mok's court appearance will be new evidence about how British troops and diplomats helped the Khmer Rouge in their fight for power.


&gt;The Khmer Rouge and their allies were fighting against the Vietnamese-backed puppet regime Hanoi had installed after ousting Pol Pot's extremist Communists and exposing the horrors of the killing fields.

&gt;In a classic piece of Cold War realpolitik, Britain - prompted by the Americans - appears to have given military assistance to the Khmer Rouge-led coalition, despite knowing of Pol Pot's atrocities, in an attempt to limit the power of the Soviet-backed Vietnamese.

Was anyone on this thread there at the lecture in New York where the guy who asked the first question about the possibility of Jews using their positions of power to exact revenge on Europe and Russia for kicking them out? First of all just typing it out makes me *shocked* that someone could be so misguided and stupid to ask that question. Further, what was the answer to the UFO question. How many other wackadoos got up and asked stupid stuff. I just wanna see the Jordan Peterson Thug Life video where he just goes WRONG. DISPROVEN. Like NO. Greetings fellow Redditers!

I‚Äôve recently come across Jordan Peterson. I have a friend who whatches PewDiePie and recommended Jordan.

I haven‚Äôt bought 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos yet, but i‚Äôm watching some of his lectures.

I‚Äôve recently read Mark Manson‚Äôs The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, and Sapiens, a brief History of Humankind, from Yuval Noah Harari. I highly recommend the latter, it‚Äôs a brief pass trough history, through the eyes of an acclaimed Historian, mixing our Biology and events in History. It makes you reflect upon certain aspects of life.

Now on to the topic
I have purchased the  ‚ÄúThe Big Five Aspects Scale‚Äù of the website understand myself recently.
This are my results:
    ‚Ä¢ Agreeableness 54th Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Compassion 36th Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Politeness 71st Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Conscientiousness 66th Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Industriousness 44th Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Orderliness 80th Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Extraversion 53rd Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Enthusiasm 53rd Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Assertiveness 52nd Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Neuroticism 50th Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Withdrawal 62nd Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Volatility 38th Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Openness to Experience 8th Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Openness 10th Percentile
    ‚Ä¢ Intellect 14th Percentile

I believe all of the above results are well within what i expected, average is my middle name. The only discrepancy I see is the low levels of openness to experience, they should have been somewhere between 40th to 60th Percentile. Although sometimes I have a hard time understanding abstract ideas, on the other hand I am very curious, I consume knowledge on a daily basis, via Youtube, reading, news information, etc‚Ä¶ I have a hard time conveying my ideas to others, specially if i‚Äôm talking to authoritative person, less so if I feel comfortable with the person. I‚Äôm not known for my lack of vocabulary, it‚Äôs the other way around (I‚Äôm Portuguese).
Openness or how the website describes has creativity, I agree, sometimes I wish I think more outside of the box. I‚Äôm highly imaginative altough, I used to write a lot on sci-fi or fantasy short stories has a kid/teen. I find most art boring, specially painting, and ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù. But I enjoy music, specially Rock and Metal! I get immersed a lot reading and watching movies/Tv Series. 

What are your thoughts on the UnderstandMyself website. Should I see my results with a pinch of salt, or should I question my beliefs. Perhaps i‚Äôm not so good at judging myself. And the answers I gave were not accurate. Perhaps I can‚Äôt trust anything in fact (Neuroticism rising!)

Thanks for reading, have a nice day!I'm just curious. I'd like to watch a video where the "other side" presents potentially overlooked aspects of its position to JBP and the two just talk about them. For the number of interviews JBP has given, I'm somewhat surprised that I haven't come across an interview of this sort yet. It seems like something he would be game for.

I know about the TVO clip with Nicolas Matte, but A) that's not really much of a conversation, and B) I refuse to think that Matte is the best spokesman for... gender studies, postmodernism, idk?

On the whole, I'm on board with JBP's concerns regarding the hazardous, even dangerous effects of a postmodern (or at least pseudo-postmodern) ideology. I'd just like to see him interacting with an informed, non-ideologue that has some appreciation for postmodernism.Someone on 4chan has been saying Jordan has Alzheimer's for several days, and you can see certain twitches in videos that reveal this.  He's making a video apparently "that will destroy him!!!".  This person sounded a little unhinged but I guess that's the next attack.-edit- 
Sorry can't change the title. This is not the place I realized to ask career related question. 
Check my profile if you'd like to read up on some of the issues occupying my attention.

Another issue (that might be related to my disastrous career) that I've been wrestling with for a while now is that there seem to be two versions of me battling it out for my conscious attention. I became aware of this 'other me' through an experience with Ayahausca (first ever experience with psychedelics). It showed me that the anxiety-ridden Me I was identified with so strongly (Ego) wasn't the 'real me', a real shock to my whole sense of being. The ayahausca trip itself was very hard, it was trying to kill my Ego and I resisted with my whole body trying to escape this feeling of certain death. Eventually I gave up fighting it and I saw and experienced God itself .... 
I did it for a second time within a few weeks and this was a bad idea, I was expecting answers related to what career to choose and it gave a much more terrifying reality bending trip, this time it was traumatic beyond comprehension. I might add that the setting was not ideal either, it was with a large group (+50 people) which stirred up my social anxiety and made flailing around like a epileptic trying to escape those judgemental gazes .... but those weren't gazes of judgement but genuine concern. It exposed a deep rooted issue I've been battling with, toxic SHAME. I was conditioned this way to feel shame for being myself. My parents told me to hide my strong artistic Self because people might not accept it. It resulted in me having random jobs while fantasizing about an artistic career while on the job.

Integrating these experiences took many months of heavy internal turmoil, but I eventually let it go slowly with spiritual practice (meditation, yoga, reading). Now I can walk into a crowded bar on my own and make friends with complete strangers and dance with pretty women while everyone is watching with amazement. This is the 'Real Me' at work, but my nervous anxiety ridden old Ego is constantly lurking around the corner seeing danger in every gaze or remark, even at work. If I don't stay conscious it get's the best of me and makes me act in very nervous validation-seeking ways. It shuts up when I'm a bit High on weed, in strong meditation or after hard excercise. How do I get rid of this 'Old Me' /Ego ?.

People who know me closely say there is a huge difference between the current Me and the one I was say 4years ago, like night and day. I realize now that  the 'old Me' wasn't the 'Real Me' to begin with, it was just a result of a very disfunctional upbringing and unsatisfying life living in the shadow of other people I considered better than me.

&gt;'Puers Aeturnus' can often dissociate from work too. They are physically present and do what is expected but not mentally there. So it's better if Puers learn to actually for once in there life be involved wholeheartedly in work. But that's difficult because Puers often keep the back door open, so they can leave anytime. But I guess Puers can learn to do this.Ôªø

This quote describes my workethic quite precisely. When I was let go a few days ago my manager said 'you do your job but you always seem somewhere else'. Well if it's not a job that gives those 8 hours a sense of meaning or growth, then yes I'm not completely there. I pity my coworkers doing "hello this is IT helpdesk how may I help you ?" to support their family's while their on the brink of being fired after 20yrs of dedicated service. 

I've learned a lot of things from watching and listening to Jordans lectures and the videos of his arguments with annoying and obnoxious people, his way of dealing with such people is just amazing. He remains calm whatever he talks about, and the effect it has on people is very satisfying. I tested the approach myself in various situations where I would remain calm and speak eloquently no matter the topic, and it drives the other person absolutely crazy! Their goal from the beginning is to stress you out and to hurt you with the words (if it's an actual argument not a debate or a discussion) and when you show that the things they say do not get to you in any way, they cannot accomplish their goal and get really really angry and it's so satisfying just to see someone lose their mind trying to insult you and get to you when they just can't. Amazing.I had a discussion with two sociologists and they claimed that intelligence IQ is mostly determined by socialization... I am looking for reliable research on the topic.(*Jordan Peterson is a prick, to be quite honest.*)

My reply: Not as big as Castro or Lenin.

(*I just started seeing his videos on youtube. I didn't really dive into it very far cause after the first one I scoffed a bit at him, but is he really this bad? Not asking this in defense of him, I've just only seen a few of his psychology videos.*)

My reply: Listen h3h3 podcast and make your own mind.

(*He is transphobic, misogynistic, and a supporter of patriarchy and Western hegemony. What is there to like?*)

My reply: He is all that if your sensibility ISO is 3200.I would like to introduce a friend to JBP but am not sure which video would be the best one to show him first. I would really appreciate suggestions! Does anyone else find it weird that Peterson is constantly confused with being , variously, a christian,  a Christian fundamentalist, a religious nut,  a Christian nut who wants to bring back medieval Christianity etc etc ( I've heard variations of all these views expressed by people all over the place).

It's as if any mention or psychological analysis of Christian traditions, Christian myths, the value of religious myth etc, in any context, automatically triggers people into assuming the speaker is a Christian. 

I mention this because it seems to me that Peterson is obviously secular/atheistic through and through, though not necessarily in the same unsophisticated way as Dawkuns, Hitchens or Harris.
I've been sharing one study I found all over the place here, but I thought maybe we could do a little collecting of some studies and have a conversation about sex, gender, power dynamics, sexual harassment, "the rules" and LIPSTICK.

I'll start us off with two studies I found:

http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijps/article/viewFile/15080/11738

http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034607*continuation of quote*: 

&gt; ... when, guided by their own insight or inspiration, they seek the right way of dealing with the forces of the inner life. Ceremonial, ritual, initiation rites and ascetic practices, in all their forms and variations, interest me profoundly as so many techniques for bringing about a proper relation to these forces. I likewise attribute a positive value to biology, and to the empiricism of natural science in general, in which I see a herculean attempt to understand the human psyche by approaching it from the outer world. I regard the gnostic religions as an equally prodigious undertaking in the opposite direction: as an attempt to draw knowledge of the cosmos from within. In my picture of the world there is a vast outer realm and an equally vast inner realm; between these two stands man, facing now one and now the other, and, according to his mood or disposition, taking the one for the absolute truth by denying or sacrificing the other.

&gt;- Carl Jung, *Modern Man in Search of a Soul*im starting to feel like ill never be articulate and able to really think :(( what do i do , any wise words?I watched the 10 minute clip on YouTube, I don't know if that's the full piece, but I don't think I really get what people are so upset about.  With the exception of the interviewer's uncomfortableness in questioning his own beliefs, which is understandable, Vice didn't paint him into a corner that I can see.I've decided to try and tell the truth as much as I can. There are two factors in my way of this pursuit.

To give an example, if my boss asks me If I knew who the person who did something wrong is, and I did, but they're a friend of mine, am I really supposed to be honest there? Can I really sell my friend out for the sake of sticking to my ideal?

Its just one example of a moral dilemma that I'm trying to work out.

Another is, what If It's a lie that I need to tell to keep my livelihood, and telling the truth will possibly get me in big trouble? But if I work hard, this lie will eventually become the truth, I just have to keep it up for a while longer, while I work hard to reach that goal. In the meantime, the lie isn't really hurting anyone, just helping me keep my livelihood. 

I know, I'm making it sound way more complicated than it is. This is something I am actually going through atm, I'm sorry that I can't get more specific.

Can anybody help me work this out?

Am I allowed these "necessary lies"?

Or will even one taint everything.

Thank you.STOP FUCKING POSTING MEMES HERE.

POST MEMES ON THE MEME SUB

IF YOU KEEP POSTING MEMES HERE IT WILL DEVOLVE AND WE WON'T HAVE A PUBLIC FORUM TO ACTUALLY DISCUSS IMPORTANT TOPICS

THANKS, BUCKOSHe's the new Mr.Rogers for the men who were raise by women who remember watching Mr.Rogers as a child. He's the dad we've all been yearning for. 

There's a couple of links on this article, most specifically the link to the Radio 5 interview where he's brought to tears talking about all the men who have thanked him. His humility and gratitude is staggering.

https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/jordan-peterson-is-helping-disillusioned-boys-become-men.-heres-why-liberal

Mr.Rogers helped us navigate childhood, JP is ushering us through a rediscovery of manhood. Hello guys, i have an extra self authoring suite; i bought the two in one and don't have anyone to share it with. So i would like to give it to some who needs some help and is going through a rough phase but cant spare to spend money on the program. Please shoot me a message with your story and how it would help you, and by the way i think i would be fair if its is a first come first serve basis. Thanks guys. 

edit: hey guys i have already given the program to a guy who reached out here, anyways thanks to all who replied and carry on brothers.I'm trying to understand how to interact with people on facebook as it is completely different, near as I can tell, with how one interacts with people in-person. I can't seem to find any good comprehensive articles that are a sort of "how-to" guide for facebook aside from technical things such as "this is how you block someone" or some such similar and equally banal thing. I'm more concerned with navigating the unique social environment. I finally realized that my reasons for not using facebook, while being reasonable objections as far as they go, were ultimately just further disconnecting me from the world around me. But I find it all terribly perplexing. For example, I recently had a friend request sent to me by someone I 100% have never met but is friends with someone I do know. Consequently that friend request is in limbo because I have no idea what unforeseen consequences might result from accepting it. I suppose this might be some of the (so called) fun but I generally like to know as much as I can before I take action. What I can't figure out are reasons why someone might do this. In some sense I suppose it is an informal introduction as one might experience with friends of friends in-person. Except this particular type of introduction lacks precisely that, and is also not, in-person. So I thought this was really primarily a social psychology question. Forgive me if this is an incorrect conclusion and therefore the wrong place to post this. It's seemed 'inappropriate' in just about every other reddit thread I could think of. I even got my post auto-removed for essentially the same post in r/facebook. 

TL;DR: But to circle back to the question in the title, are there any good articles or suggested reading that might shed some light on the psychology of what is going on here and help guide me a bit. Also, any articles or just even user suggestions on tips, tricks and/or pitfalls to avoid?  

Either way, thanks for you help and comments or even just your time reading.
(What Im doing is applying the same logic of the ideological, political propaganda that is common here, and reversing it because I like to be contrarian and challenge group think).

EDIT - Im not a communist or an apologist for wrong doing by Stalin.

Most communists are highly critical of Stalins wrong doing, except for the "tankies". I put it to this forum that you are "tankies" for capitalism.


&gt;For example, if a government cuts education funding, universality is impaired, and therefore long-term economic growth. Similarly, cuts to health programs have allowed[citation needed] diseases such as AIDS to devastate some areas' economies by destroying the workforce. A 2009 book by Rick Rowden entitled The Deadly Ideas of Neoliberalism: How the IMF has Undermined Public Health and the Fight Against AIDS claims that the IMF's monetarist approach towards prioritizing price stability (low inflation) and fiscal restraint (low budget deficits) was unnecessarily restrictive and has prevented developing countries from being able to scale up long-term public investment as a percentage of GDP in the underlying public health infrastructure. The book claims the consequences have been chronically underfunded public health systems, leading to dilapidated health infrastructure, inadequate numbers of health personnel, and demoralizing working conditions that have fueled the "push factors" driving the brain drain of nurses migrating from poor countries to rich ones, all of which has undermined public health systems and the fight against HIV/AIDS in developing countries.[citation needed] A counter-argument is that it is illogical to assume that reducing funding to a program automatically reduces its quality. There may be factors within these sectors that are susceptible to corruption or over-staffing that causes the initial investment to not be used as efficiently as possible.

&gt;Recent studies have shown strong connections between SAPs and tuberculosis rates in developing nations.[19]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_adjustmentI just took the test.  For better or for worse it seems pretty accurate except somehow I scored very low in conscientiousness.  7%.  Then I read the explanation and it basically said I'm lazy and don't care.  Which is funny because in fact the exact opposite is the case.  I'm probably conscientious to the point of neuroticism.  I stress about getting things done constantly, and the stress of wanting to get things done sometimes interferes with actually getting things done.

This is really bothering me.  

I apologise if someone has already pointed this out - but something seemed VERY familiar when I watched the Vice hitjob on JBP

Red Ice (31 Jan):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc3o4YmHJbc&amp;t=199s

Vice (7 Feb):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blTglME9rvQ&amp;t=169s

is it just me, or is it a little strange that they would use the EXACT same clip (from completely different camera angles) in their attempted attack on JBP?

Can't help but laugh!This question is inspired by the recent makeup controversy. There's lots of discussion centering on the concept of "victim-blaming". 

This could apply to women wearing makeup just as easily as it applies to not walking through a high crime area with a briefcase full of cash, or jumping into a lake full of crocodiles with chicken wings tied to your body. 

It's too easy, and too dangerous, to dismiss the issue by applying the "victim blame" solvent to any attempt at consideration of negligence. 

On the other hand, actually assigning a victim responsibility for the villain's actions is of course outrageous. 

Undoubtedly, taking each incident into account based on the context, known facts, and motivations of the persons involved is of utmost importance.I have heard Jordan talk about chaos in one's personal life, but I cannot remember which video(s) it was in. Any ideas?The ussr and china eventually fixed their problems with natural famines despite capitalist interests trying to create shortages through sanctions.

And capitalism has not fixed the starvation and healthcare shortages it creates artificially.

In fact capitalists discourage us from using natural resources or taxing the capitalists that stole them to fund fixes for artificial healthcare and food shortages created by capitalism.

20 mill plus a year die due to capitalist hoarding.


Can we discuss this?

I wont be responding to red herrings or claims that naturally occurring famines in china and ussr were part of a communist design.Go figure.First of all, I love reading book, I try to read as often as I can and I do enjoy it.

I am just curious what this sub thinks on the matter, why wouldn't reading books be on par with watching Netflix all day? 

Even if you read Plato, Nietzsche, Solzhenitsyn etc. Does it really change anything in your life? Does your life play out in the same way if your read a book or binge Netflix. Is book reading just a glorified endeavor of pure entertainment for the pretend intellectuals?I‚Äôm a huge fan of Jordan Peterson‚Äôs ideas but I think one less ideal aspect of our respect for him is that he embodies a hero fantasy of someone who says what everyone is thinking (the sage wise man in Jungian thinking).

It may be that I‚Äôm just a coward but curious how others who are deeply embedded in leftist areas (SF, NYC) deal with being constantly pestered with diversity trainings, bias workshops etc.  Speaking up often does mean termination or at least ostracization.  I almost am starting to believe that classical liberals need to start constructing a parallel society to replace this one that‚Äôs been slowly but comprehensively corroded.

For the first time in my life I‚Äôm considering walking away from many of the things in my life to be able to live a more honest life.He looks and sounds like him.Would love to see  JP analysis of Forest Gump, Explicit Content. Part of the reason for the popularity of JBP's content seems to be that it contains fundamental truths about reality - truths that are as intrinsic to nature as the speed of light, yet exist at a level above physics and chemistry, a level where human minds reside.  He seems to have given a sense of purpose to nihilists, who now feel that there is a non-arbitrary way of finding meaning, a way, again, that is as steeped into nature as physical laws.

However, it is possible, even likely, that this set of archetypes is but one of many different sets found throughout the cosmos, or even on earth.  Consider the life cycle of some spiders, where the female is physically superior, and often eats the male after copulation.  Imagine the set of archetypes associated with these creatures - some would surely be at odds with our own set of archetypes.  

One can imagine many other life cycles that would have conflicting archetypes, where our hero archetype simply doesn't exist.  

I just wanted to draw your attentions to this possibility, and to start a discussion about it.  It seems to me that the human archetypes, particularly the main one about a hero, may not be general cosmic truths.  **Instead of being as ubiquitous and fundamental to nature as the speed of light, it may be more like the mass of a particular star.**

I'm not trying to detract from JBP's content.  His work has been eye-opening and *useful* for me.  This just seems like an unaddressed implication.  I have several arguments/critiques against my own position that I may bring up later.I recently took the Big Five Aspects Scale at UnderstandMyself.com. I was particularly interested in a section of my results that states:

&gt;People with extremely low levels of neuroticism are very good at tolerating risk. If they are average or high in extraversion or openness, they may even enjoy it. They remain calm in the face of even extreme uncertainty. They can thrive in recreational, career, financial and social situations where the possibility of loss is higher. They can consider and implement career changes and other transformations that could enhance their lives with exceptional ease.

I am curious if anyone here knows of some good research papers on personality and risk? I've found a few, but I haven't been able to find a thorough review paper or seminal article like I can for personality and many other behaviors/tendencies. Sup buckos.

Question: a couple of months ago, a user made a cool poster with the original 40 rules laid out in a manner from longest to shortest? Something like that.

Anyone have the image? I want to get it made into a full blown poster to put in living room.

thxWhen you clean your room every day, it no longer accumulates dirt, clutter, dirty laundry laying around, and essentially chaos. When it stops accumulating chaos, putting it into order becomes quicker and easier, almost to the point where it is in perpetual order.I think it's getting a bit out of hand recently, and that some rules need to be set to maintain the quality and utility of the content here. I'd like this to be a place for serious discussion, more importantly, I'd like this subreddit to be *productive* rather than reactionary and angry. 

Some examples I've noticed:

* Channel 4 interview reposting, especially either 'clever' edits or memes 
* The incessant posting of links to smear articles or anti-Peterson circle jerks on other subreddits - This especially, there is nothing to be gained from these, they serve only to generate outrage and echo chambers where we all come together to deride ChapTrapHouse. Can we please not stoop so low so as to become one of those subreddits whose content is actually just people getting angry at xposts from other subreddits.
* Jordan Peterson memes - there's already a post addressing this.
* There is simply not enough encouragement for people to read the source material and think these things out on their own. How about a book club or reading discussion sticky?
* Posting content from ideologues and pseudo-intellectuals 

There's more, but I would suggest a new rule banning low-effort posts and questionable sourcing ([there's a clip from OAN news on the frontpage](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7waxqq/petition_to_ban_mango/)). I'd also like the mods to encourage more text/self posting, even for external links. 

What do you think? 

All of them are fantastic but #15 seems particularly applicable to this sub. JPB passed away in his sleep a few days ago. RIP John.

I had the pleasure of meeting its founder, Kwame Scruggs, back in 2016 at the C.G. Jung Institute in New York. There is a documentary about the organization called "Finding the Gold Within" ([trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6_6OBbosLk)). Unfortunately the full documentary, which you can  find on YouTube, is not available for free.

**Extracting the Gold Within**

Like what Peterson does in his Biblical series, [Alchemy](http://alchemyinc.net/about-us/) [about us] discusses stories to distill messages to guide us towards meaningful life - in Kwame's case, mythologies from around the world. Alchemy, Inc. has a mentorship component where graduates of the program mentor new initiates beginning in elementary school. Participants [reportedly](http://alchemyinc.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Alchemy-Power-of-Myth-Article-Final.pdf) [article] have increased GPA's, high school graduation rates, and college acceptance rates, but I could not find exact figures.

Hope this serves as inspiration to uphold the transmission of these messages to other young men as you traverse your own journeys.

P.S. Originally posted this in /r/JordanBPeterson, posting it here now as I originally intended.Why does Jordan Peterson have so many alt right fans? Hi, I want to buy Self Authoring Suite and I'm checking if there's a working discount code for it, thanks in advance!Be Authentic. The only person who ever voiced this to me was a Black woman in Sarajevo of all places. Since the Chan4 interview this board has become a grubby facsimile of what it was. If it wants to be relevant and keep it's status as JP's Reddit sub it needs to prune like it's on cocaine. I can't be the only one who's been lamenting what's happened since #soyou'resayingate.Winston Churchill once said,  ‚ÄúThe best argument against Democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.‚Äù

Everyone who downvotes this is a testament to the accuracy of my appraisalI have bought his books for my boys, watched nearly every podcast and interview with the guy, changing my habits and learning a great deal on how to be a better man, husband, and dad. 

Now my fear is that I have become a cultist or at least lost my perspective. The guy rings so true. 

We all have heard of or seen the BBC Channel 4 interview, but are there any other lions cages he has walked into with professional critics? I would love to see the contrarian opinions to make sure I am not going off the deep end. Jordan said to look out when the term equity is used over equality, as equality refers to equal opportunity while equity refers to to, for example, if half the population are women, then half of all jobs in a business should be done by women.  Or if a certain racial group makes up 7% of the population, every business should have 7% of their employees spread out at all levels of that racial group.  So you would hire or not people based on their identity.

I heard the term health equity and was confused by it here http://jeffthompsonmd.com/2018/02/07/equity-quiet-failure-biggest-potential/

The article says health equity is different than health equality.  The article cites the institute of medicine‚Äôs definition of health equity:

‚ÄúProviding care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status‚Äù

It sounds good, except geographic location and socioeconomic status are the harder ones improve.  I don‚Äôt understand how that definition is different from health equality though?  Any thoughts?

Really though. Just curious. 

When's the last time you engaged with a hardcore feminist, an avowed communist, or a dogmatic leftist? 

Recently, I've had conversations with people who would fall under all three of those categories, and honestly, it was refreshing.

It's good to stay sharp and be forced to REALLY think about why I hold the opinions and beliefs that I do. 

It's even better to leave a conversation like this being able to establish a common ground with you intellectual opponent. You can respect and empathize with those from the "other side" without having to agree with them. 

What I've found is not everyone from these camps is a raving ideologue. There are those of them with compelling arguments, and they're able to present their positions in a clear, articulate way. 

Yes, the conversations are uncomfortable, but they're invaluable.

Any interesting stories? Revelations? Opinions? 
I started reading the first part of the 2nd rule in JP‚Äôs new book and I started writing out my thoughts and how I relate it to myself.

I‚Äôve concluded that most of my motivation for doing anything in life has a basis in people-pleasing and I‚Äôve discovered how absolutely fucking miserable I am because of that!  I‚Äôve gone to somewhat ridiculous lengths to make sure someone else‚Äôs ends are met but when it comes to my own I hardly give little to no real effort.

Probably my biggest fear is failing to meet someone else‚Äôs expectations or disappoint and letting others down.
I‚Äôve felt how damnably crippling that is in the past to feel like I‚Äôve utterly failed someone.  I‚Äôve felt that heavy boulder of shame in my chest, that piercing anxiety that left me bawling so hard that one time my mother actually considered driving me to the hospital.  Even writing this is somewhat breaking me up but I want to get past this.  I want to know what it really means to take care of myself and actually fucking DO IT!

I don‚Äôt get out much and I feel like I haven‚Äôt really done much with my life as a result of this people-pleasing.  The way I see it is that it just seems to drain me so much that I don‚Äôt have the motivation to do what I want.

Sorry this is long but I felt like posting it here since it seemed most appropriate and I would like some constructive feedback and any ideas of how to overcome this shitty way of living.Just saying. It‚Äôs so not hip to be Christian and adherents have largely accepted the abuse of pop culture.  After hearing his description of Dostoyevsky‚Äôs the brothers Karamazov, and musings on the Parable of the Madman by Nietzsche it‚Äôs pretty clear how one can hold on to belief in light of having lost the culture war. Hating Christianity is something a kin to hating your 
parents, in the west. It might be funny in the moment, but eventually you have to make peace to have a happy life.

Pomos lose their mind even considering this. I love how they casually drop God is Dead, but usually have no clue of the context.  Next time you hear someone drop this line, ask them what they think of the parable of the Madman. You will likely get vacuous stares Whoopsie. When I bought "12 Rules" I added on "Gulag Archipelago", accidentally picking a (much cheaper) abridged version.

Is it worth cracking the cover of this version? Or should I attempt to return it and get the full sizer?When Jordan Peterson tours Australia next month (early March), I expect (hope) he will be doing a round of media interviews while here. Q&amp;A is a live, weekly, national TV program that features a panel of high profile political, business and public personalities with fair moderation, taking questions from the studio audience and viewers. Q&amp;A covers a range of current social and political topics, and generally has a focus topic each week. When Jordan Peterson tours in March Q&amp;A would be the perfect forum for him to discuss topics that his book, work and political commentary has covered and give the important issues he raises the broadest mainstream coverage. I am looking for other Aussies who support this idea and people who can reach Jordan Peterson to help make sure the opportunity for this appearance is not missed. 
Thanks

https://www.truearrowevents.com/dr-peterson-tourI searched online, and I'm beginning to think such careers don't exist...at least not with significant success. We don't have to remove Triple parentheses for antisemitism, in the same manner that we don't have to remove a post for calling someone Jewish, one thing you can take issue of the Triple parentheses is that it's code language. Not everyone knows what it means.

So I suggest to the moderators, rather than removing Triple parentheses for breaking rule *2) Keep submissions and comments civil.* remove them for speaking in code language. Calling someone Jewish, White, Black in of itself should not be subject to removal. [[[]]] --- ---- \\\ \\\ /// /// +++ +++

I want to hear your comments on this suggestion, I think personally it's a great idea, not for us  but the world as well.

Because if you remove people using triple parentheses for antisemitism, they will go to their forums and increase polarization, when it actually just can be seen as a code language and hence be removed for that. Or you will have to make a claim that calling people Jewish is breaking the rules, unless that's fine and code language is not. And my result was 87.

Like, shit, what did I do wrong? I'm not a genius, but I'm not _that_ retarded either. I still read and comprehend difficult literature, and I'm doing pretty well in business school.

I heard a few people say that he was probably just an undercover Alt-Righter. But it‚Äôs pretty convenient that Vice was there filming, and got footage for their video. Maybe it was a setup by Vice, to catch JP make a response to that question. ü§îTaking the sample set of one which is me, I wouldn't be surprised. #Physical Checklist

After his Vice interview or any of his past debacles, I think he has adequately demonstrated how backwards and pseudo-intellectual his worldview actually is. 

For people who wonder why he's considered right wing(objectively he is), its comments like this, or comments like https://twitter.com/cultofdusty/status/957681697482473473
that illuminate his extremely socially conservative views. 

Also before you queue the "you took him out of context" arguments, I can promise you none of these are taken out of context.

His first comment though was sexist. Yes, objectively sexist and stupid. Not sexist in the way SJW's use it, but its just an example of victim blaming. 

Somehow i'm not surprised that a psychoanalytic try-hard would share the same contempt for women that freud and jung did. Simple enough question. I want to start following his work more closely. I have been watching him as he pops up on Youtube on other people's shows since the whole Trans pronoun controversy, but to REALLY get the benefit of his lectures and knowledge, is there any particular Youtube video (or set of videos) I should really be watching (or at least starting off with)?

I'm currently listening to "12 rules for life" on audiobook (can't beat it being read by the author) and want to follow more. So any advice or pointers will be gratefully appreciated.

(and sorry iof this one has been asked a million times already)How much impact do you think the interview had on people who maybe shared her opinions?

Do you think many of these people where brought to the conclusion that maybe they where wrong?

Other than Peterson gaining more pupblicity/followers is there any other way to read the impact it had on lets say "left leaning" or "leftist" people on the whole?This was started largely by this person.

But someone had to fund it.

&gt;While at Yale Law School, she received a National Science Foundation fellowship.[2][3]

Why would the US government fund it?

&gt;Abstract This essay shows, among other things, how the development of the NSF's social science program during the 1950s reflected a variety of political, institutional, and intellectual concerns, **including academic worries about the standing of Marxism as social science, anti-Communist political pressures,** and the dominant presence of natural science leaders at the NSF. Under these conditions, the agency developed a cautious strategy of funding the so-called hard-core end of the social research continuum, designed to ward off criticisms about the subversive connotations of social science while strengthening its ostensibly apolitical and objective scientific status.

So, what was funded in reality was sex negativity, anti-pornography, draconian legislation that can be used against men, and a critique of marxism that basically ended it by replacing class is a social construct with gender is a social construct.I've attempted multiple searches through a few databases, and have only found postmodern, social justice articles. I'm fairly new to JBP and don't really know where he claims to stand politically (I suspect its complicated), but for me, a life long liberal, I've been questioning my beliefs lately.  I've not necessarily swung the other way but can now see the flaws in liberalism.  I am alerted to other thinking and reasoning.  Its hardly the black or white scenario that I have always thought it was.  I heard a podcast which discussed libertarianism and liked some of those ideas too.  Has anyone else had their views and opinions from reading/listening to JBP?Agreeableness: Moderately High 65th percentile

JBP talks a lot about Hierarchy and how he changed his semantic from Dominance Hierarchy to Competence Hierarchy after talking with someone who studied Hierarchies.  While I get the concept I am looking for resources of the differences and how they are at times related etc...

Anything will help, a link or your comments.

Thank you buckos!**Background to my question**:
Like a moderate portion of this sub, I am a young male trying to "integrate my shadow." I grew up lacking a father figure. I was raised by an extremely agreeable family; I'm aware I'm just too bloody agreeable.
My Big 5 test for Agreeableness showed an overall agreeableness score of 39th; with 95th percentile in compassion and 1st in politeness (I could've fibbed on this a little, depending on the day I float between 1st and 20th in politeness).
**Anyway, here's my question**:
In the first chapter of *12 Rules*, Dr. Peterson elaborates on the relationship between high-status/serotonin levels and an elevated and open posture. He states that a "victory" will increase serotonin levels and therefore expand your posture. This can be worked the other way around, however, if you fix your posture you can increase your serotonin levels.
Recently, Rebel Wisdom did a documentary about Dr. Peterson and interviewed him. At around the 13-minute mark, Dr. Peterson references someone who has integrated their shadow;
&gt;‚ÄúIt is a physiological thing. I mean you
can actually see a change in people's
faces when that part of them is
integrated. When the, I would say the rage
circuit, is integrated because their face
is hardened like they no longer look
like wide-eyed children. They're no
longer someone to who things only happen
to, they‚Äôre someone who makes things
happen‚Äù

By changing my facial expression (hardening my face, not looking so wide-eyed), can I cause a psychological shift, akin to raising serotonin levels by fixing my posture?

An obligatory note: I'm doing other work to integrate the shadow (listening to my resentment, speaking out when something bothers me, reading history *as the perpetrator*, etc...

Thanks in advance. What is this?:  In 1 Corinthians 13, Apostle Paul mentions The Mysteries.  There are Mysteries in the Bible and the Spiritual.  There is reason to The Spiritual and how God works.  We are seeking Truth.  

Audience:  Truth seekers.  Anyone looking to understand The Spiritual, The World, and God.  Jordon Peterson did a Bible Series.  This is meant to add to understanding.  

In the song ["American Pie"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAsV5-Hv-7U) by Don Mclean there is mention of a "Satan's Spell." What exactly is a Satan's Spell? 

**American Pie**

In the Bible there are themes of Light and Darkness and Truth and Lies.  Someone who is in The Dark is someone who was lied to and believes a lie.  A man is married, and his wife is cheating on him with his best friend.  He senses or feels something is wrong.  Both his wife and his best friend lie to him.  He allows them to ease his fears and suspicions and believes their lies.  He is in The Dark.  He has a false perspective or reality.  He believes that his best friend is a good friend and someone he can trust.  He has faith in his wife, and believes that she is part of him and working for the good of both as a married couple.  He is in a cave of ignorance and lies.  Given, one day, he sit down at his computer, and finds he has access to his wife's facebook, and finds some messages she had sent his best friend, he may have an Apocalpyse.  An opening of the eyes.  The false perspective and false reality that he had, the false beliefs, would be shed, and the truth would be clearly seen.  He has evidence that his wife and best friend were committing adultery.  He may be able to put all the pieces together as to where and how.  He has an awakening of sorts.  Ignorance is bliss.  Knowledge brings sorrow.  The Truth hurts.  


*8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light* (Ephesians 5:8)  

People may be told a variety of lies their entire life.  Some lies some people really like or they need to be true for piece of mind.  Some lies may be institutionalized, and generations of men are born and die under said lies.  Satan has been known as The Lord of Lies.  Jesus Christ is the Light and The Truth.  The Holy Ghost is a teacher and a councilor.  Turning to God, someone may be lead into all Truth.  The Truth may be hard and hurt, particularly if it hits you all at once.  I will try to be nice.  



&gt;The following is from a Satanist AMA on /r/religion:

&gt;The Order is dedicated to the study and practice of Black Magic, that is the Art of altering or changing one‚Äôs Subjective Universe, in order to produce a similar or proportionate change in the Objective Universe, in accordance with one‚Äôs Will. https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/6dq4vg/order_of_the_serpent_ama/

Satan has been known as The Lord of Lies.  In a Satanist AMA on /r/religion, The Order of The Serpent states there is an Objective Universe.  There is one Truth or Objective Morality.  Their definition of Black Magic is that having a subjective opinion or subjective idea or a lie, and working to make changes to the Objective Universe based on that lie.  What is someone's reality or perspective?  They are working to change not just one man's reality or perspective, but how society views certain things like morality.  Someone has a Will, and they are working to assert their will over society and change how society views the World.  The Matrix or "Satan's Spell" are lies and false perspectives.  Someone that claims to worship darkness, is a worshiper of lies.  

In the 1960's and prior to, Christian morality was deeply engrained in the US.  Given someone was termed Bad Company, that may have been a major put down.  That person is someone that should not to be trusted; a corrupting influence.  Why?  Bad Company corrupts good character.  (1 Corinthians 15:33) There is a band called Bad Company who sang the song "Bad Company."  This band may grew up in a society based on Christian morality, and may have had prayer in school.  They called themselves Bad Company.  Now, Bad Company is thought to be something cool or cool in a rebellious type of way.  This is a small example of how perceptions change.

And

&gt;This is an Interview with Ex KGB Agent Yuri Bezmenov: ["Deception Was My Job"]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qkf3bajd4)

&gt;It is an eye opening interview.  Yuri Bezmenov explains a lot of what is going on today.  Here are some notes I made from the above interview.  

&gt;32:20 Political Prostitutes - Progressive Intellectuals

&gt;51:30 KGB wanted Americans to be interested and motivated by non-issues, non-existent harmony.  

&gt;55:50 Many "useful idiots," American Leftists would be executed.

&gt;1:07:40  Changing the Perception of Reality for Americans  - Satanism  

Lies and false perceptions and false realities blind us to God.  Someone who believed in Moloch or Baal is a deceived individual who has values rooted in their belief.  These value change their perception of reality and their world.  Someone that believes in Secular Humanism is a deceived individual with values rooted in their ideology and belief system.  Their values blind them to God.  

*Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I let them inquire of me at all?* (Ezekiel 14:3)  

False beliefs and values blind men to God.  They act as stumbling blocks.  Someone growing in Faith and seeking Truth and God would be working to shed false beliefs and false values and working to see things more as God sees things.  He may have to work outside and up of Dominance   Hierarchies.

https://wechslertest.comHi, 
I'm gonna introduce Jordan to my mom, can someone post a short clip for that purpose?
Thanks! JP says if you don‚Äôt refer to trans people by their preferred pronoun then you‚Äôll be fined and subjugated to the 21st century gulag. 

So my question is: **would you refer to a trans person by their preferred pronoun?**

Also... Does anyone have **ANY** evidence of someone being fined or jailed?

I‚Äôve been told this was just to keep housing, employers, and schools from discriminating solely because of someone‚Äôs gender-nonconformity, similar to how you can‚Äôt fire someone solely for being black or gay. 
I‚Äôve also read that this was to keep people from harassing people solely because of their gender-nonconformity.
[The bill seems pretty straight forward](http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-16/third-reading)
‚Äî-
The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the *principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals* to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, *gender identity* or expression, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.

(Basically they added ‚Äúgender identity‚Äù or gender-nonconformists to the list identifiable groups)  

‚Äî-
Peterson‚Äôs fans argue the problem is that solely referring to a person by their birth-gender would constitute harassment under the new law, but the bill doesn‚Äôt say that specifically, so let‚Äôs investigate what the bill does say. 
It does say is failure to comply will result in prosecution under criminal code 318. 

‚Äî-

First off let‚Äôs establish that sections 318, 319, and 320 of Canada‚Äôs  Criminal Code forbid hate propaganda. "Hate propaganda" means "any writing, sign or visible representation that advocates or promotes **genocide**or the communication of which by any person would constitute an offense under section 319.
Section 318 prescribes imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years for anyone who **advocates genocide**. The Code defines genocide as the destruction of an "identifiable group." The Code defines an "identifiable group" as "any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, ethnic origin or sexual orientation.‚Äù
Section 319 prescribes penalties from a fine to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years for anyone who, by communicating statements in any public place, incites hatred against any identifiable group where such *incitement is likely to lead to a* **breach of the peace.**
‚Äî-
You can freely express your views, unless you‚Äôre *advocating for [genocide*](https://imgur.com/a/UKI7w) to the point of *breaching the peace.*
Some of you may ask, But what exactly is a ‚Äú*breach of the peace*‚Äù? The phrase was considered in Frey v. Fedoruk et al. a 1950 Supreme Court of Canada decision on a claim of false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.
‚ÄúA breach of the peace takes place when either an actual assault is committed on an individual or public alarm and excitement is caused. Mere annoyance or insult to an individual stopping short of actual personal violence is not breach of the peace. Thus a householder - apart from special police legislation - cannot give a man into custody for violently and persistently ringing his door-bell.‚Äù
It seems like Canada might actually allow you more freedom of expression than America. Lol 
But, let‚Äôs examine further...
‚Äî-
Under section 319, an accused is not guilty: (a) if he establishes that the statements communicated were true; (b) if, in good faith, the person expressed or attempted to establish by an argument an opinion on a religious subject or an opinion based on a belief in a religious text; (c) if the statements were relevant to any subject of public interest, the discussion of which was for the public benefit, and if on reasonable grounds he believed them to be true; or (d) if, in good faith, he intended to point out, for the purpose of removal, matters producing or tending to produce feelings of hatred toward an identifiable group in Canada.
Section 320 allows a judge to confiscate publications which appear to be hate propaganda.
‚Äî- 
You won‚Äôt be imprisoned or fined if...
A) statements communicated were true
B) if you were expressing your religious beliefs 
C) ‚Äúif the statements were relevant to any subject of public interest, the discussion of which was for the public benefit, and if on reasonable grounds he believed them to be true‚Äù - is that simple enough? 
D) if you think an identifiable group of people is being persecuted. 
‚Äî-
So basically that means you can‚Äôt start a fight with someone because of their gender-nonconformity. 

The bill says if you‚Äôre an employer or a landlords or a school, or a public official then can‚Äôt discriminate against individuals solely based on their gender-nonconformity, and if you do discriminate against these groups then you‚Äôll be subject to the same fines as someone discriminating against gays, blacks, women, or any of the groups listed. 
IT DOES NOT SAY people will be forced to use ‚Äúpreferred pronouns.‚Äù

ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE does this bill state the members of the public will be forced to call people by their ‚Äúpreferred pronouns.‚Äù 

And in fact the bill directly states why that won‚Äôt happen. Section 319

If you‚Äôre an employer, landlord, teacher or a public official and you‚Äôre discriminating against someone solely because of their gender then that‚Äôs now being labeled as discrimination and you‚Äôll be subject to the same fines/gulag that anyone would be subject to if they discriminated against gays or blacks or women or any of the other listed identifiable groups. 

Edit: I know about Linsey Shepherd and that is a case of the university misinterpreting c16 and later apologizing... I‚Äôm specifically looking for *fines* and/or ‚Äújail/gulag.‚Äù  I‚Äôd really like some proof that members of the public being jailed for not using ‚Äúpreferred pronouns‚Äù and being charged with harassment or ‚Äúhate speech.‚Äù 
Hi all, 

I didn't know where to talk about this, but here goes. I discovered JP in late December 2017, and have been enthralled by his works, thoughts and ideas. As a result I've begun implementing things along the lines of "clean-up your room", and am working to refine my thought processes and presumptions, in hopes to clarify my ideas in my own head, and integrate the truth of what JP says (which seems to be a majority of what he says). 

My wife and I worked together on cleaning up our house over the past two weeks and it has been fantastic! Pictures hung after a year of living here, organizing space, and addressing what is brought to our attention that needs doing. My wife is peripheral to JP, has listened to a few livestreams and sees the value and importance of his ideas.  But recently she has become vocally upset when I bring up JP, and sometimes when i only bring up thoughts presented by JP. (I think I do this a lot, so maybe the solution is to find others with which to discuss, My social life is minimal, with almost no one with which to talk through these ideas besides my wife. Hmm, I think I've answered my own problem :-p). I guess I'll move forward and work through these thoughts through discussions with others... Now only problem is to find others with which to discuss these thoughts.

TL:DR - Strain on my relationship with my wife has been a consequence of 'cleaning up my room'. Probably because she's the only one I talk to about it. Guess I need to find others to talk to.

What consequences have you experienced as a result of 'cleaning up your room'?I‚Äôd like to start this post by stating that I am a huge fan of Dr. Peterson. The reason I‚Äôm writing this now is that I am seeking answers to a dream I experienced recently. In the dream he was an egotistical prick and it made me question myself.

I have engaged in some kind of hero worship ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù with the idea I‚Äôve concocted of Jordan B Peterson (JBP). I am not at all comfortable with it to be completely honest... That being said I‚Äôd like to know if he is a good person. 

Now to ask of the community... Has anyone out there met JBP? Did he seem to embody his own teachings? I‚Äôd prefer experiences from people who haven‚Äôt paid for his time. 

I donate to his Patreon and bought his book (which is a great read btw) and I want to know if he is worthy of that support. He doesn‚Äôt owe me a damn thing I do understand that.




I have mixed feelings about Peterson. I've read a lot about him and I've listened to many of his lectures and interviews. 

I'm doing my best to cut through the exaggerations of both his fans and haters and soberly assess his ideas.

I would appreciate if some of y'all could answer my questions (questions that largely overlap):

1) Peterson talks much of "post-modern Marxists" and "cultural Marxists" (he seems to use the terms interchangeably) and I am familiar with the term "Neo-Marxism". Is it safe to say all three of these "Marxisms" essentially mean the same thing? 

2) Can someone succinctly define the Pomo/Cultural/Neo Marxism that Peterson rails against? (My overlong definition would be: the importation of a Marxist class struggle paradigm into other forms of power struggle (gender, culture, race) where most truth claims are regarded as subjective narratives produced and validated by those who control the means of intellectual production (usually men, the West and white people); the dominance of these narratives can oppress historically marginalized groups; justice results from upending those narratives by privileging truth claims of these marginalized groups.)

3) Why is Peterson so upset with these Pomo/Cultural/Neo Marxists? What does he find so dangerous about their ideas? Please give tangible examples or data. 

4) How does using gender-neutral pronouns for trans people serve a Pomo/Cultural/Neo Marxist agenda? What exactly is that agenda? What is dangerous about this agenda?

5) I understand Peterson is opposed to a social constructionist view of gender and he associates this view with Pomo/Cultural/Neo Marxists. What is so threatening about a social constructionist view of gender? Why is a social constructionist view of gender wrong? Please provide evidence.I'm fairly new to JBP and don't really know where he claims to stand sexually (I suspect its complicated), but for me, a life long homo, I've been questioning my beliefs lately. I've not necessarily swung the other way but can now see the flaws in homosexuality. I am alerted to other arousal and reasoning. Its hardly the black or white scenario that I have always thought it was. I heard a podcast which discussed homosexuality and liked some of those ideas too. Has anyone else had their gender and sexuality from reading/listening to JBP?Just want opinions. 


Edit: specifically*There must be something more than the far left and far right. What about the far center? What about the ultra rich that influence nations? There must be something else... I don't know.The movement that Jordan Peterson is espousing needs a name, and I don't think that there is one. *Jordanism* might do, but I think that something stronger is needed (and that is not based on Jordan's name). We need something to call ourselves, and *lobsters* and *buckos* won't do.

**We need something that the media might latch on to.**

Any suggestions?I remember him talking about why fire looks so different from other forms of light - can anyone remember what he said and where he said it.I just want to know your opinions considering he touches on this topic. 

Would you consider Jordan Peterson an alpha male?Here's what I'm trying to say: As time goes one, the more frames of references people have to go off increasingly into the future. 

For example, it was impossible for someone to "be a hippy" in the 1500s. I mean, I'm sure it was possible, but "being a hippy" wasn't yet quantified by speech in the way that it is today. There was a lot less "things" one could be back then.  

Point being, as time goes on, the more "things" people can theoretically be and therefore the more things they have to think of. This, in my mind, leads to a never ending expansion of ideas or frames of reference that touches and ever complicates every aspect of human life, every day.  

Another example: the idea of self-actualization, or happiness, or other quantified emotional states. 

We were not able to contemplate the nature of our emotional states until we quantified them with language. Flash forward to today: now we can contemplate the contemplation of people contemplating their emotional thoughts.  

It's like we get further and further out into this orbit around concepts since, as time goes one, there are more and more "things" one can possibly be, or ideas to be considered, or vantages to take into consideration.


Does any of this make sense?

I swear I'm not bugging out on acid.  lol.Anyone know if there's been any efforts to translate 12 Rules into Spanish? I¬†often see the point that feminism (especially enclined towards socialism) benifits men (and people in general). Focusing on women takes the pressure off men and promotes things like being open to talking, compassion and less competition (all benifical for someone's wellbeing). I don't know how to respond to this point when I see it. I really appreciate your perspective on why this kind of statement is fallacious or something you agree with. I see that people put a lot of philosophical thought into things in this group so hope this is OK to ask here :). Please answer in any way you deem fit, I'm interested to hear any opinion.

I'm only mildly familiar with JBP's work so if there is a link to something where he discusses this very point that would be great too.

Thanks in advance!I am just genuinely curious about what he may have said on this subject or not. I have seen blurbs here and there but I assume he has gone more into it. 

Thanks for any help. &gt; Basically, everything is already being collected, in the larger sense. If it's not being directly managed in a trusted external system of yours, then it's resident somewhere in your psyche. The fact that you haven't put an item in your in-basket doesn't mean you haven't got it. But we're talking here about making sure that everything you need is collected somewhere other than in your head

http://www.43folders.com/2006/07/24/b2gtd-mind-sweep

I have collected some 264 items in an inbox. Things like making an interview script and making presentation and protocols; to finding documents, cleaning up hard drive, cleaning up gmail. 

I have processed 30 in all - and everything looks so easy and clear now! 

234 remaining. I wish to finish all 234 today! It's been one week since the other 30 were being processed in bits and pieces. Can I do it? Can I?

This is my dragon for the day!I'll be honest, I don't really like Peterson. At least what I've heard from him has been full of logical fallacies or just preying upon people who are shitty at arguing. But I want to be open minded so I thought I would come to a place that is enthusiastic about Jordan and ask for some suggestions. I'd like to know how the rest of you are putting order into chaos. I just completed present and future authoring and have been striving to take responsibility for my life with determination. I've noticed I starting to enjoy keeping a detailed schedule. I'm taking pride in doing things like cleaning and handling boring responsibilities. I'm finding I have more interest in my favorite hobbies. I'm telling the truth more to others and myself and I'm observing the effects of it with agreement. 


It's not easy. My life has honestly gotten harder since I've decided I want to accept the burden of being, but I feel less ashamed of myself and I'm suffering less because of that. I'm truly finding meaning in trying to make things better.


What about you?After finishing a program is it possible to change it or do it all over?Currently reading 12 Rules for Life.


Jordan mentions *"Satan, God's highest angel gone most spectacularly wrong"*.


I realized that this story is one less talked about in context of Bible.
Why did this highly extraordinary being (originally called *Lucifer*, "shining one, light-bearer") fall from the grace of God? What were his motives?


In Genesis stories Satan is a serpent, that's understandable. What's the reason to show him in angel form? What is the psychological and mythological significance of his Fall? 

Does Jordan talk about this story in his Biblical lectures?


(Lots of questions, but the topic is fascinating)Jordan Peterson is obviously a naturally clever and insightful guy.

He is not alt-right (though he has some right wing views).

His opposition to the more over sensitive elements on the left is justified.

He has a major problem though. He can't let go of his need for religion - particularly Christianity (even if he himself is not religious, though it's unclear if he is or isn't as he has made conflicting statements on this point).

This need to keep religion and spirituality as a core influence on the individual and society is common in people that have grown up in religious families and communities. The core ideals of religion persist even if the belief itself has gone, and one of these ideals is that we need religion and the spiritual at the center of human experience in order to not descend into chaos and beastiality.

This need to keep religion around can be seen in people that grow up in religious backgrounds but have rejected the specific Judaeo/christian religious doctrine they grew up with. Often they cannot fully reject this need and turn to more esoteric spirituality. 

All this is fairly common in people in JPs generation. The mixing of philosophy, science and spirituality to concoct a kind of methadone to help them get buy without the 'drug' they where exposed to at a young age.

I propose that it's this side of JP that takes his otherwise logical brain and makes it susceptible to woo, albeit a breed of woo that is heavily, though ultimately superficially, influenced by logic and science.

When you combine this with a seemingly opposing nihilistic streak that's evident in him, I think what we see is a person that feels on a deep level that at the core of humanity there is a dark void that needs to be filled.

This is an unhelpful and unproductive undercurrent in his talks and writings.

So does he have a point? Yes, if we can separate out all of the above traits of his he certainly does have a point, but the conversations about JP are so far away from dealing with the issues I mention that his real contribution is obscured.

What JP (and others that are critical of contemporary 'morality') are right about is that it can't carry on in this current state. It's polarized and therefore lacks nuance and depth, so results in pretty terrible injustices towards anyone that steps outside of its strictest interpretation.

What he is wrong about is that looking back gives us all the answers we need. This is not true. The philosophies and ideologies of the past several hundred years, combined with our religious hang over, are exactly what have brought us to this point of confusion and chaos. Going back to Jung, blaming Marx and standing in awe of Nietzsche is holding us back.

We are on the brink of leaving behind these outdated ways of analyzing and categorizing the human state, but have not codified what it is we are replacing them with yet. That is not necessarily a bad thing... Maybe we need this process of being set adrift and feeling the panic of having no footing in order for a new path to be found that takes all our historic philosophies and theologies into account, contextualizes them, distills them down to their useful components and MOVES ON!What: I made a list of the most general types of people based on my experience. It's a socio-political categorization based on once personality, iq, occupation, preferences and place in society. Again, my generalization. Not based on any official info.

Why: I'm interested in what people think and what motivates them rather what they say. Also it helps me to simplify the world


The 14 categories are as follows:



* Romantics:

-Poets, some actors, artists, high verbal iq, creative, high intuitiveness, low to high in extroversion , higher than average in neuroticism, average quantitive iq.  

Examples: Bukowski, Adrien Brody


* Humanists:

-entrepreneuers, social scientists, some journalists, some comedians, high verbal iq, high in extroversion, average or high quantative iq, higher than average in agreeableness, fairly high intuitively

Examples: Jordan Peterson, Steven Pinker, Bret Weinstein, Jake Tapper, Conan O‚Äô Brien, Obama


* Introverted humanists:

-usually philosophy graduates, libertarians, low in extroversion, loner types, lower than average in agreeableness, high in verbal and quantitative iq, autistic tendencies

Examples: Stephen Hicks, Ayn Rand


* Rationalists:

-IT people, natural scientists, utilitarian, binary thinkers, more introverted than extroverted, some physicisians, lower than average in agreeableness, , high quantitive iq, low verbal iq, low intuitiveness

Examples: Stephen Hawking, Sam Harris, engineers


* Doers:

-usually conservative, high iq, upper class, high in energy, high conscientiousness, disagreeable, low in intuition and creativity, CEO‚Äôs, lawyers

Example: Ben Shapiro, Peter Thiel


* Psychopaths:

-high iq, manipulative, opposite of humanist, authoritarian, leaders

Example: Stalin, Hitler


* Pragmatists:

-higher than average iq, low to mid level leaders, low in agreeableness, practical,  warrior types, police, industrious

Example: Jocko Willink, Joe Rogan


* Contrarians:

-Mostly conservative, higher than average iq, higher in openness than average conservative, disagreeable, assertive, provocateur,  orderly, some comedians, individualist but not leader types

Example: PJW, Steven Crowder, some of the alt-right, /pol/, Bill Burr, 


* Idealists 

-egalitarian sjw's, gender studies, average democrat politicians, high verbal iq, almost like humanists, but with low quantitive iq,  

Examples:  Cenk Uygur, Nicholas Matte, Justin Trudeau, Cathy Newman.



* Normies 

-low to high iq, range from working class people to business graduates, more worker types than leader types, mainly middle class

Example:  Roaming Millennial, Dave Rubin, Lauren Southern


* Nice guys

-low in energy, average to high iq, non-competetive, male feminists, submissive, high in neuroticism and agreeableness,low in conscientiousness

Example: Pewdiepie, sjw‚Äôs



* Working class 

-common sense people, not interested in leading or college degrees, average iq or lower

Examples: construction workers, soldiers

* Authoritarians:

-low verbal and quantitive iq, high disgust sensitivity, collectivist

Examples: Antifa, neo-nazis, far-left feminists and the authoritarian sjw's

* Outsiders:

-criminals, lone wolfs, sociopaths, no particular interest in politics, low verbal iq, welfare leechers




What do you think? Did I miss something? 

Also: what bothers me is that Nietzche is the first one whom I can't put in any of those categories. I have never known anyone from real life who's like him. At the same time he seems pragmatic,  highly intelligent verbally and quantitively,  neurotic, disagreeable, romantic, contrarian and a psychopath.  

Hitchens was another weird one. I think he was essentially a humanist, but he is highly disagreeable and a contrarian which is a weird combination for a socialist humanist. I would like to introduce my family and friends to JP, and his book seems like a nice gift. However, I fear most of them won't be able to digest an english book. Does anyone know if there are official translations in the works?Some of the inmates are disagreeable, but the trolls are quite nice.We know from the Peterson lectures that acting out things is generally reflecting back on you as a person, you become what you act out. Now, recently I wondered how this applies to genuine actors, the ones who are out there on stage, or television, or in front of an audience. 

If you are an actor and you play a type that in the real world would be detrimental to your psyche and your environment, would this also apply to the real world, or is the mind capable enough of separating fiction acted out from reality?Does anyone know of any JP videos re getting past sexual assault or PTSD? Thanks!I've been having these for a long time, sometimes these thoughts feel so real and tempting they give me this weird anxiety that feels like I might actually do it.



I'm in a very dark place in my life right now, and I really need to get rid of these pathetic low level thoughts but it just feels like they just don't go away. Has Jordan given any lecture on these?Peterson suggested this in a recent interview, I‚Äôd like to hear your opinions. 

Maybe prod your theories.

Majority of results are hit pieces (Globe and Mail, MacLeans, Guardian, etc.).

Not to jump to conclusions, because it seems the 'algorithm' is returning more anti-JP than pro-JP, but I am also aware there has been probably more hit pieces written than complimentary articles...  I do love a good conspiracy though...!I noticed a few similarities.

lobster mind vs Gorilla Mindset

They both seem to be provocative.

They both focus on ‚Äúegalitarian‚Äù rights. 

They are both known for their anti-PC, anti-SJW, and anti-leftists rhetoric.

They both talk in ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù culture and teach the ‚Äúhow to‚Äù.I didn't know where to go, but i assumed you brilliant people could give some insight. When you're talking to someone, often you might come to a JBP pause and look up at the ceiling, though your word never comes. Is there a way to actually call and meet upon that mysterious word more often?It's all you have to do in response to an argument claiming Peterson was sexist in the Vice interview.  

The profound irony is, those who view both the question and answer that gets cited as sexist, clearly shows the sexist perspective of thoses who are making the claim.  

Here is what he said:

&gt; **Interviewer:** "Do you feel that a serious woman who does not want sexual harassment in the workplace, do you feel that if she wears make-up in the workplace, that she is somewhat being hypocritical?"

And here is what Peterson said:

&gt;"Yeah, I do". 


Here is what people claiming Peterson made a sexist comment thought they heard:

&gt;"Do you feel that a serious woman who does not want sexual harassment **targeted at them in the workplace**, do you feel that if she wears makeup in the workplace, that she is somewhat being hypocritical?"

They only see women as victims in the scenario. They interjected the women's victimization. That's how they drew the conclusion. 

If you asked the same question, but changed the sex:

&gt;"Do you feel that a serious man who does not want sexual harassment in the workplace, do you feel that if he expresses sexuality in the workplace, that he is somewhat being hypocritical?"

He'd answer the same way, and these folks would not have an issue with what he said.  [Canadaland - JP](http://www.canadalandshow.com/podcast/canadaland-guide-jordan-b-peterson/)

Curious to hear others thoughts on this guys‚Äô opinion of JP. A friend shared the link with me as he knows I‚Äôve been a fan of Peterson for a while. If you skip past the first 7 minutes of mattress commercials I think you‚Äôll find a relatively weak argument against Peterson‚Äôs motives. In the spirit of playing devils advocate I thought this would be a good place to share and any feedback or takeaways are welcome.Male/32/Argentinian

My score:
Agreeableness: 26%;
Conscientiousness: 8%;
Extraversion: 57%;
Neuroticism: 44%;
Openness: 91%.

But, I'm definitely a right wing classic liberal with libertarian leanings. My room is a mess, but I actually graduated 3rd best in class at law school. Then I career changed to film making (no wonder), and I'm doing great academically, and my short films are above the average good and I have worked very hard on them.

The thing with me is that I work very hard on what I love, but with the rest of my obligations I admit I'm a mess. I fail to keep my house in order, pay my taxes on time, do administrative stuff, etc. 

My Low Conscientiousness and High Openness would tend to make me a liberal, according to the test (and my experience too). But I'm kinda a very conservative person, in the classical liberal vein.

Some people say I'm sort of a conservative adventurer, in the style of Tintin. I love to travel and get to know new people, new cultures, new ideas, get into dangerous situations and risk my safety. But at the end of the day, I still consider western christian culture to be the superior culture, all things considered (I still don't deny we can learn and incorporate stuff from other cultures, or admire them as they are). 

So I am kinda puzzled by these results. Am I a walking contradiction?   I remember Jordan talking about something along the lines of someone using jokes/comedy and it's relation to Chaos. Could somebody help me find that? I cannot seem to! (Might've even been in his new book I really cannot remember!)What does he mean? How he presents that to people comes off heady. Exactly what truth is he implying we get at?I just want to learn more about Peterson fans and this community‚Äôs background. I thought this would be an apt place to ask this, since JBP is so concerned with lying and telling the truth. 

I guess I'll start: we were taught that jihad had nothing to do with the violence in the middle East or against Europe. This was bugging me ever since I watched the channel 4 interview. She clearly she was attempting to hit Jordan Peterson with a one two punch with "What gives you the right to Offend" question. What I know for sure is the question would have made her look absolutely hypocritical if you asked it after JBP made his point that is why she had the long pause, as she tried to reformulate the question in manner that she would not seem hypocritical which she could not do.  The first few sentences (below) sum up my thoughts on the media debate on him. I personally think his insights from decades of clinical therapy experience, academic research, teaching, and the historical/philosophical/evolutionary/neuroscience perspectives he incorporates make him an incredibly fascinating and helpful force. But of course there are also moments where he takes things to extremes and generally acts ridiculous about something. I love him regardless. Good read though. 

"Jordan Peterson continues to appear all over the news. It seems that those who like him ignore the parts they disagree with and those that dislike him exaggerate the parts the disagree with"



http://www.patheos.com/blogs/accordingtomatthew/2018/02/three-major-issues-sjw-disagrees-jordan-peterson/You Peterson fanboys keep accusing me of being a troll, but yet you all fail to discuss the issues.

Lobsters &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Buckos unite! 

Please tell me the wonderful ways of Dr. Peterson and about how he taught you to clean your room. 
Idunno what it is about this guy, but he is the cornerstone to the world i always imagined being possible, and it‚Äôs real. 

Dr. Peterson is my Kurt Cobain. 
Reality shooting me in the...This should be interesting given some of Brand's comments with Sam Harris, specifically, his  pseudo-postmodernist claims.

Suicidal. Thinks of suicide everyday. Hates himself for what he's done to his life. No friends. Terrible relationship with his family. No job. No money. Still lives with parents who pay for everything. Dropped out of college twice. Multiple health problems which led to the dropping out of college twice. Virgin who has never had a girlfriend but longs for a girlfriend so bad. Ugly face, which is the leading cause of why he doesn't have a girlfriend. Addicted to porn. Addicted to sugar. Jealous and resentful and bitter that he isn't doing as good as he knows he can do (IQ 135 and got accepted in to two Ivy Leagues, but left both due to ill health). Angry and hateful that literally everybody he knows including his younger siblings have gone on to bigger and better things whilst he is struggling to even get out of bed in the morning. 

What would Dr Peterson say to this guy?I'm looking for a new job at the moment (thanks, Peterson) and got invited to do a one-way video interview on Friday where you have 1 take to record your answer. I'm high in negative emotion and this was my first interview in many years, which may explain why halfway through answering the first question I panicked, closed the app and therefore sent a blank answer to the interviewer. After this, I felt horrifically ashamed of myself, deleted the app and carried on my job search. 

Today, I've been listening to the Jocko podcast where Peterson talks about the man who was afraid of needles and how he managed to overcome it. How you have to make the active choice to face your fears. I ended up re-downloading the app and completing the interview. I know I sent a blank question and I'm aware that doing an interview covered in sweat post workout 1 hour before the deadline probably isn't going to result in any shiny new job offers, but I faced my fear, and damn it felt good.So I watched Crumb a couple nights ago. For those who are unaware, it‚Äôs a documentary about a guy who started the underground comic movement, Peterson has mentioned it in a number of his lectures, which is what led me to watch it. 

When he references the documentary, he usually says, ‚ÄúIf you want to know how a serial rapist thinks, if you watch that movie and really pay attention, you‚Äôll know.‚Äù Well that piqued my interest. I thought that would be useful to know in terms of further developing a coherent picture of my capacity for evil, my ‚Äúshadow.‚Äù

But after watching it I can‚Äôt really say I‚Äôm sure what Peterson was referring to. Crumb‚Äôs mind was certainly twisted and warped in a lot of ways, particularly with regard to his view of women and sex, but he wasn‚Äôt a rapist. 

Anyone else here watch it and care to shed some light on the subject?I'm about to turn 26.

I grew up a bitter, angry, sometimes violent young man. Most of this came from bad relationships and disrespect for my teachers and school administration.

When I went to college it just got worse. I became possessed by bitterness, cynicism, hatred, and criticism of everything.

I sabotaged my education, my social life, my family out of this mindset and lifestyle.

At my worst I was alcoholic at only 23.

Well, I kicked that habit.

I got myself back in college at 24. I'm getting myself on a career track in healthcare where there are plenty of jobs.

I've got friends again.

And I'm trying to fill my head with positive, productive thinking.

But I'm still possessed by this negative and bitter mindset.

I'm behind on all of my classes again this semester. My grades are constantly mediocre and I'm constantly only putting in 40% of the work I should be putting in.

Instead I'm always spending hours getting distracted by my thoughts. What's wrong with society. What's wrong with politics. What's wrong with women. What's wrong with old people. What's wrong with my family. What's wrong with this. What's wrong with that. How I'm going to outsmart them, get them back, prove something to them.

THE THING IS. I'M CONSCIOUSLY AWARE THAT A LOT OF MY THOUGHTS ARE FALSE AND SELF-DEFEATING. But I just can't stop. **I can't stop thinking what I know is pointless. I know most of my problems are of my own doing. But I'm trying to kick something that is neurologically programmed into me at this point and I can't.**

Then, when I snap out of the spell the weekend is over and I haven't accomplished anything.

**It is neurologically programmed into me.**

It's like trying to kick a drug habit.

It was programmed into me at adolescence and young adulthood. Now my brain is basically done developing and I'm stuck with this default to bitterness and hatred whenever I have a problem.

Often I don't even have a problem at all. I'm just addicted to thinking cynically and criticizing things I guess because it gives me a sense of security that I've figured things out. That I've exposed all the shortcomings and bad behaviors of others. It just gives me a sense of power even though it's making me weak and pathetic. 

**How do I reprogram myself?**JP mainly reaches male audience but i'm a huge fan and have been trying to sort myself out. was wondering how i can apply his typically male archetypal hero narratives to my life?

already spend adequate time on appearance, fitness, diet. working full time now to save money for grad school for visual art. single and never been a relationship (intimacy issues re childhood, in therapy now). plan on moving cities for grad school so everything is my life is still very transitory. 

what else can i do to climb female dominance hierarchies/ my own "be better than who you were yesterday" comparison? what are any books, attitudes or quotes you guys recommend?Thought this would be interesting to share. Its from the website The Art of Manliness  based on the book *King, Warrior, Magician, Lover* by Jungian Psychologist Robert Moore and Author Douglas Gillette.

A not so great quality of the audiobook for *KWML* is available on youtube:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1523brduw4The other day I met this middle-aged woman in her 40s and 50s who I ate lunch with and had a very amicable conversation with. Right until our conversation got onto politics and she suddenly decided to go ahead and inform me, (her new friend), all about secret Russian hackers, that it was time for a female president, that it was a moral imperative for America to have more female leaders, and that Nazis were on the rise. 

I was so dumbfounded by the stream of completely false information coming from an erstwhile completely normal lady, I didn't respond with a single thing. I just let the conversation keep going, and the topic changed to female representation in schools. 

Apparently she had written her dissertation on the benefits of Title IX for women. Again, I was completely at loss for words. Title IX? Had she been asleep to the nonstop scandals for the past 4 years? Here I was more concerned with being polite than trying to school a middle aged lady. How the hell do you maintain a polite conversation with someone who demonstrates no awareness of the current events outside of the bubble? There was no way to oppose her without completely making a fool out of this sweet person. If her conversation partner had been any other student, they would have fallen for it.Dumb, irrational, trolls, virtue signaling. 

Peterson fans don‚Äôt argue ther ideas and instead spam counter arguments. Doesn't that make him a failure to some extent? After all, he wasn't chosen by a female to procreate. He wasn't deemed worthy of giving offspring to a female. He wasn't good enough, strong enough, whatever, to put it bluntly.

Obviously this is a pretty simplistic way of viewing things, and there are people who are physically weak and disgusting, and in spite of that are "chosen" by women to procreate. But I have to believe at some level, never reproducing, or never "being chosen" to reproduce means something.I hope you'll be receptive to this. I know [Peterson talks about Dostoevsky](https://youtu.be/esaES9LCihE?t=7) a lot, so I'm hoping more of you would know about his condition. I happen to suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy, much like the kind Dostoevsky suffered from in his life. The way Peterson describes Dostoevsky's seizures is quite similar to how I experience mine. Today I was working through the future authoring program and during that I had one of the most intense seizures I've ever experienced up to this point. It's very difficult to put into words what it was like but I'll try. 

I just finished writing out the part where you're encouraged to write stream-of-consciousness about your best possible future, and began to get into the same mindset to start with my worst case scenario. Just before I was about to start, I was struck with my "aura" - a sort of feeling epileptic people can get before they're about to have a seizure. So I stopped writing and laid down on my bed to ride it out. What ensued was probably one of the most terrifying seizures I've had so far.

 *(aside: I've been dealing with them for about 3 years and have had them controlled with medication for the last two. My pharmacy switched me over to the generic brand last week, and I guess that might have done the trick.)*

It was like every emotion that I had bottled up about what was going wrong with my life came to the surface all at once. Everything I was about to write about seemed to surface up at the same time in this hellish vision of how bad my life could get. It wasn't so much a vision in the sense that I saw things (I know that sounds weird but epileptic fits are hardly logical), but more like...this overwhelming sense of intense psychedelic fear with a dash of crippling sorrow, while ideas kept flitting in and out of my head: homelessness, abandonment, isolation, loneliness...topics I definitely would have touched on for what I would have written in my authoring suite had it not happened.

I'm going to write it out there at some point but for now I'm taking a break. These seizures often have a spiritual bent to them. A lot of what Peterson said about Dostoevsky's seizures is very accurate to how I feel mine.

I just wanted to share this with you all here. It's a very rare type of a pretty rare condition so in a sense I feel blessed, which is kind of weird. Feel free to ask me anything about what the experience is like.This is probably the most impressive thing I find about JBP. he really is careful with his words. Often times in his lecture you will pause, you can his thinking, then he makes a statement.

It will be my goal to have that kind of control as opposed to just rattling things off without careful thinking.I've been going through the self authoring suite for a while now. I finished present authoring and am currently in the middle of past authoring. I'm finding that the past authoring is making me feel very bad about myself. I find myself hyper-critical and very embarrassed of my past actions, I feel like I'm reliving the worst periods of my life, and my self confidence feels like it's tanked. I'm finding it extremely difficult to get through (I can work on it for hours, feeling worse and worse, and that bar barely moves). These memories of the past weren't repressed, but I just rarely thought about them. I had felt as if they were laid to rest, but now they've returned, and it's made my sensitivity to negative emotion skyrocket recently.

Is this a normal consequence? Will it go away as I get further into the program? Has anyone else experienced this?I live near a capital city and theres about 3 different public libraries I have reasonably easy access to and maybe half a dozen if I use some automotive transport. Should i realistically expect to come up empty on 12 Rules since its so new and in high demand? How popular was maps of meaning in terms of sales in the US?**really jealous--tell me everything** Hi guys, first i want to say that i'm new to reddit, and this community, ok, i've been watching Dr. Peterson's videos and i like the idea of sorting my life, because i have been feeling bad for like 3 years now, i don't feel satisfied with my life, i feel like i can do better but i don't really do anything about it and i know i have to change.
Ok, i took the Understanding myself test and i feel like i answer honestly, so i want to share my results and see if someone can share his/her experience in changing their behaivor. I already know i have to change, i guess i just want more encouragement.

English is not my fisrt language, sorry for my grammar mistakes in advance.I was looking at the Google trends

And one thing that jumps out at me is that JP is more popular in the Nordics than would naturally be expected. 

The Nordics are not English-speaking, and with the exception of Iceland JP has never been there. It is quite counter-intuitive that JP is more viewed on YouTube by Norwegians than Canadians, for example. 

So why are countries like Norway, Sweden and Iceland so heavily consuming JP-content like there's no tomorrow? 
They are even more overrated in the YouTube's, which indicates that JP is just more compelling to them. 

Thoughts?I cleaned my room for the first time in 3+ years; it feels amazing. Thank you Jordan Peterson!Stories of dragons have been told for millennia, from Skyrim all the way back to St. George. Dragons are evil, monstrous creatures which hoard gold and capture innocent women. While dragons themselves do not exist, there is an aspect of slaying the dragon that plays true in our everyday lives. Dr. Jordan B. Peterson‚Äôs example of slaying the dragon combines with Hannah Arendt‚Äôs ideas of politics as action in the public realm.

Hannah Arendt writes on ancient Greek society that ‚Äú[w]hat prevented the polis from violating the private lives of its citizens and made it hold sacred the boundaries surrounding each property was not respect for private property as we understand it, but the fact that without owning a house a man could not participate in the affairs of the world because he had no location in it which was properly its own.‚Äù In this she has connected the public realm with that in the private in that one must have a determined private world in order to truly participate publicly in politics. She expands on politics as action, that which differentiates oneself from the polis and reveals to it their identity. She was also a student of Heidegger, who remarked on this notion in this way: ‚ÄúIn determining itself as an entity, Dasein always does so in the light of a possibility which it is itself‚Ä¶ [t]his undifferentiated character of Dasein‚Äôs everydayness is not nothing, but a positive phenomenal characteristic of this identity,‚Äù ‚ÄúDasein‚Äôs average everydayness, however, is not to be taken as a mere ‚Äòaspect‚Äô‚Ä¶ and Dasein comports itself towards it in the mode of average everydayness, even if this is only the mode of fleeing in the face of it and forgetfulness thereof.‚Äù Heidegger has established the authenticity of action the means in which one differentiates themself from unremarkable everydayness, as well as the notion of differentiating oneself as something that one might flee from. When one acts, they are truly free; but doing so is something that requires courage. This is why the private realm is so important; it is a realm which one has to himself and does not have to venture out and engage in politics for.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson explains the need to clean one‚Äôs room as a psychological phenomena in this context. Cleaning one‚Äôs room is the imposition of order upon chaos, a transformative Godlike action in which one establishes something which is necessarily theirs. This establishes the private realm which is crucial for participation in the public realm and engagement in politics. However, this latter thing is something frightening ‚Äì one must choose not to be cowardly and remain in the private realm or differentiated but do the courageous thing and venture out from their private realm and differentiate themself. In the same manner as St. George of legend and the Dovahkiin of Skyrim differentiate themselves for their heroic actions of slaying the dragon, when one acts in the public realm they slay their own dragon. But one cannot do this in reverse ‚Äì one cannot hope to slay a dragon if they cannot even keep their room clean. As Matthew 25:21 states, only after we have taken care of the little things can we be tasked with the responsibility of taking care of the big things.As I'm sure most of you are aware, there are some pretty horrifying videos out there that depict brutal tortures and executions. Even Reddit has its very own sub dedicated to these videos called r/watchpeopledie 

I, myself, have watched countless videos of these. I've seen all the worst ones and everything in between. They can be quite difficult to stomach to say the least. 

Peterson teaches us confront our shadow. To see just what evil humanity is capable of. I feel like watching these types of videos allow me to see that very spectacle up close and personal. At the very least, I am a witness to the innocent victims in these situations. 

Does anyone here watch these types of videos?  What are your thoughts?  Is this a healthy or unhealthy thing for your mental health?

its $30 and if its him reading it then I will definately buy it, it just feels different when its another reader so I wanted to know whether to buy audio vs textLess of his psychology or politics, more of a focus on his self help stuff, especially in regards to young men (which my friend is). Help would be appreciated.Found an interview from years ago where he claimed be taking antidepressants but he doesn't name the specific SSRI from what I gathered.  Only Wellbutrin was named.Alright to counter the idea, that we lobsters can't be critical of JP here are my top ten criticisms. 

1) He's an idealist, which sounds hard to believe considering how much time he spends destroying left wing ideals, but at the end of the day his entire world revolves around a very specific christian model of good and evil. His proposed "value structure" is at the pinnacle of everything he believes, and will not entertain the idea that it may not be all that useful. 

2) He doesn't believe in sensitivity, he believes everyone should hear the brutal truth and deal with objective reality, oh except for that god bit. This one really stands out when you realize how incredibly dependent he is on believing in free will. Tell Jordan Peterson that we live in a strongly deterministic world and he'll have a meltdown, and I mean literal meltdown. Why because everything he believes is heavily dependent on his subjective beliefs in free will. 


3) He hides behind his ability to talk. He's on occasion bragged about his very high verbal iq, and in his own words can out talk most other people. But at the end of the day means he'll never actually say what on his mind. See Peterson never flipflops on a topic, he "re-articulates" to a level of detail that means he never ever has to reveal what he actually means. 

4) He doesn't believe in fairness yet believes in a set of Christian moral claims. He's aggressively a stickler that christian morality has some fundamental claim on the universe, than completely glosses over arguments that would suggest that fairness is a intrinsic moral value. This is a big one since he fights for acknowledgement of biological inequalities between peoples, yet never ever thinks we should actually do something to correct or address those issues. 

5) He's big on naturalistic fallacy. I.e. because lobsters live in dominance hierarchies, that really reflects the intrinsic value of our own patriarchy. I'm not exactly a revolutionary on the topic, but it's important to point his entire world view regarding sociobiology is dependent on the idea that we still live in a somewhat natural environment. He's a strong believer in the inherent moral truth of evolution, and it's something to scratch your head at when you realize how intensively things have changed in the last 50 years and will continue to change in the near future.  

6) He completely hand waves the very real right wing behaviors that have caused things to get so polarized. Anti gay marriage, dismissive attitudes towards mental health, an absurd obsession with boot strapping despite all the scientific evidence suggesting the exact opposite etc. I'm first to admit that the left appears to be over reacting at times, but the idea that the right is ever gonna step up to the plate is an absolute joke. JP of course realizes this and has this bizarre obsession with the idea that the left should just play second fiddle until they land upon a viewpoint that the right  will tolerate. 

7) He's very defensive over people who lack compassion. This might have to do with the fact he has a son that by his own estimation ranks in the 5 percentile for compassion. Regardless of why he doesn't believe empathy compassion etc matter as long as people play by the rules(that he defines) and are conscientious. Because you know being compassionate is meaningless if your weak, because the strong will always have a higher moral virtue, because god can't make mistakes in the dominance hierarchy. 

8) He uses the scapegoat of the radical left for pretty much everything. This one might be a bit obvious but you really have to think how much he obsesses over a tiny portion of the population and uses them to scape goat a lot of the things that have been occurring because of the influence of big business etc. 

9) He knows nothing about the hard sciences and technology. He's an expert in his field no doubt, but when it comes to understanding the technical details of economics/technology there is good reason to say he's clueless. He'll talk your ear off about the "motivations" of left wing people but he hasn't the sweetest clue about anything beyond that shallow layer. His great understanding of economics is the pareto distribution, which is a bit of a joke because he transform it into a naturalistic fallacy all in one stroke. Things in nature randomly come about, but fails to grasp how much civilization revolves around working around this natural tendency. 

10) He is a hyper individualist, and equates any behavior oriented around collectivism as literally evil. In his mind things only go wrong when we group up into teams etc. That of course is a perfect valid point when you have an IQ over 145, and rank yourself in the 95 percentile for industriousness. However for us mortals group behavior is exactly how you compete in society. Surprise surprise he's arbitrarily decided that groups are bad, and only individuals should be rewarded in our society. 
Also to have references at hand and maybe add them to the community infoI have been observing this since the last two days. Whenever my body slouches or bands, I notice something at the base of my spine, arch of my back. I find it absolutely loathsome to stay in that position and I correct the posture. The difference in the feeling is palpable.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlrpSpwxgWw


It is clearly one of those meaningless terms that seems to be used as a magnet for all that one dislikes in the world without having to get specific.  Great for reactionaries on the right, but that is not something worth propping up.I have read plenty of misinformed and ignorant articles on Jordan, but I'm genuinely curious if there's any good criticisms of him and what he says.

Eg. He talks about Jung's work like it's fact despite plenty of it being rather mystical and unable to be proven through the scientific method.I write this because ive heard him bring it up a couple of times lately and what he seems to say is that a man who can not do wrong can not do right/good either.

I would consider myself rather calm and have (almost) never broken rules in school or at home. I have only had a small handfull of anger outburst or fights. It is not in my nature to break rules as im quite strict and orderly or be physically violent even though im not weak per se.

What i think im asking is this. How dangereous does a man has to be for him to truly do good in his life and in the world?

Sorry if this is not coherent, writing is not my strength. I can try and explain it further if needed.Any favourites? I personally think Tool are perfect for JBP material (biased as they've been my favourite band since I was a pre-teen): Notable tracks:

* [Lateralus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awYc9xvqnv0)
* [Right in Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrx9IJToFmg)
* [Vicarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLLhbwOU5iQ)I've heard Jordan Peterson talk about having an illness and not being able to eat certain food, but what disease is this?title is self explanatory, going through a weird thing 5 months post break-up and this (if it exists) will be the holy grail.I understand that Identity Politics has been around since the 70's but it has grown massively over the past decade and especially in younger people or millennials. I was wondering if this could be tied to the long term use of social media by this cohort especially as they use this media through late childhood and adolescence a time when the brain is highly plastic and your identity is being shaped. Essentially online via social media platforms these adolescents have a huge amount of control over how they wish to be perceived and can more or less construct and project any identity they wish to online and be certain to find a supportive community. 

In the real world this is a much harder, if not impossible to do. We have little control over how others perceive us and for older generations this was something we had to accept aside from the usual identity signaling via clothing, make up etc. I think that as we grew older we clung less to the idea of projecting a particular identity and accepted that only a few people would ever really get us or see us fully. 

It sees that there is a demand now from younger people that we see them as they see themselves rather than how we perceive them independently and I wonder if this might be an effect of social media bleeding through into the real life where we don't have the same control? 
I just finished 12 Rules For Life and I really enjoyed it. There was one paragraph in particular that I cannot stop thinking about in Rule 7:

&gt;...To have meaning in your life is better than to have what you want, because you may neither know what you want, nor what you truly need. Meaning is something that comes upon you, of its own accord. You can set up the preconditions, you can follow meaning, when it manifests itself, but you cannot simply produce it, as an act of will. Meaning signifies that you are in the right place, at the right time, properly balanced between order and chaos, where everything lines up as best it can at that moment. 

This profound statement has struck a chord with me for a variety of reasons. This line of thinking -- that meaning manifests itself -- seems contradictory to modern thought process. For me, modern thinking would say if there was meaning, it should be apparent, it should be ever present, and it should be unchanging. Like the laws of physics or the material world, meaning should be predictable. I think finding that meaning is unlike the material world leads to nihilism or the rejection of meaning. 

It is easy to write off manifested meaning as absurd. Because there is no universal meaning, it is easy to conclude that life has no meaning and therefore you are free to create your own meaning. I believe Camus wrote (and please forgive me if i mischaracterize it) that you must continue to live even though there is no meaning in life. Life is absurd and there is an apparent contradiction that you must accept. Isn't this just philosophical suicide?

I cannot help but think that the idea that there is no meaning is like not seeing the tree for the forest (I know it's usually "not seeing the forest for the trees"). Meaning is like Hiedegger's Hermeneutic circle. Individual things are compared to the whole and the whole compared to the individual, except that the Being that is doing the comparison will eventually cease to be. We relate a pencil to the objects it interacts with and understand its meaning based on both the pencil and the paper. But, a pencil can just a soon be a tool to stab and all of a sudden it has a different meaning. 

I think Jordan Peterson is really onto something significant with this perception of meaning (or maybe it just resonates with me for some reason). Still haven't had time to read more than chapter 1 due to work and class... Will probably be delayed further as I clean my roomJP just tweeted 

https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/963069090104451072

"Ctrl-left... That's a good one."

I have liked this term since I first heard it a few months ago. It's a perfect antidote to "alt-right". Control is of course what many on the left are trying to do. I hope it will catch on, now he has publicised it to his 452k followers. So I just did my Big 5 Personality test and got these scores for all the following, just looking for tips and advice for job occupation.  Here are the results.

Just looking for feedack on this, thanks for any responses I may get.



~CmoHello, fellow lobsters,

I've been lurking for a little while now and enjoying the discussions, I feel like this is a great community and so I wanted to ask for some help from somewhat likeminded people.

I've listened to a good portion of Dr Petersons lectures online and quite a few of his political videos. A while back I watched a snippet of his views on postmodernism and why/how it should be tackled, here's the video for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf2nqmQIfxc

When I watched it originally I didn't really understand the postmodernist movement and admittedly I don't think I have that much of an understanding of it still. I've tried to understand the movement and see the views of both sides and try to see the points that Peterson makes.

When I originally delved into philosophy I looked at different philosophies and existentialism was the one that I looked into the most. I had a fairly positive view of a lot of the French intellectuals, Sartre, Camus etc. This was because a lot of the ideas helped me traverse the questions I had about the world and my justification for carrying on. From the study I have done recently, a lot of the ideas and content that I enjoy are described as postmodernist, not from my own observations but from those who explain it well and often bring a lot of clarity and insight, a specific example is of Wisecracks analysis of the humour of Monty Python:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFANgWN2Ul0

I've found myself at a bit of an impasse and I'm not sure which way to go. I highly admire Dr Peterson but I also found the ideas accompanied by existentialism to be far more real than most of the values that I've come across. I don't want to submit myself to entirely agreeing with Dr Peterson 100% time but I also don't want to be complacent in my worldview based purely on how comfortable it is.

my question/plea for advice, can anyone explain post-modernism in laymen's terms? Am I being too dogmatic in either of my views? Have you been in a similar situation before and what did you do?Heyooo does anyone know where to find the multi-variable analysis that JBP refers to in the channel 4 interview? I'm greatly interested to see the 19 things he's referring to. I know there was agreeableness etc. Pls help.Hello, 

Is there a reason that JBP does not engage with metaphysics? I have been reading Edward Feser's "Scholastic Metaphysics" (widely regarded as one of the best Aristotelian-Thomistic philosophers at present) and am curious if there are any other travelers who have tried to integrate some of JBP's insights within an explicitly non-naturalistic metaphysical worldviewI see in a media posts for example the vice interview that 12 rules is a "manual for young men" is this the case. I'm halfway through the book and I think the rules apply to everyone lol.&gt;When someone opposes you, it is very tempting to oversimplify, parody, or distort his or her position. This is a counterproductive game, designed both to harm the dissenter and to unjustly raise your personal status. By contrast, if you are called upon to summarize someone‚Äôs position, so that the speaking person agrees with that summary, you may have to state the argument even more clearly and succinctly than the speaker has even yet managed. If you first give the devil his due, looking at his arguments from his perspective, you can (1) find the value in them, and learn something in the process, or (2) hone your positions against them (if you still believe they are wrong) and strengthen your arguments further against challenge. This will make you much stronger. Then you will no longer have to misrepresent your opponent‚Äôs position (and may well have bridged at least part of the gap between the two of you).  -*12 Rules for Life*It was mentioned by Lauren Southern on Stefan Molyneux's podcast as they discussed the [slaughter of white farmers in Africa.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TfAq3LrIjg).

I'm a little more than halfway done with JP's book, 12 Rules For Life, but I've seen many of his lectures and it's truly astounding what was being said on this matter one year short of a century ago.

[Here's an annotated PDF version which may be easier to read as well as understand with the provided annotations](https://storage.googleapis.com/dentonbible-org/www/Gods-commentary.pdf).

I want to mention that 'copybook headings' refer to the snippets of wisdom kids were made to copy when practicing their handwriting.

    AS I PASS through my incarnations in every age and race,
    I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place.
    Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall,
    And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.

    We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn
    That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn:
    But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind,
    So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.

    We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace,
    Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place,
    But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come
    That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.

    With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,
    They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;
    They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;
    So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things.

    When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace.
    They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.
    But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe,
    And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "Stick to the Devil you know."

    On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life
    (Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife)
    Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,
    And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "The Wages of Sin is Death."

    In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all,
    By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul;
    But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy,
    And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "If you don't work you die."

    Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew
    And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true
    That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four
    And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.

    As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man
    There are only four things certain since Social Progress began.
    That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire,
    And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;

    And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins
    When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins,
    As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn,
    The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!

I have been trying to keep up but he has been all over the place these past few weeks. I know I have missed a few and I can't even figure out which ones since searching his name has become a shitshow of clips and reaction vids.Buy the audio book for petes sake, hear this man deliver it. It's like nothing you've ever heard.It seems to me, and some people on this sub to be the most problematic stuff he's said so far. Coming from handling the channel 4 interview so well to this seems really odd. Why hasn't he made a comment or addressed the material yet? This is not my area of interest, but I inquired into it to see if Jordan really was dishonest. To me, he was honest in telling he could not answer at the spot. He did show reverence to the difficulty of quickly and accurately answering an infected question. Am I wrong?

*Jordan Peterson says 'I can't do it' when asked about Jewish Influence*:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqtPsEXZTec

I saw someone taking this video as part of a reason to bash him.

(The other one was this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXVDtICVwMA - *Jordan Peterson on the subject of anti-semitism*)

I do not remember the video discussing these, but it was claimed Jordan was dishonest and did not practice his advice of telling the truth. To me, he simply declined because he, first had not read the source the argument was based on (but offered to do so), and second I recognize the challenge of formulating a clear answer to an issue that probably is very multifaceted. 

One guy with seemingly good reflection (have not watch it all yet): *On Jordan Peterson's Refusal to Address the JQ During a NY Talk*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAQNFi6ZLhk

Edit: Here he JP do adress *similar* question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56UmHs_6CfsI followed JP since the US presidential election and I am a huge fan. But I'm not comfortable with how he uses the word psychopath

I watched his biblical lectures. And in one of his lectures he refer to the documentary ‚ÄùCrumb‚Äù (about the ‚ÄùFritz the cat‚Äù cartoonist). And he urges everyone to see it to get an understanding about ‚Äùpsychopathy‚Äù. And since I'm a Crumb fan and interested in psychopathy/autism I watched it (free on youtube).

Now I'm not a clinical psychologist (whose expertise is to diagnose people) but I have some experience in working with people with autism (social work) and I can determine by simple looking at the Crumb brothers that all 3 of them have severe autism and not psychopathy. How can I, as a layman come up with that? Well it is obvious that at least 2 of them are suffering from fragile-x syndrome simply by looking at them. Defects on the x-chromosome is the strongest indication there is on autism.

‚ÄùAutism‚Äù has had an interesting journey. Hans Asperger defined it as an subgroup to psychopathy ‚Äùinfantile psychopathy‚Äù, A few years in the early 70's it had moved to schizophrenia in DSM classification before it got moved again (but not in France, french doctors still treats it as an psychosis), recently ‚Äùautism‚Äù and ‚Äùasperger‚Äù got grouped together in a new category.

The only thing we can say for certain about autism (and psychopathy) is that ‚Äùwe don't know what the hell it is ‚Äù. I've seen JP use the word psychopath several times eg. about columbine high. But almost all school-shooters have had autism with clearly visible fragile-x syndrome.

I'm not saying he is wrong. That's why I use the word comfortable. I just think we must discuss more careful because we know so little.

He also draws parallels between Oidipus and the brothers relationship with there mom. Well if I'm right about the brothers and fragile-X (I am), that means they inherited there damaged chromosome from the mother (boys can only get X from mother). That would indicate that she to has autism. And far more likely that it is a relationship formed by autism and not Oidipus complex.


You can read about fragile-x here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X_syndromeI'm a clinical psychologist and I want to do the Self-Authoring Suite, and have my clients do it at the same time.  Does anyone know any current promo codes for the Self-Authoring Suite?  I'm ready to buy, but for a promo code, don't know if there are any current discounts out there, other than the 2 for 1 deal.I asked this question a few days ago on another subreddit, and nobody has able to provide me with a case where he explicitly answers. It has become something of a topic of debate in my social circle, and the fact that Peterson can't seem to answer such a simple question starts to look like deliberate obfuscation.

Does Jordan Peterson *actually believe* in God? Is he a deist, or a theist, or neither?

Is there anywhere where he gives a straight forward answer to this question, and not just "it's all metaphors and that depends on what you mean by believe."Anyone bought the paid version? What did you like about it and is it worth buying? Ive taken the free online versions before (bls.gov might even have a version, not sure about that).I've been binging Jordan Peterson videos and I really enjoy listening to his views; however, many of the persons he's debated about gender, the left, and group identity have been kind of uninformed about relevant research literature and various areas Jordan's expertise. I mostly agree with him, but I'm still interested to hear someone debate him who has a similar background but more or less different views. Are there any discussions of Peterson with individuals in his clinical psychology field or other relevant fields who disagree with him and can actually deliver an informed argument? I'm not interested in listening to him and Sam Harris debate the value of religion.  I decided to start watching his lectures-which part should be my first? Also, what do you people want to "achieve" or get with listening to his lectures?Was checking out r/enoughpetersonspam and boy oh boy it got me fired up. Obviously I wanted to butt in on every single comment but I restrained. 

A recurring theme was that essentially all of us hate Muslims, hate women, or really everyone besides white men, and generally we are bat shit insane people that want to screw others over.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm from a metropolitan area, was a stem undergrad and now going to grad school with a long term girlfriend. I‚Äôve got one white best friend and the rest are literally first generations immigrants(but they‚Äôre Chinese and Hungarian so they don‚Äôt count;). I‚Äôve got an amazing normal family who never discusses politics. Bottom line is I feel like I‚Äôm a pretty normal put together person.

So yea it just irks me that people think supporters are ubiquitously alt-right. You guys aren‚Äôt truly crazy right? New to following Peterson This evening I went to a local charity seeking an opportunity to volunteer for a mental health charity. I have been so inspired by JBP that I have decided to pursue a career as a therapist, so this is the way people usually start in the UK at least. 

They had a selection criteria which said: '...and willing to fight all forms of oppression'. So I asked about the theoretical framework that informed the term oppression. The response I got was that we are all susceptible to prejudice and the diversity training will be going through what we would be expected to adhere to the organisational policy. 

Alarm bells went off in my head and I realised that the diversity training was going to be exactly what JBP was raising. 

Maybe someone can tell me I am being paranoid or can offer me some advice? I am tempted to write to the organisation and ask for a break down of what the diversity component of the training is about, then I can offer my polite perspective from a more informed position. Thoughts?Does anyone have good reads? I watched the H3 podcast in which Peterson explains the importance of reading. Right now I'm reading some self-improvement books and afterwards I want to start reading The Gulag Archipelago and War and Peace (which I for some reason stopped reading after 100 pages few years ago).

The books should have an intellectual character or have an important role in literature.Im sure thats a good thing overall, but the ome library w the most copies told me they will be ordering more to help suffice the high demand....im in a small state so i am a little surprised at the interest overall. No copies of Maps of Meaning in the state, but ill live with the lectures in the meantime....i guess i should just purchase my own copy of 12 Rules :o)Listening to one of Peterson's biblical lectures the other day and couldn't help but think how cool it would be to have a psychologist like him. He told a story of how was working with a young girl who was capable of lucid dreaming. In this girls dream, she said she could literally ask the characters what they were trying to teach her and they would say it. 

Peterson then was able to hypnotize this girl and bring forth these characters in a trance so she was able to learn more about her unconscious. 

That would be freaking amazing. I can't imagine how much a person could learn about themselves with that kind of therapy and I would be willing to pay good money for something like that. Except, I wouldn't know the first place to start when looking for something like that. [Land or Death: Mandela's Failed Rainbow Nation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8-G9hMY-qk)

[The Reality of South African Farm Murders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCLJRVbaMyQ)

People are being butchered in Marxist-esque ideologically-driven class-based hatred. Farmland is going to be seized and redistributed. 
To say this is disturbing and horrifying is beyond understatement. This is actually happening, *right now*.


But what struck me was that the structure of the situation - the stated intentions of the government, the rhetoric held by radicals, and the practical real-life scenario - mirrors the kind of impending ideological horrorscape that JBP refers to; the kind seen in The Gulag Archipelago, etc. It's the Ukranian farmers all over again.


What do you think?

I hear Peterson use it often, but his exact meaning is unclear to me. He seems at pains to be precise with his language, but this phrase comes across as nebulous to me. Post Modern may refer to the idea that all interpretations are valid. Neo Marxist would seem to refer to any proponent of a mixed economy, as opposed to pure capitalism. Is this what he means?&gt;"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in **awe**, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed. This insight into the mystery of life, coupled though it be with fear, has also given rise to religion. To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms‚Äî this knowledge, this feeling, is at the center of true religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I belong in the ranks of devoutly religious men." - Albert Einstein

---------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

The following is an interview on a topic that to me seems like the most profound and relevant yet often underappreciated idea that Prof. Peterson has spoken about.

The interview took place last year during a segment of a Patreon conversation and has not been published previously.

A minute long clip of several excerpts taken from this conversation can be [heard here](https://soundcloud.com/theta_tau/a-conversation-with-prof-jordan-b-peterson-on-awe-excerpts).

Some of my own questions have been slightly rearranged and rephrased for clarity and readability. Prof. Peterson's comments are pretty much all verbatim. My few annotations in {} brackets.

&amp;nbsp;

---------------------------------------------------

**Me**: Hi Dr. Peterson, pleasure to meet and speak with you.

**JBP**: Nice to meet you.

**Me**: I would like to talk to you about a topic that's been fascinating me considerably for awhile now, and hearing you talk about it has been quite insightful: that topic is the experience of awe.

**JBP**: Aha!

**Me**: Specifically, the following [section of your 11th Maps of Meaning 2017 lecture beginning at 51m48s](https://youtu.be/T4fjSrVCDvA?t=51m48s) really caught my attention:

&gt;*"you look at what transcends your current reality and what inspires awe, so god exists where awe is experienced"*

&gt;*"if you exist within a conceptual structure and you encounter {that} which is outside of it, you will feel awe, the transcendent value in that which inspires awe. ... ultimate transcendent value is capacity to generate order out of chaos"*

Being both an atheist and curious of my own experiences of awe, I looked at the scientific literature on the effect that awe has on humans, and I find the significance of your description of this psychological phenomenon complements the current research very well.

For example, it has been shown that an (often even a relatively mild) awe stimulus can:

* [increase ethical decision-making of individuals within broader social contexts and enhance collective concern](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspi0000018.pdf)

* [increase generosity and altruism, especially in high social status individuals](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspi0000018.pdf)

* [more so than emotions of pride or amusement, lead people to cooperate, share resources, sacrifice oneself for others](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspi0000018.pdf)

* [reduce feelings of entitlement](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspi0000018.pdf)

* [increase the feeling of the presence of something greater and of being connected with the world](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930600923668)

* [increases resistance to bad arguments through an increase in systematic rather than heuristic thinking, unlike most other positive emotions](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0018421)

* [increases accuracy of memory recall by making it less likely for memory to be influenced by implicit prejudicial factors](https://youtu.be/uW8h3JIMmVQ?t=20m28s)

* [embeds the individual self in a social identity](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930600923668)

* [regulates inflammation (cytokine) response to a healthy level](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-01796-001)

* [helps persist longer on difficult puzzle tasks and increases originality](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_do_we_feel_awe)

* [lowers impatience and leads to a greater willingness to donate time](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612438731)

* [leads to greater momentary life satisfaction](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612438731)

* [attenuates materialistic desires via a stronger preferences for experiential versus material goods](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612438731)

With all this in mind, shouldn't we as a society place more importance on the encouragement of the experience of awe, as at least a part of a solution to today's societal problems?

**JBP**: Well I think that's partly what artists and religious leaders should be doing, and orators and educators, yes, definitely. I just sent you a paper, you might be interested in it, it goes into some of the underlying [neurophysiology and evolutionary roots of the experience](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3061318/).

**Me**: For example, shouldn't we attempt to survey awe-inducing experiences across cultures from around the world, whether involving music, art, or other means, to try to find the most effective ones, and perhaps then take what we learned even invent new ones? Shouldn't awe induction in that sense be a major role for religion, in a way that would allow it to usefully revivify itself?

**JBP**: I think if religion was to revivify itself, that would be one of the most powerful ways it could do it. The question is whether you can do that as part of a conscious plan, you know I mean obviously the cathedrals were built to do exactly that, and the pipe organs, and the stained glass, and the singing and all of that, was there to evoke precisely the emotion that you're describing, and that was something that was more important, or let's say at least as important as the sountrack to a movie is to the movie. Well, I also think we lose beauty in our surroundings at our peril, architectural beauty and that sort of thing, it's lacking, sorely lackin in modern cities, and I do think that that contributes heavily to the general sense of modernist nihilism because there isn't anything in the immediate environment that's enobling and uplifing.

**Me**: Exactly, and it seems that neither we as a society, nor our leaders and politicians recognize the importance and beneficial qualities of this experience, nor are actively encouraging the research into it.

**JBP**: Agreed. Never! Never happens. You'd think Canadians were completely blind to beauty.

**Me**: So given the problems we have today in the West, especially in Europe at the moment regarding integration and the [failures of multiculturalism](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/western-europe/failure-multiculturalism), it shocks me that for example even something as simple as gathering immigrant kids and ethnic European kids, and have them watch a sunset or sunrise together, something so intrinsically awe inducing in its nature, is not encouraged or explored.
I don't find that we understand and value the potential long-term beneficial effects of such experiences. This is causing a lot problems in terms of developing a sense of shared identity.
It seems to me the culture with a high appreciation and capacity for induction of awe, will be more be cabable of effectively forming social bonds with and absorbing members of another, even one perhaps initially significantly different culture.

**JBP**: It's a great research hypothesis. You know it would be very interesting to see what a shared awe experience would do to members of politically or religiously diverse organizations, it's an interesting idea as a practical process, innovation by which you could fix something. Yes, it's a very interesting idea.

**Me**: Being European, I find we have a dire need for unifying experiences that despite your cultural or racial background can unify and sort of place individuals on some shared psychological plane of meaning &amp; identity, and thus implicitly provide a sense of trust and togetherness.

**JBP**: Yeah well I think part of the reason that the EEC is a failure as a political unit is because it has no rituals or mechanisms, I mean its like "Well this is good for you practically and economically," well first of all that's debatable, especially if you're in the lower {economic strata}.

**Me**: It's a purely rationalist structure, in a related way to how you talk about totalitarian dictatorships of the last century were an imposition of a rationalist structure.

**JBP**: Yeah, right, so that just doesn't speak to people at all. The devil is in the details, I don't know how you go about promoting that except to make the kind of case that you just made... Who you talk to about that, that's a completely unsolved problem, but to be able to have an intelligent discussion about the functional utility of beauty and of awe, that's at least a start, at least you can make a case for it that way.

**Me**: You almost have to induce it to convince any given person of its value.

**JBP**: Yes, and the other problem too is that some people are much more susceptible to experiences of that sort than others. And those are generally open people, they tend not to be conservative.

**Me**: [Right](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760500510833), and at the same time you said that often psychedelic experiences, for example, reliably [increase trait openness](
http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881111420188) in people.

**JBP**: Yes they do.

**Me**: Is it because of the awe experience that is potentially contained within it and induced by a positive psychedelic experience?

**JBP**: That's a good question, I don't think people know why, but obviously thats linked to it in some manner... Yes, the effects of that seem to be very positive.

**Me**: So despite the enormous progress we have made in the last couple of hundred years, I find people within modern society are frequently affected by a sense of nihilism, [alienation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/connections/200905/epidemic-loneliness), resentment, [depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20110726/richer-countries-have-higher-depression-rates), [anxiety](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rewired-the-psychology-technology/201706/the-anxiety-epidemic), and [narcissism](https://youtu.be/w7Q7wTt4IbA?t=14m8s), amidst increasing [socio-political polarization](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) and a realization of the [limits of reason and rationality](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds).
Shouldn't society therefore, in the most optimal sense, contain some opportunity for socially binding experiences, whether via religion or otherwise, as a way help alleviate and perhaps overcome these ills? Experiences which take advantage of all the psychological benefits of awe I listed previously?

**JBP**: Yes, yes. The other thing that's happened to modern people, is that they don't see the sunset, and they don't see the night sky. Those are experiences that were available to anybody that was reasonably close to nature, and it's a real loss not to have that.

**Me**: Right. I find we have small pockets of that today, for example within non-mainstream music scenes or at events like Burning Man. There the use of very powerful soundsystems, capable of generating low frequencies that [mimic](http://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.4799137) the [sensation of touch](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273229711000025) on one's skin through vibration, is often coupled with sophisticated lightshows and immersive projected visuals. All this combined can lead to the production of intense sensory experiences, where in the presence of others one can get that feeling of being humbled before something, at least from a psychological point of view, 'greater' than oneself.

**JBP**: Yeah, well that's why there has been such a hunger, I think, over the last fifty years for collective musical experiences, because those are the only places that people regularly go to now, with the possible exceptions of movies and theaters, to have that collective experience of awe that certainly rock concerts or dance events {can provide}.
Because it should be allied with something, right, that's the other thing is that it shouldn't be just, I don't mean allied in an ideological manner, but it shouldn't be just in some sense content-free awe.

**Me**: Yes I agree, there should be a context, where, for example, one has the opportunity to be presented with symbolic representations of archetypical roles that from a psychological point of view are useful and encouraging. Examples of personification of heroic behavior, such as the figure that goes out, confronts chaos in the world, that you speak of. So a ritualized admiration of a projected ideal that can embody--once again, from at least a purely psychological point of view--a set of common transcendent values of a culture.
Perhaps a religion of the future in its best potential form should provide such a context, and furthermore, in the present era, perhaps we should look to utilize what the latest modern technology--such as Virtual Reality--can offer to this end, in an analogous way to how pipe organs and stained glass were intended to be used in cathedrals in previous times that you mentioned?

**JBP**: Yes, yes... I actually went to a conference on awe 5 years ago, one of the people that was there was the guy that was running Psylocybin experiments at Johns Hopkins, so there are people, and there is a society I think in California, I could find out, that is very interested in exactly this sort of thing.
{I believe the researcher Prof. Peterson is referring to is [Roland Griffiths](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/1311852/roland-griffiths)}

**Me**: Yeah, very interesting. So my final conclusion from all this: people should seek and encourage **awe spaces, not safe spaces**.

**JBP**: Yes! That's what a University should provide too, cause I mean the other place that you can reliably come in contact with something that is awe-inspiring is literature, and philosophy, and great literature is awe-insipring, thats the best possible definition of great literature.

**Me**: Yes, I absolutely agree. And there is a cognitive, phenomenological difference I think between that and the group experience of awe, since the latter plays on all the primate psychology of experiencing something together in a group, being confronted by something (often physically) greater than ourselves, and consequently  bonding to a degree over this experience as a result.

**JBP**: Yeah, well we know very little about how necessary collective experiences of that sort are to bind a collective. But they are necessary, and the fact that we lost them is definitely a catastrophe. I mean we picked up some of that, because music definitely binds people, and does provide a bit of a cultural skeleton for people.

**Me**: So should we talk more to politicians or religious leaders that these experiences should be considered seriously, and that perhaps we need to put more effort into researching and promoting these sorts of experiences?

**JBP**: That's a whole different question, that's a marketing question, that's a tough one you know, it isn't obvious...

**Me**: Thank you for the conversation.

Did I miss this?  Anyone else hear about this?The FOG stands for Fear, Obligation, and Guilt. Its a website that helps people to understand and deal with others who suffer from personality disorders. This should definitely be useful not only for fortifying yourself against the tactics of abusive people within a personal context but also politically because politics tends to attract a subset of disordered individuals looking to manipulate and abuse others.

Something i've found particularly useful is their top 100 traits of Personality Disordered individuals. Not only as a tool to spot in others but also for self-reflection.

http://outofthefog.website/traitsDisclaimer: Stop crying because I used the word soyboy(the title might or might not be a joke depending on how much of a pussy you are), thats what a soy boy would do.

Once again I am really surprised by a lack of nuance in the way people think. This time even more disappointed because it manifested itself in the users of this subreddit. 

After the whole JP saying that makeup actually mimics natural signals to men that men that a woman is aroused and it may very well be one of the reasons why there are higher instances of sexual harassment in the workplace. 

To those who are nuanced in their way of thinking can clearly see that JP is merely pointing out the fact that what makeup does and how it might influence the behaviors of people. Nothing more objective could be said on this topic. 

However many JP fans were surprised on how Jp could say such a thing. 

Really? REALLY!? 

Did JP say women should not be allowed to wear makeup? 

Did JP say women wearing makeup makes then bad people? 

Is pointing out facts really that controversial nowadays. Some people sadly members of this sub think JP was advocating the banning of makeup and what not. IS THAT REALLLY WHAT YOU GUYS THINK HE SAID?

Or is it your internalized feminism stopping you from thinking about difficult topics that are related to women. [Human service work, gender and antidepressant use: a nationwide register-based 19-year follow-up of 752 683 women and men](http://oem.bmj.com/content/early/2018/01/25/oemed-2017-104803)

Kudos to r/prettygoodfixie for the post - [link to r/Psychology discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/7xg4mf/men_working_in_human_services_occupations_like/)

&gt;The hazard of antidepressant use was **higher among men working in human service versus all other occupations with the same skill/occupational level** (1.22, 95%‚ÄâCI 1.18 to 1.27), but **this was not the case for women** (0.99, 95%‚ÄâCI 0.98 to 1.01). The risks differed between professions: male health and social care professionals (including medical doctors, nurses, practical nurses and home care assistants), social workers, childcare workers, teachers and psychologists had a higher risk of antidepressant use than men in non-human service occupations, whereas customer clerks had a lower risk.

fascinating manifestation of what appears to be gender-based differences at the personality level. open questions remain: to what degree is this a function of familiarity with medication? less perceived stigma associated with use of medication? self-selection of individuals high in neuroticism?

So now if I exit the page and shut the computer down, is the purchase still avalaible ?

You have to be careful of women. They conceal their feelings and even entice you into a closer acquaintance so they can strike. It's their MO. They can't physically overpower you so they get you to drop your guard then go for your throat.

I have a story.

I was in college doing a foundation course to attend University. I got acquainted with a tutor, a middle aged woman a little older than me. We talked as adults and during these exchanges she informed me that her teenage son had died and she had subsequently divorced from his father although they had another child, a daughter. She talked about her ex-husband telling me how he was a good provider but I'd read that marriages can find it difficult to survive the death of a child. I explained to her the circumstances of my deciding to return to education and how in becoming deconstructed after a breakdown I'd realised I needed to strive to become a Man. She was visibly uncomfortable with this and I sensed a change in her although I couldn't put my finger on it. One day we needed to go to the city to visit the University Library attached to the college and she gave me a lift. She was anxious behind the wheel and during a maneuver she became aggravated at another driver. I tried to reassure her and called the other driver a fool but she said something that really made an impression on me, she said, "it was because he was a Man". Time went by and she continually tried to explore my character. I could sense she was being dissimulating but I didn't feel suspicious or judge her, it just felt strangely odd and surreptitiously intrusive so I became cautious. During one of our conversations the issue of Feminism came up and she asked me in the context of what I'd began to see as the more unjustly critical aspects of feminism if I was 'angry' at women. This was due to me getting a sense that there was some expressions of feminism that seemed to be virulently against the notion that Men are attracted to women, as if it illustrated something malign in the nature of Males. I admitted that this made me angry and she became very remote from this point on.

It later transpired that on the basis of this conversation she suspected me of being sexually deviant and I presume, a potential rapist. The faculty in the college colluded with her when I made it obvious I was avoiding her realising she was dangerous. My actions in this respect mortified her and she brought her colleagues into the vendetta. I tolerated this till the end of the course because I wanted to go to Uni but when it was complete I approached the faculty and told them I wanted to begin an official grievance procedure against the College, the faculty and this woman in particular. It was a private meeting with a student liason officer who knew about what had happened (everyone did). What happened then didn't surprise me but served to inform my future attitude regarding the culture in Higher Education. He told me point blank that if I instigated a grievance procedure with a view to holding the College responsible they would withhold my qualification to attend University the following year. He blackmailed me to drop it.

My take away from this was that she had been severely disturbed by the death of her son and in some way had come to hold Men, beginning with her husband, responsible. She was also heavily involved in Women's Studies and during our familiar period I asked if I could attend this out of curiosity and she told me that Men weren't allowed. I had a powerful impression this was a deliberate policy so they could revel in anti-male rhetoric and the demonisation of Men. The actions of her colleagues, some of them men, made me realise you can't rely on these people and it is despicable that these people are able to influence the thoughts and minds of impressionable young people who pass through the education system. There was clear examples of racism as well and all of this and more has convinced me that Boys and Men are under a sustained and covert attack to undermine and destroy Male confidence, sense of reality and coherence of Self.There's not enough Light in this sub and far too much Heat.GreyEnlightenment's Quote:

&gt;Dr. Jordan Peterson in his videos mentions several times that being born with a 3-standard deviation IQ (&gt;145) is better than being born in a family with a 3-standard deviation wealth,

==

I don't know what is a 3-standard deviation wealth, but as I have written before, sometimes wealth can trump all intelligence. After all, during the days of monarchy, extremely smart people often worked under a complete moron.

In my opinion, even the smartest person on earth would be no match to someone having a wealth of , not even 1 billion; maybe 100 million would be enough.

Someone with a wealth of , say, $10 million can easily bury a poor genius of, say, IQ 135. As seen in the immortal movie "Atonement", which should be seen as how the Upper Class maintains itself, in England poorer people with higher intelligence were easily culled. It had a long tradition - Thomas Hardy's Jude or DH Lawrence's Sons and Lovers are like that too. (Incidentally, neither of them reproduced.)

Higher intelligence in a poor family was often seen as a curse, and in China it usually meant a quick trip to the castration mill. The poor-and-smart boy would now serve the Emperor sans his genitals, and although the eunuch might become strong and powerful, the genes would die out and the power gone after death and social structure does not change.

Everything being equal, getting a richer though a bit less intelligent spouse is preferable to getting a smarter but not rich spouse. That's how upper classes marry - they would rather prefer a slightly dumb person of their own class than a super-genius but not from their own class.

In my opinion, wealth still triumphs over IQ, and although higher IQ would increase the possibility of higher incomes, against the truly chic it would just be another qualifier.Dr. Peterson looked and sounded great tonight. I didn‚Äôt see any of the weariness evident in a few other recent talks. It was one of the most intellectually stimulating talks I‚Äôve ever experienced. YouTube is great, but attending live is the difference between AM and FM. If he comes to a town near you I highly recommend being there.No, this is not a clean up your room type retort, I usually do the dishes when I'm cooking to save time.  

Today I did the dishes totally out of sequence. 

I spent a useless hour on this subreddit, and I felt to urge to shake off the useless. 

Just a friendly reminder, reddit is useless, you are not relaxing, your not learning, and you sure as hell aren't "rewarding" your soul with a addictive waste of time like reddit. 

Do not do things that make you weaker!!!!!I think it's fair to say that Peterson's work is astonishing on this, and it must be remembered that each traits act simultaneously on your character, combinations can be funny or odd I guess Each traits was subdivised in two, now some of them left me doubtful particularly :

-Politeness

How do you define this one in every day life ? It's about respect and manner or so ? Never really knew what this means.

    Enthusiasm

Okay we all know what it means, but the measure of this trait still, I don't know where to put myself in, I'm either moderately low or average... How do I tell ? Looking at the description didn't really helped me out determine. I think I've been fairly enthusiastic in my teen years before I hit depression for one entire year, then now I cannot figure out where I stand naturally on this, it's like if half of the questions about it are now tricky questions, I've changed a bit (not too much tho) due to life events so now I'm fluctuating in some trait, one of them being the enthusiasm.

How do you properly evaluate yourself on this one ?

Thanks in advance !!
In another discussion here it occurred that people referred to females by the slang expression of their genitals. It was in a comment trying to explain the nature of things. It was a discussion about the "price of pussy" on a supposed market of mating or something. I objected not against whatever argument, but against the unintelligent language.

I can not take any one to be serious when using such language. If they are young people, they should "grow the hell up". I never see Jordan use such discourse and for this reason I respect him. Jordan is liberating exactly because he avoid this at much higher levels even, and I find it useful to follow his example.

I am not advocating banning words, but that you should raise your level of thinking, and the expression in the example is a sign of lower level of thinking, and a sign of low interest in thinking critically and low interest in intellectual honesty.In no small part do I have JBP to thank for launching my podcast 8 weeks ago.
Today's episode is an interview with the President of the UBC Free Speech club, we discuss free speech, censorship, bridging gaps between polarized people and more. Check it out.

This line of reasoning comes up all time in my personal life, and in the media as well. 

"Well, you're a cis gender, straight, white male, so you aren't allowed to comment on this subject."

Basically, if you're in a "privileged" group, you aren't allowed to even discuss subjects that pertain to groups other than your own. 

What is the best way to combat this line of reasoning? The best argument I can come up with is that humans have the ability to empathize with experiences that they haven't had. So, although it's true that I don't have the experiences of LGBT, women, people of color, etc., I can still reasonably infer what those experiences would be like. 

Are there any better arguments that I'm missing?[link to the interview](https://youtu.be/ci7iM7c3VB4) thanks to /u/TerrificMcSpecial

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DBw0J2x5zoMaybe this isn't the place, but I was hoping someone here could help me better understand Jordan Peterson's position on a few things.

I listened to him on Russell Brand's podcast on Under the Skin, having never heard of him and I thoroughly liked him. I then went on to listen to him on Joe Rogan's podcast and couldn't stand him. I like to think of myself as a rational, philosophically minded individual who seeks to grow in all aspects of life, and so even though I consider myself to be about as left wing as you can get, I always try to understand the anti-thesis.

So, I am currently reading books such as State and Revolution by Lenin, the Ego and it's Own by Stirner, and consider myself closest to anarcho-communism ideologically, although I don't cling to ideology very tightly at all and consider myself somewhat of a pragmatist. I'm more of an anti-capitalist than anything else really. I am a big fan of Slavoj Zizek and really hope these two will debate in future. I am really interested in certain aspects of Marxism such as his critiques of capitalism, dialectical materialism etc, so I find it very strange that Jordan Peterson refers to Neo-Marxists and Cultural Marxism. These concepts don't seem to intersect with my understanding of Marx and it's always been my opinion integrating new knowledge with the old and removing any contradictions is the best way to find out truth.

So here I am. 

Can someone help me understand how Neo-Marxism intersects with classical Marxism? Does Jordan Peterson really believe in Cultural Marxism?I am only 23 and I do not feel like I have enough tragic events to fill 6 different epochs. The only events that bother me were from 2014 and onwards. How can I do the past authoring to tailor one or two events?

I am lost nowadays drowning in information and doubting all the time when it comes to absolutes. Is this right? Is this wrong? etc. 

I need help, somewhere to aim at, to be certain of my choices. I am always doubting. Belittling. Over anaylizing to the point where I do not do anything. The past still tends to get to me 

Thanks all who read and especially who answer. Appreciate itGreetings Dr. Peterson,

I was curious if you have heard of The Positive Mind  \- [http://www.thepositivemind.com/](http://www.thepositivemind.com/index.php) ? The host and psychologist, Armand Dimele, sadly passed three years ago. I was wondering if you would consider reaching out to WBAI and/or the Positive Mind staff about continuing this legacy or if you would consider doing something similar?

Sincerely,

dinaWho owns the website intellectualdark.website and who appointed them the leader of the idw? Who chooses who‚Äôs part of this group and who isn‚Äôt? Is it a fair panel of wise men or just one person? It sounds so elitist, I really don‚Äôt like it. Hi, I've just stumbled upon you recently and I've found a reawakening within myself. So, I wanted to find out more of what you think. 

With your belief that white privilege isn't real. What would you say to those that belief such is real but, only within countries some countries like South Africa where they claim that White South African's make up 7% of the country and own over 70% of land. (unsure of the figures). Some people like my friends have put this argument towards me, and I've began to question it. You said something about how the majority will always uphold a culture that sways more to the those within the culture. So, my question to you would be, how were the white minority of South Africa able to use their culture to gain land from the majority, while being the minority? Is it because their culture consisted of more competence and assertiveness or that the Black South African's had a culture that consisted of too much reasonableness? And what do you think of Black South African's trying to gain back the land of their ancestors, would it be good to do so as their ancestors were forcibly removing from the land or that it is the way life is, people come along and conquer land?

Additionally, do you think that that places like the USA, South Africa and Australia are places where white privilege is real? This is only because of you saying that the majority can uphold a culture that may accommodate to those within the culture more. Can it be said for the USA that people who don't share the same characteristics of the European are a part of the culture in a way that does give them a disadvantage? Such as killing of the African Americans for what is seemed to be a gun, owning and developing on the lands of the Natives the same can be said for Australia. Which involves all them in the history of the White American in ways no other has been. Which would make them apart of the culture as they are not going to leave America as they claim to have nowhere to go. So, surely, they should by now be a part of the culture? and if, so, why do they feel that there is a presence of white privilege?

As you can see I don't know much about these topics but I'm very happy to learn more of what you think of these topics.

Thank you for your willingness to enlighten those who are blind, you have certainly enlightened me.
There is a growing nationalism spreading across the world. People are becoming increasingly infected with fear about the future. When people sense danger they fortify themselves in any way they can. It's happening as the generation that demolished traditional values is beginning to fade away, Baby Boomers. They are dying and it is we the later generations who are going to have to deal with the legacy of those 'good intentions'. Jordan Peterson is the first of possibly more who want to try and correct the excesses of those mid 20th Century social justice warriors.

I am mixed race. What exactly constitutes 'me' isn't important but you could find it if you search my post history. That isn't what I want to talk about. What I want to discuss is related to not strictly belonging to any of the groups that are presently coalescing into opposing and allied factions. Race relations in the West has been predominantly a desire to soothe the antagonism between two groups who refer to themselves as Blacks and Whites. This fractious relationship began with the colonisation and slavery of sub-saharan Africans. In my opinion it is the centre of gravity around which the main arguments of 'racial equality' orbit. Any other ethnic group that enters this fray are peripheral and, to my senses, not relevant to the focus of the debate. It's like this, these people, the Blacks and the Whites, have more than enough problems to keep them occupied. The attempts by 'outsiders' to infiltrate this discussion only serve to distract them from resolving their mutual differences. 

The fact is that our specific concerns aren't addressed, anywhere, no one cares, or knows to care. We don't form a cohesive social group but I am sure there are millions of us, millions.

So how many here feel themselves to fall between the webs of these discussions and arguments? How many here are consciously aligning with their preferred identity, coping with the knowledge that there isn't a place for you so you must align with that which appears to offer the most tolerance? There's no point asking but it ought to be mentioned that many of those who would in all likelihood fit into the category I am talking about may not even be aware of it. This kind of self-awareness is very difficult to manage."Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." Matthew 19:24

Jordan Peterson is either a Christian, or someone who takes biblical teachings very seriously. Given that his biblical lectures have not covered the New Testament, I'm wondering what he'd make of the above passage. Especially in light of something he said when I saw him in Toronto earlier in May. 

He was talking about the fact that he's been making a lot of money, and said "I'm not ashamed of that." The crowd applauded him, and I did as well, because I'm happy that he's successful. I think he will put the money to good use. 

At the same time though, I have to wonder what is going on with him, what he's thinking about this situation. It was pretty strange seeing people walking around with VIP cards hanging from their neck, a picture of JBP printed on each card, as if he was a rockstar of some sort. I understand that he basically is a rockstar now, but I hope that he doesn't let it get to his head.

I'd also be fascinated to see what he thinks of the New Testament's teachings regarding the acquisition of wealth and how they relate to both his current situation and his support for capitalism \(not saying capitalism is bad, but it has a tendency to incentivize greed\). 

Do y'all think he's in danger of becoming consumed by success? I'm optimistic because when I saw him in Toronto, he was as humble, self\-aware, and level\-headed as ever. I couldn't find a big 5 subreddit so I thought it'd be good to ask you guys this question.

What does it really mean to be high in openness to experience? I scored high on a big 5 test but I'm confused about a few things. 

By definition if you're high in openness, you like to learn and experience new things, yes? So if you're offered ecstasy at a music festival, but reject trying it, would that mean you're not really that open of a person? If you're someone who reads tonnes of physics books but has no interest in history books, are you really high in openness? In both cases you're rejecting a new experiencing and sticking to what you like/comfortable doing. 

So how open do you really need to be to be truly open. Wouldn't a truly open person want to experience everything, regardless of potential risks and want to learn as many different fields as you have time to put your hands on. 

Also if you're a very open person, but high in neuroticism. Can you truly be an open person? You want to do new things, but you're too neurotic to try it. Huge Peterson fan. 12 Rules for Life turned my life around. But having a bit of a crisis of faith. Listened to his debate with Sam Harris on truth and really feel Sam kinda bullied him. Anyone can lose a debate but this was more like an intellectual mugging and for it to happen on something so fundamental to Peterson's philosophy: his definition of truth, almost the foundation to his worldview, well this is worrying to me. and I found it quite disturbing.

I feel when JP discusses modern life and gender he's a boss, but Sam punished him here, and it almost felt like JP knew he was losing and grovelled for mercy. Please listen to this debate and give me your thoughts. It shook me up.  Someone I respect deeply was humiliated and it hurts.

The whole debate is very long, but here is a snippet which captures the heart of it pretty well. Appreciate thoughts and intelligent feedback. My heart wants to believe Peterson won this, but my head won't follow:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDvqMHke4YI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDvqMHke4YI)I just took Jordan Peterson's Understand Myself Big Five personality test. I find the results to be fairly accurate but what kind of person does this make me? I've had a lot of failures in my romantic life \(rejections and only got with mentally ill and disloyal women\) in particular and I've been told I come off as non\-confident a lot. However, my results don't really paint me as a "nice guy" from how I see it. What do you believe these results say about me as a whole and what should I do with this information?

*the app I was using to post this kept telling me the post didn‚Äôt go through, so I decided to spam it. Whoops.*Me and a friend literally got warnings from a slack group mod for merely mentioning Jordan in #politics. Was curious to know if there is any interesting chat groups discussing the topics of our times? Hi Dr Peterson, I'm a 20 years old male from New Caledonia and I'm here writing for assistance about brain, right and left hemisphere and conscientiousness within it. Alright so I have a unique problem (don't know how to call qualify it with another word) out of all people I guess.  Recently I've been able to hijacked my brain and live in the full potential of the left hemisphere, having the verbal side the meaning and the positive emotions effect. It's like floating in meaning, absolutely everything changes, even the perception of reality. After swimming in it for a while I decided to pause that miraculous finding and just broke out of it for a while because it's not so natural for the brain. However being extremely and dangerously curious (worst thing ever when you can't choose your damn limitations) I've watched one of your video where you were talking about the two hemispheres and their function. Unconsciously I woken up my right hemisphere and it's functions in the process and I don't how how to shut this down. I doubt even you have the answer to such a thing, but I'm more than willing to take your advice. I'm having 3 conscientiousness right now, my left hemisphere, my right hemisphere and myself in the middle. I have to shut this down but don't know how. 

So to make this clear I'm either living in the right hemisphere, so I'm all the functions associated with it, or the left and same thing. I need to shut the whole thing down but I don't know how that's a bit frightening I've believed in God for a while now, as well as growing increasingly interested in Christianity. Peterson has opened my eyes up to the value of the Bible. As a result, I've hung out with more Christians and spoken with them about their beliefs.

As a result, I have felt my relationship with God strengthen in a way I didn't know was possible. At the same time, though, I'm having a lot of trouble accepting the idea that to be favored in God's eyes one needs to have a literal belief in the ressurection of Christ. I have trouble accepting this because I don't think that it's intellectually honest to claim a belief in something extraordinary like that which one has not witnessed. I believe in God, on the other hand, because I've had experiences which only make sense when I define them in terms of God. I feel God's presence in my life.

Christians \(or non\-Christians\), is it possible to be a "metaphorical Christian", to accept the Christian message as true while admitting that one does not and cannot know whether Christ was actually ressurected? We are living in grand times. The scale of everything is just insane.

I was just sitting there watching maps of meaning lectures and something just blew my mind when i put it all together.. 

I am sitting in my room, with my legs on the table watching a brilliant scholar giving a brilliant speech, pouring his heart out into it. 

A few hundred years ago it was only the privileged who got to experience these things. 

But now the common man has things the kings never dreamt of having. 

Like really we are living in such a grand society. You walk into a store and there are shelves full of food from around the world. And this is normal! How many people in history, throughout human existence got to experience this? 

We have all the knowledge in the world at the click of a few buttons, how many people got to experience this? 

Like my mind is just blown thinking about how far enlightenment ideals and free market capitalism got us. It's just mind boggling. There's a demand for something?, Theres a supply for it now! Jesus. I'd like to share with you all a set of realizations I had and the lead up to them. I've been attending therapy for the first time in a while for the past two months. My therapist is of the psychodynamic school, so we spend most of the time trying to dig in the past and expose my shadow. For those unaware, the shadow is the dark parts of your personality you ignore and project outward. We've been having steady progress, but no huge changes yet.

For a different set of reasons more pertinent to this sub, on Friday night, facing a week off work, I decided to do an experiment. I would spend each morning cleaning my apartment for an hour this week. Find things to fix, get everything in order, and see how nice I could make it. This morning is my 4th day and it is unrecognizeable. I still have a lot of work to do, but I can't really describe how nice it feels to live in an ordered space. 

The real kicker though is what follows. I had a trip out of town with my band last night. I was a drink deep and starting to feel a bit lonely, overwhelmed by people, and pretty deeply consumed by the demons of others. I decided to grab another drink, maybe that would help. That's when I got hit with it. This was all in my head. Every bit of negativity I was sensing was within me. Every demon I sensed in another exaggerated and caricatured by my own shadow. I didn't get that drink, I needed clarity to chase this all the way down. I was the only one there without my partner or family so it was easy to get the space to really dive into my own head in the loud bar. I did an inventory of my bandmates and I, analyzed how we stacked up on the big five. Had the jarring realization I was by far the most neurotic, and also the most open and highly agreeable. The guys I felt the most tension from in the group were the most starkly contrasted on those three traits, it made sense we would clash. I kept having feelings I was unwanted or a burden, but in reality I was just not the center of attention. I don't even like being the center of attention, so thinking through I realized I was putting too much perception through this invisible lens.

Then I put some thought into faith and motivation. I've had Cain's selfish motivations. I was giving incomplete sacrifices and getting upset when they were consistently rejected. I felt like I put in all this effort to improve my social skills to keep myself together and my life was only getting worse for it. My resentment towards others was building and I had no relief valve. I realized then that faith is tainted word. It has been conflated with believing without proof. I think a more helpful word is trust. I lacked trust that my efforts and sacrifices, motivated by their highest aims would lead to the things I wanted. I was scared of giving trust to reality, trusting that others would help me if I helped them.

The night ended with grabbing a snack with one of the members I've clashed with and his partner. We chatted over dinner about the dynamics of people in bands, how hard it is to balance a relationship predicated on communal expression without someone trying to treat the other members like their own orchestra. Several months ago, I got into a huge argument with another member, and was called out by the guy I was eating with. I've known for a while I've had that tendency to control others, and in the process of weening myself off that control and power I've felt alone and weak. For the first time since I've started down the dark road, I got some recognition for the effort I've put in to repair the relationship. He opened up about his own social weaknesses for the first time with me. In putting my faith out there, in trusting that pure motivation was enough and that I should trust my rational mind that I was welcome and appreciated, I was shown proof of it. It happened within the very night I had these thoughts. However, it has been building in that direction for a long time.

I thank any who have read so far for sticking with my long winding story. So what's up with the title? In cleaning my room, I exposed unknowns. I found piles of dust and dirt under piles of garbage. I found a dirty sink under the dishes. I found things I forgot I had that I valued. I found solutions for small problems. I found my shadow room, and carefully sorting it, integrated it into my clean room, I made a beautiful space. By cleaning my room at the start of the day, I exposed far more than just dirt. I performed a meta-act, I started my thoughts with patterns of cleansing and sorting. I looked under the chaos, and saw my shadow. And I cannot express how valuable that can be. It isn't a metaphor, clean your room and keep it clean, and maintain that cleansing and organizing mindset throughout your day.Hope this can move to the top. I know it's a long shot. My friend and I would like to take Dr. Peterson to dinner before or after his speaking event in London, Ontario on 7/21/18.

-AlexHey guys one of the things that perturb me the most is my hypochondria, I have been in some doctors and therapist and none of them couldn‚Äôt help me with this. In fact some ignore this, I think a lot of psychologists and psychiatrists don‚Äôt understand people with depression or some type of disturbs is frustrating to me. Some of you guys have this problem, if so can anyone give me any advice.
Btw, my focus is always in my heart I always think that its something bad with mine. 
Thank you for your attention I'll preface this post by saying that I'm a big fan of Dr Peterson, especially of his personality lectures. I don't agree with everything he has to say, particularly when it comes to political issues both social and economic, but as a psychologist he is clearly brilliant. He has instilled in millions of miserable, alienated people a drive for self improvement and in the process has dramatically improved their quality of life.  What better measure of success could there possibly be for a psychologist than to improve quality of life?   


I used to talk to people quite regularly about Peterson at my university here in the UK, but for the most part these are people who are quite similar to me ideologically, i.e. they are left wing both economically and socially, I'd really prefer to engage with Peterson fans on the opposite side of the political aisle, so I figure that this is the place to come.   


I'll start with a very brief outline of what I believe:   
I believe that capitalist systems rely on perpetual growth, i.e. it they rely on ever increasing consumption of goods and services, either through an increase in population size or through an increase in consumerism. I think that consumerism gradually erodes the fabric of what's important in society, community, connection to other people, etc.   


Capitalism has proven itself to be a great generator of wealth in countries where consumption can increase without social costs, i.e. in India many people don't have enough food, water or shelter, so a system which necessitates an ever increasing level of consumption is no bad thing! But in developed countries I don't believe it is optimal to mindlessly increase consumption without taking into account quality of life.  


I think we need to gradually transition into a system of public ownership, i.e. nationalised industries with less reliance on private investment, and strong social welfare programs that allow everyone to achieve a higher quality of life.   


Maybe some of you guys could share what you believe, and we could probe the differences.  So, since Jordan Peterson has been, and still is, a big influence on my life and especially the way I think about things and think about others (mostly those who disagree with me, which used to make me crazy in the past), I was wondering how any of you Reddit\-People were impacted by Jordan Peterson and what led to you becoming a 'JP\-Fan'. I'd be really interested to hear your stories! 

[Here a beautiful gif. ](https://i.redd.it/96p3wyncar211.gif)Dr. Peterson,

What is your take on the recent suicides of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain this week?

Is it a media\-related suicide contagion?

Is Kate Spade's suicide related to taking Antidepressants (as with many teen cases)?

Do you think current antidepressants are to be discontinued (due to a lot of evidence linking high suicide rates to current antidepressants) and an alternative to depression in clinical trials should be considered (such as the John Hopkins clinical trials that you mention i.e. [https://youtu.be/Y\_WBBMfiIHo](https://youtu.be/Y_WBBMfiIHo))?

What preventative measures are to be taken?

dinaI can pin point times in my life that were filled with great joy and naive moments that lead me down a spiraling path of foolishness. The anger I felt at such ridiculous subjects brings me great shame. I'm interested to hear from higher than average IQ blue collar workers. What's the reason you chose blue collar work?I wrote this before.

Americans don't want to talk about this since it is not something they would be proud of, but the life of John A.B. Wilson (he only used the two middle names, Anthony Burgess, when he was writing something) was never the same after his pregnant wife was raped by two American soldiers. Of course she lost the baby and didn't have children again, and she suffered from mental problems from then.

Their races are not specified, but since they were NOT punished and their names were not even recorded, it is probable that they were not blacks. At that time, 'to enhance Anglo-American cooperation', Churchill's govt discouraged Brits from getting angry to the half-civilized behaviors of the Americans, but many of them did behave badly.

Wilson was very upset that the two Americans who ruined the lives of his wife and himself were NOT punished at all and wrote this, years later, to contemplate why these kind of people behaved badly.

I do not think the harsh treatment of ex-GIs nowdays is unfair, since American soldiers, in most cases, are not worth the respect since they tend to come from the lower rungs of society and lack the ability , intelligence and whatnot to be respected. "American Lives", contrary to the claims of some rednecks, are often not worth that much (and I am not even talking about blacks, hispanics, etc.)In the Brave New World of my fantasy eugenics and dysgenics
were practiced systematically. In one set of bottles biologically
superior ova, fertilized by biologically superior sperm, were given
the best possible prenatal treatment and were finally decanted
as Betas, Alphas and even Alpha Pluses. In another, much more
numerous set of bottles, biologically inferior ova, fertilized by
biologically inferior sperm, were subjected to the Bokanovsky
Process (ninety-six identical twins out of a single egg) and
treated prenatally with alcohol and other protein poisons. The
creatures finally decanted were almost subhuman; but they were
capable of performing unskilled work and, when properly
conditioned, detensioned by free and frequent access to the
opposite sex, constantly distracted by gratuitous entertainment
and reinforced in their good behavior patterns by daily doses of
soma, could be counted on to give no trouble to their superiors.

 In this second half of the twentieth century we do nothing
systematic about our breeding; but in our random and
unregulated way we are not only over-populating our planet, we
are also, it would seem, making sure that these greater numbers
shall be of biologically poorer quality. In the bad old days
children with considerable, or even with slight, hereditary defects
rarely survived. Today, thanks to sanitation, modern
pharmacology and the social conscience, most of the children
born with hereditary defects reach maturity and multiply their
kind. Under the conditions now prevailing, every advance in
medicine will tend to be offset by a corresponding advance in the
survival rate of individuals cursed by some genetic insufficiency.
In spite of new wonder drugs and better treatment (indeed, in a
certain sense, precisely because of these things), the physical
health of the general population will show no improvement, and
may even deteriorate. And along with a decline of average
healthiness there may well go a decline in average intelligence.

Indeed, some competent authorities are convinced that such a
decline has already taken place and is continuing. "Under
conditions that are both soft and unregulated," writes Dr. W.H.
Sheldon, "our best stock tends to be outbred by stock that is
inferior to it in every respect.

 . . . It is the fashion in some
academic circles to assure students that the alarm over
differential birth-rates is unfounded; that these problems are
merely economic, or merely educational, or merely religious, or
merely cultural or something of the sort. This is Pollyanna
optimism. Reproductive delinquency is biological and basic." And
he adds that "nobody knows just how far the average IQ in this
country [the U.S.A.] has declined since 1916, when Terman
attempted to standardize the meaning of IQ 100."
In an underdeveloped and over-populated country, where
four-fifths of the people get less than two thousand calories a
day and one-fifth enjoys an adequate diet, can democratic
institutions arise spontaneously? Or if they should be imposed
from outside or from above, can they possibly survive?
And now let us consider the case of the rich, industrialized and
democratic society, in which, owing to the random but effective
practice of dysgenics, IQ's and physical vigor are on the decline.
For how long can such a society maintain its traditions of
individual liberty and democratic government? Fifty or a hundred
years from now our children will learn the answer to this
question.

Meanwhile we find ourselves confronted by a most disturbing
moral problem. We know that the pursuit of good ends does not
justify the employment of bad means. But what about those
situations, now of such frequent occurrence, in which good
means have end results which turn out to be bad?
For example, we go to a tropical island and with the aid of DDT
we stamp out malaria and, in two or three years, save hundreds
of thousands of lives. This is obviously good. But the hundreds of
thousands of human beings thus saved, and the millions whom
they beget and bring to birth, cannot be adequately clothed,
housed, educated or even fed out of the island's available
resources. Quick death by malaria has been abolished; but life
made miserable by undernourishment and over-crowding is now
the rule, and slow death by outright starvation threatens ever
greater numbers.

And what about the congenitally insufficient organisms, whom
our medicine and our social services now preserve so that they
may propagate their kind? To help the unfortunate is obviously
good. But the wholesale transmission to our descendants of the
results of unfavorable mutations, and the progressive
contamination of the genetic pool from which the members of our
species will have to draw, are no less obviously bad. We are on
the horns of an ethical dilemma, and to find the middle way will
require all our intelligence and all our good will.According to Wikipedia, there are around 850,000,000 white people, which is around 11.5% of the population. White people are typically old, so there's only a few percentages of white people who are young and in childbearing age.I'm actually quite anxious to continue doing this, but stopping now would probably be the worst thing one could do, right? Did anyone reading this have a similar reaction to this?

I gotta say though, I'm far from done with the past\-authoring program and I don't think I'll ask myself the "Why am I like this"\-question ever again.[https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6518731/commons\-speaker\-john\-bercow\-is\-accused\-of\-being\-sexist\-comments\-to\-female\-minister/](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6518731/commons-speaker-john-bercow-is-accused-of-being-sexist-comments-to-female-minister/)

  
A female MP has tried to claim that when the speaker told her "no dilation" (referring to long wordy speech) because time was short, that he actually was making a reference to her being dilated during pregnancy, and has filed a complaint of sexism and bullying, rather than simply accept she was asked not to be so wordy because time was short.

The most worrying thing? Newspapers are actually reporting this and not the obvious BS behind it

Our good friend Cathy Newman is of course retweeting it too... :\-/

It seems like the whole world has gone mad, and is intentionally pretending things are sexist when they know they aren't. Apparently they're trying to get the Speaker fired... what holesAbout 6-7 years ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in but Dr. Peterson himself.

I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he read a magazine and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Jordan, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Dr. Petersons put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.My thought of spirituality is that it is a non-materialistic final goal. What I've learned of spirituality is that it dissolves the notion of free will. It also dissolves any stories relating to the Hero's journey, order/chaos, yin-yang, and pretty much everything Jordan speaks and writes of. So in a sense you embark on the spiritual Hero's journey to find yourself devoured by the whale, and it all disappears. You realize that not only didn't all of the previous not exist, but neither did the whale to devour any ideas of the Hero's journey. As a whale to devour the Hero's journey can only be the case if it existed in the first place. The absolute dissolution of the Hero and its stories and ideas, is spirituality in a nut shell, I think. Though most people don't understand the implications of that. We usually think of the Hero making it through that. Some people call it a rebirth, a Phoenix that rises from the ashes. Such a thing is only a story which would go through the dissolution process, which the Hero couldn't be attached to, to go through it. What the rebirth story might be a reflection of is the inability for the Hero to see further than its own ego and self-hood. A relevant reflection is "Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water, after enlightenment, chop wood and carry water".Hey guys! 

Does anyone know if JBP is currently following a ZeroCarb / Carnivorous (https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb) diet? 

I struggle with IBS and have heard a lot of good things about elimination diets. I‚Äôm just curious if anyone knows if he follows this diet? 

During the middle ages, those who were able to exploit the peasants the best became Dukes, Earls, Barons and Knights.

Their bloodlines are still doing great, getting ambitious and smart genes. Their influence will never end.

Today's world is very favorable for those who lie , cheat, break-the-law-and-lobby-the-politicians-to-make-it-legal, steal patent-lawyer up - pay a pittance to the original creator as settlement types.

And, the cold truth is the investors, who are the only class of people who do matter, do not give a shit about that as long as their rate of return is good. Many of them belong to such mindset themselves.

Those who are still stuck in the old mindset of cooperation, 'be good','the golden rule' will be swept away by the sweeping change for the Future, be cheated out of the little worth they have, and die in the most abject penury possible.

No schools teach these well, but parents who are like that tend to instruct their children in this way, often showing by example. I don't know how JP teaches his children, but chances are the children of today's winners will be taught that way.

The future belongs to those who can exploit others the best.

The "Golden Rule" died, because when one does bad against others, the others WON'T BE ABLE to strike back. It is like the Indios trying to strike back to the armed Spaniards; they belonged to different dimensions, so no strike back was possible so the Spaniards did whatever they felt like to the natives.

Same thing will be the future, where the smart, the cunning, the ruthless, the merciless, etc will be able to do whatever they feel like to the rest without any consequences. Sorry, you may not like it, but this is the reality.https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/twelve-tips-for-making-sense-of-the-world-43348077cf80

In short,

&gt;1. It‚Äôs always ultimately about acquiring power.
2. Money rewards sociopathy.
3. Wealth kills empathy.
4. Money is power.
5. This same ruling class controls the media.
6. People are always manipulating each other.
7. Society is made of narrative.
8. The lines between nations are imaginary.
9. Powerful forces are naturally incentivized to collaborate with each other toward mutual interests.
10. There is an immense amount of wealth that can be grabbed in the chaos of war and conflict.
11. The neocons are always wrong.
12. The push towards truth always starts with yourself.//

In my opinion, after the first 3 tips the remaining 9 tips are kind of superfluous. 

I don't know who Johnstone is, or where she is coming from. But, it is clear that she vaguely understands the old ways don't work anymore.

Elsewhere I said JP is the most famous philosopher since Wittgenstein, and I received replies that there were Tim Leary and others including Slavoj Zizek. So, I stand corrected - JP is the most famous philosopher in the 21st century. Zizek is not well known in North America.

Still, I see JP as being a transition figure between the old way and the new, techno-feudalist way, somewhat like Augustine being the transition figure between the ancient world and the medieval world, or Descartes between the absolutist world and the enlightenment world. He is important, but I think that in the near future (if we don't integrate ourselves into machines first), there will be a new school of thought which we can't imagine now, to match the reality the people in near future will face.Jordan Peterson, whether people know it or not, is specifically dealing with the issue of Identity. In fact he's the only person I know of in the entire world who is actually grappling with this issue in a serious and meaningful way. Identity or a *sense* of Identity is how we as a species relate to and connect with reality and this is the true reason for his immense popularity.

The confusion about identity has emerged since America became the de facto vanguard in the establishment of a new way of life since the 90's (the end of the Cold War) and American's have **no sense of Identity**. I suspect if an American lost their accent they would lose any sense they have of Self. But another aspect of what sense of Identity they have is *colour*. It is ludicrously and ridiculously unsophisticated. You can't hook a coherent sense of identity, a coherent sense of one's connection to **Existence**, to **Being** on something so trivial.

Now if they wanted to do this simply for themselves then I'd say sure, whatever, do what your little minds can handle but they are trying to do this for everyone and I'm not fucking buying it. They are the most offensively simple minded fools who try to determine reality by proscribing those who disagree. Asia is a vast continent with many many peoples, languages, customs, traditions and what they are doing is what they always do with people who don't conform to their idiotic ideas of freedom and "the individual", they are depersonalizing them. People may not know that this is happening but they sense that 'something' is happening and they are revolting against it.

When this happens with an individual they respond to it in different ways. They may have a breakdown or become unbalanced, lashing out, **or**, they may enter a **dark night of the soul**. From this they emerge as the person they will hitherto become, one who recognises they are a 'part' of this world and try to contribute in some meaningful and 'good' way, or they rebel against it and persist in rejecting it because **it** doesn't correspond to their own, selfish sense of what it should be.

Jordan Peterson is admirably navigating a course for those seeking the former but he's not doing enough to make people think for themselves, if that's even possible. Worse though is that he isn't grasping the nettle that is the real snake in the bosom of the West's desires and despair; a new and contemporary rendering of what White Identity **is** today and going forwards.I AM / Consciousness is all that is known and all that can be known, of any being, in any universe, in any timeline, under an infinite amount of time.

Untruth does not exist. Nothing but truth that is I AM exists. If God existed He would know only I AM, too.

That does not diminish what the illusion does of not-I AM, which doesn't exist.

All you know is that you EXIST!
Stop looking elsewhere - It's RIGHT HERE!
What's the problem with Truth!?

There is No One Else.Hi I am from India. We have a system called reservations in India. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India

It propagates on the idea that somehow people born into certain arbitrary castes are less privileged than others. This is the narrative of the politicians and "liberals". The truth is far from this. To give you an example search up our Presidents caste(he is from one of those supposed communities where if you are born you are illiterate for your whole life) . 


I have been fairly a good student. But given India's very large population (approx 1.4 million people fight out for a very small number of seats at IITs every year. Do not know the exact figure as there is 50 % reservation for "subjugated" castes and again some reservation for girls from this year and I wanted to go for Computer science for which effectively you have 350 seats in the old IITs). I failed. I am going for an interview in the top institute in the country instead for a degree in business management tomorrow (have ran a business during high school. The experience was fun and will be willing to do it as a career).


My recent experience with people have been very sour when I tried to debate on affirmative action. They are somehow not willing to consider that affirmative action is mostly discriminatory. And the politicians use affirmative action like a goddamn carrot every time election comes up. The Supreme court (the highest court in the country) does not even bat a lid when its own previous directives on affirmative action isn't followed.

What mostly puzzles me is that why people who doesn't belong to this castes support such a system. Also my group is the minority in terms of numbers and hence no politicians gives a damn about us. Thankfully we are also the people with the most drive (as the system literally gives the other castes a free huge boost in all types of entrance exams). A bigger problem is we don't have that many good institutes either.

Everybody is predicting India to be a big economy house in the next 40 or so years. As an Indian i disagree. Socialism plagues the country. Every election is filled with people demanding government jobs as if that's the only duty of the government to ensure everyone has a damn job. Majority of my friends are complacent about life. They youth - majority of them are not conscientious. And the very high number of SJWs who get triggered by the utterance of how Trump isn't Hitler is very high.
I don't know i just feel like I want people who can have a debate/dialogue about the ideologies they believe in and currently after having expressed my beliefs recently about Trump, gender pay wage gap, affirmative actions I have very few friends remaining. As I write this I realize that's actually a good thing as I don't want to associate with people who can't imagine that they can be wrong.

Ps - this is my first post on reddit. So if this doesn't belong here I apologize and the mods can remove it.You look at all the different possibilities, how could all these things go wrong? Before you take action. Sometimes people get lost, they don't add the action part of it, because you will not have perfect understanding.

Another thing they do too, which is a mistake, because you might think "well I don't want to act until I know" no, you can't know. So you say, well then how can you think something through? Part of the answer to that is always take into account the cost of what you're doing now. Because what people tend to think is well whatever I am doing now is risk free and here's a bunch of options. It's like no, whatever you're doing right now has all sorts of risks, you're just blind to them, because you've habituated to them, they've become invisible, but so you can't wait around, you can't wait around to make things better on the assumption that what you're doing already is without risk.Guys I‚Äôm freaking out.

____________________________________________________________

relevant because:

- the SPLC has been a demonstrably bad actor in the arena of public discourse for some time now, participating in the parameterization of public discourse by unfounded accusations. this represents a significant positive development.
- maajid nawaz has been, on balance, a light &amp; a bearer of hope in thorny issues--here's [his latest appearance on the JRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGdPcC0zBIQ), with Sam Harris, &amp; his [interview w/ JP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMBfT38xbhU)

two additional thoughts:

the sheer amount of the settlement may be a turning point in the way the SPLC functions. what remains to be seen is whether this shift will be toward fact-based reporting &amp; research or the adoption of strategic ambiguity ("*allegedly,*" headlines phrased as questions, "*interested sources report that,*" etc) to continue propagating intersectional orthodoxies.

one also notes that Nawaz' lawsuit was mostly crowd-funded--this suggest that participants to public discourse with sufficient following can appropriately defend themselves from demonstrably libelous/slanderous accusations. this is reason for optimism, and it applies to **everybody**, including, e.g., the ChapoTrapHouse podcast. 

reasons for optimism.

## Subverting the Narrative | Holocaust Denial and the Lost Cause [20:27]

TL:dw youtube guy thinks JBP shouldn't comment on Hitler's motivations. Wedges clip of JBP describing Hitler's disgust motivation on h3h3 in-between "dog whistling" holocaust deniers.

clip is ironically called subverting the narrative, as if that applies to the subjects of the video, rather than the author's intent.


Did he get paid for it? I hope so, cause he's lost his credibility.He has talked multiple times about his alcohol abuse at a young age, and still seems a bit awkward/surprised at the massive global following he has amassed. Does anyone else consider the incredible material and physical temptations of women, cars, being shady/cheating or just being outright selfish? All the normal things that come with money, power, and fame. 

I think of all people, he would be thoroughly prepared to deal with this. When he was a full time professor I'm sure at least a few women tried to throw themselves at him. The only thing is, he is in control of much more power, influence, wealth, and freedom than ever before. Thoughts?Go outside for a little bit it's healthier than any youtube video you could watch. JP or not.Hi Mr Peterson. Again you must have seen ton of theses letters bringing personal experiences and asking for help, but here I have a question about you and your dedication to help people, and sorry it will just sound very straightforward and penetrative (because it is), do you take care of yourself as you think you could or should be ? Tell me if I'm wrong (I don't even know what exactly I'm affirming here) but you don't seem to be exceptionnally align with the bottom soul of you're core being. 

It really matters for me to be one hundred percent in alignment with myself to keep living, because I've created at the age of 12 a little monster asking for recognition and running away from my true self. It has led me back in the past in very very bad places. 100% authenticity to the core of you're being, it is because you find it expansive of time to go back to yourself ?

Would love you to see and potentially answer that, thank you very much for the work you've done all that way until now Dr Peterson, you provide people every with tremendous help.How many of there are you here?

I've found myself in a position where I have a great appreciation for Christianity as a result of JBP, but I don't think God is literally the Christian God as described in the bible (though the bible probably gets the relationship between men and God down well).

Really want to hear the perspectives of others who are searching for God. Hi Dr Peterson ! And Hi everyone ! I'm glad to announce that I managed to rise my lobster kind to the very top :DD

Quite an appealing revelation you must think, but it's more sophisticated than that. I've centered my being and connected with the bottom of my soul for an entire month. Every moment I've lived so far are the most meaningful one and it's pretty much the level of experience I was born for to live. It's like a symphony as you said, everything takes the perfect place around you, and everyone else participates to it. 

I had the chance to have my birthday (I turned 20 the 1st June) in those conditions. By far the best night I've ever experienced. So much good and everything coming at the right place at the right moment without you asking. An orchestra of meaning I'm not kidding, that's what everyone is trying to aim at. And that's the very best there is. 

So now I'm not sure what to do with that Dr Peterson (or anyone having experienced it), because THIS is the true me, undoubtedly. However you talked about the external "reality" so to say. Do you think it is possible to get rid of it ? Like, it's very easy to engage in as you said, but it's full of resentment, harshness and that's where hell on earth is. 

So, to keep yourself align as I understand watch your video you're aware of your speech (I have a different pathway that pretty much work the same way, because I have to be aware of what I say, what I feel, what I breathe, what I see.) but it this enough to guide your external "world" (really don't know how to call it other than pathway to hell if not careful lmao) into alignment with your internal self ? 

So to be clear what's the purpose of it ? Are you trying to bring the same feeling of meaning into the external world or are you trying to repress it and every temptation it represents by listening to your internal world (thing you help people to do by creating self-help program, giving free lectures away, being a clinician and professor of University), which is, one would say, the very core of your soul ? Is THIS the PURPOSE you're trying to guide all of us in ? To not listen to external world of temptation anymore ?

Thank you god so much for all the things you've helped people so much over the course of your own story Mr Peterson :)

Thank you god so much for all the things you've helped people so much over the course of your own story Mr Peterson :)I don't get it. Why should bakers be forced to serve a customer if they don't want to again? 

I am aware of the "black customer, civil rights" argument, but I think that even in that case the baker should have autonomy. Yes it is racist and "wrong" to do so, but freedom always comes at a cost. That cost being government being able to tell what business owners can and cannot do, isn't that setting a dangerous president? My mom never watches football. Like not even once. But now that the world cup is around, she is watching all the matches, sharing the scores on social media and just cheering and screaming at tv whilst not having any idea what is going on.

This kind of irritated me because a part of me went like "she doesn't really like football, she's just trying to fit in with the crowd". 

I was ready to roast her about this. Not brutally ofc, just in a joking way. 

But then I stopped for a second and my brain thought about it pragmatically, she is watching football, but thats only at the surface, on a deeper level she is connecting with the community, enjoying herself, relieving stress and having a good time. 

Should it really matter what we do on a low resolution surface level view, when in reality something else is being full-filled? 

Maybe over-thinking about the small things in life and being cynical to the point of catharsis could be an aspect of what makes modern men miserable, despite not having much to be miserable about.  

Maybe watching sports and getting together with the family and having a good time together is better than being "woke" and outside the system.Watching the biblical lectures really got me back into Islam and to start practicing my religion properly. It's made me grow up a lot in the past year. I'm surprised Jordan Peterson is not an advocate of Islam. I think committing to god has replaced my need for constant self gratification through drugs and other self destructive behaviours. By putting something else above me instead of living pure egotism which brought me to a very dark place. 

A lot of the things Jordan advocates are strong tenets of Islam. Hi everyone and hi Dr Peterson. I've found the meaning of my soul and how to properly respect it by using hardcore mindfulness meditation over 5 days. I've aged like mad, it's like if I gained 25 years of experience in that span of time. And I've found the very meaning of my soul and how to respect it and carry out the upgrade order without falling into chaos.
Like end game of life, you found what you were always looking for with the proper values attached to it, and I'm setting the rules for these values to be extended over my lifetime (Respect your soul, upgrade your order, stay out of chaos globally.) And I felt it. Even yesterday I was completely fulfilled. However when I woke up today I was not on that level yet, so I meditate on my being to slowly get back there by concentration, having that vision in mind. Not forcing too much but putting the effort to get there.

And what happened is that I shattered a bit my concentration at one point, so I wanted to get it properly back. I did go take a nap while meditating as hard as I could towards this vision, with near all my willpower. 
But I was tired mentally because of all that meditation and I didn't visualize it at perfection. 


Now I just woke up I'm way too far from it. I'm undergoing too much internal changes, and these changes has to cease because I already found what I was looking for all that time. 

I don't know what to do, I don't want to be a different person every time I wake up. And to respect my soul properly I've learned which places not to go and I've set a value around it. And now I'm struggling to get back here.

What could I do Mr Peterson ? What I'm doing over the long-term is probably dangerous. I have to go back find my soul, it's values and stick with it. 
You're probably one of the few people on earth able to help me out on this I really need an answer from you. Or from someone out there who miraculoulsy reach such a level of fulfillment. 

Thank you tremendously for upcoming answers My question is, is it normal to feel emotional like rage and hatred when doing the

past authoring program?

My little rant below, dont mind it.

Its a clear fact now that everything miserable with my life is related and shaped by my tyrannical father.

I wont get deep into it but i think I've lived in denial in order to cope with his shit. I've always get upset and then downplayed his action after i while. Thinking that people experiencing far worse, like kids in Africa is a classic one. And before you go all retarded i'm black myself.

But now, after carefully combing my life and finding 1 son of a bitch thats responsible for 80 &amp;#37; of the unconscious shit i've been struggling with, i feel this lump in my fucking throat, I've been told my facial expression looks like i want to murder someone and they are 100 percent right.

I feel this hatred, deep animosity man. At first i was relived, its better to be pissed of then scared right? But this feels like its taking a darker turn. I'm starting to feel sad, like i want to cry or something. Had to get this shit off my chest i guess.Whenever I venture to r/TrollXChromosomes I almost always come across posts talking about these "dirty things", and women there are always relishing it (really like pigs in mud (i'm not calling women pigs)). They talk so openly about it, and so proudly. They really have no shame bringing these topics.

Also, women in real life generally have no problem saying "I have to pee", while men would never say it so openly.

I am trying to tie this with Buddha's claim that women are, compared to men, immoral creatures (or, softly put, have naturally more proclivity for lack of honor, etc).

What do you think?

Example: https://reddit.app.link/7esYLC8JXNCharles Kauffman's immortal words,

‚ÄúThese aren't the kind of men you send to jail. You fit the punishment to the criminal, not the crime.‚Äù

is the signature word for Civilization, and how the world should move on to.

Kauffman, who survived 3 years in a Japanese POW camp, basically gave a slap in the wrist to the two men who killed a Chinese laborer because the latter was taking their jobs. However we need such standard for talented people who might put those who have less ability than them into harm.

There was a case where a rich Saudi was acquitted of rape in England via a bizarre legal definition. However, because of his wealth, acquitting him brought more economic value , which advanced civilization because richer people can contribute to civilization more than poorer people, talented people more than untalented people, etc.

JP's 12 rules might be applied among people of similar intellectual class, you know, the kind of people who are likely to read JP's books (including me who paid the full price of the hardcover).

However, I wrote kulm's 12 laws to treat people who are less intelligent, less able, etc.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/8fupgc/jordans\_12\_rules\_are\_quite\_defensive\_in\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/8fupgc/jordans_12_rules_are_quite_defensive_in_the/)

In the future, people will be judged according to who they are, not what they do. Although Ted Kaczynski's punishment is justified because he was against Civilization, people who cause the death of the less able (i.e. kicking a homeless person to death) should not be punished since such act improved the gene pool and therefore Civilization.

Today's world is not for sissies. Maximum social darwinism, and maximum survival of fittest, is the way to go. JP is now suing his university - I don't think his words would be that benign anymore after the suit ends, since reality is harsh and no amount of sugarcoating will hide the cold truth.

(I don't care if I am banned. Someone has to say what I have to say.)I've always played this game for the sake of taking mindfulness pleasure. (Not resentment and bitterness, I'm talking about a video game). However since yersterday I'm having it rough inside, and I was thrown into chaos.  To put this straight, I'm getting into pretty bad places for me. I don't know where the hell I'm heading, I'm not lost but... Yeah I'm getting lost. I've sorted myself out 100&amp;#37; a month ago, I really did find meaning in life. You have to feel it to even comprehend why meaning is meaning. And at one point I grew a bit tired for not having goals at hand (I know it) and I've been falling. I've took part into the resentment of my little brother, during a little play basically. (he's 13, had a couple of problems and now I think he is at a point he is the one who can help himself, with some guidance tho.) and it's terrible. You know the video Jordan posted out time from now with guidance to embrace your shadow to believe it was possible. It's not my shadow I'm talking about here, but I have to put this straight to make you aware it's no common problem I'm sharing with you here. I've put my life straight at the highest possible of virtue for the soul (I'm not making metaphors, for me to be sure you guys understand on which level I'm talking about, it's fullfillment nothing less) a month ago, and now I'm here. I can't say it with better words.

I'm doing the wrong travel, and I want it to cease. It's an extemely difficult thing I'm exposing here, it's really special and complex obviously, it's rare to see someone go to 100 to 0.I'm facing one crap of a problem.

 I have to let go of dead wood and insufficiencies in me, and that would be my obssessive loop. It's hard to let go of it, it's a kind of loop "thoughts" (except their not really thoughts, nothing to do with) I'm sorry it's hard to talk about because it's kind of a mindtrick. 
Everytime I think about something I should not do (not Everytime on everything tho) I do it. It's a mindtrick. 
This is something I have to let go of. It drives me further away from the truth and reality. I can't qualify it another way for the moment because I'm struggling with it right at this moment when I'm writing this message, an obssessive loop.

Help ?These are my true, authentic thoughts and feelings.

My Name is ES(not rly tho). I am in my 20s. I live up north. Where Americans think polar bears and humans walk among st each other rofl.  Enough banter for today, lets get into it.

Loner. Lurker. Ph.d  and mastery in procrastination and living the "quiet desperation".

Acceptance of the shadow (Carl m to the f JUNG HAHA). Same perception, same outcome when integrated (regarding this video) : [https://bit.ly/2qyGCAh](https://bit.ly/2qyGCAh)

.

When you let your fucking ego/persona, which is developed and formed, when living in civilization and society, not by your fucking core value and moral judgement but according to the external.

The external like other peoples persepctions and opinions. If you stop lying to yourself and with radical truth that deep down youre a sexual, lustful, greedy, lazy, fearful, inappropriate, rude, aggressive,  bloodlust, murderer and all the potentialy down to the core of evil, suffering for the sake of suffering.

When my friends, you can swallow that vomit inducing, repelling pill, the paradoxical nature of human nature,

not good, not evil. Both. You're both. Even the cleanst and most honrable man have a devil, an inferior demonic, satanic bum, a manifastaaion of evil it self.

When you can acept that, is when true tranendance, wholeness, and unity is achevied.

You stop judging, because the thing you so dislike in your brother, so it is in you. Will you hate yourself. Or accept your human nature and live in harmony, wholeness, tranquility and absence of fragmentation and  feeling of tension. Not resistance and struggle. And what all people desire. Self confidence/efficacy and self respect/self worth i,e self esteem.

Side note, ive been taking approximately half a gram of hashish and 100ml of of  benzydamine mouthwash.

I was wathing this video when the daydream accourd. It was then i decided to write my thoughts.

Currently i feel like a fucking genius. Some next level  Nietzsche sht.

Is this is what they call higher consciousness? Transcendence? Spiritual awaking?

ANYWAYYYYYYYY.

My next move the second youre reading this is,

to post this shit on reddit, forget about it for a couple of hours , watch some Luke Cage, S02,

Dont fucking get me wrong, his moral decsions are all fucked up.

"thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine OWN EYE. And then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.

Have a lovely day, wherever you guys are.

PPPPPPPPPPHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW bye.If they've read or listened to any of Jordan work then surely they should know that they are projecting their fears and weaknesses onto non whites. Even making them subhuman as we've read on this subreddit before about non whites. I'm pretty sure I've heard Peterson warn against that type of scapegoating and where it leads (think hitler). 

Why is racism against non whites so prevalent on this subreddit? Hey beautiful people, 

I'm 23 with no debt, in good shape, own my car and make a good income where I save 65&amp;#37; of it, invest in the stock market and on track to be able to retire by 33-35 ($1.5m). I am in a very challenging and fulfilling field and have a few close friends I workout with and play video games with. 

I plan on getting a vasectomy and wanted to know JBP's take on childfree living. I found two videos where he spoke on parenthood as a good responsibility, but not the only one, as I view my career as my main challenge in life. 

Do you know if a man can still live a fulfilling life without being a parent? I think so!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR4aQBUIGqE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR4aQBUIGqE)Hey guys! 

We all live in an echo chamber of some sort so I understand the importance of branching out to see other perspectives however wouldn't our time best be utilized with family, friends, career, exercise, sleep, good food, video games, writing and reading books? 

Would you ever take a 6 month, or longer, hiatus from all news and politics in your life? Do you think it would be a net positive or negative in the long-term? a deliberate, [surprisingly measured article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/arts/music/kanye-west-ye-interview.html) in the NYT.

i've [written](https://old.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/8pfwvr/jordan_peterson_x_kanye_west/e0cdu5t/) about Kanye as a synchronic manifestation of somebody attempting to integrate chaos &amp; order, publicly &amp; often painfully so, &amp; parts of this piece are astonishing JP's description of speech as a way of thinking:

&gt;‚Äú*We need to be able to be in situations where you can be irresponsible,*‚Äù he said. ‚Äú*That‚Äôs one of the great privileges of an artist. An artist should be irresponsible in a way ‚Äî a 3-year-old.*‚Äù

&gt;Even though this is the sort of behavior that gets Kanye labeled  inconsistent, it is perhaps his most enduringly consistent feature. He is **congenitally honest, almost shockingly unguarded in his speech.** You can almost watch him as he lobs a new thought into the public consciousness, then stands back and watches as it‚Äôs either embraced or swatted down.

________________________________________________________________________

Kanye's flirtation with trumpism &amp; now infamous slavery remark get ample treatment. but this a largely sympathetic profile of a messy, damaged, audacious, courageous &amp; insanely talented individual pursuing truth. it's a wonderful read, &amp; a chronicle of what "**burning off dead wood**" might look like.

&gt;Along the way, there will be missteps, setbacks, even upheavals. The healthiest choice, Kanye has discovered, is to learn from them, accept them and absorb them into who he‚Äôs becoming. I payed 76 total for the ticket, I'll let it go for 35 through pay pal, then I'll transfer through ticketmaster.

Good seats, LOGE 2 row 3 if you want to check out the seat map. Just shoot me a pm if interested. Hopefully I can hook someone up.I don't understand why Jordan B. Peterson has not talked more about non-dual liberation / spiritual enlightenment. His self-authoring suite is the anti-thesis exercise of meditation, the building of autobiography and fake self. Truth does not lie in self-hood or free will. It lies in the spiritual!

I am becoming comfortable with the fact that I don't have free will, that everything is run by itself. I'm not so comfortable the modifications of my mind. I want to shut off all self-referential thought to abide in non-dual awareness.

Self-referential thought is the largest delusion ever. It's insanely paradoxical and nonsensical. Everyone's mad, Everyone's insane, No one's sane - except those who sees with blind eyes. Those who are enlightened. Who know Truth. Who abide in awareness without self-referential thought.

I was in the shower one day in the darkness and I was thinking who am I? Who is thinking these thoughts? The shower is usually a place of extensive self-referential thinking. I had found a switch from my thinking, which I pressed and there they went, completely gone. No thoughts. Stillness. Unlike I've ever experienced before. It wasn't mystical, or religious, or had intense emotions, just no "blah, blah".

Why "blah, blah", why not "now, now, now"?

All stories immediately disappeared and understanding of this came in thought. My understand of the brain came into mind:

Self-referential thought arise from the Default Mode Network, which is mostly activated while you're not tasking, it's correlated with music, story comprehension, etc.[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/opinion/harvard-asian-american-racism.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/opinion/harvard-asian-american-racism.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region)

\&gt; [The report by the plaintiff‚Äôs expert witness](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/sffa-files-motion-for-summary-judgment-against-harvard/), the Duke University economist Peter Arcidiacono, revealed that Harvard evaluated applicants on the extent to which they possessed the following traits: likability, helpfulness, courage, kindness, positive personality, people like to be around them, the person is widely respected. Asian-Americans, who had the highest scores in both the academic and extracurricular ratings, lagged far behind all other racial groups in the degree to which they received high ratings on the personality score.

\&gt;‚ÄúAsian-American applicants receive a 2 or better on the personal score more than 20&amp;#37; of the time only in the top academic index decile. By contrast, white applicants receive a 2 or better on the personal score more than 20&amp;#37; of the time in the top *six* deciles,‚Äù wrote Mr. Arcidiacono. ‚ÄúHispanics receive such personal scores more than 20&amp;#37; of the time\* in\* the top seven deciles, and African Americans receive such scores more than 20&amp;#37; o\*f the time in \*the top eight deciles.‚Äù

Can someone say "projection"There are a wide variety of opinions and ideas from the subs here but I was thinking about what the board's become and I think we need to put aside our differences.

I am a very conditional supporter of Dr. Peterson and some of you will know I am overtly critical at times but I ask you in the cause of something greater to read what I am about to say and think about it dispassionately. For some time now the board has been polarizing into what we all agree is the revolting area of Identity Politics. We all seem to be able to grasp something the mainstream has real difficulty with, namely, the essential core message of Dr. Peterson's teachings. I began with my interest in Dr. Peterson because of this core message and I remember feeling great joy and relief that someone had come to prominence who could meaningfully communicate the importance of these myths and fables without being howled down as a krank or bible thumping idiot. His profession as a clinical psychologist gave him the *understanding* required to make the connections which the mainstream and conventional modes of thinking found it apparently impossible to do. Many of us here recognized this and I feel sure you can relate exactly to what I am talking about.

But something's happened since then, well many things have happened but something has happened to that initial surge of appreciation and his coming to prominence. We all fell for it and it seems that Dr. Peterson has to. He's been drawn into a political swamp of enmity and antagonism, and we're all covered in the shit of it now, including JP. It's clear that it was the C-16 issue which provided the impetus but it was his central understanding of a moral compass which gave him the strength and conviction to oppose that bill. It is this moral compass he should be talking more about but he is being beguiled I think by money, perhaps fame, professional pride and career embellishment, what have you. The point is he isn't talking about the underlying reasons for the position he takes and it **these things** which are of critical importance, not those others, they are essentially peripheral to the main question and answer as to what the fuck are we doing here and what is the best way to live.

We know that JP frequents this board although perhaps not as much now but maybe there are associates and acquaintances who do that can communicate to him what I'm talking about and maybe, just maybe, if you, the peers of this board can be encouraged to do so aswell perhaps we can cajole him to focus again on what's of critical importance rather than what's of peripheral importance.

It's wildly baffling how one can be distracted from a goal of such importance without even being aware of it but he is swimming in heady waters now.So hey everyone I'm on my way on making my life as good as it can be and I already encountered several problems that are part of development. 

Currently I'm into what you would call self-sabotage because my brain is afraid of me being hurt in a way if I SUCCEED. I figured disappointment and this might be it, but things need to be precisely cleared out so no conclusions drawn out yet.



[WARNING : SELF SABOTAGE LESSON COMING GO TO END WARNING IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED

PS: I've found that on Tony Robbins content, self sabotage go for it. One of the few things I'm taking valuable enough currently to actually work, taking account the fact I'm really at the edge of success. No arrogance intended or disillusion intended.]

And so my brain wants to drive me away, but what I convince him is first.

You know you're not helping me a lot here, but I know you're doing it for a right reason, you're trying to protect me and that's just you being positive.

Whenever we self sabotage it's our brain doing something positive. In my particular case for example, he wants to keep me away from success because he's afraid that I would be disappointed with that success, or something of the kind. 

So it evades this little pain and drive me away from it. And in those situations what you have to do step by step is :

Go see Tony Robbins video. Original content you'll get the message straight instead of me repeating it, that's how you loose valuable content. I was tapping it but I abandon so.

[END WARNING] 

Because I'm a bit struggling with self sabotage right now I can't allow myself (for my good actually) to listen to someone or something thag would be not on my level of experience. Otherwise I will just retrograde and damn sure that's the last thing I want to avoid. So I'm even hesitating listening to Tony Robbins tape on that now.

Because some of his content let's say, are really addressed to people far way down the way I've crossed already. I don't want to go into regression you know. And I'm genuinely feared, not being arrogant when I'm tapping this. 

And having that self sabotaging thing I have to deal with currently, quite a pain in the ache. It's like I think about something and it happens. More or less, so I can't go into details, because you know it's not a good idea if I'm writing not good things with that current problem you know.

So currently I don't know, I don't even remember why I decided to write this but I'm not saying no to a little bit of helping here with the things I've shared.

Feel free to ask any questions. And it's usually the sheltered ones who have never been through anything pushing this victim agenda the most. It's like a trend in western society. Even western women think they are ending oppressed LMAO. No offense but it seems a lot of westerners are living in a complete bubble separate from the rest of the world. 

Also a lot of western feminists seem to have manly haircuts and reject all feminine roles or attributes. So on the one hand they are crying about some imiganry regime that is oppressing them while on the other hand they are trying to be men. These are my thoughts today. &gt;He who by Tao purposes to help a ruler of men will oppose all conquest by force of arms. (30)

&gt;(Tao) clothes and feeds all, but does not pose as their master....Because it would never claim greatness, therefore its greatness is fully realized. (34)

&gt;The adherence of the populace can only be won by letting-alone. (57)

&gt;Ruling a large kingdom is indeed like cooking small fish. (i.e. the less one handles them the better) (60)

&gt;The people are not frightened of death. What then is the use of trying to intimidate them with the death-penalty? (74)

&gt;The people are difficult to keep in order because those above them interfere. That is the only reason why they are so difficult to keep in order. (75) 

&gt;The Way is like an empty vessel that yet may be drawn from without ever needing to be filled. It is bottomless; the very progenitor of all things in the world. (4)

&gt;The expression of Vast Virtue is derived from the Tao alone. As to the Tao itself, it is elusive and evasive. Evasive, elusive, yet within it there are things. Shadowy and dim, yet within it there is a vital force. The vital force is very real, and therein tells truth. (21)

&gt;Tao never does, yet through it all things are done. (37)

&gt;What is of all things most yielding can overwhelm that which is of all things most hard. Being substanceless, it can enter even where there is no space; that is how I know the value of action that is actionless. (43)

&gt;The Sage arrives without going, sees all without looking, does nothing, yet achieves everything. (47)

&gt;Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. (56) 

-Lao Tzu

&gt;(statist:) You say there must be no government. But if there is no government, how are men's hearts to be improved?

&gt;(Chuang-tzu:) The last thing you should do is to tamper with men's hearts. The heart of man is like a spring; if you press it down, it only springs up the higher.... A wild steed that cannot be tethered -- such is the heart of man. (Waley, p. 70)

&gt;Suppose you and I have had an argument. If you have beaten me instead of my beating you, then are you necessarily right and am I necessarily wrong? If I have beaten you instead of your beating me, then am I necessarily right and are you necessarily wrong? Is one of us right and the other wrong? Are both of us right or are both of us wrong? If you and I don't know the answer, then other people are bound to be even more in the dark. Whom shall we get to decide what is right? Shall we get someone who agrees with you to decide? But if he already agrees with you, how can he decide fairly? Shall we get someone who agrees with me? But if he already agrees with me, how can he decide? Shall we get someone who disagrees with both of us? But if he already disagrees with both of us, how can he decide? Obviously, then, neither you nor I nor anyone else can decide for each other. Shall we wait for still another person? (p.48)

&gt;Master Tung-kuo asked Chuang Tzu:

&gt;"This thing called the Way -- where does it exist?"

&gt;-- There's no place it doesn't exist.

&gt;"Come,,you must be more specific!"

&gt;-- It is in the ant.

&gt;"As low a thing as that?"

&gt;-- It is in the grass.

&gt;"But that's lower still!"

&gt;-- It is in the tiles and shards.

&gt;"How can it be so low?"

&gt;--It is in the piss and shit.

&gt;Master Tung-kuo made no reply. (p. 241)In the past year I've tried to be a Christian, convinced myself I believed in the literal story, and always ended up falling out again. I'm not sure. I believe that there is a God (that something created us) but I don't really find that believing in the bible is necessary for me... 

Curious to hear from former Christians why they "left the Church". [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfJFxAvyE1Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfJFxAvyE1Y)

Love how the words "CLASH" and "HEATED" are capitalized to make it seem like a boxing match or something. Also, their faces in the thumbnail, they're like "ooooh shit no you didn't!"

The channel, "Conservative Network". I love it. The whole presentation of this video has that YouTubeness about it. I keep seeing arguments about this. I've watched all of the Biblical lectures. Many times he reaffirms that he is NOT reducing Christianity/Jesus/God to merely a metaphor. He has simply been pointing out the wellspring of mythological and psychological value contained in biblical stories. 

Peterson is on his way to finding Christ.  In his discussion with Paul Vanderklay, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUGGrZUFMg4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUGGrZUFMg4) , he says that in the coming months he will be looking more deeply into the historicity of the Resurrection. 

I'm making this post because people are confused by his recent tweets, in which he defines God in terms of the role God plays in the psyche. His definition, however, is merely psychological but not metaphysical/ontological. Hierarchies as Dr. Peterson has pointed out with the lobster example are millions of years old. I have been curious for a while about whether I need to accept this reality of hierarchy and attempt to climb to the top. Do I for example have to be more disagreeable to be more successful? Do I need to be more alpha? Do I need to be less harmless or at least become more capable of taking tough actions that might appear not nice? Is there no way out? Is our existence limited only to the hierarchy? Can we not escape this and lead lives that are aimed at just being calm and not participating in the hierarchy? I would like to hear some responses and opinions on this. Thank you.I had a roommate in my college dorm who was a really nice guy. Well dressed and polite. But he was awfully lonely and depressed. One night he tells me how he dealt with depression since he was a child and attempted suicide when he was six. We weren't that close as he was fairly reserved and I didn't ask much. I just didn't know what to do. Here is someone confiding their most vulnerable secrets to me, a stranger. I have been in slumps myself which weren't by any means suicidal but I know what it is like for someone to act like they know you enough to judge your value on the basis of flaws they see in you that they don't see in themselves. 

So what should I do? Tell him that life i precious and he should value it? What do I know about hi life to judge that he can come to the same conclusion? Or maybe give him a religious argument for meaning and value? I'm far to clumsy with words to articulate  my points in a graceful manner. Add to that the fact that I barely talk to people myself so my communication skills are least to say imperfect. And by what authority do I have to tell him what he should do with his life or its value? In many ways he is more talented and capable than I am, So what do I do? All I did say was that he should get help and slept on it.  He never brought it up again. I know for fact that his parents are aware of his condition so chances are he did  get some help which probably didn't help. 

The man was alone. And not alone as in feels isolated. Alone as in he needed to request a group photo from a bunch of strangers in campus to send to his father as a sign that he is living a normal 19 year old's social happy life kind of alone. The kind that makes a six year old think for 13 years his life is meaningless and futile. I don't know what transpired of him after that as I moved to a college out of city. So, I just want to know. What could I have said or done that is more helpful than simply saying get help which for some reason feels to me like a cop out, at least my case.

tldr; My roommate who is briefly know confided in me his depression and suicidal tendencies. What do I say to him that would be of most help?All the progress I have done in personal development will not be lost ? Like when you have a little bit regression going on, due to the circumstances I've been merging from I concluded that I really need to chill out in order to come back. I might be pushing myself too much while I feel the natural things to do for the moment would be to just chill. 

I can't even find a proper reward for myself so I really think I should chill. What do you suggest ? Thanks for answersI was under the shower just now and I was playing the role of talking about my personal experiences in life to a public of young people, and when I talked about something proper to my personality that I've done, talking about it on a third person perspective (because the speech was oriented in such a way) I felt weird for an instant and then I had this brutal earthquake in my psyche, like if I was separated myself from myself while talking about what I did. 


What the hell has happened I'm still feeling froggy does anyone has an answer for this phenomena please ?There's a trope that the villain is the hero of his own story. I don't think that's true. I think there are plenty of villains that are the villain of their own stories.

It's people without any touch to their inner devil that perpetuate that idea. There have definitely been times where the idea of just being the villain out of sheer sadism had some appeal to me.

I'm generally an empathetic person, but it's more like there's a war going on inside of me most of the time. Part of me likes brutality. I was sometimes mean to pets growing up, sometimes very loving. I stopped the meanness as I grew up. I was mean to my brother growing up, also grew out of that.

Once someone cut me off on the highway. It pissed me off for a moment, but the anger subsided and I chased him down the highway at speeds of over 100 mph out of the thrill of knowing that he was scared out of his mind. It was no longer revenge. I had let go of the fact that he had passed me. Rather, at that point, it was just funny to me. I was a teenager then. I've also since stopped doing stupid shit like that.

If you were to just disable my empathy, I don't think I'd just become a serial killer. I'd probably be a corporate psychopath, or maybe enlist in the army.

But I know this side of myself well. I know the bounds of it. When I hear naive atheists say things like "religion is the cause of evil," I want to slap them in the face. How sheltered can you be? I mean, I suppose it's cute that some people don't have any conception of what it means to enjoy hurting another being for the sake of being able to do so without consequence. Or, maybe they just think that's a rare thing and that it's not part of normal people.

Kids are brutal to each other growing up. People say things like "bullies are just insecure." Bullshit. They like it because sadism is real. I'm tired of sugar coating human nature. Liberals really do a good job at teaching kids that everyone is a misunderstood nice person.

I think that conservatives are also equally guilty of not acknowledging this aspect of human nature. I.e. the "let men just fight it out." No, don't do that. Some men take it too far. Or, they think it's a good idea to deregulate everything and let the free market go. No, don't do that either. There are genuinely sadistic people who take advantage of others. I know not because I'm some radical leftist fighting power imbalances, I know because I can relate with the *perpetrators.*

The dark side of human nature needs to be acknowledged. Utopianism is dangerous. Utopianism gives that dark side of human nature stealth. It gives your own dark side stealth. See, when I was a teenager chasing down that guy who cut me off, I didn't even really realize that I was just power tripping at that point. I had no education growing up on what that was like, and what that meant.

So, I was sheltered enough growing up that I experienced a blindness to my own evil. So, I was also wholly unprepared to deal with it, or channel it productively, since I learned suppression also doesn't work. It's like trying to suppress the sex drive. One way to channel it is to go shoot guns. Or go off-roading. Or hunting. Lifting weights is also good. Fighting sports. Football.

If you want the good to win, you have to recognize your bad and use it as a tool, at least as night vision goggles.[https://www.meetup.com/Buffalo-Jordan-B-Peterson-Meetup/](https://www.meetup.com/Buffalo-Jordan-B-Peterson-Meetup/)

Just started a Buffalo JBP [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) group. Anyone in Western New York, join!Hi everyone, I'm annoyed by the fact that I mess something up.

I kill my own value system or I'm requestionning it way to often when someone says something that is not appropriate about me, I'm slightly putting myself under their opinion.

I do that unconsciously like if I self destroy. Before doing it I believe I tell myself "why not do putting myself into a troublesome situation that would maybe make me weak for fun (or another reason that I subconsciously ignore)".


What should I do to stop that ? Thanks for answersIn direct experience, there's only consciousness and what's being conscious of. How can we know anything else?*This whole creation is essentially subjective,*

C.G. Jung

You probably think that white men exist, that it's truth. I have an alternative view to offer that they do not exist, and that its false. I'm basing this on my own experience.

A white man is something that happens or appears *in vision*. If there is not a white man in vision, there is no white man. Why is changes in vision reality or existence? Do we not assume that existence or reality is unchanging?

If we want to figure out what exists shouldn't we focus on what does not change? Something that changes ultimately will not exist, if we use language to conclude that it does exist even if it won't.

I presume that you equate existence or something that exists based on that it does not change. If you see the futility or delusion in something that we define to exist but will not.

If you don't, we can just say "White men is not absolute". What is absolute?*(Just kidding, it won't take that long.)*

I Am is the only thing any sentient being can know. There is no higher someone that somehow knows something you don't because it's not possible for any conscious entity to know more than I Am. No one can have any other knowledge because there's no other knowledge to be had. That's not a *you* limitation or a *human* limitation, that's a consciousness limitation. No one can know more than I Am, so what does that make God? Can there be a supreme being who doesn't know any more than you or me? A supreme being who is entirely belief-based? In other words, delusional? Of course not. Once we've ruled out the possibility of knowledge, we've ruled out the possibility of God. Just that simple. No God, no higher beings, no all-knowers or insiders of any kind. But don't waste a tear on God or Allah or whoever else you thought was up there, the truth is much better than the fairytales.

Beyond I Am, it's all belief. There is nothing to know because there is only consciousness, and that thou art. Ignorance is not a matter of what we don't know, but what we do know that's not true. In the dreamstate, false knowledge is everything and true knowledge is *Sentio*, *ergo sum*. I am aware, therefore I am. I-Am/Consciousness.

So, with one diamond bullet, we have killed God, gods, science, philosophy, religion, and any and all other claimants to knowledge, and we didn't use belief to do it, we proved it. Not bad for a couple of paragraphs. I-Am/Consciousness is the weapon that destroys the universe.

\-Jed McKennaWe've all seen videos of ANTIFA attacking people for their clothing or their speech. What are your opinions on purposely going places where you may be attacked to make a point?

I live in the Portland metropolitan area and ANTIFA has shown up to several free speech 'rallies' to fight people.

While the idea of a free speech rally sounds somewhat insane, the violent responses have shown that it may be needed. I'm an able bodied male with a pretty mild temperament, I think I would be safe from serious bodily injury if I were to attend.

My opinion is that I should not attend any events like this because they are often organized by controversial public figures and that don't represent me.

What are your opinions on this?Hi Dr Peterson Hi everyone, I'm currently not operating fully in the world because I struggle to manifest the potential I have accumulated from the experiences I previously had.

I developed a life vision, I see what would I want to be and it's a good vision for me as far as I know, I've managed to be that way for like (I'm talking about state of being), 2 weeks, but now I don't know exactly what is happening because I struggle to come back.

What is holding me back from attaining that life vision I've developed ?  If anyone knows where I'm stuck at or if you have any tips to give me don't hesitate, thank you very much !!I use to not be able to learn anything in class. It was a combination of being distracted and inability to keep up with classroom pace. Now I can pay attention clearly and I improved a bit on reading, writing, and verbal communication. 

I notice my moms family has higher level anxiety traits. My grandma is a huge worrier. My aunt has OCD. My other aunt is the smartest but for some reason fails at exams. My uncle is a smoker and drinker(I think it calms his mind) My other uncle never moved out never graduated primary school, never seen him in a relationship, though he takes care of the main house in Philippines.My mom looks like a mess outside, but  she always has it figured out. They're a bit moody. One hour everything is going well, next thing I hear is someone having an argument. I also notice them to be quite empathetic.

My gut feeling tells me my 'anxiety genes' is a big part of my complications(ADHD symptoms, social anxiety, selective mutism, social withdrawal, overeating, slow learner)

And paying attention to the source, anxiety, made things so much better for me.

Am I thinking in the right place?

Hi everyone.

I use the internet too much. I probably average at least 2 hours a day of time wasted doing nothing but mindlessly skimming through the YouTube feed, sometimes actually watching something novel and interesting, but much of the time just displacing time.

I also waste a lot of time mindlessly browsing this subreddit. I read a good amount of posts, but usually when they're too long/academic I don't bother, which is really depressing because it's not like I don't find that kind of thing enjoyable and stimulating when I actually focus on it. The problem is that since the internet has fragmented my attention span, I don't have the patience for such things. 

JBP says to not do things that make you feel weak. Mindlessly browsing the internet makes me feel weak. It makes me feel like my life is slowly passing me by and I'm dissatisfied with it that I have to escape into a virtual reality.

I want to read more, I want to write more, but both of those things usually aren't as immediately gratifying as the internet. 

Has anyone successfully decreased the amount of time they've spent online?Book V of Wealth of Nations is often skipped but contains  A.Smith's view upon education. 

J.P's opinion upon liberal and arts education, reminded me of  A.Smith's book.

I remember I first came through these words when I was still a college student. I read to my girlfriend back then, we were both amused.

Awareness is truth and appearance is belief. Instead of awareness and appearance, we can say dreamer and dream, beholder and beheld, or yin and yang. There's plenty to be said about appearance, but the only thing you can say with certainty is that it's not true, just as you can say with certainty that untruth does not exist. Consciousness is true and truth exists. The content of consciousness is not true and untruth does not exist.
Although it's not true and doesn't exist, appearance is absolutely necessary. Without appearance, there can be no awareness, but there is awareness so there must be appearance. Without anything to be aware of, awareness is not aware. Without anything to be aware of it, appearance does not appear. Yin and yang.

This begs a lot of which-came-first type questions, all of which are nullified by the fact that consciousness does not exist within time. There is no causality, no this-then-that, there is only Is. It's not very satisfying, but it's undeniable. We are the dreamer and what we call reality is the dream. That's as far as you get when you start digging because no matter where you dig in a dream, you just keep digging forever. I don't understand the dreamstate, but I do understand that it can't be understood. You can wake up in the dreamstate and you can wake up *from* the dreamstate, but you can't wake up *to* the dreamstate. There's nothing there to wake up to.

In order to explain the nature of reality, you would first have to determine that reality actually exists, which, actually, you can't. Yes, reality is obviously real, but the fact is that no one has ever proven that reality exists and no one ever will because no one can prove anything. There is no such thing as *objective* knowledge and the only *subjective* knowledge is I-Am/Consciousness.

All supposed knowledge is really belief masquerading as knowledge, and the word for belief masquerading as knowledge is delusion. If everything you think you know is really just belief, and if belief itself is knowably false, then your entire reality can in no way be distinguished from a dream. There is no truth in the dreamstate because, in truth, there is no dreamstate.I managed to become my ideal self three weeks ago, I figured out what would be the best for me. 

Compassion
Authenticity
Depth
IntegrityÔªø

And an excellent role model and a way to conduct in life, with meaningful goals established. 

I had all of this and I felt complete for like 1 or two weeks. However since 3 weeks now I find myself engaging in expedient things, expedient thinking and I still feel that all this progress as a person is there. But I struggle reaching my ideal self again now. 

How could I reach my full potential again ? I don't think all this progress I've made as a person is lost. But I seriously struggle with just coming back to that person.

Thank you very much for answers.Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otRgd5lapXM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otRgd5lapXM)

Even if the  liar be convicted latter on, who would compensate the two poor men for all the opportunity costs, including reputation, career opportunity lost, scholarship lost and legal cost?Ôªø Just a guess would rank the number in the neighborhood of millions.

In theory, the girl can be sued for loss. But what is the likelihood that she would realistically pay **IN FULL**, before declaring bankruptcy?

By the principle of innocence before proven guilty, I hardly find it acceptable not to give the benefit of doubt and wait for a final verdict of legal system, with patience, clam and civilized manner. To do otherwise may suspiciously resemble a witch hunt.

This whole story makes me ponder on a lot of questions:

* Why is that acceptable for a mob to jump on a suspect before the court decision is issued, as it often happens in reality in similar cases?
* If it is acceptable, is this at least in spirit an violation of the principle of innocence before proven guilty?
* Are all the members of the mob, at least guilty to some degree, by the logic of benign of evil, if not active evil, however small it may be?
* If so, should them be made legally liable in some way, lest the accusation be proven to be false latter on?
* Can a men's reputation and dignity be possibly compensated fully even in theory? Are a men's reputation and dignity priceless?
* Nikki's sentence of 1 year pales greatly in comparison to possible sentences the two poor men could get. Is this really justice served or another demonstration of double standard ?

Put yourself in the two men's shoes, are you afraid? Moreover, suppose there be no brave witnesses to prove your innocence, what would happen to you is very clear. How do you reconcile with such injustice ever, when your innocence can never be proven?

**‚ÄúThere is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide**.‚Äù  Albert Camus.

What can possibly prevent you from suicide if an injustice be big enough. This is where I recall J.P.'s words on suffering. However, I would not possibly be sure I'd be strong enough if such injustice be upon me:

* job lost
* reputation ruined
* no one believes I am innocent
* everyone looks me in a hostile way

Under the hypothetical case, If I do commit suicide,  is this a surrender to the mob and injustice?

Such is the drifting in my mind.Even some I don't need. Internet is shaping our society with the information availability, more and more people are waking up to this. We forget how to feel, how to learn by ourselves. I'm not saying it's bad or good tho.

I'm unconsciously putting myself under challenge every time I learn something new. It's not all good. For example if I've just read or listen a piece of information on a particular subject, like how starving helps you balancing your alimentation, I will not eat until starvation and so on. 

That's an example of what I'm doing unconsciously, I don't really know how to stop that and decide by my own when it is worthy to take on a challenge.

Maybe I'm not the only person struggling with this so maybe some people will relate. 
If you have any tips on how to stop this, I'm taking it. Thanks for answersIt seems the definition of "Fascism" has morphed over time and is now used to discredit others. 
Am I mistaken that it was originally defined as an amalgamation of Corporations and a Dictatorship?

I could be wrong about everything but that's why I'm looking for some scholarly insight on this subject and the historically accurate record.I'm a fan of his insistance that you get off your ass and do what you want to, instead of wallowing around doing nothing with your life. But I can't help but notice his obsession with the left has blindsided him to the much larger issues the world faces today.

1. The rise of authoritarian capitalism in many countries, through lobbyism in the US and generally China.
Few would argue this is a good thing. Free market is one thing, but a government catering only to megacorporations can only lead to less freedom.

2. The risk of larger military conflict has increased on a depressing scale. China and the US antagonizing one another, like the EU and Russia while a quiet arms build ups pile on. 

3. Climate change. Perhaps the biggest threat to mammalian life. Pretty much the entire academia agrees that we risk catastrophic ecological collapse if, as it is now, pollution is left unchecked. Farms flooding lakes with nitrogen, overfishing, co2 pollution and deforestation is transforming our planet.

So I know JP isn't superman, but as a man who I have no doubts truly wants to make the world a better place, why does he never mention the issues above? He has the platform to do so, and raising awareness is the least he could do.
To my utter disbelief, he has started posting anti-climate stuff, which actually endangers us further. So why do you guys think he spends so much time on battling the left instead of these, much more serious, problems?

-A sincere, but worried fan.
You know that anger, frustration and impotence you're experiencing? That's what it feels like when you're not able to control the agenda or the perception of reality any more, and it's only going to increase as you're drawn to a more equitable reality. You know what you have to thank for this? The Internet, and the crash in confidence in mainstream media, not to mention the zeitgeist.I suspect he's had long conversations about this with his closest confidants and they've come to the conclusion that his record speaks for itself. But it's disingenuous for him to engage with it on behalf of White Identity which he and many on this board regard as axiomatic when if he were, and those here were capable of being intellectually honest you'd all acknowledge that it doesn't exist as an aspect of Objective reality and is an imposition on it.

Although race is understood to exist as an aspect of developed societies in the West, in Europe the issue is a much different one than in America. The tone and sentiments expressed at recognisable times of the day are clear.

I've had the sense ever since I began thinking about it that racial tensions in Europe will be a much more difficult issue to address because the peoples of Europe have a certain homogeneity that doesn't apply in America. Racists in Europe who claim White Identity use their ethnicity to reinforce their claim to being White. In America I think it's understood by those who can that everyone has been deracinated, this extends to so called Whites. The essential tensions that are derived from race in America have been equality of opportunity but in Europe it's a different matter. Ethnic minorities in Europe face an essentially irresolvable dilemma. They can **never** become, say, German or English, French etc. All they can hope to truly possess is a political status equivalent to the indigenous ethnic peoples where they reside. An actually authentic Sense of Identity equivalent to these indigenous peoples would be their original, so to say, God given one.

In modern republics in the West, everyone's Identity is a conceit of the Enlightenment and can be argued to have been sourced from just a man, or men perhaps, but clearly not from God. Painfully it has to be accepted that the only genuine and authentic Sense of Identity that one can maintain even to death is that bestowed on us by God.A  theist can't ask why an atheist would be right in a deterministic world  because at that point the theist would have already lost, it's a  deterministic world. Theism has created the following paradox: not  understanding the human capacity for abstract thought theists gave  themselves up to conjecture, considering mankind is capable of both  logic and emotionally biased thought it was inevitable that 2 opposing  factions would surface. Once the idea of god was introduced into pop  culture it became idiosyncratic with human existence. Anybody can start  praying to god when a strong earthquake occurs, even the most adamant  atheist. "Hey god, I know I haven't exactly been the ideal follower of  yours, but just in case you exist, even if there is 0.00001% chance you  are real, could you please save me? I'll be your best buddy! Make me  immortal and I'll be your BFF!" Why would an atheist be afraid to commit  suicide? The defensive mechanism in their brain (be it consciously or  subconsciously) tells them that in the event that god is real they will  go to hell (this doesn't have to be the only reason, it's one of the  reasons). So even atheists are hypocrites. It was never about theists vs  atheists, it was about emotion vs reason, is god real or fictional?  Depends on how you phrase it, he is real in the sense that god is a  topic people discuss everyday. He is fictional in the sense that  atheists do not believe in deities.

Even some atheists want god to exist (in the literal way, not fictional). People can feel one thing, think another.

To  go even further than that, there is a conflict within every human being  on an individual level, even a conflict of interest at times. Logically  you know you need to work in order to get paid, but emotionally you  hate your job. So we bite the hand that feeds us. This doesn't  necessarily mean emotions are bad for us, it's emotion which brings us  together, that and mutual benefit, we are social beings after all.

Humans  simply aren't perfect, therefore we have conflict. Morality is the  product of human cultural evolution, said the atheist. Morality is the  result of the transcendent good in the universe (god), said the theist.  Based on man's capability of logic, there is no logical way to confirm  the existence of the supernatural. Based on man's emotions we want the  supernatural to be real, psychologically a sane person doesn't want to  die (however they may not want to live either).

This  would explain the general correlation (general not absolute) between  intelligence and atheism, a more intelligent person is more likely to  realize what they believe and why they believe it.

A  reoccurring theme is the concept of duality. Yin and yang may have  originated from China, but what is China? A land with an arbitrary name,  where people use an arbitrary language, has people of a certain  ethnicity etc. All of these are social constructs. Yin and yang is a  human philosophy. We need social constructs in life, we also need to be capable of distinguishing between a social construct and objective fact  (what man created vs what was already there).

If  there is constantly a battle between equally powerful yet opposite  forces why would we assume one must win? What if we can learn from both  sides? What if both sides have a reason to exist? There is a reason why  everything happens be it because of physics or "god".

"Jordan Bernt Peterson is a Canadian clinical psychologist and a professor of  psychology at the University of Toronto. His main areas of study are in  abnormal, social, and personality psychology with a particular interest  in the psychology of religious and ideological belief".

For  the sake of convenience (in case you aren't familiar with Jordan  Peterson) allow me to generalize the audience of JP into 3 categories:  people who mostly agree with him, people who don't have a strong opinion  of him, people who mostly disagree with him. If I had something to say  to the "fanboys/haters" it would be that life is far more complex than  being just an eternal penis measurement contest (this does not apply to  all of them, just those who say that he is right about everything based  on one thing he got right and those who say that JP is wrong about  everything, because they disagree with his religious views). It's silly  to hate a man because he is not perfect, it's silly to forgive him if he  is human. Of course no one man/woman has all the answers, no one human  is perfect, there is no cheat sheet to life, if there was we would have  had all the answers by now.

Not to  discourage or stress anyone out, but life is a journey where people keep  searching for answers to a seemingly infinite number of questions. Many of these contradictions are based on the notion that many concepts which are considered binary may not actually be binary at all. 

Let's  go back to determinism. Hypothetically if there is no god, but the  world isn't 100% deterministic either (there are theories about that)  what would I say? I'd say if you throw a basketball up in the air it  won't suddenly turn into a bowling ball and smack you in the face so  even if scientists one day confirm that the universe has "random events"  which science can't explain and aren't supernatural either, in  practical terms the world still wouldn't be "random enough" to be  considered random overall.

A little Matrix reference for you: "You take the **blue pill**‚Äîthe story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the **red pill**‚Äîyou stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."  
Which pill would **you** pick? I am a **red pill** man myself.

Why we believe what we believe?

We  believe what we believe because logic isn't always reasonable enough,  but there is a reason for everything. If the mostly rational person  wants to know what a spider is they can refer to Wikipedia. A mostly  emotional person who is afraid of spiders may say something like  "spiders are the physical manifestation of the devil's will". Both men  will be correct in their own way (the mostly emotional man is mostly  emotional, what would one expect from him?). Emotionally I want to be  right about everything, logically that's impossible. So I can't claim  that I'm 100% right based on logic and/or emotion. However if I am 100%  wrong at least the readers of what I have written now have a blueprint  on what **not** to believe :).

Seems I can be both bold yet skeptical, why do you think that is? There is more to mankind than meets the eye.[https://youtu.be/LunP7Q5Dulg](https://youtu.be/LunP7Q5Dulg)

Christine Hayes' introduction  is [there](https://religiousstudies.yale.edu/people/christine-hayes)**.**

From a theological point of view, she talked about how to deal with *fools*\[sic\], the importance of patience and civility and the complexity and issues of slanders.

it all reminds me of the complexity of freedom of speech and constructive conversations, if nothing else.

Be patient and finish it before you comment. I meant to bring a good material to you attention, above anything else.The Danish show 1864, about Denmark's defeat by Prussia which led it losing the best parts of land, is not easy to find in the English speaking world although it had aired at BBC before.

However, underneath there is a very deep social darwinistic message, showing the Danes understand social darwinism better than many other peoples, although the message is very subtle.

tl, dr:

There are two peasant brothers, Laust and Peter, and a peasant girl Inge. The local landowner Ditrich , son of a Baron, rapes Inge while Lauste and Peter are fighting the German. Ditrich also rapes Peter's lover Sofia, a mute gypsy girl.

While Inge bears Laust's son, Sofia bears Ditrich's son. Laust gets killed and Ditrich marries Inge, and both of them throw Laust's son, a peasant, to an orphanage. Ditrich and Inge rule the town as upper class and produce more offsprings, who are safely in the higher status.

Fast forward 150 years, the old baron, grandson of Ditrich and Inge, is still very rich and powerful but he is dying. (We don't get to learn where his relatives are but they are probably living very comfortably.

Meanwhile, there is a delinquent girl named Claudia, who is partly black and living with a Slavic never-do-well. her brother ended up as a soldier (a prole job) and got killed in Afghanistan. Claudia gets a job in the old baron, now partly deaf and dying.

Claudia reads the diary of Inge to the Baron who had written his grandmother's memoir before but had forgotten it since a lot of things happened between then and now. While Claudia steals jewelry from the Baron's house to fund her boyfriend's drug habit,, he forgives her because he realized she was descended from the child Ditrich had with the gypsy girl, raised as a son of the peasant Peter and acquiring that status.

But, before Claudia could raise her social status with her newfound relative, the old Baron dies and the show ends. The jewelry she stole would be the only thing she would get from her rich noble family. There is no mention of descendants of Peter or Laust's son, meaning their lines probably died out. And, although Claudia is a lowlife, her line did survive because she was descended from a nobleman.

===

Illegitimacy was quite common in the old days, and it can't be denied that if an unusually bright child comes from the lower class, it is not a mutation or something like that - it is likely that one of the grandfathers were of a much higher status.

In many case, women who had illegimate children with powerful men never had an actual child with her lower-class husband, which appears to be the case above. Similar cases are legion, like the woman who had Henry Ford's illegitimate son who was her only child.

Even if the woman has children with the lower class mate later, the bastard with the superior genes are more likely to outcompete his/her less able siblings (and they tend to think that they are above the rest even though they never learn their own origins), so their lines survive and the lines of their lower class stepfathers die out.

Even if the bastards' lines end up like the Kallikaks, they still outcompete others.

The genes of hardy, strong men do not survive. Their wives are more likely to raise the children of a higher class, higher-able person and they tend to drive the line of the hardy strong men to extinction.

tl.dr: in the end, intelligence and ability come from somewhere, which is not from lower class. Even if someone who appears to be from lower class makes it good, chances are somewhere in that person's family tree there is likely to be an elite.I met a girl, and I get along with her better than any girl I've ever met before. In the course of a few months, we've become best friends. When I first met her, I didn't think she was that attractive, but as we've grown closer I often find myself irresistibly attracted to her. She's not hideous, at all, but she's not the most objectively beautiful girl. That being said, I love her personality (soul?) so much that it makes her more attractive than most girls...

I want to date her, because I think she'd be a fantastic partner. And I'm certainly attracted to her. But part of me is insecure about the fact that she's not like... the kind of girl that makes your eyes go all looney-toons and pop out of your head. At least not when you first meet her. 

I've had the thought before that I love her, I just wish that certain things about her appearance would change, like the shape of her mouth. 

I understand how superficial and stupid this is, but how do I get over it? I dated an ugly girl in high school and I think it ruined my self-esteem in a way that I'm still getting over... I also know that I could get with girls that are more objectively attractive than this girl, but her personality really is a gem, to the point where it makes me want to jump her bones when I'm with her.

TLDR: I'm in a bit of a Shallow Hal situation (although she's not fat, nor is she very ugly, she's just not model tier, which part of me feels like I should go for). *For the sake of simplicity, I will work under the frame work of groups, not because I believe in group identity and politics strongly, but because I want to point out the inherent absurdity even within the framework.*

I am trying very hard to steel-manning the argument for group guilt of the white, as steel-manning is promoted by J.P.

One argument is that the white people, has a group, collectively are guilty  as their ancestors repressed bloodily the non-white people.

However, it is very suspiciously resembling  [collective punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_punishment#United_States) in law. In theory, it is not very different from saying that your father is a murder, so you are one too, at least to some degree, however small the degree may be.

Now, I can switch position and attack this position by pointing out group guilt is not collective punishment. Thus it is a very different thing. Isn't it the right thing to pay for your father's wrongdoings?

To counter this attack, I can switch back and point out it is absurd for a son or a daughter to feel guilty of the father's crime if his/her father murdered someone. Should the son be put into prison for his father's murder? Should the son be ordered or even feel obliged to pay for his father's crime, however small the payment may be?  In addition, group guilt is the rationale behind collective punishment.  Otherwise, how do you even justify collective punishment?  Thus,  to propose that white people, as a group, should be guilty to some degree just because their ancestors did some terrible things is obviously absurd, not to mention the issues about group identity and group politics, which I do not want to digress.

I can further point out the absurdity of the idea of white group guilt by even by going along with the idea of cross-generation guilt. If I follow the logic of cross-generation guilt, then:

1. Chinese guilt: Chinese has a everlasting group guilt because in ancient time, they invaded Vietnam many times.
2. Islam guilt: Muslims have a everlasting guilt because Muslims invaded Iberia and slaughtered a lot of people.
3. French guilt: French people have a everlasting guilt because they invaded Italy many times and killed a lot of people.
4. Polish guilt: The common wealth used to great and oppressed Ukrainians for a long time.
5. Mongolian guilt:  God knows  how many people Genghis Khan killed.
6. Men's guilt: Men used to oppress women for thousands of years.
7. Women's guilt: Before patriarchy, it is predominantly matriarchy. Women used to oppress men for millions of years.

I don't want to go on listing as I see countless accusations. I can even hazard that **not a single group** is innocent, in the extremely long course of history if sufficient manipulation of groups be employed.

If and when non-white people be helped, it should not be based on group guilt, but based on some other ideas such as national identity, love and patience towards peers, humanitarianism and etc. I don't want to digress here, due to limitation of time.

From a different angle, this is why everything must be centered around individuals. One is a criminal because one committed crime; one should feel guilty because one did something wrong. This is where I recall J.P. also emphasized the importance of individualism.

I am more than willing to admit my limitations if not flaws, as a human beings. If and when you comment, be civilized if not patient and loving. I have zero tolerate towards savage manners.Im quite fond of JP, if find him quite rigorous, very knowledgeable and I do have a favourable penchant towards his apparent ethics but I am still quite critical of some aspects of his work and I've become very specific about them. I've dedicated a lot of my own time studying reading and thinking before discovering JP, I've read his 12 rules, I went to one of his conferences, I watched  hundreds of hours of lectures and videos and again given it a lot of thought and have done  a lot of reading afterwards. 

I've been following this sub for a few months and I must say that its content is really poor... I think its content is so weak that it shouldn't even be using his name.

For these reasons and all of the underlying reasons that led me to the last proposition, I am unsubscribing... 

In other words... this is a shitty sub and shows almost no  valuable  discussion on topics related to JP's demonstrated ideas, hypotheses, thoughts, opinions, etc... 

Yes, a shitty sub with bs groupie posts... most of you need to read more than titles, captions and tweets to start cultivating your minds and becoming anything.

Your posts suck and don't mean anything.

Alright now, bye bye.

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬ØIn April I've gone through an ego death by facing a life-lie I was embedding myself in since 8 years straight. Facing my self deception was enough to make me experience an actual ego death.

I've opened the Pandora box where all the troubles were dormant. Now I've seen what potential I've got, and I think I have an idea of what truly matter, and I have developed new role model and better aim since then.

Jordan Peterson first mentioned that through his journey an individual have to define who they would like to be, and then what he truly needs would show up as he move forward in life. 

What an individual truly need is based on his biological system, so does changing your personality isn't, a pointless thing at the end, because you will end up answering your need in the best possible way. 

Maybe I'm wrong. And I think I am on some point, I'm oversimplifying here. 

Maybe the best question here would be how to know what part of personality needed to be improved.

Thanks for answers.While the title may seem odd I hope that you will bear with me. I would also like to caveat this letter with this. I realize that this stance seems to hold a multiplicity of negative connotations such as arrogance, condescension, and even narcissism. I in no way intend to convey those traits, I simply don‚Äôt know how to avoid them in regards to this topic. 

I have always been a firm believer that IQ is by no means the end all be all definition of intelligence, far from it actually. However, it can‚Äôt be ignored that people with above average IQ‚Äôs, for the sake of argument let‚Äôs say north of 130, seem to have issues with what most would consider normal social interaction. I‚Äôve read a lot of articles from well-respected individuals from many different fields on this particular issue. While all of these articles are very informative in giving a reason for this none seem to address what the hell to do about it. 

My circle of friends and family have always made remarks on my intelligence and how lucky I am everything comes so easy to me. When I attempt to explain what may seem like a gift to them feels like a curse to me (at times), well I may as well be looking in the gift horse‚Äôs mouth. All I‚Äôm really trying to do is explain to them that yes, it‚Äôs nice learning things faster than the average person but it comes at a sizeable psychological cost, at least in my case. I don‚Äôt react from an emotional standpoint in a way that they would in many situations. This makes me come off heartless/emotionless to them when in reality I recognize the severity of a situation but I‚Äôm approaching it logically as I don‚Äôt see the benefit in the emotional response. It got so bad I actually saw a psychologist to determine if I was a psychopath. I knew going in that I wasn‚Äôt because I am capable and do feel emotion, I just don‚Äôt display it unless it seems the logical thing to do, like at a funeral. 

Anyway, I asked the Dr. what I could do to help myself ‚Äúfit in‚Äù better. Obviously I realized that was and extremely tall order but I certainly didn‚Äôt have the answer. Her recommendations were not very helpful let‚Äôs say. Then I found Dr. Jordan Peterson. 

Reading your book 12 rules for life helped me deal with this issue more productively. However I still can‚Äôt seem to resolve the issue of how to articulate my perspective to others well. I‚Äôm curious what advice you or others would have as how to handle this? Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs not like my life is all chaos and this is some plaguing issue for me, it‚Äôs not. I just want to try and help them understand why I am the way I am. Essentially why my frontal cortex seems to take far greater priority to my amygdala. Thank you for everything you‚Äôve done and are continuing to do, it is definitely helping people. [A recent encounter\[link\] ](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/97nswf/fan_of_jp_but_always_skeptical_and_looking_for/e4ayfut/?context=3)makes me think: why did he/she be so enraged with no provocations whatsoever but only respectful and calm disagreement?

\[Let's assume it is a male for the sake of simplicity of writing. \]

Then I recall J.P.'s teaching about Maps of meaning: when one's ideology is threaten, the natural reaction for him or her is not to be clam and think, but to destroy, intelligently or physically.

Following this line, rage is a very natural reaction for any abnormality. It is even a necessary rationale before engage in verbal or physical attacks :

* It is why and how mobs used noises to block J.P. on campus \[[this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1P_1mLlJik&amp;feature=youtu.be)\].
* It is also why and how he was so enraged without any provocations in this incident.

But why did it happen to fellow J.P. admirers ? Didn't J.P. teach about this danger of rigid ideology in Maps of Meaning?

This is where I realize that wait, there is an inherent danger: to fully adopt/agree with everything J.P. says itself is a rigid ideology:

* This may be why J.P. emphasized very much upon the the mechanism between Chaos and Order, and the dangers of too rigidity ideology and too much chaos.
* This may likely also be why Communists have no issue to put formal fellow comrades, now "heretics", into prisons and gulags.

\----------------------------------------

However, from a philosophical angle, is such a traps set up by oneself inevitable, despite the thinker's efforts against it?

Such a question reminded me of  St.Augustine's fear in his latter life: he worried future generations will just worship him and would not think for themselves.

I worry the same, but this time, for a different great man, however arguable or controversial he may be.

Maybe this is why in bible, it is emphasized that one can only worship God but no other idols,  as in  Nehemiah 9:6 " You alone are the LORD".

For the atheists readers, I can rephrase it. Truth is the most fundamental, important thing. However, perfect knowledge is unattainable due to limitations of human beings. We can be closer to truth, but never exactly be the truth. But to worship any idol other than the truth is falsehood itself, if not laziness.

\----------Update---------

As some pointed out, he may have just attempted joking upon the lives of my children, my mother and me, in an arguably ambivalent way:

* If so, however, I am not sure if the ambivalence of the jokes is a sign of his entertainment with evil thoughts and intentions if not evil deeds, however small the ambivalence may be.
* If not, I do not need to digress there.

I am not trying to shame him or blame him with certainty, as I fully understand that people change all the time. He may very well  is or will be a guy with high moral standard, and has saved or will save tens if not hundreds of lives.  In addition, due to the fundamental limitation of human beings, I may very well be mistaken if not wrong.

The least I can say for sure are :

* the thought experience listed in the article is still valid and fascinates me at least temporally : the difference between following and worshiping is very subtle and hard to distinguish.
* My suspicion toward him is at least increased, while my good faith toward him is at least shaking of not non-existing.[http://greyenlightenment.com/no-dysgenic-collapse/](http://greyenlightenment.com/no-dysgenic-collapse/)

Tl, dr, there is no dysgenic collapse because the lower-IQ immigrants are largely irrelevant.

===

I personally think the Great War is the greatest disaster ever to fall to humanity, and both Gavrilo Princip (whom the Serbs think is a hero, an opinion I do not agree - indeed I think Clinton should have nuked Belgrade on 1999 to punish Serbia's incalculable sin to Civilization) and Brigadier Charles Fitzclarence, whose stupid charge at Gheluvelt prologed the Great War by 4 years , caused 9 million more deaths (including himself and his stupid 200 Worcester men whose acts  eventually helped people like Sadiq Khan and Meghan Markle) should be branded as criminals against human civilization and enemies of humanity, no matter what the opinions of Serbes and Worcestershire people might be.

At that time, there were 400m Europeans, North Americans and Japanese. And about 1/3 of them were rural Russians, or people like Romanians and Greeks, completely irrelevant to Civilization.  Despite of the 'example of Ramanujan, who was a star created by GH Hardy when the real students were getting killed at the trenches, (I personally think all of Ramanujan's 'achievements' should be flushed down the toilet but that's just me),

the cold truth is if all 1.2 billion, or about 75% of the world's population, living in the colonies and South America on 1914 disappeared, the world would have missed nothing.

They were not even deadweights - they simply **did not exist,** as far as Civilization was concerned.

But, thanks to Chuck Fitzclarence's stupid act, these people were armed and a lot of Chinese laborers were imported to Europe as well. Some of them stayed in Europe after the war and helped people like Chou Enlai and Teng Hsiaoping, who were admitted to French Universities to learn - Communism. Without Fitzclarence's stupid act, the anger of Britain and France would instead have exploded in the colonies, and we would have seen much , much less Africans, people from teh Subcontinent, South Asians, etc and much more higher-IQ people. (Some people have a soft spot on Chinese IQ, but even now, China can't create anything to save its own life  - it has to steal every little thing.)

And, because so many colonials were armed and had military experience, more and more concessions were granted to them which led to the independence of these countries (the few remaining colonies, like Puerto Rico and French Guyana, are freeloaders with no economic resources to speak about and are very happy sucking from Washington and Paris, or islands which are too tiny to be viable), leading to billions of people multiplying and consuming resources in a prodigious pace to make Singularity, Futurology, etc in doubt.

Right now, the example of a few hundred thousand 'smarter' (mostly in auxiliary way .. they make cost lower but do not really contribute anything vital, and bring their own culture  which have proved to be not too conducive for advancing civilization for millennia) people outside of Western background has not been enough to offset the incalculable harm caused by peoples not known for higher IQs.

As far as civilization is concerned, the bottom 20% simply does not exist, and the middle 60% do NOT add anything to civilization but just create unnecessary consumption. And, even in the top 20%, about1/4 - 1/2 of them are freeloaders or in industries which are going to die because of tech advancement.

tl.dr. I go further than GreyEnlightenment's claim that 50-75% of pop is deadweight.  I would say that 85-90% are deadweight, just like 1914 when only about 2.5% (the top 10% of Europe, North America and Japan, about 40 mil back then) were relevant, about half of the remainder (50% of the 360m remaining pop of these zones) were needed to maintain civ, and the rest and every single person in the colonies (including Ramanujan) simply **did not exist**  as far as Civilization was concerned.I had my results long time ago and I already put on work on it.

Some of them probably have changed. 

(Also apart from the topic at hand. Whenever I'm talking about the change that occured with me, I feel myself self-examining my psyche, it's a real weird and real feeling and I hate it. Due to that examination I feel less complete and less "one" with my psyche.)

Okay so that excepted, long time ago I had those results

Agreeableness 65th
Compassion 75th
Politeness 45th


Extraversion 25th 

Enthusiasm 36th 
Assertiveness 22th 

Conscientiousness 3th

Industriousness 9th
Orderliness 0th 

Neuroticism Low

Openess Moderately low 

So now I'm more assertive than I used to be, not excessively tho.

I'm moderately high in Openess today, a psychedelic experience changed my Openess level and pretty much my life.

I'm higher in industriousness, still low but probably near 20.
I'm still not quite orderly but I'm near 10. 

So I would like to improve on my politeness, being more blunt than I am, I thought of doing some shadow integration.
Also being more extraverted overall, I'm more assertive so that's good, but I'm aiming to improve my enthusiasm, if you have any tips to suggest me to improve on that or a trait that I should work harder on and I'm currently missing I'm open to suggestions, thanks very much !!So, here's my situation. 

I have notes about health, scientific annotations, general tips and advice. 
I want to archive them in a way that I am reminded constantly that they exist so that I can regularly read a little bit of it, sorta like a bible I suppose. 
My current approach is to print them and find a physical stand to organise it by category, but maybe someone in this sub has come across a better method.  I really disagree when Jordan Peterson says money is not the issue, how he denies the maslow pyramid and thinks that carrying the cross or get responsabilities and therefore life is suffering is the real deal. Money is indeed very important and violence is due its bad distribution, maslow pyramid is like negating theory of relativity in psychology and life is not suffering as it is, life is finding ways of reducing suffering and taking advantage of it, which money helps a lot.

Also i think many of his dreams are probably bullshit.First &amp; Second wave feminists have been increasingly silenced by the current climate of "transgender" ideology (which is distinct from transsexuality). A notable high-profile example of this is the demand to no-platform renowned feminist Germaine Greer who has spent a lifetime devoted to women's liberation and is now being mischaracterised as transphobic for simply stating the fact that males are not women. Make no mistake, Greer will never be silenced, but the attempts to denounce her voice concerns many women, transsexuals and lesbians in the feminist movement who are increasingly targeted and silenced on all social media platforms.	
 	
Feminism has been a serious and beneficial discourse since the early writings of Mary Wollestonecraft, Minna Kant, Emma Goldman and Virginia Woolf (and many others) and has established itself as a rigorous academic discourse as well as flourished in women‚Äôs literature and art for centuries. 	
The radical feminist theory of patriarchy may sound like a hostile accusation, but it simply refers to the effort to liberate women by dismantling the stereotypical expectations placed on both men and women from a society which idealized masculinity to the extent that it limited the male and female experience. Gender came to be a useful term to pit all the feminine and masculine expressions which did not pertain to the behaviour, personality, or expression of an individual in the collective. The general population, as you have noted, consists of feminine men and masculine women as well as masculine men and feminine women. No single stereotype applies to all the lived experiences of either sex. The theory of patriarchy is the claim that the social construct of ‚Äògender‚Äô or as it is now referred to as ‚Äògender identity‚Äô is but a mere hypersexualized stereotype which is oppressive to women and men and has historically been used as a tool to oppress women (e.g. through finishing schools).

Germaine Greer was born in 1939 and has experimented in a lot of different ways to liberate women from oppression of patriarchy which idealized masculinity to the extent that caused suffering for all people, men and women alike. She has distinctly told that she does not choose to talk about trans issues at all because it simply doesn't interest her, and as her cause is to further women's liberation (globally, I might add), it is incredibly sexist of anyone to demand a woman spend her time appeasing transgender men in their identity crises since she rejects the social construct of genderism itself as a misogynistic attempt to fetishize femininity onto women.

This is a very simple conflict we have at our hands currently: trans rights, gay rights, and women's rights are all important causes, but these rights cannot impede on each other through the invention of gender (=femininity&amp;masculinity) because they have been proven to be cancelling each other out. ‚ÄúTransgendered‚Äù men demand lesbians to be sexually attracted to penises and assault them out of LGBT pride demonstrations and call them ‚Äútransphobic‚Äù for upholding their right to their own sexuality. The oppressive institution of prostitution and surrogacy is contractually negotiated in western societies or simply being accepted as a right to buy and rent impoverished and desperate women. The language for female anatomy and reproduction is being erased and we are told to call our vaginas ‚Äúfront holes‚Äù in order to appease the men who are confused about their own identity. 		
	
Gender is a term invented in the 60's and at first functioned in a liberating way to strip the categories of 'man' and 'woman' from the stereotypes that had haunted and oppressed them for centuries. Men and women could start describing their experiences as individual human beings and make distinctions between their behaviours, personalities and expressions and dispel them from their sex categories of men and women. This lead to the following generations being able to enjoy being men and women without the prescriptive category of gender stereotypes holding them down to the extent that it did in the past. These stereotypes still persist, largely through the spoils of capitalism (not to discredit its benefits) which projects the plethora of images of gender (stereotypes) all over our revolutionary technology: media, film, radio, advertising, pornography etc. 	

Men and women are highly educated in our advanced society but perhaps more confused than ever in a delusional quest to adhere to the mere stereotypes that the previous generation fought so hard to dismantle for the good of everyone. We have an epidemic of miserable men and miserable women trying to cope in a world where money means value and technology replaces human resources, and the recent adoption of 'gender identity' is in direct conflict with the much needed and separate, protected categories of transsexual, homosexual and sex classes: man and woman. People should not have to concede the language they use to describe their experiences at anyone's demand, which is exactly what is happening with this recent adoption of gender identity as something more than nonsensical stereotypes of masculinity and femininity that oppressed us for so long.		
						
These are the concerns of many transsexuals, lesbians, women and feminists who nobody is listening to. You will find us under terms such as ‚Äúgendercritical‚Äù, and the sexist slur ‚ÄúTERF‚Äù we have been ascribed by transgender activists who attempt to hack our social media accounts and create misogynistic caricatures of the women‚Äôs liberation movement. This sexism is largely promoted by an ideology that demands women include men into their distinct sex category as we are told to accept their parody of womanhood and erase the human female existence through manipulative and coercive language and legal games in attempt to alleviate their discomfort with masculinity. I am part of a growing number of silenced feminists who are arguing for the rights of girls and women to have sex-segregated spaces such as toilets, sex-segregated sports, and freedom to organize and engage in discourse without harassment and violence based on our biological reality as girls and women. 

I've never been aware of how much creative I am. Or I never gave too much credit to it. When I was little I liked playing by myself with dinosaurs toys and creating stories. And actually acting them out.

Once (I was seven) I was playing soccer at a sport club (oops lack of English grammar showing up here sorry for that) I stopped chasing the ball and went in the opposite direction, running like a raptor. That's WEIRD AF. Lmao. That was also funny as hell 

I liked playing with words at a young age, and also reasonably often get lost in thoughts. I was already higher than average in Openess to experience for sure. 

However I've never been aware of it up until today, and until I hit 19 years old so last year (or at least between the span time of 12 to 19yrs old), I've always considered myself as a low creative person. I've put aside my creativity, and this info is much more alarming, partly because I've tons of problems in the past with attention seeking behavior during my teens. So I'm currently breaking out of self deception that have been put to the surface THANKS to an ego death (or psychedelics experience).

I'm probably way higher than what I thought in Openess.

Also I'm biased beyond belief today when it comes to take a personality test with accuracy, since I haven't been acting my true personality since childhood, I don't really know how to assess myself now. 

I've been low and high in nearly all the traits (compassion and orderliness excepted), so yes I'm the living evidence that personality is not set in stone lol. But I'm dealing with more important stuff now (like why I had so poor self confidence and having set aside my creativity, exploring the past and killing the self deception I'm in), so ultimately here is my question :

How to assess myself accurately on Big Five now ? And if I'm creative, what portion of time should I give to this creativity ? 

Thanks for answers !!I'll lay out here what Peterson said in his recent video on Free speech : 

"Its really hard to think, you have to be trained like mad to think. You have to be able to divide yourself internally into a couple of different people, and then you have to let those people have a war in your head ! 

And that means you have to develop characters, who have opinions, in great detail, opinions that might be contrary to your own,  and then you have to withstand the tension of let them have it out"

https://youtu.be/EuNeqawPuuY 

22:34 

Man, I tried this once, and I failed like crap. I got myself into depersonalization because I detach myself from me.. Without actually letting anything out, so that was pointless and probably innacurate in the way I did it lmao. 

Who is working on thinking ? Or maybe some of you are already capable of doing it. There are some really well thought-out buckos out here, that wouldn't be a surprised to me.
JP's teachings give comfort for those who tend to be smarter, more successful and more aware of today's world, while it annoys those who are too indoctrinated, too deep into their own narratives, etc.

‚Äã

The cold truth is that there is simply no hope, no redemption, no 'rescue', no 'reset' for today's non-smart, non-rich and non-elites.

‚Äã

It is not their fault that they end up like that, just like the dodo and passenger pigeon getting extinct is not their fault.

‚Äã

The environment changed. That's all.

‚Äã

Today's environment vastly favors the rich, and a few not-rich-now-but-smart-enough-to-get-rich-before-it-is-too-late people. And that's it.

‚Äã

Labor is dead; all we need is capital since labor can be automated. I have posted a link which says 50-70% of all humanity is deadweight, although I personally think it is closer to 85% now and will increase as tech makes more and more jobs obsolete.

‚Äã

The complete financialization of the economy means no more cycle of boom and bust, and no more chance for the ordinary people to at least carve up a niche for themselves. Unless one is really talented, all they have to look for is a lifetime of gig jobs, penury, insecurity, unable to raise a family because of the impermanence of their lives (very few migrant laborers left descendants, and if they left any the death rate of foundling's homes were about 80% - they were kept that way precisely to avoid people dumping their children ! - Social darwinism was the law before 1945).

‚Äã

Most people will end up like Boxer in Animal Farm, because the supply of phosphate is running out and the tale, which might be apocryphal, of Napoleonic battlefield bones harvested to make fertilizers will be true. But, today's elites, like Napoleon in Animal Farm who succeeded becoming humans, will reach Singularity/Type I Civilization earth and conquer the space, while the rest of humanity perish in the worst misery the smartest brains can think about.

‚Äã

We have to justify it. The tradeoff of 7 billion plus people and a space-faring civilization which will expand forever is not hard; no one will remember the 7 billion plus, while space conquest will be eternal.

‚Äã

We need a philosophical justification for the future technofeudal, strictly social darwinist and expansionist civilization. The Spanish padres provided such theory to the Conquistadores, who killed the natives after they save their souls. It might be cruel but in a utilitarian way it was justified, since it led to the economic explosion of Europe which made the scientific revolution, etc possible.

‚Äã

It is also necessary for the people to accept the cold fact that they are mostly doomed. The stupid aspiration of Serbia, which has failed to contribute anything to human civilization (again, I must tell you that Nikola Tesla, the sole contribution Serbia made to humanity, NEVER entered the boundaries of Serbia in his entire life) doomed Europe , killed the best of Western Civilization, and led to the pop explosion in the colonies - which became countries - not likely to add anything to our Civilization. Such acceptance will keep resistance and subversion to a minimum, although if necessary forces might have to be used.

&amp;#x200B;

JP might not approve these ideas - after all he is a professor and he can't say these things. But , he is not the last word on everything - we have to expand from there.Or at least, I believe I'm assuming that I already know everything within me. Which is certainly not true. You age if you think you already know everything

Since I had an ego death I've been pierced by all of this new information, this wisdom. Maybe I'm just overthinking. But I want to make sure that I don't became arrogant. 

So how do you tell you're being arrogant or/and you close your mind to new knowledge ? How do you prevent against that if it was to happen ?

Thank you very much. Much appreciatedThe Billboard Hot 100 had been conquered by a Japanese a long time ago, but it was pre-Beatles and could be dismissed as Coriolan's sack of Rome, which made a Shakespeare play and a Beethoven composition, but was of very little historical consequence.

‚Äã

Black DJ's blocked Psy's invasion of Billboard Hot 100 back in 2012, like Stillicho's Vandals blocking Alaric's Goths from destroying Rome. However, the invasion of BTS appears to be more sustained, better financed and have more support.

‚Äã

BTS topped the 200 best selling albums chart , the first album sung in Asian language to do so.

‚Äã

[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8458997/bts-selena-non-english-no-1-albums-on-billboard-200-chart](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8458997/bts-selena-non-english-no-1-albums-on-billboard-200-chart)

‚Äã

The Singing Nun did it with French, Selena (US citizen) did it with Spanish after her death, and a few crossover acts did it, with a few European languages. However, BTS's conquest of Billboard 200 was done with an Asian language,. a huge invasion of Western Culture from an Non-Western one.

‚Äã

Jawaharlal Nehru wrote "Glimpses of World History" in 1934 for his only child Indira. In there, he said history is full of struggle of East and West (although Indira's descendants became Western for all practical purposes).

‚Äã

In my opinion, this is a huge victory of non-Western culture over Western culture. Granted, all the 'black' music can be called as non-Western but at least they grew up under Western fold. BTS is not Western in any kind of shape.

‚Äã

BTS will hold a concert at Citi Field in October. For me, it might be like the fall of Chalcedon/Scutari (now called Uskudar, remembered by Americans as a silly song)  The Turks took that town, directly opposite Constantinople, on 1338 and that was the beginning of End of Byzantium.

‚Äã

The very fact that BTS's invasion of American Pop is not even being resisted might be telling everything we might have to know about the state of Western Pop culture now, and showing the lack of resiliency  of the West - it might be too tired to fight off an invasion from, out of all countries, Korea.My hatred of Srinivasa Ramanujan, who spent his time in Cambridge and became a member of the Royal Society while the real students were getting slaughtered wantonly, is infinite.

‚Äã

Ramanujan is famous for asking vegetarian food while England was under rationing. In other words, he thoroughly failed to understand that

‚Äã

1. England was in war and he had no business to be in there to begin with
2. People didn't have enough to eat
3. There was not enough resources to support his dietary habit
4. He failed to do with whatever stuff he could have obtained which could be called vegetarian, and expected the hard-pressed staff, with most young men at Flanders, to accommodate his strange need.

Tl, dr, what he did was equivalent to "Hey, I don't care whether people starve. I need to eat my fucking veggie marsala!" If he really wanted to eat that, he could have returned to India and eat as much veggie curry as he fucking felt like. He showed how a spoiled brat he was by doing that.

‚Äã

\---

‚Äã

Some highly able people have strange habits and other idiosyncrasies. People who have these traits but became well known at least could withhold some of their own preferences for some time in order to carve a place for themselves.

‚Äã

IN the old days, people like Vincent van Gogh, who was clearly not fit to survive in the real world, Still there were enough slack to accommodate these types. Right now, not much. We don't see any eccentric geniuses; that kind of function is now well served by black hipsters and people like Donald Trump.  All the 'geniuses' are now standardized, and are in a selected circle where they basically know each other.

‚Äã

Movies like Little man Tate and Good Will Hunting show geniuses being buried by people who do not add anything to them. Since these movies were made by the actors themselves, it ends according to what the actor wanted to go. But in countries which value Civilization higher than personal choices, in tate the Jodie Foster character(Tate's mother, who wants her gifted child to be raised with a bunch of rednecks)  would be run over by a truck without a license plate, and Tate would be taken by the state to be educated ; and Good Will Hunting would wake up in some govt facilities, with all contacts to his former pals and his useless 'girlfriend' who destroys his life , lost forever.

‚Äã

In other words, totalitarian countries are quite better than retaining geniuses and highly able people than capitalist country. In these countries, people skilled in tech do not drop, or not allowed to drop out, to pursue interest like making music nobody listens to.

‚Äã

But there are some highly able people who simply cannot fit, like Ramanujan above. He lived 100 years ago - I don't see people who are that hard-to-fit nowdays since they are already screened out before they become important.  At best they end up in youtube, for a tiny audience who stay in their niche.

‚Äã

Also some highly able people think they can be assholes, even though they had not produced anything to justify such attitude.

‚Äã

I think that there is a limit to how much one can go to accommodate highly able people who do not fit in. There would be a point where it is no longer worthwhile to bend to their wishes, no matter how able they might be, since a suitable replacement is not wanting in today's world.Hello everyone. I can't help but be obsessed with remaining a close connection to myself since I first had an ego death.

I'm aware of my psyche within me (my actual psyche,) and things happens with it.  

I shall tell you how it all started. A month and a half from now, I think I managed to articulate the person I wanted to be, and through hard work and journey into the underworld I finally managed to do so. (I guess the person I was aiming to articulate and bring to reality was the Self, behind the ego.) 
So I was glad I managed to finally became the person I wanted to be, and from there, I could get through life and keep going. But then, a
short time after I achieved that goal of mine I started to slowly loose the connection or the incarnation of it, and I have an idea for why :

- I relaxed and told myself that I've done it,(consciously)

 and so I have nothing else to do so I probably just stopped being this person from here. (Unconsciously happened)

Or in a way I told myself that I can't remain this person for a reason or another.



How do I counter this ? I'm going full backwards today. 

The underlying problem might be, as always in life, 'how do I reach my goal without being so afraid I can't reach it anymore.' ? 

And how do I stop being obssessive with progress I already achieved and prevent going backwards ?

Thanks for answering a bunch of such a weird and special questions 

but it's jordan P. Beterson.So I started rereading the Odyssey. I first picked it up 11 years ago in 5th grade and it was gripping to say the least. In retrospect, finding the classics was the moment in my life that I can point to and say "That's what made me who I am." 

Anyways, I found JP almost a year ago and I really enjoy his ideas and take on the Biblical stories. However, I feel like he is, either willingly or accidentally, omitting hundreds of years of Western wisdom by ignoring the the rich tapestry of European mythologies we've inherited. It's obvious to anyone who has studied early Christian history that the predominant force that shaped the expression of that religion were the stories and philosophies of the Greeks and Romans. 

It's easy to forget that Christianity was nothing more than an offshoot of Judaism in its early days. Only after the stories of Christ entered the zeitgeist of the West through Greco-Roman authors did the movement begin to differentiate itself from Judaism. By that point, it had become so infused with the philosophies of its host that they became incapable of differentiation. 

What prompted me to make this post was an error on JP's part in an interview I found on YT. He claimed an etymological link between "genie" and "genius." "Genius" comes from a Latin word spelled the exact same way and was understood as the spirit/essence of individuals and phenomena. Essentially, the genius was the element that made a thing what it was rather than something it was not and in some ways is linked to fertility or familial power embodied by the pater familias. 

Has anyone else noticed a Judeo-Christian centrism to JP's videos? 

If you have, why do you think this is so? 

Is he missing a necessary and beneficial part of the Western spirit by focusing on the mythology of an imported, Eastern religion? This could be a really good thread for bibliophiles. It'd be great to get a reading list going with short takeaways from each text. Please contribute and thanks guys!

*The Age of Reason* by Thomas Paine really influenced my conception of god and my understanding of the relationship between science and religion. 

*Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius along with several books on the Buddha like the *Dhammapada* have helped shape my morals. 

*The Odyssey* by Homer gave me my first heroic archetype. 

*The Power of Myth* by Joseph Campbell was the first thing I came across that showed me how religious texts can have a deeper meaning if meditated on as allegory. This book also helped shape my first critique of modern society. 

*Democracy in America* by Alexis de Tocqueville has really shaped my politics and my critiques of modern America. Some parts of it read like prophecy. It's gripping. 

*For the New Intellectual* by Ayn Rand. This is the only Ayn Rand book I've read and I really only enjoyed the first essay. Like de Tocqueville, this text reads like prophecy. Rand really understood the intellectual crisis that I find myself embroiled in. 

*Human All Too Human*, *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* and *The Anti-Christ* by Nietzsche have all contributed greatly to my views of society, the problems the West faces and fostering my individualism.

*The Poison of Subjectivism* by C.S. Lewis is a masterpiece. Aside from his Narnia series, I haven't read much of his work, but I found this essay a few days ago and am ready for more. 

*The Undiscovered Self* by Jung. I'm nearly finished with it. He makes some interesting critiques of socialism, collectivist ideologies and academia. This is my first Jung book. Most of what I know about his ideas are second hand from textbooks and academics like JP. What quasi religious practices do you do?

Are they holdovers from a religious childhood? 

What benefits do you get from engaging in them? 

I was raised a Christian but started doubting and subsequently leaving Christianity around age 10. After that, I dove head first into mythology, philosophy and non-Christian religions. 

Now I'm 22, don't attend church, don't read the Bible, occasionally pray and meditate a couple times a week. It may not seem like a spiritual exercise but I set aside time each week to pursue something artistic (writing, painting, music). The sort of feelings these activities produce are similar to prayer and meditation imo. 

Prayer is definitely a holdover from my childhood even though they're no longer directed toward Jehovah or Jesus. There's something comforting and calming about praying that I enjoy. Like meditation, it helps me to silence all the background noise so I can focus on reality of a situation. I have zero desire to participate in any organized religion but I do miss the sort of familial like community churches foster. If sermons were more about allegory and faith was left to the individual, I would definitely become a churchgoer again.

What about you guys? Modern art was CIA 'weapon'
Revealed: how the spy agency used unwitting artists such as Pollock and de Kooning in a cultural Cold War

By Frances Stonor Saunders Saturday 21 October 1995 23:02 BST

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html

For decades in art circles it was either a rumour or a joke, but now it is confirmed as a fact. The Central Intelligence Agency used American modern art - including the works of such artists as Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko - as a weapon in the Cold War. In the manner of a Renaissance prince - except that it acted secretly - the CIA fostered and promoted American Abstract Expressionist painting around the world for more than 20 years.

The connection is improbable. This was a period, in the 1950s and 1960s, when the great majority of Americans disliked or even despised modern art - President Truman summed up the popular view when he said: "If that's art, then I'm a Hottentot." As for the artists themselves, many were ex- communists barely acceptable in the America of the McCarthyite era, and certainly not the sort of people normally likely to receive US government backing.

Why did the CIA support them? Because in the propaganda war with the Soviet Union, this new artistic movement could be held up as proof of the creativity, the intellectual freedom, and the cultural power of the US. Russian art, strapped into the communist ideological straitjacket, could not compete.

The existence of this policy, rumoured and disputed for many years, has now been confirmed for the first time by former CIA officials. Unknown to the artists, the new American art was secretly promoted under a policy known as the "long leash" - arrangements similar in some ways to the indirect CIA backing of the journal Encounter, edited by Stephen Spender.

The decision to include culture and art in the US Cold War arsenal was taken as soon as the CIA was founded in 1947. Dismayed at the appeal communism still had for many intellectuals and artists in the West, the new agency set up a division, the Propaganda Assets Inventory, which at its peak could influence more than 800 newspapers, magazines and public information organisations. They joked that it was like a Wurlitzer jukebox: when the CIA pushed a button it could hear whatever tune it wanted playing across the world.

The next key step came in 1950, when the International Organisations Division (IOD) was set up under Tom Braden. It was this office which subsidised the animated version of George Orwell's Animal Farm, which sponsored American jazz artists, opera recitals, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's international touring programme. Its agents were placed in the film industry, in publishing houses, even as travel writers for the celebrated Fodor guides. And, we now know, it promoted America's anarchic avant-garde movement, Abstract Expressionism.

Initially, more open attempts were made to support the new American art. In 1947 the State Department organised and paid for a touring international exhibition entitled "Advancing American Art", with the aim of rebutting Soviet suggestions that America was a cultural desert. But the show caused outrage at home, prompting Truman to make his Hottentot remark and one bitter congressman to declare: "I am just a dumb American who pays taxes for this kind of trash." The tour had to be cancelled.

The US government now faced a dilemma. This philistinism, combined with Joseph McCarthy's hysterical denunciations of all that was avant-garde or unorthodox, was deeply embarrassing. It discredited the idea that America was a sophisticated, culturally rich democracy. It also prevented the US government from consolidating the shift in cultural supremacy from Paris to New York since the 1930s. To resolve this dilemma, the CIA was brought in.

The connection is not quite as odd as it might appear. At this time the new agency, staffed mainly by Yale and Harvard graduates, many of whom collected art and wrote novels in their spare time, was a haven of liberalism when compared with a political world dominated by McCarthy or with J Edgar Hoover's FBI. If any official institution was in a position to celebrate the collection of Leninists, Trotskyites and heavy drinkers that made up the New York School, it was the CIA.

Until now there has been no first-hand evidence to prove that this connection was made, but for the first time a former case officer, Donald Jameson, has broken the silence. Yes, he says, the agency saw Abstract Expressionism as an opportunity, and yes, it ran with it.

"Regarding Abstract Expressionism, I'd love to be able to say that the CIA invented it just to see what happens in New York and downtown SoHo tomorrow!" he joked. "But I think that what we did really was to recognise the difference. It was recognised that Abstract Expression- ism was the kind of art that made Socialist Realism look even more stylised and more rigid and confined than it was. And that relationship was exploited in some of the exhibitions.

"In a way our understanding was helped because Moscow in those days was very vicious in its denunciation of any kind of non-conformity to its own very rigid patterns. And so one could quite adequately and accurately reason that anything they criticised that much and that heavy- handedly was worth support one way or another."

To pursue its underground interest in America's lefty avant-garde, the CIA had to be sure its patronage could not be discovered. "Matters of this sort could only have been done at two or three removes," Mr Jameson explained, "so that there wouldn't be any question of having to clear Jackson Pollock, for example, or do anything that would involve these people in the organisation. And it couldn't have been any closer, because most of them were people who had very little respect for the government, in particular, and certainly none for the CIA. If you had to use people who considered themselves one way or another to be closer to Moscow than to Washington, well, so much the better perhaps."

This was the "long leash". The centrepiece of the CIA campaign became the Congress for Cultural Freedom, a vast jamboree of intellectuals, writers, historians, poets, and artists which was set up with CIA funds in 1950 and run by a CIA agent. It was the beach-head from which culture could be defended against the attacks of Moscow and its "fellow travellers" in the West. At its height, it had offices in 35 countries and published more than two dozen magazines, including Encounter.

The Congress for Cultural Freedom also gave the CIA the ideal front to promote its covert interest in Abstract Expressionism. It would be the official sponsor of touring exhibitions; its magazines would provide useful platforms for critics favourable to the new American painting; and no one, the artists included, would be any the wiser.

This organisation put together several exhibitions of Abstract Expressionism during the 1950s. One of the most significant, "The New American Painting", visited every big European city in 1958-59. Other influential shows included "Modern Art in the United States" (1955) and "Masterpieces of the Twentieth Century" (1952).

Because Abstract Expressionism was expensive to move around and exhibit, millionaires and museums were called into play. Pre-eminent among these was Nelson Rockefeller, whose mother had co-founded the Museum of Modern Art in New York. As president of what he called "Mummy's museum", Rockefeller was one of the biggest backers of Abstract Expressionism (which he called "free enterprise painting"). His museum was contracted to the Congress for Cultural Freedom to organise and curate most of its important art shows.

The museum was also linked to the CIA by several other bridges. William Paley, the president of CBS broadcasting and a founding father of the CIA, sat on the members' board of the museum's International Programme. John Hay Whitney, who had served in the agency's wartime predecessor, the OSS, was its chairman. And Tom Braden, first chief of the CIA's International Organisations Division, was executive secretary of the museum in 1949.

Now in his eighties, Mr Braden lives in Woodbridge, Virginia, in a house packed with Abstract Expressionist works and guarded by enormous Alsatians. He explained the purpose of the IOD.

"We wanted to unite all the people who were writers, who were musicians, who were artists, to demonstrate that the West and the United States was devoted to freedom of expression and to intellectual achievement, without any rigid barriers as to what you must write, and what you must say, and what you must do, and what you must paint, which was what was going on in the Soviet Union. I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War."

He confirmed that his division had acted secretly because of the public hostility to the avant-garde: "It was very difficult to get Congress to go along with some of the things we wanted to do - send art abroad, send symphonies abroad, publish magazines abroad. That's one of the reasons it had to be done covertly. It had to be a secret. In order to encourage openness we had to be secret."

If this meant playing pope to this century's Michelangelos, well, all the better: "It takes a pope or somebody with a lot of money to recognise art and to support it," Mr Braden said. "And after many centuries people say, 'Oh look! the Sistine Chapel, the most beautiful creation on Earth!' It's a problem that civilisation has faced ever since the first artist and the first millionaire or pope who supported him. And yet if it hadn't been for the multi-millionaires or the popes, we wouldn't have had the art."

Would Abstract Expressionism have been the dominant art movement of the post-war years without this patronage? The answer is probably yes. Equally, it would be wrong to suggest that when you look at an Abstract Expressionist painting you are being duped by the CIA.

But look where this art ended up: in the marble halls of banks, in airports, in city halls, boardrooms and great galleries. For the Cold Warriors who promoted them, these paintings were a logo, a signature for their culture and system which they wanted to display everywhere that counted. They succeeded.



**Covert Operation**

In 1958 the touring exhibition "The New American Painting", including works by Pollock, de Kooning, Motherwell and others, was on show in Paris. The Tate Gallery was keen to have it next, but could not afford to bring it over. Late in the day, an American millionaire and art lover, Julius Fleischmann, stepped in with the cash and the show was brought to London.

The money that Fleischmann provided, however, was not his but the CIA's. It came through a body called the Farfield Foundation, of which Fleischmann was president, but far from being a millionaire's charitable arm, the foundation was a secret conduit for CIA funds.

So, unknown to the Tate, the public or the artists, the exhibition was transferred to London at American taxpayers' expense to serve subtle Cold War propaganda purposes. A former CIA man, Tom Braden, described how such conduits as the Farfield Foundation were set up. "We would go to somebody in New York who was a well-known rich person and we would say, 'We want to set up a foundation.' We would tell him what we were trying to do and pledge him to secrecy, and he would say, 'Of course I'll do it,' and then you would publish a letterhead and his name would be on it and there would be a foundation. It was really a pretty simple device."

Julius Fleischmann was well placed for such a role. He sat on the board of the International Programme of the Museum of Modern Art in New York - as did several powerful figures close to the CIA.

I don't think so.

I initially titled it as 'intelligence' but changed it into 'mental capacity', because there are people like Ted Kacynski who has a high intelligence but thoroughly lacked the capacity to succeed in the cutthroat, inimincal tech civ and resorted to terrorism.

I think that within a generation a massive Social Darwinistic culling will occur, mostly without any shots being fired. The less capable people simply being bred out of existence.

Whether people like or not, most of the future will belong to the whites (including Ashkenazim), because they have more people with higher mental capacity.

The supposed higher IQs of Asians is a different matter, but Asian men will be outcompeted by white men, and Asian genes will mostly exist in female lines only.

I will spare words on the rest.

Tl, dr, it will be a tough arena of survival, and it is likely that no matter what the pop of less mentally capable people might be as of now, it won't be relevant as time goes on and tech complexities simply keep most people out of a well-paying job.Is that possible ? I don't have any credit card and I definitely NEED that book, that's an emergency 
I would say that I'm lost since 4 years now, and I'm yet still 19 yrs old, I don't know how to look at my past, I may have a vague idea of the future I should throw myself into but nothing concrete 

What's really painful in my life currently, so painful that I can't even feel anymore, is that I'm completely aside of who am I. I'm so lost that I cannot even relate to my own past I don't know what I should do, I'm being paranoid, and I feel completely off. 

I'm jealous of other people who seems to live their lives without bothering themselves, I cannot even decide if I should either broke it all and make a fresh restart or keep things this way, I may discovered things about me that I never get an answer about.

Even despite being quite popular in my work environment and everyday life I'm so alone at the same time. I can't do any actual shit that's sound just like random stuff 
I get my exam, okay now WHAT ? Where I go ? Was this the good things ? Should I be asking all those questions ?

There IS SO MUCH to know about me that I find unable to dive into introspection, because I don't have any personal view points or particular value to begin with, nothing to go with. I sound like an empty shell, or a ringer bell who don't get any echo from his action. 

Part of me is already dead in the inside I guess, can't even further anymore. 

Sorry for this long block but if by any chances someome have a double copy with him and doesn't what to do with it, I would be glad to take it 

So let's come back to the original topic, I've got a few questions 

-How can I get this program ?

-Possible translation ? (I'm not English you've might have see)

-Phone credit with another money type (euro‚Ç¨ for example) can do it ? What are the best prices ?

Thank you for all your upcoming answer, I'm being annoying with all of that and I thank you for your support I definitely NEED that book, that's an emergency I would say that I'm lost since 4 years now, and I'm yet still 19 yrs old, I don't know how to look at my past, I may have a vague idea of the future I should throw myself into but nothing concrete

Thank you very much, I know give something expansive away on the internet is doubtful, and I'm not even saying that I would do it too to be honest..
So by this I'm highly grateful to whoever would just give it away from someone else. 
Thanks again ...with present virtues !

First, I want to thanks JordanBPfan for freely giving me the program, and I'll pay you back for that. 

Now I'm into the first epoch and I'm writing words about my virtues, that's really exhausting but definitely worthy, that's fun at the same time. 
Do you think a rest might be need between each step ? I focus a maximum but at the same time being that much into it won't kill the effectiveness ?On a couple occasions J.P has been retweeting/responding to tweets regarding nutrition.

&gt;High carb, low fat diets: Perhaps the worst public policy advice ever. Unbelievable.
https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/919385064051494912

Citing study 10.1016/j.cmet.2017.09.011 which is, I guess, a review of the PURE study.

The truth is that macro-nutrient composition isn't that relevant, but the quality of the foods which make them up. The PURE study did not make a differentiation between unprocessed and processed carbohydrates.

&gt;**did not analyze which
specific source of carbohydrates (e.g.,
sugar/refined carbs versus whole-grain
products) may contribute to the detri-
mental  effects  of  carbs  observed**,
especially since income and wealth do
impact the quality of dietary choices
significantly.  This  criticism,  however,
misses the fact that a (not immediately
accessible) re-analysis additionally ad-
justing  for  household  income  and
wealth, as well as for socioeconomic sta-
tus of the respective country, did not
affect  the  key  observations  of  the
study by any means (appendix, p. 34 of
Dehghan et al., 2017
)

Paragraph above is cited from the study, which addresses this criticism with a re-analysis of income, wealth and socioeconomic status. It's refined vs unrefined which is what is relevant here.

Jordan B. Peterson is criticizing public policy, if it includes refined carbohydrates, then that's a bad thing, since it'll mostly impact the dietary selection of companies, schools, hospitals, etc which adhere to it. A high-fat, low-carbs diet can be bad if it includes diary products like butter, that has naturally occurring trans fats which cause heart disease, and processed meats like bacon, ham, sausage, which cause cancer in the colon. So the differentiation between unprocessed and processed foods apply here as well. We're going lost with this nonsense.That's complicated to me, I'm into Present fault and I've realized that my flaws are not really based on reality but how I feel about it.

"Lose opportunities because I am too isolated" is someting I'm currently deeply feeling, however that's not the impression of my surronding people because they call me out like a social butterfly

So I'm feeling like this but the reality may oppose it, I'm always craving more and more of that and actually never satisfied (either because I couldn't reach a point of satisfaction or because I ACTUALLY never really managed to do so.)

How the hell am I supposed to answer that ? That's hard damnThe effectivness of the program is probably measure by the time/effort ratio putting in, after only three stage written and  completed (I'm currently in present fault, you know one stage means one fault) I'm tiring out, and I've still got 8 to complete (I've orginally choosed 19 trait), should I rest ? Don't want it to take too long thoSo there's this meme going around that male feminists are just roundabout rapists, or guilty sinners, or whatever term they use.

And it's undoubtedly true, it's too common an occurrence. So it got me thinking as to why.  
Most people say it's denial, or projection. A very shorthand pop-psychology label. Not that I'm above pop-psychology, but I wanted to understand the thought process from da capo.

I don't have any idea where the thought came from, it's like it blindsided me. But I thought, "Who would be most likely to believe that all men are rapists, but a rapist?"  
Say you're a rapist, say you have fantasies of rape. *You know what you are.* You're the lowest of the low, aren't you? But someone comes along and says, "No, everyone else is just like you. You can be better than everyone else, by accepting the guilt and becoming an ally."

Then the story isn't, "I'm a monster and I can't accept that." It's, "Not only am I not alone, but everyone else is a monster and I'm the only one that's accepted it."

Tell me if this is a trite realisation, or if you've got much to add. I've been noticing lately that, thoughts come out of nowhere in my head. Like air filling a void. This is just a shower thought that evolved into armchair philosophy. For instance I saw a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQtwOoF9Egs) where Jordan mentions the ancient Greeks located their sense of self at the heart while a lot of modern day people locate themselves primarily in their head. He mentions a theory for this is that we've become more physiologically intellectual as time goes on.
  
I find this sort of thing fascinating and I think it'd be cool to learn about these kinds of topics on my own or from seperate sources.  
  
Do you have a favorite book examining the human condition from different time periods?So I know this thread isn't supposed to be a chatroom or what but I'm stuck and since I don't know where to post this 

So 2 weeks ago I was supposed to go with a lot of friends to a local dance, and I didn't. 
Nothing wrong with it you must think
And yet, I'm so ashamed.. 

To sum things up I was talking about this party since month to my friends, and it was supposed to be a rendezvous point to FINALLY have a party together. 
Because most of my friends are not in the same section as I am, the distance between us has kept growing, and then here we are, after 1 year "together" not a single party to count. We lost so much occasion, and sometimes it was my own fault because I wasn't paying enough attention to their activities, because I believed I would be welcomed no matter when if I wanted to spend more time with them, and then because I didn't intiated enough now we're distant AF. 

Plus, personal problems got in the way, I told them about it but it doesn't excuse everything, I've completely fucked this up and I wanted to do those things but I couldn't . 

To come back at the initial topic, that night when I couldn't go at the party, it was because I DIDN'T WANTED TO GO. 
Yes that's unexpected 

I showed up at a pub about 7o'clock and met a couple of aquaitances, and then I left to go at the local dance, and all the way, since the moment I encountered them at the pub NO, since the last week, I was depressed like. I felt awfully vulnerable, and dangerously unstable emotionally. I was seperated betweem the rage and the lust to go at that party and another part of myself holding me back from doing it, I never felt that bad and empty this night 


I didn't showed up because too much negative emotions, later on I freaked out screamed and blame myself all the night, I go on shouting out of rage while I was watching the party house from far away 

And I've initially payed to have a place. 

Earlier just before going out at the door of my house I swore myself that all the shit that I've been accumulated that far would be forgot just for this night 
And I screwed up 

Now it's been two weeks that I haven't seen or talk to any of my friends (and almost anybody else, I'm half-depressed and even tho I'm an extrovert I don't want to see anyone right now), I've turned bipolar because I think that I ignored my own needs for too long, LIKE SHIT I was living aside me or what ? What did I did wrong ? 
I'm currently looking for this answer by doing Peterson's program, however it's still to recent to be dealt properly with 


So what should I do ? What should I tell them ? I'm so ashamed and feel so unreliable right now that I'm afraid they will think that I'm just paying their head off and lose them for good and not being able to do anything with them again 

I could showed up like nothing happened but that would be sooo fake but at the same time so easy to do.. That's definitely not the solution, nor for me, nor for them 

Damn I feel too much guilty this time :(When I was kid I was a big head in the cloud, I was not particularly loudy in general (even tho I don't held anything against loudy environment) I was more calm by myself and still outgoing with people. 
Always thinking to something behind shit, all goes to introversion. At the opposite side my brother was what you expected from an extrovert, always out doing something 

Then from the age of 12 I've been kind of the clown class and became quite more extrovert in my behavior, I did still enjoyed my time by myself and I was not particularly drained from social interaction 

And then from the age of 15, I became to behave in an even more extrovert way to draw attention towards me because I genuinely love people and love being able to make them have fun, I was pretty much of an attention whore outside and I enjoyed it (so much that most of my classmates after a while started to ignored me because I was too much on making people laugh by anyway even by saying not funny things)
Then I introspect and I cooled down myself. 

Same shit at the age of 16, even more an attention seeker and yet my time alone didn't bother me that much (Saturday-Sunday I was at home)

Then I hit depression at the age of 17

And from the age of 18 I've always been more comfortable with people than my ownself 
And now I'm here asking why so much swing.Regarding the Ocean Cleanup:

Tearing ourselves into pieces like rabid dogs is the current incline of this subreddit as of this moment.

So to have better memories of myself I'm revisting old memories by pictures or friends' thoughts on me 

And I've came up to one problem 
My integrity. 
I mean, I'm always feeling (and I've always felt that way) that I'm just better when around people until circumstances separates us, and then I find myself good alone. 
I feel like having extrovert spirit in a lower-form introvert body, or the other way around, but not particularly one or another 

When little I've always been daydreaming when my attention was drawn to something that interested me (like boring school topic for example) and energetic when it comes to people, fucking excitable. 

What the actual hell ?

Parents described me as gentle daydreaming and a bit of introvert to my teachers when little, my teachers mostly described me as a clown or pertubator element through all my scolarship, even sometimes as a manipulator who hides well his play (wtf lmao) because I was so gentle and polite when my parents were around. 

I'm excitable when around people and wanna make the best of it, and then I'm good alone...  But I've lived in extended period of loneliness sometimes when little, I was the independent extrovert or another fake name like that, when under 12yrs old I was by my own for like 5 days when holidays were coming 

And as opposite, (really weird) my old brother was energetic battery of energy when little, solicitating people for company and doing a lot of sport and physical activity 

However he wasn't acting as extrovert as I was around people and appeared shyner most of the time (for example when I was 10 and him 12) 
That was often kind of a shock for my family because when I was around them most of the time I was lazy as fuck and didn't wanted to go out doing rollers and my brother treated me as an unsociable 

However when around people I was the life of the party just wtf, and no as you may think I wasn't trying to fake or anything not even making a second guess thougt just naturally acting in the moment 

Also I've never been shy until the age of 13 until the age of 15 because we moved out in an outside country 

And since now I've never came across a clear explanation for that behavior, extroversion scale has always been described on how we recharge, either by being alone or around people 

I've read some article talking about where WE actually DRAW how ENERGY FROM. Same thing and I'm being stupid lmao or a not so bad concept ? 
I can't tell myself an extrovert because I know that after an extended amount of time around people I can get tired (even Extrovert do and I'm obviously less tired than introvert so maybe I'm wrong) 
And I can't tell myself an introvert because being alone for an extended amount of tine would drain me to insanity 

Ambivert ? But I seemed to be leaning towards introvert side whem little and I heard we just don't change that, adaptation is possible but not brain change 

But shit introvert ? Me ? Really seeking for quiet place and peaceful life ?  No shit lmao 
On a psychological value today I would considered myself as being extrovert, on the "need" thing I may be come closer to the introvert 

Sorry that was long, but can you enlighten me ont that?  I HIGHLY value social integrity since little, and I feel like making pressure to be alone/and to be with people. I can't separate those. And that's not just something I can forget now until I got appropriate answers :/ http://www.noelshack.com/2017-44-3-1509502515-screenshot-2017-11-01-10-44-15.png

I've read it all and that's pretty disturbing. I prefer to get rid of the screenshot because I'm not ready to even go THAT FAR in "self discovery" 
That's not discovery anymore, that's another deepness level 

Some real philosophic shit right here I'm watching JBP's interview with Jocko Willink and it's finally convinced me to use the self authoring program I bought with Patreon during JBP's last &lt;$50 Q&amp;A.  
  
The [post](https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson/posts?tag=Perk) labelled $20 gives me the discount code for 100% off but doesn't work when I enter it into the site.  
  
I think this is because the most accurate option is $20-$34 which turns into $29.90 when I try to check out.  
  
I've tried the other options just in case but to no avail.  

If anyone knows a fix for this I would definitely appreciate it. I was intimidated by the program up until this point but now I'm eager to give it a try and feel like I'm in the right place to do that.Called "free traits" who defines you as a person, that's the "blind zone" of psychology, referring to each individual belief or core value, (part nurture if I understand well, but we can say that nature is origin to nurture) 

Here is an EXCELLENT video about it, Brian Little, a competent psychologist who uses to share thougts with Jordan Peterson :

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8GrviOPdmWc


I mean, that's the first time I heard about SELF-MONITORING. For an High-self monitor, that's the capability to one to adapt himself to any given situation, and on the other hand, a low self monitor is the one who cannot really do so and stay true to himself in differents situations, authenticity at his very best. 

When I come to think of it, that's why my behavior since very little is so much axed on an extrovert way, and yet I can relate to introvert 

It seems that most online users are low monitor based on my simple and objective observations 


I'm so glad to have found that fuck**** piece of information. 

Damn that's one thing I would have want to know since long time now. 
A lot of people waste their lives trying to study the cultures of primitive people, who will contribute nothing to the advancement of civilization.

There are some interesting things to study on these people, but the cultures of these people are not competitive with the Western culture and are dying anyways because these people watch Western lifestyle from TV and want to become like that too (although probably won't).

That aside, there are some major cultures, while borrowing heavily from the Western culture, still try to remain alive.

I think that there is no reason to respect other cultures, and let Western Civilization devour everything.

Already 50% of all web pages are in English (the rest are mostly in Chinese, Japanese and Korean). 

As the world gets closer to Singularity, the first culture which develops Singularity will be the dominant culture once for all and all other cultures will die anyways.

To facilitate the process, I think we should abandon the bullshit that every culture is worth keeping, stop any spending to preserve 'traditional' cultures, and let everyone adapt Western values or - else.[Recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS5sR1WytNQ), JBP has advised people to run away from anyone who uses the word "equity."  I have been concerned previously about indoctrination in public schools, and there is a banner which says "equity" on the side of our local school alongside other banners.  I have investigated this, and it appears that "equity" is promoted [top-down](http://www.safeschools.info/maec-online-sessions) from the state and even [federal level](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mid-atlantic-equity-consortium-inc-is-awarded-the-us-department-of-educations-equity-assistance-center-grant-for-the-mid-atlantic-region-133070613.html) by the US Dept. of Education.


So, should I freak out and prevent my kids from going to public school?  Homeschooling could be worse, and religious schooling could give them a structure of religion which could easily be blown apart by Sam Harris types, leading to the nihilism I was lost in throughout my twenties.


What do you think?  Is it viable to send them to public school and try to guerrilla-teach them on the side that this postmodern jibba jabba is hogwash?  I'm up against some strong left-leaning sensibilities in my extended family and somewhat strong skepticism toward my newfound fear of pomo, etc.  


Is this cause for extreme alarm?  Should JBP's warning be taken literally, to its fullest logical extent?Until quite recently, people had to watch out for other people's opinion, and unless you were Michael Jordan or Floyd Mayweather, one could not get away being an asshole.

But, tech advances has eliminated the need to pretend to have empathy. Smart assholes who can earn income independently without having to suffer idiots can now become an asshole and still do great.

Empathy was some kind of development , so the group would be helping the weak and could work as a whole at times of adversity.

However, it is incompatible with the reality we have now, when technology is being developed by a few very high functioning autistics/aspies, who care about very little other than themselves and maybe their very tiny cohorts.

For the first time in history, John Donne's argument that no man is an island is false. One man can be an island and can still be rich and comfortable. 

As HBD becomes more mainstream, the view that the poor and the unfortunate are that way because they are , well, born inferior will be the main worldview again. It was the main worldview of people who did matter until about 1945, when the cold war (a topic by itself) suddenly created the 'need' to work with the less developed people around the world.

The future belongs to smart, suave assholes who do not give a shit to those inferior to them, lack any kind of empathy and will generally not suffer those who are below them. Whether you like it or not, it doesn't matter too much, since it is the way the world is going  - just another chapter of evolution.https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/7d6z1f/til_a_father_of_five_worked_23_years_as_a/

I do not find such stories heartwarming.

First of all, the father overused his leverage as a janitor to put all 5 kids to Boston College, which is no dummy school. However, if that college had a screener who had half a brain, after the first kid the application would quietly be put into the shredder, and the screener would have saved the college $560,000.

Second, since the surname is unusual, fashionable and beautiful people now know never to treat someone with the last name of Vautour as a real BC grad, but as a lower class person. Sorry, that is a fact of life; people who do matter do not want to spend all the money to deal with a janitor's child.

Social Class is real, and in fact it is more important than intelligence in real life, as George W Bush and his offsprings have proved. They know how the social game is played, while the Vautours will never learn that.

The really important people of the world know whom to exclude from their lives, no matter how fancy the university titles might be. If one is not one of 'them', one is not part of it.

I find it pathetic for a lower class person, and the myriads of Asian parents, who think their smarter kid will go to a fancy univ and raise their social status. Like Julian Sorel , Gatsby and many others found out, there is a Wall which will keep them in their dungeon, and it is needed to keep society stable. If you want a country where the higher-IQ people replaced the higher-class people you only have to look no further than Russia, which will never enter the post-scarcity age.&gt;... the 2011 review "[The role of testosterone in social interaction](https://www.gwern.net/docs/nootropics/2011-eisenegger.pdf)" ([excerpts](http://lesswrong.com/lw/84i/social_status_testosterone/)) gives me the impression that testosterone does indeed play into risk-taking, motivation, and social status-seeking; some useful links and a representative anecdote:
...

&gt;"... Ruthless self-interested goal seeking involves actually bothering to pay attention to social politics. People like people who do social politics well. Most particularly it prevents acting on contempt which is what Wedrifid finds prompts the most hostility and resentment in others. Point is, what is a sanity promoting change in one person may not be in another."

&gt;As it happens, these are areas I am distinctly lacking in. When I first began reading about testosterone I had no particular reason to think it might be an issue for me, but it increasingly sounded plausible, an aunt independently suggested I might be deficient, a biological uncle turned out to be severely deficient with levels around 90 ng/dl (where the normal range for 20-49yo males is 249-839), and finally my blood test in August 2013 revealed that my actual level was 305 ng/dl; inasmuch as I was 25 and not 49, this is a tad low.

&gt;One idea I‚Äôve been musing about is the connections between IQ, Conscientiousness, and testosterone. IQ and Conscientiousness do not correlate to a remarkable degree - even though one would expect IQ to at least somewhat enable a long-term perspective, self-discipline, metacognition, etc! There are indications in studies of gifted youth that they have lower testosterone levels. The studies I‚Äôve read on testosterone indicate no improvements to raw ability. So, could there be a self-sabotaging aspect to human intelligence whereby greater intelligence depends on lack of testosterone, but this same lack also holds back Conscientiousness (despite one‚Äôs expectation that intelligence would produce greater self-discipline and planning), undermining the utility of greater intelligence? Could cases of high IQ types who suddenly stop slacking and accomplish great things sometimes be due to changes in testosterone? Studies on the correlations between IQ, testosterone, Conscientiousness, and various measures of accomplishment are confusing and don‚Äôt always support this theory, but it‚Äôs an idea to keep in mind.

&gt;One might suggest just going to the gym or doing other activities which may increase endogenous testosterone secretion. This would be unsatisfying to me as it introduces confounds: the exercise may be doing all the work in any observed effect, and certainly can‚Äôt be blinded. And blinding is especially important because the 2011 review discusses how some studies report that the famed influence of testosterone on aggression (eg. Wedrifid‚Äôs anecdote above) is a placebo effect caused by the "folk wisdom" that testosterone causes aggression &amp; rage! ...

/u/gwern | [gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#testosterone)Has anyone watched the Cartoon Network short *Over the Garden Wall*?

I understand it as a story whose main theme is an exploration of nihilism.[Last man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_man)

The Last man, or the Last race (German: Letzter Mensch), is a term used by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in Thus Spoke Zarathustra to describe the antithesis of his imagined superior being, the √úbermensch, whose imminent appearance is heralded by Zarathustra. The last men are tired of life, take no risks, and seek only comfort and security.

The last man's primary appearance is in "Zarathustra's Prologue." According to Nietzsche, the last man is the goal that modern society and Western civilization have apparently set for themselves. After having unsuccessfully attempted to get the populace to accept the √úbermensch as the goal of society, Zarathustra confronts them with a goal so disgusting that he assumes that it will revolt them.[1] Zarathustra fails in this attempt, and instead of repelling and manipulating the populace into pursuing the goal of the √úbermensch, the populace take Zarathustra literally and choose the "disgusting" goal of becoming the last men. This decision made leaves Zarathustra disheartened and disappointed.

The lives of the last men are pacifist and comfortable. There is no longer a distinction between ruler and ruled, strong over weak or supreme over the mediocre. Social conflict and challenges are minimized. Every individual lives equally and in "superficial" harmony. There are no original or flourishing social trends and ideas. Individuality and creativity are suppressed.

Nietzsche warned that the society of the last man could be too barren and decadent to support the growth of healthy human life or great individuals. The last man is only possible by mankind having bred an apathetic person or ethnic group who are unable to dream, who are unwilling to take risks, and simply earn their living and keep warm. The society of the last man is antithetical to Nietzsche's theoretical will to power, the main driving force and ambition behind human nature, according to Nietzsche, as well as all other life in the universe.

The last man, Nietzsche predicted, would be one response to the problem of nihilism. But the full implications of the death of God had yet to unfold: "The event itself is far too great, too distant, too remote from the multitude's capacity for comprehension even for the tidings of it to be thought of as having arrived as yet."[2]Right now, more intelligent people are being restricted by a lot of laws, regulations and other inconvenient stuff which had been legislated when the People had some power.

In "The Great Reckoning", william Rees-Mogg argued that it was because of megalopolitics; when the people had guns, the elites had to listen to them.

But, now tech is developing in a way to make guns, and most people, irrelevant. 

Dostoevsky, himself from a lower class, wrote a bunch of books when Russian nobles could get away with virtually anything. (For example, Count Lev Tolstoy regularly raped his serf girls as a pastime, but was not punished at all. He also had nothing to do with the lower class Dostoevsky at all, despite of them living at a same time and had a lot of mutual friends.)

Dostoevsky pondered the question about whether people of ability could do anything they felt like in his books, but died before he could find the answer for that question.

Now, after a Revolution and its demise, Russia became a free-for-everyone environment, which did improve things a lot but unfortunately Putin ended such opportunities and only allowed himself and his cronies to have all the fun.

====
Freeing higher able people from actions of their consequences can significantly boast Civilization, although their victims won't like that too much. It is called collateral damage.

Already the elites are somewhat immune from the consequences of their actions, but the costs to do so are rather high.

We need a pro-Civilization policy in order to reach our next level of existence, which is the goal everyone should have. An existence which could conquer the space and beyond.

To be able to do so, I think that the more intelligent people should be immune from consequences, and the 'pygmies' should not be allowed to attack them for trivial things like libels , insensitive remarks, or other abuses they might inflict.

Some kind of line should be drawn for the borderline cases, like people with an IQ of 130-145 who would be given some privileges, but not extreme ones like the ability to shoot a unruly student in a class.&gt;[Addendum (from Comments): ‚ÄúI have heard Canadian Psychologist Jordan Peterson making the same point as you do in your last paragraph re social constructivism and cultural marxism. What makes you think that this is done with the intent of bringing down the US, rather than their purported motive of compassion for marginalised groups?‚Äù

&gt;In Marxism, ‚Äúthe end justifies the means‚Äù is axiomatic. Marxists are allowed and in fact encouraged to lie - it‚Äôs explicit in their playbook. For a Marxist / communist, literally anything is justified to bring about the Dictatorship of the Proletariat ‚Ä¶ i.e., the dictatorship of Marxist activists and ideologues. (Yes, right-wingers lie too, but at least some of them actually feel guilty about it.)

&gt;Marxist strategists long ago announced their intention to subvert and control America by mass deception and the systematic infiltration of its power structure, including academia and the mass media. And what do we now see? Extreme leftward bias in the corporate media, monopolization of intellectual commerce and high-level employment by leftist indoctrination mills / credentials factories like Harvard, politicians openly funded and controlled by Marxist organizations and front groups, Marxist platitudes and policies coming out of their mouths and pens and legislative deliberations in great profusion, and the openly hostile presence of certain problematical ‚Äúmarginalized‚Äù groups which did not arise in the US, but are being imported by the millions with full governmental knowledge of their unassimilability and the danger they pose to American unity and security.

&gt;This unmistakably implies the presence of enemies within, and our ‚Äúfriends‚Äù the Marxists are looking very good for it ‚Ä¶ certainly better than anyone else. It remains only to note that as always, the Marxists are secretly in bed with the wealth-and-power elite, as we see by the fact that corrupt corporate fascists like George Soros are funding domestic socialist groups, paying rabblerousers and demonstrators to riot, and generally fueling unrest with no resistance or explicit disapproval by the government. The ultimate goal has become obvious: a 2-tier neofeudal society with corporate fascism at the top as always, and communism for all the ‚Äúlittle people‚Äù down at the bottom (that way, people won‚Äôt ask why the rich have so much and they so little; they will concentrate on trying to stay alive while jealously watching each other to make sure that their rich masters have no annoying competition from lowly members of the proletariat).

&gt;Every time the Marxists take over and rule a nation, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before its citizens are disarmed, relieved of their freedom, and standing in bread lines, where they talk in very low voices lest the wrong word send them to the gulag, reeducation camp, or killing field. Meanwhile, the party elite - and of course, those by whom they are financially leveraged - fatten on the blood of the people, gorging until their wealth, power, and privilege exceed all bounds. This is the way it went in Russia, China, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Cambodia ‚Ä¶ and how it‚Äôs going right here, right now, in the Americas. It‚Äôs a massive, murderous, phenomenally abusive pseudo-utopian scam run by con artists with big ambitions and very little in the way of humanity, and it‚Äôs strictly for dummies.

&gt;If that‚Äôs really what you want, it can only be because you think you‚Äôll be part of the inner circle, the Politburo, the Supreme Soviet. But the problem is, so do you all ‚Ä¶ and at best, only a handful of you will make it. So the question is, how much of your soul will you sell to make the cut? ;)]

https://www.quora.com/Despite-having-an-IQ-of-160-I-did-not-get-into-Harvard-I-even-submitted-proof-of-being-in-Mensa-How-can-I-cope-with-this-and-move-on-with-my-life/answer/Chris-Langan-7I took 23 days to complete a task that measured only 20 hours in total.

Today, the last three hours of the task took me 12+ hours to finish.

Interruptions, momentum disrupted, distractions.

But the first few days were wasted, not because of interruptions, but because I could not sleep on time.  I did not hav a sleep cycle.

Today, I sleep well. I sleep by midnight, and wake up early mornin, have a walk and do a small warm up exercise to get started.

I have set the foundations for a good routine - and maybe that is the biggest victory of the last 27 days. The task taking so long of a time is probably a side effect. Now that the foundaiton is laid maybe things would be faster.

Much to talk about and observe, and I will make these observations later. Would be helpful.

NOW, I have started a timesheet, to record how I spend my time. I will come up with specific goals to waste less time.

Also, I am really laidback at times. I display less urgency. That's the next dragon to slay. Get up, show urgency for the day and tire yourself.Okay so JBP has a point but where are his arguers in this debate? There are beginning to emerge from academia critics of Social Justice who want the excesses to be contained. This is laudable. There needs to be a dynamic balance. But where are JBP's and Janice Fiamengo's antagonists? Seriously, where are they? One might think that those academics deliberately employed to oversee the application of ethics regarding social justice might have posited a counter point to 'some' of Peterson's arguments but there hasn't been anything. Minorities **do** experience prejudice, minorities **do** experience scapegoating, minorities **are** subject to social stigmas and cunts like Lauren Southern can act with impunity when she pokes at psychological wounds that may in some cases have been open for many many years. The search for meaning for many people who don't fit into traditional social roles is an extremely young phenomenon but HEY! these are only people too, they will fuck up and over-extend. That's what it is to be young and pushing boundaries to find the limits of your strengths and abilities. Plainly this search is now extending into the zone established for bullies and bigots to act in and it's hurting them, and they want it to stop.

I say, fuck them.

I don't care what Doc Peterson claims are his motivations, or his denials of being a champion for all sorts of revolting right wing proclivities, he is contributing to the entitlement of bullies and those who want to feel 'normal' at the expense of a stigmatisation of the unconventional. JBP is striving to be representative of moderation, let that moderation embrace the moderation of the left.

So, the 30th Day is here. 

 

How was the day? Well, good enough. I woke up at 5:30, for an appointment, yes. So that is good. 

 

But I spent a lot of time doing nothing, sitting in front of the TV or just doing random stuff because I really had no idea how I was going to spend my time through the day. I just did not have a pressing deadline. And that affected the first half of the day, really badly. 

 

So, time from 8:30 to 14:30 - four hours were spent away just like that, because I did not schedule my time.  VERY badly. 

 

The time wasted till 12:30 had it's roots in the lack of scheduling on this day.  

 

That's the first. 

 

I also waste a considerable amount of time on routines. If I start exercising, it's fine. It is done in time, but it is the time after that which I do not get at scope. I think it is because the time after exercise is not defined. What is the completion of the exercise time? That is an important question. So, if I start exercising, what is the time when I exit that state? 

 

And what am I NOT supposed to do when I have exercised (waste time online after I have gotten out - instead of bathing immediately and getting back to work.)  So, what should take 1 hour ends up being 2 hours because the one hour after it is undefined. 

 

Also heard what my parents had to say about me. They don't trust my work. Ofcourse, because the last 6 months I did nothing but sleep and spend my time away waiting for the day to end. 

 

They were talking to me about the problems that I might face when I go up to work with other organizations, who would just not take me because of my history. And they are right, that is also the other  part of the story that will keep me waiting for long. 

 

In what sense? The thread about my story of how I wasted such a long time is also essential for my survival, so that should be my third focus. 

 

Also, I have no day to day focus. No week to week focus. And no month to month focus. What do we need for that? We kind of sort of have a 2 year idea 

So I think that defines my work for tomorrow: Get started to defining two year focus. Immediately. 

For the first time in my life, I feel like I have a control over my focus: I have some clarity about what I could do tomorrow, the next Month and the year after that. And it makes me feel great about it all. And that gives me clarity to think about what to do tomorrow. 

 

My Trello board is getting better now. Instead of having a dozen cards, I now have dozen to process and a 5-6 to focus on, with three of them top priority. And that means I know what is REALLY important tomorrow. :-) 

 As always, being slow and having a lack of urgency are my weak spots. They are my dragons.

Apart from that, I sat down today and laid out plans for the next two years. It was tough to do, but such an articulation helped me.

I have been following unstructured ambitions since the last 8 years. However, I felt really confident while listing down all major and minor goals.

This meant that everything that I do is contributing towards some or the other goal.

This accomplishes something I have always wanted to do since years: Have three goals for day, week, month and year. I have these things listed out roughly, so I can start improvising and gain a direction.

Need to do past authoring again. Present and Future Authoring remains.

Trello is a god send.https://imgur.com/x4qWtVE

JEEBUS! He wasn't against the bill, he was against the use of Law to 'compel' speech, thus corrupting the notion of Free Speech. Further by way of justification he is arguing the law is sloppily written and vulnerable to abuse.

Why aren't people understanding this!? He isn't seeking to offer 'pseudointellectual' arguments that undermine civil rights, in fact he is trying to do the **exact** opposite. He has **repeatedly** stated his antithetical stance to Right Wing ideology and is by independent estimation responsible for steering many young men *away* from the Alt-Right.

It would be baffling if it wasn't for the fact that some of the so called Left in this debate genuinely seem to be incapable of  seeing reason.So I was thinking about Norm MacDonald discussing transgenderism and something he said suggested they want everyone to be marginalised so, in a sense, we would all be the same. I'm not insensitive to the feelings of non-binary people and it's evident they are a section of the greater community but I think they may be missing something in their calculations to spread equality. If they succeed in drawing (or coercing) mainstream society to their cause, it will leave the middle ground with a higher concentration of Right leaning radicals. This is as good a reason as can be needed to make legislation concerning their safety more moderate than Bill C-16 seems to stipulate. Certainly it should go without saying that a Law ought to be as clear and unequivocal as possible so it's bewildering that JBP has been able to example where this is pitifully lacking.

I think the holy grail for unconventional people is for them to be able to regard themselves as 'normal'. I think they are rightfully sick to death of stigmas that have endured for generations and want to be embraced in the warmth and security of the wider community. This in itself doesn't seem so unreasonable but I think they are getting closer and closer to an irresolvable dichotomy. What they are using the organs of Government and the Law to accomplish where the usual dynamics of society couldn't, won't be able to change how people *feel*. This is the brutal truth and one they would ignore at their peril.

They need to leave safe spaces for the knuckle dragging neanderthals and I might be one of them. I don't think I'd mind being labelled as one if they'd only leave me alone but it seems they are intent on painting me and people like me into a corner. Perhaps they have yet to learn that conflict and peaceful cohabitation exist on a spectrum and can't be disassociated from each other.Okay so this thread is dedicated to Yahooyellow.

To begin with I will say that I believe my belief and Faith in God is rational. That is to say I am convinced I have a working concept of what God is and how that impacts on Reality and me as an aspect of Reality. I believe that I am a necessary component of Reality and I believe Reality requires me to exist in order that it can 'BE', in this Space, at this Time.

I believe that Jesus was a real person who personified and made cognitive a concept of humanity that **needed** to be brought about.

I believe the Church, for all it's faults and the criticisms leveled at it, has been the foundation of Western civilisation since it's adoption by the Romans as State Religion.

have at it
Interesting, I have been waking up now regularly at 5 30/6. Will see today if it still holds.

Looked for a calendar app, and made it properly work. Got a few ideas for scheduling.

I had lots of trouble for prioritizing, but I had a workaround. Just add all things that come to your mind. Now, compare one item with the ones around it and see which one should be on top. Do this for a while and you start getting a sense of what's important. I guess do this for a while and you will intuitively realize what is important.

So, did that. Have a few thoughts on scheduling and other things.

Will post.

NOW, also, since i have been suffering (HAD been suffering) from chronic depression, I have missed out on a lot of maturing.

I got scolded by a friend who didn't take kindly to me losing a bit of his accessories. He said I am like a child and I don't even take an ounce of responsibility.

That's not entirely true but peopel are indeed frustrated with me. ANd after private victory is the public victory. But I will have to do past authoring with all of this analysis done well: where have I dropped the ball before?

I guess that's it for today. Good sunday.I've noticed in a lot of fiction, and documentaries for that matter, that it is common for criminals and other destructive people to build up a whole story in their minds why what they're doing is ok. Frequently some variation of I've been hurt so this is compensation, or revenge, or feelings of superiority that don't require playing by the rules. Sort of like the evil version of the hero's journey.

Is anyone aware of resources that outline this type of thing? I mean I hear snippets of it in Maps of Meaning, but I guess I'm asking about Maps of Chaos. I'm curious to know if anyone has actually outlined the story lines of destructive people.It was an OKish day, good hours put in, however, I still ended up wasting a lot of time on Lunch and a lot more time after 8 where the entire night was gone and no work was put in. I lost my habitica streak on scheduling. 

 

The best thing about the day is that one of my tasks was to read up on making projects and on productivity. They had discussed how to schedule your daily tasks and move them around in slots of times. 

 

For the first time in my life in almost a decade, a day's slots are becoming more and more apparent. 8 PM Outside. 6 PM exercising. Get up between 05:30 AM to 6:00 PM. 

 

The problem with my scheduling is that I have demarcated three goals for a day, but I didn't even finish one. The problem, as usual, was that I was not clear about what exactly to do apart from showing up. I didn't know when I was done with 1 task and I should move to the other. 

 

Also, all of my tasks are  "Do this project", "Do that project". However, I never have items like, "In this project, do this particular task, which would take 1 hour. Aim to get it done within 1:15 hours". 

 

I tried to do that in college, but I always fumbled with the timings of these endeavours. When my focus should have been on putting in the hours or even basic ‚Äì getting a regular wake up and sleep time, I focused on figuring out my tasks, thinking about them and then finding what the exact next task should be. 

 

And that's the lesson right now, I focused first on getting up. Then, I focused on showing up for work and fixing it. I have a decent clarity about month long, yearlong goals and their weekly breakdowns, but I am not yet swift enough to make a good judgement on what the daily breakdown is and what particular piece of work I should do at what time of the day. 

 

But this is essentially just the productivity part of my world. There is still a lot to be done about the other areas ‚Äì especially familial relationships, friends, finances and intimate relationships. 

 

Let's get there, let's sit down and think about it fully. 

 

I had one important realization though: There are some tasks which eat away your energetic time. Things like getting things in one folder. Or waiting for updates to be installed on your computer, which you could have done on the night before. I did the updates the night before, but the PC restarted midway and since it's a dualboot ‚Äì it went to Ubuntu instead of the windows Installation. "Introverts" as you may know have a reticular activating system (RAS) on higher lvl of arousal than the "extroverts", who by definition need to have environment stimulation to perform at their best.

Actually there is two way :

*First* one, the lemon juice experiment. Relatively easy to do, see there : http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/personalityandindividuality/lemons.shtml

*Second* is equally easy but longer and require more attention, and you can have an approximation of what degree of extraversion you have, except if you are a big coffee drinker :

Some of you might know Brian Little, if not I recommend you checking his video on personality traits : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYvXk_bqlBk

He describe that coffee have a counter productive effect on introverts, for example where two cup of coffee might give an effective boost to the extrovert to complete accurate task, an introvert individual would loose perfomance

Also here's what he add about it and I found it very interesting : https://youtu.be/qYvXk_bqlBk?t=573

So if you are just as introvert as he is, like a REAL one, and you took a cup of coffee at 4 pm, don't even expect to sleep before 10 pm.

This bring us to the Brian scale. (Okay now this experience sounds like bullshit, but I'm not even kidding)
Brian can't sleep before 10 pm if he take his coffee between 3.30pm and 4 am, let's consider that the optimal time of ingestion is as he said 3pm. 

3pm --&gt; Brian sleep at 9 pm and a half let's say.

After coffee ingestion Brian need at least 6 hours to be able to reduce his state to the optimal lvl 

So if you don't have already a tolerance against caffeine this experience might actually surprise you, try yourself on the Brian scale ! 

Drink one good cup of coffee  in the afternoon and see when you can go to sleep, be aware of your biological clock, don't go to sleep at 8pm if you usually go to 1 am the last few days otherwise the experiment won't work obviously

PS : I did it myself and find that I need about 5 hours after coffee, a little bit less like 4 hours and forty minutes.

However I have no actual idea of how it could be possible to measure it on the global population of course lmaoThis was an inconsequential day in a way. What I noticed, however, was that I wanted to finish off one reading that I am doing. I am not terrible excited about it, but I keep wasting more time than I should at it. 

 

My current time wasters are Lunch and getting down to work in the morning. Lunch takes 45 minutes or so. Bathing takes up around 20 minutes because I am almost always lost in thought while bathing. This is a scary thing because it breaks rhythm and also, is unreliable.  

 

Anyways, the news is that I have a good routine since some time now, which is morning around 9 AM to evening 6 PM, at which I go down to exercise and around 8 when I hang out with friends. 

 

This also allows me to notice other stuff. 

 

I have also taken JP's advice that if something is bothering you or you are distracted at work because you are thinking about it, then it's not that you lack the capacity to focus, it's just that your being has decided that something needs thought. So when you sit down and write about it all, you are expressing it and are not letting it bubble up again and again. 

 

Now once this is done and dusted and I start working on these projects, I will have to give thought to the more important matters - handling uncomfortable conversations, making money regularly and also, having resumes and other stuff ready, talking to different people who might not have your best interest at heart and also caring for parents. 

 

But all that happens after we sort ourselves out - which involves a good routine. So, that's that Bucko! 

 

I think the step after that is that I have to take considerably less time in the things that I write about. Day 36 | My Journey | The nitty gritties

I have done well since the last few days to sleep at a time and wake up regularly. So it took around 20-25 days of concerted work to get that done. It's actually very encouraging.

I have been feeling more upbeat, energetic and enthusiastic since quite some time now. I hope to keep it up.

Now is the time to have nitty gritties. I have seen that I stop work at 6PM regularly. Lunch wastes a lot of time, a LOT of time and ensures that the time I have between afternoon and stopping to work is usually around 1 : 45 to 2 : 15 hours.

I am using a timesheet to measure my effort, and it shows that I waste a lot of time in bathing as well as other routine work. I also get started a little late. There is nothing that I can do here, where I wake up at 6 and don't get started till 9 AM.

A LOT of time is wasted here, and I ought to focus on these skills.

Also, I usually don't function after going out. So 6 PM to 11 PM is around generally a waste. Some of it is spent socializing.

I have also noticed that when I go out for running / exercising, around an hour i spent on a 20 minute activity. Which is just a LOT. TOO MUCH.

So these issues are the battles with the dragon. No need for complacency right now, the idea is to maintain statistics and keep track of a few edges.If Hubris is having the temerity to challenge God's supremacy, what has the West or developed world done to deserve the accusation?

I believe they have tried and succeeded, at least in their own eyes, to create man in their image. I think AI may be the next but I think the most erroneous and present example is Secularism.

But what are the consequences? Can it be said that the West and the part of the world that is essentially Patriarchal, namely those cultures whose origins are founded on the Judeo, Christian, Islamic religious traditions, are suffering those consequences now? Have these cultures strived to emulate the Father, or have they sought to usurp Him?Can the dynamic of change in the West be regarded as an antagonistic 'conflict' between a blossoming 21st Century Matriarchy 'at war' with a declining Patriarchy?

The villain it seems is widely regarded as the Patriarchy but I see no mention of how it's detractors consider themselves. The are variously referred to as Liberals, Progressives, Cultural Marxists and most commonly as the Left but aren't they essentially Matriarchal? Is this recognised by anyone in the thick of the melee? Do current social trends share any common analogies with Matriarchal societies? I wonder whether people who claim lower IQ are faking it or are not tested correctly, since lower-IQ people are not likely to be interested upon what JP has to say, which is no kindergarten stuff.

The truth is that there is not much place for lower-IQ people when things are improving so fast and one needs certain comprehension skill to be useful, not valuable or advancing but just to hold on, in the world of the Future.

And, yes, lower-IQ people are probably doomed and will have no place, since today's IQ 80 job will be done by IQ 100 people and so on.

Social darwinism goes to work when resources are dwindled. It was dismissed for a while because we exploited the fossil fuels, but they are running out; affordable ffs are running out and while there aer plenty of them they are expensive, both physically and economically. The heavy oil in Venezuela are largely worthless, which is why that country is in deep shit.

A higher-IQ person delivers more value to the society so would be generally treated better.

While a high IQ does not guarantee a high income, a lower IQ will certainly guarantee lower income, lower social status, and probably much less value to society. I have supervised people who were much older, but were below my pay grade because i was smarter. They were often in financial trouble, and i was well known as nothing-passes beyond-me person towards them. In other words I treated them according to their intelligence.  Such hostile and high-handed attitude towards those inferior to you should be the norm, but that's another topic

Tl, dr, IQ is a very good rep of how a person's value to society will be expressed. Theire might be better ways to find the value, but we don't know how.

I think the majority of the work day was alright. I observed the same old trends as earlier. 

 

Currently, the problem is with: 

    Wasting time after waking up, it's just a lot of time. Around 1-2 hours. 

    Also, forgetting to make these posts before the day ends. 

 

I also noticed that whenever my family brings up the status of my online courses, my body wants to go away from that situation instinctively. My brain knows that this is wrong, so I have forced myself to stay. She's asked me how long is this going to take, and I told her a few weeks. 

 
A few weeks is optimistic, because when I was down, I spent entire months without pursuing any project. And then I spent the first 20-25 days of this project trying to get up on time. And thankfully we are there. 

 

And once that private victory is done, I am sure public victory will follow very easily. I say easily, because if the private victory is there, public victory is just a matter of being oriented in the right direction. 

 

Also, there was a dull, exhausted state at around  6/7 PM, and 3 - 8 PM just happened very fast. 

 

In the book, "Your Brain at Work", there's this assertion that a huge part of using your own brain properly is to have distinct, sharp names for the different states that you experience, and proper routines to establish them. 

 

Also, I have been passing out more often rather than mindfully sleeping since the last few days - I think that's a bit of an issue. By passing out, I mean, returning home from an evening at the beach with friends and beer. 

 

Also, one of my chief targets has been to sit down regularly with Seven Habits and keep re-orienting my life around the questions, regularly; however, once I have had regular time, this did not happen properly. Maybe I should go out on a weekend to a beach, loosen up a bit and then enter a reverie. Same has been the case with picking out a paleo/Keto diet; and also doing proper research on diet/nutrition/exercises. Is that even possible ? I'm still 19 years old and I can't have a bank account yet because living in the parent house, the thing is I have cash and phone credit and I wondered if it was possible to use either of theses to buy it. My parents don't want to use their credit card to buy something on the internet and because they're not according much confidence online, and certainly not cash !

Any idea ? I'm open to any kind !Missed my day's exercise routine because of a family visit I had to make. 

 
A family member, close on, acts very irrationally. Full of unneeded trauma and unprocessed past. Made a lot of embarrassment today. Will have to work this into the things that I pay attention to and have to resolve this. 

 

Also, missed the exercise routine even though I knew we would be going off at 3 30 PM. Could have practiced earlier. So effectively, I broke a streak. Maybe I will keep this as a reminder to plan ahead and anticipate when we have out of the routine breaks. 

 

That's it for today. The upset family member is a huge deal and I will have to look into it. I've done the workcoach version, so here are my result :

*Openess = ??th percentile


Openess : 23th percentile

Intellect : 12th percentile

I agree with that I'm kind of an ignorant of complex thought, but while I don't seek to be more open I find myself fairly open. 
Surprised to see that I'm not higher than that, the results surprised me 
Either they are ungodly high or surprisingly low on each trait 

*Conscentiousness : ??th percentile


Industriousness : 9th percentile

Orderliness : 3th percentile 

I'm super-lazy I agree with that and quite impulsive, I struggle following a routine and even simple schedules, sometimes it's just stronger than me.  I still hope I can bring this little higher with time but I don't have enough will to do so lmao such a fate 


*Agreeableness : ??th percentile


Politeness : 79th percentile

Compassion : 58th percentile

I'm kind no surprise here


*Extraversion : ??th percentile


Assertiveness : 9th percentile

Enthusiasm : 52th percentile 

(Wthell that low in assertiveness while being more enthusiastic than half of the population ?) Anyway while I don't necessarely disagree too much with the results I really need some explanation, looking at them like this. 
I'm not talkative at all with my family, I just keep the interaction with them at a minimum, while outside it's another story, I'm not super talkative (not quiet either) but I'm described as good comapny and I'm usually joyful

Also I've been categorized as class clown when I attended high school, thing that didn't happened when I was in kindergarten, I was somewhat calm and enthusiastic out of class I guess

Does someone has an explanation for the high differencce between the two ? Agree that I've always been a huge follower in groups





Today's day was a washout ‚Äì akin to the earlier days of my journey the first few days. I think it was beer that made me wake up at 3 AM after passing out at midnight. I did nothing in the morning trying to sleep, slept after 7 hours finally (because I had to be up once it was 6 Am to finish chores, and the responsibility made me alarm). 

 

I woke up at 1 : 30 PM and have basically been zoned out since then, in a reverie. I am high in openness, and that makes me prone to states where I have read a lot and I end up processing that in a dream like reverie while time passes me by. 

 

Such a reverie is good once in a week, when it gives me valuable thoughts : but I could not come out of it today after waking up and spent entire day in it - (though admittedly I had a few decent ideas). 

 

It was extremely frustrating to realize that I was zoned out and time is passing me by and that out of the routine I had no way to get back to work. 

 

I need a Habit forming procedure/NAC to condition myself to get out of a reverie at unwanted times. 

 

I also need backup routines for me to go back to sleep after I have woken up early. Will also need to check on the effects of alcohol from the insomnia book : I have had a really good time so far and I don't wish to go back to the old routines. The way you currently are, the way you've been through your lifetime, or the way you were before ?

I struggle with that, based on each of those I get different results. So I don't know which one should I go with sometimes, especially when you want to know how you are without being too much stuck in the past (from which you learned) and without forget it (totally off results).

Right now for example I've adopted some behavior (or persona I guess) since quite a long time that I've hard time detaching myself from, even tho they're not entirely "true" to my inner self. 

However when you've became good enough to even fool yourself questions must be asked

So how do you take your test ?It was a Sunday, but I was still working because I had missed a few hours on Friday due to a time commitment.

However, on a Sunday, I had little clarity on when to start working and how many hours I have left. I started at 9, and yet inside I wasn't in an entirely excited state of mind. It was a laid back experience. As I have said many times, I my sluggishness is my own dragon. A Dragon within me. It's a huge problem.

So yesterday's productive work was around 3.5 hours, even though I sat down through the day from 10 - 6. This has been the problem.

In the evening, I met a few friends of mine who are developing a product. I would be working with them in some or the other capacity, if not as a partner. Being with them was energetic, but it alarmed me out of a sense of urgency - if I work with someone else, and If I give them my commitment, then I don't have enough time for the things I wish to do. In other words, If I want to exercise regularly - I might find that I don't have the time for that. If I don't do it properly then I lose trust of other people.  If I don't exercise, then I risk messing up my body.

I don't think there's a specific problem, but it was an alarming situation.

Also, I one of my friends was irked at me for something I did : and it bothered me ever since. I slept on it and when I woke up that was my first thought. However, coming out of a depressive state, if I let these things get to me, I might sink back again.

** A good book I follow makes the following suggestion: "If I feel a strong emotion, don't express it straightaway. Hold it, and use it to get something done which is significant and harmonious". I felt I should lash back at my friend, prove that I was right. However, I did not. And in doing so, I had little say in the matter and I felt helpless and insulted, though it was not fully uncalled for. **

What will I do now? I will hold that emotion, make something useful and redeem myself in that manner. Not redeem myself in someone else's eyes, but in my own eyes.
Things are becoming clearer right now.

I have my parents worried about my future and  desperately want me to get occupied with something instead of being/working from home. And I have never paid attention to it as if it's my responsibility to comfort them. So, what do I tell them, how do I routinely comfort them? I have not paid attention to that.

Also, I have a couple of dates in two different towns, and there's chemistry. However, I have never gotten time to get involved and the chat by phone doesn't work so well. My sex life is receiving much little attention, like me not giving enough attention to my parents and well wishers.

Also, failed to deliver any concrete result/output anywhere, even though I was occupied throughout the day. I think I was juggling a lot of tasks, but I did not realize that after 2 PM, time passes very fast and I would need to start closing tasks soon. So, biggest drains were, not knowing what task to do, not coming back to a task I made progress on earlier and also, being just tired and exhausted by afternoon. (Maybe I should work-out at that time?)

There's definitely a lot of confusion in selecting the things to work on, even though priorities were set, making a choice itself is tough. Maybe I need to start not only with a schedule, but with a concrete idea of who I want to be by the end of the day - just like JP says : scheduling is deciding what's the best possible future for you that you like? Did he ask for it to be removed?I had a very bad, unproductive day.

Intense exercise and running and waking up at 5 had me fatigued today. When I woke up at 5 and stayed up till 7, I did not have the will to work. I decided I need to take some more rest. When I woke up at 9 - 30 ish again, I was completely rested, relaxed and had lost all my sense of urgency. It was a good feeling, but also frustrating because I wasn't excited by anything.

I did a lot of random tasks today, without really focusing on anything - mostly because I don't have an impending deadline. But I have made enough progress to know now that goal evaluation is needed, and the regularly we do it (after a point in our personal growth), the better it is.

After trying to get back on track, I kept getting derailed and distracted, and there were small bouts of work. Tomorrow, however, I will have made estimates of what should be done by what time, and focus on maintaining that speed.

Not bad for the 43 days of progress from when I woke up at 5 PM in the evening and did nothing the entire day.

I have to constantly find my intent everytime I check my progress through the day.the title seems baity, but [if the shoe fits...](http://www.foreignobserver.ca/2018/01/15/the-humanities-have-gone-insane/)

&gt;At a now-infamous TA meeting at Wilfred Laurier University, an assistant professor of communications asserted that that Nicolas Matte‚Äôs comment ‚Äú‚Ä¶**it is not correct that there is such a thing as biological sex**‚Äù is not something that‚Äôs up for debate, in that Matte‚Äôs statement is unequivocally true. The other professor in the meeting echoed this sentiment, claiming that one side of the TVO debate in question (Jordan Peterson‚Äôs side) had zero academic credibility. 

&gt;But **how is it possible that there is zero academic credibility in something as simple as ‚Äúthere‚Äôs biological differences between males and females in animals and human beings‚Äù**? The answer lies in certain subsections of academic journals in the humanities, which **have been at odds with reality for a long time**.

a strong argument is made linking quintessential postmodernist claims on the self-serving nature of *all* narratives to the accelerating decay in many of the soft sciences. 

thoughts? objections? is the write-up unfair or careless? i will readily admit that i found it particularly cogent in light of my own experiences as an English undergrad at berkeley, something like a decade ago.Solipsism is the observation that **every**thing and **no**thing, reality, is the self, and that there is no other, only self. If you realize that by careful observation of what an other person is, you will realize it is merely a perception. Then there's no one to blame but yourself, there's no one to teach or expect to take responsibility. You are ultimately responsible for everything, because you're all that exists.

Intellectually we can attribute people of being conscious, but it's not an other person or consciousness or self. We already concluded from observation that there's only self, hence to explain 'others' at least as you see it now, it's simply the same self. One self can be many by the mechanisms of disassociation, and of course all these "separate" selves will claim multiple selves due to the effects of disassociation.

The drama of all conflicts reside in the construct of the separate selves, and we can't expect to get out of this mess and make it messy if it becomes too orderly if we all believe in it like if it's true, completely ignoring our observation and intuition. Yeah, it means we're all one self, but we're not equal in everything. We are unique except for the self. Competence and hierarchy is born in that uniqueness.I don't even feel like I am doing any work if I just allow myself to work. Probably many such tasks are like that. However, my trouble has been ab out taking breaks. If I take one, I'm out.

Around 40 minutes wasted. Best rule in life is to just follow the pomodoro technique and work within it. Now I'm unhappy that there's been such a waste of time. I will use it. Better.

Pretty uneventful day except for the fact that I did a little bit of reading up on to do lists, which told me about how we procrastinate, or lose energy while focusing on a single task. It's related to JP's insight that procrastination works in such a manner that if you have two hard tasks to do in a day, you will feel like doing the less harder one and still feel productive, even though the most crucial one still is left undone.

They call it structured procrastination - which is basically doing a task on your list till you feel like it, then putting it back at the end of your list, and switching between these tasks regularly. And it literally does not feel like I am doing any work - it's as comfortable as that.

But this led to a huge breakthrough: I was avoiding weekly planning, looking up diets, exercise schedules and information on metabolism etc. because I was worried that I would not be able to do the most important stuff first. And the most important stuff would drain me out.

However, after this insight, it allowed me to work on all the tasks that I had to do, and make me realize that EVERYTHING that I have been trying to do so far is just easy, very, very easy. The important part is getting it done.

So, this means that I have broken through a huge barrier: not defining weekly tasks. I have also realized that my productivity will skyrocket by using this little method.

So what's the main thing to do right now? Sleep. And get back tomorrow and start working on huge tasks. So far, the pattern was that I would just focus on one thing and drag it out till it was completed and I would waste days and days on it. Now it feels different.For those who don't know Mark Manson is an author most famous for his book " The subtle art of not giving a fuck". 

I think it's a book everyone should read, his philosophy is very very similar to Peterson's as he talks about suffering, accepting respobsibilty for everything and many other stuff. He's not an academic or anything but what he writes is very useful and we'll thought out.I ran 14 kms today. On a whim. Not only did I finish it, I was bored near the finish - it was that easy. So my body has definitely adjusted.

However, I suck at scheduling. The last 45 days my priority has been to sleep and get up at the same regular time and then to finish off work.

A few weeks back I finished off one project, and have been trying to work since a week on a project and a course, and lay out my long term plans.

Although I have put in the time, the results aren't there. A lot of my time is wasted in the morning and during Lunch.

I've noticed that once it is Lunch, I am already looking at 3-30 PM. And from there it's just a couple of hours before the day ends, and in the morning I am subconsciously looking at Lunch.

My efforts have not been enough - probably because even though I have been very mindful of how much time I am spending on everything (I measure time), I never had the simple common sense to calculate how much time I realistically had before the day ended.

I finished a 2 hour session from 9 30 to 11 - 30. And for some reason decided to finish off some tasks at the bank. That one and a half hour detour cost me the entire day's productivity.

So this is my phase where I am learning how tough it is - or how tricky it is - to wrestle for your own time, and how small choices matter. It's a day wasted if you think of it in that sense.

There's plenty of work that's around that I haven't done. For example, I maintain a timesheet since 20 days now, yet, I have never analyzed the timesheet for trends. Maybe it would take me 7 days to get used to taking time regularly, but I just did not have the sense to regularly inculcate newer habits to progress - first measuring, then trends, and then focusing on changing some metric.

Today, I realized that if I start at 7 AM, I can finish 6 hours (12 pomodoro sessions) by 2 PM. It's a tall ask. But this can be done. 

In case I have not made it clear so far - my problem right now is one of skill - of focusing on momentum on the work that I am doing. If I start something, then being there till a major chunk of it gets done. That's the goal right now.
#Successes:

I had a tremendous peace of mind in the morning when I just let myself work on the tasks in a set amount of time period. Say 2 hours in the morning, I would do this. So, I was all set. I was not worried about time. I was not worried about tasks. I had decided to be there for two hours, and I was there and it was all very peaceful.

#Frustrations

The trickier part is after Lunch, or when I start taking breaks. I am very, very sluggish after taking Lunch and it all just sort of breaks apart. I have always been unable to recover after Lunch and the sluggishness takes over. The energy with which I put in the three hours, I just don't have after that.

And I need to fill in the hours. I have logged in 9 hours today, which is strange, because I would want to log in at least 12 hours every day at the minimum. And that's just straining. I have done nothing but stay at work, from 9 till 9, and yet the total amount of time logged is just 9 hours - including the breaks and routine work. :-( And that's something.

I also don't have set times to go on my routines and rituals list, so I often end up rattled about finishing those rituals. Do I do them at 6? Something has come up and I need to work, what do I do? DO I go out? But if I am late, I won't be able to finish all of my habits! So, how do I even begin!

#On being high in openness:

One of the biggest things to do is to come to peace with an open mind and consider the works of an open mind also to be productive. It's not just doing the set order of your tasks - and if you don't then you feel guilty.

It's like there's an in-lain belief. : that I ought to be productive and I ought to be getting these tasks done. Yes, I should do them, but if I am not doing them that does not mean I am whiling away my time. I have to give myself permission to work on what my mind has thrown up. All I have to be careful of is that whatever I choose to work on (that my mind is throwing up ideas about) is something that is relevant to my life.#Looking back
	
It has been a very pleasant journey. In just a matter of 45 days, I have soared in confidence and being punctual. I still struggle somewhat when it comes to finishing tasks. It's not a matter of carelessness, but a matter of strong intent. Things often get in the way.
	
#Mentally calculating times
The one thing I have realized is that it has been so long since I scheduled or thought about a day in terms of phases that I just can't visualize different times in my head while mentally making calculations.
	
Towards the end of these days, It felt really comfortable when two sessions were demarcating themselves in front of me. Then I could say, hey, I can finish off 6 pomodori by Lunch and try for 8 after Lunch. That kind of clarity is coming in very handy now.
	
#Patterns and how soon can we spot them?
The other tendency that I can spot from outside by resting on a Sunday is that I have been too narrowly focused on finishing a task through the day, so much, that I can't spot patterns long after they become apparent.  For example, if a period of time is being wasted, I don't realize it before it's too late. I am just running around in a hurry that this task has not been done yet, feeling bad about it.
	
Sometimes, the bad feeling is so bad that I bury it. **But coming out from a depression, it's my personal practice that one very relevant feeling has to be held on to, amplified and channeled into something productive.** If I am feeling frustrated, I ought to channel that into making a change somehow. That's life. It's never going to be a set of hours given to you to work in complete silence!
	
#The wider world 
And I have written far too much about productivity and scheduling - and it's very relevant coming out from someone very low in conscientiousness. However, there's a broader world that I am a part of. I have a family whose sanity depends upon me being productive in life. Our family has a reputation to maintain in the extended family. There are younger cousins of mine who will need someone to help them through their studies - and I could do something about it. There's a lot of places where I ought to be, and in measured amounts contribute my energy.
	
It all has to be considered in its totality.
	
A couple of days back my date messaged me that something happened, and that we can't date. I tried to calm her down and told her that there's no need to make so many decisions at once. It's alright to hang out and not have any expectations. 
	
#Clean Your Room
In a different time and place, I would have been able to give these matters a lot of my attention and energy - and that would change my personal life considerably. However, not having my house in order with respect to productivity means that I am falling short on many grounds. 
	
**This is not a lament. It's actually a realization about why Peterson emphasizes humility so much. Why he tells us to clean our room. When we do that, we become stronger in non-trivial ways.**
Is it possible that Jordan Peterson has identified the missing link, the keystone between the apparently mutually exclusive means for establishing Truth? I imagine it like this, each side in the debate between rationalists who reject outright the legitimacy of Revelation, and adherents of Faith who argue that Science cannot speak to the Human Condition, are both reaching up to the Light, so to speak. But unable to fully maintain their integrity in the face of sharp analysis as to their entitlement to define what it is to be 'Human', they fall at a critical obstacle, they fail to persuade. Could Jordan Peterson have been slowly germinating the thought and process whereby an accommodation can be reached between the two schools of thought? It could be the moment of Singularity.Quit helping himLike I have been saying from the beginning she was being malicious on purpose. Like How on earth are people even allowing for such behavior?

She was not playing the devils advocate like so many naive people are saying here she was actually being the devil. Just because JP made it work doesn't mean it was a good interview, if its stupid and it works doesn't mean its not stupid, it means you got lucky. Even a broken clock shows the correct time twice a day.

Go have a look at JP's twitter if you don't believe me.

https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/955027904836055041I'm most interested in the history of land ownership in the last few hundred years but anything that gives me more context on how our system works would be great.   
  
For instance how different countries handle the nuance of it compared to one another.  
  
Any leads are much appreciated. If there's a better sub for me to ask this in let me know.As someone who has passed college by memorization, I can say that rote memorization does work.

Asians excel in rote memorization - they just do the same thing over and over again until it becomes a routine, a concept quite alien to Americans.

But, there is something to be said about memorization. Even if someone does not actually understand the concept itself, if the same passage is memorized many times, it somehow begins to make sense.

Chinese monks memorized Sanskrit texts transcribed in Chinese. While not knowing a word of Sanskrit, after a long time of memorization some kind of understanding was reached by the monks, because even if they did not quite understand what the text exactly meant, they now 'knew' what the text was about.

It would be better to memorize something and understand it. But if understanding is slow, memorization can get someone get by with, and after a long memorization an understanding is reached. it is just slower and might seem less efficient; but it is better than nothing.

Same for math,etc ; just do it, over and over and over again until you could do it eyes closed, and you do understand what it is.

I originally wanted to write about the militarization proposal of classrooms, where the teacher would reserve the right to hit or kill students not deemed suitable for class. But that topic will wait for the future. It did work in colonial Korea, which began from the middle ages on year 1910 CE to an industrial power by 1995 CE. Unfortunately, at that point of time, SJWs took over and education in Korea went to the toilet, and richer parents simply began sending their kids to North America.Many of us here who listen to JBP's lectures frequently are probably familiar with the 'Matthew Principle'. In simple terms its the phenomenon of those have have a lot getting more and those who have little getting even lesser. The rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. JP says that once we start going to the left of the pareto distribution, we start improving at an exponential rate because of the Matthew Principle and its almost as if we improve on compound interest. I think that is not only a really cool fact but also gives hope to people who might feel like they can't improve at all. I certainly can see this slowly happening as I started sorting myself out. 

Now another interesting phenomenon is the 'Minority Rule'.

I was reading this article by Nassim Taleb; 

http://nassimtaleb.org/2016/08/intolerant-wins-dictatorship-small-minority/

And he talks about the minority rule, how a small number of people who have certain needs that don't restrict the needs of others can create massive changes in society. For example jews eat kosher but for non jews it doesn't matter if the food is kosher or not, so to save money businesses end up making all of their food kosher provided it doesn't cost disproportionately more. Same for vegans, vegans dont eat non vegan food but non vegans can eat vegan food, so for businesses it makes sense if they have more vegan products. 

Now how is the minority rule relevant to us?

Well to be honest I don't have a strong case for it but I'll go anyways it might make for an interesting discussion. 

Just like how a small group of SJW'S can shut down theaters and get books banned. Can't a small group of sorted people create disproportionate good for the world? I mean look at JP, 1 man that created a wave of sorting around the world, causing a chain reaction. What if we the small minority of bucko's hold higher standards of conversation, not tolerate in-tolerate ideologies, do all the possible good and thus cause better good for ourselves and the world? 

The fallout from the Channel 4 interview is ongoing but how many of you are concerned it will put a kink in JP's mojo? I feel this incident is only one of many that will test the integrity of Dr. Peterson's philosophy and, as in this case, will in the end add gravity to it. It already is attracting a growing number of people who know something is wrong in the West and are searching for answers. I feel positive despite the tone and content of the mainstream media's indignation and rhetoric.

So who here thinks it is a set back and who thinks it's an opportunity for greater dissemination?

https://strawpoll.com/9r4f2477I'm motivated by the idea that the discussion needs to take place in an arena of light, not heat. It's true that a very substantial section of Peterson's supporters are disenfranchised young men. Unfortunately it is almost exclusivley young men who behave in this repugnant way on the internet. You do the Maths. It is not our game or their game it is 'the Game', and it needs to be regarded and presented in that light. We are not in this to create two opposing camps that can then go at it in some battle fucking royale. The West is in serious danger of being in turmoil if something isn't done to stem the tide, enough fucking around and polarization. It's Peterson that is seeming to threaten the status quo, it is Peterson that is regarded with fear and hostility, it is the mainstream that considers itself the bulwark against chaos but we seem to know what they plainly don't, they are having a Ball on a sinking ship.

It's on the people who support Peterson and a compassionate conservatism to stop stamping their widdle feet and put their fucking cool faces on. That means growing the fuck up, learn to be Men, take responsibility and stop being dickheads.The day has gone by already. I observed something. On the Sunday, I tried and rested deliberately.

However, I was always uppity and had to consciously make myself not work and not be up in thinking or engaging in any form of work. I did not want to spend a valuable day of rest in trying to work. I was trying to establish a good rhythm, where on a weekend I don't work.

#Body playing tricks on me

But on Monday (today) I was very relaxed right from the get go! I was not uppity. My body was feeling light. I did not feel alarmed and focused on working, but rather joyful and relaxed and interested in doing leisurely things.

Maybe this is simply my body adjusting to the different patterns that I am deliberately putting it into. :-)

All in all, on Monday, hardly any work was done. And I just let it be that way.

#A small yet significant breakthrough!

However, there's something I did for the first time: Plan an entire week in advance, especially the goals that I want under my belt by then. :-) And that gave me such a bit of clarity around everything.

Instead of a vague sense of being alarmed and stressed over everything, instead of just desperately trying to wrap up one task, I have a good week long focus of doing something. Most importantly, that goal did not make me shrink or reduce myself. It energized me a bit. It excited me. And a little bit scared too, that this is all that I am going to get!Before anyone tries to shit on this thought think first whether you can honestly say you know what a Prophet would look and sound like. I'm being semi-serious here. Perhaps he isn't a prophet in the sense of Mohammed or Jesus, Moses or the Buddha, someone who goes on to generate or reboot a Religious Tradition. But maybe more along the lines what Bill Hicks was talking about here: https://youtu.be/Kbbxwer_Pc8?t=2m30s

He is putting some very substantial tremors through the establishment and they sense, however unconsciously, that he is jeopardising their existence. It really is that big of a deal. I for one wish him Godspeed.It seems as if Jordan Peterson is speaking another language but what he is actually doing is speaking 'on a different frequency'.

We are witnessing a paradigm shift in Real Time.#Ongoing Struggles
When I first started out, in the initial days, I could hardly get anything done through the day. And that was what was remarkable and FRUSTRATING. And so someone recommended the War of Art to me, which described how everything got down to resistance to doing real work, and most normal human behavior is just resistance to doing actual work.

I looked at my timesheet for today - which is important, I maintain a timesheet through toggl.com - and I saw to my horror how even though I sat down at 9 : 30 AM, I didn't really start my work for the day till as late as 12 PM. What is worse is that I took breaks of 5 minutes, that somehow went down into breaks of 30+ minutes and it just passed me by.

Lunch and Post Lunch is worse. Lunch take me around half an hour (in the past it took me 1.5 hours due to sluggishness and my insistence on watching something along with it) after which I had slept for 50 minutes. All good. But I never really had a recovery structure for waking up from sleep. Quick exercises to pump my blood up, some mental exercises to get my brain active and getting back to work.

#Picking out behaviors to sacrifice
I think I have to get back to the initial days of my journey and focus more on the NACs. I have to condition myself for two behaviors:

- Getting on the seat by a fixed time. Hopefully within half an hour of finishing a morning exercise routine.
- Finishing four hours of work before Lunch time
- Having Lunch mindfully, without any noise.
- Taking a small nap, again, without any noise. Or to train myself not to nap, if my body can cope.
- And getting back into swift action after waking up.

I need to condition five huge behaviors today!

#Good warm feelings bubbling up, but how do I express them?
That apart, I am feeling happy and more loving with my day. Reaching out to the people I know and the women I know. Thinking of them in a heartbeat, wanting to have their company and make love. It's really interesting that way! However, if I do that right now without perfecting this condition, I can't get anything done at all!

I have to REALLY focus on working 8 - 10 hours a day, properly, and then focus on my personal life.

#Orienting the day to the week
Also, I have observed that a lot of this resistance builds up if I don't follow up on a project that I started immediately after I start it. If there's a break of even a day from when a project started, that break adds up and it gets nowhere. All of  this can be dealt with only if I am doing what I am supposed to do at a given point of time. I need to mentally condition myself into doing this - by nailing down a weekly goal, and then orienting every day around it.

These five behaviors have to be embedded.Why are you doing it? What purpose does it serve? Watch this thread get brick battered. [sensible chuckle]We are living through a paradigm shift. Jordan Peterson may be personifying that in the way prophets of the past have. The world seems to be powerless to stop a drift toward God knows what. The fabric of society is groaning with the strain of trying to please everybody. We're all going to die. Not imminently but relatively soon, and that includes you teenage humans who frequent this board.

Somethings happened to this board and I don't fucking like it. It's got really fucking dumb in the space of a Goddamn week. Thread after thread saying, "look at me!", "look at my book!", "look where I am!"(speaking events). For crying out loud, GET A FUCKING GRIP!

Why are you here? Not just in this Sub, but here, on this plane, in this Space &amp; Time? What is your fucking purpose? Is it to buy shit, to pull dumbass faces and double wave with someone of notoriety in the background? WHY ARE YOU HERE!? Get on it! Think about it! Stop idolizing this guy and follow his advice. You contain a Universe, every one of you, explore it, before it's too late.

Chew on this. If we can assume for the sake of argument that reincarnation is the correct hypothesis for what happens after death but we are unconscious, is the space in between manifestations literally the blinking of an eye?

For the love of God stop showing off and talk to each other.#I fully understand what Openness to Experience means

I had been focused on a task till the last Sunday. However, it has been four days in the week - and once the feeling of urgency left me, it has completely left me.

My journey thus far has been pretty interesting in terms of the personas that have come up:
	
- First was the persona that had completely given up, and wanted to just‚Ä¶ be. 
- Then came the persona that wanted to get its act straight but it was still clueless on how to spend time and how to plan.
- After EVERYTHING, came the persona that wanted to focus and just stay hyper focused and get shit done and get challenges done.
- However, this is the problem. After gaining confidence that I can get shit done, came the other persona: one of relaxed enjoyment.

Here's the problem with the relaxed enjoyment persona: It just wants to stay relaxed and perpetuate itself. The last three days I have tried to get back into a normal functioning state, but it JUST gets distracted. It wants to be alive, jump, play around, read books, make love and just be around friends. That's the persona I am dealing with right now.

And what is the issue? 

The issue is that these persona have to cycle themselves appropriately, instead of dominating completely. I experienced this on Sunday when I just took rest on purpose, but inside I was hypervigilant and was looking for something to work on.

I was hyperfocused.

So, what should I do today? I should be getting focused and find the things that are out there to kill me. And then start dealing with them.

What is the issue right now? The issue right now is to finish off a bunch of tasks and then move on to the courses. There are also some high level things I have to deal with in life, other than just normal tasks and productivity routines.I've found when informing someone of something they aren't aware of which is palpably frightening to them, they don't see the value in having that knowledge, they feel the fear. Then they transmit that fear onto the person giving the warning. With the depth of the crisis enveloping the West, is it any wonder JP is cast in this searing light? He is putting it about that, 'The End is Nigh!' and doing it in a way that is intensely uncomfortable to the Mainstream. It's getting to the point where I expect someone on one of these shows to stick their fingers in their ears, screw up their eyes and ,... well you understand.

I think it's arguable that the way Jesus did it was to literally die in excruciating pain and agony, as spectacularly and publicly a way as possible. Perhaps I should rein that in but it having been done once sufficient for purpose I'm confident it won't happen again. However I am fairly strongly of the opinion that if we miserable frightened and absurd ostriches don't get our heads out the ground it might mean the death of millions, ...maybe billions. I've never felt entirely as I did writing that then, perhaps it's because I'm listening to music:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4V3Mo61fJM ...but it felt realler somehow.

We're experiencing the double edge of civilisation, it alienates us to this our world and Original/Source Reality.

I think I have spent four days with little care in the world of any consequence, even though I am in the middle of commitments.

Time to get my act together again - happiness has been a problem for me. It's time to take on stress even though I am happy. :-)
Dr Peterson has been inspiring many big changes in my life... okay small ones but they're adding up well. And I am considering facing the dragon of institutionalized education.
In fact I'm so inspired that psychology is the direction I'm interested in going, since I have always been passionate about understanding why we behave like we do, what influences our behaviour and the nature of thought. 

I want to make sure if I do go back I pick the right direction because I'd hate to find myself in a boat full of post-modern neomarxists. :P I think clinical psychology sounds good as I am quite inspired by helping individuals shape their thoughts and perspectives to improve their life. social psychology sounds interesting because I am really interested in the behaviour of groups and how other people and environments shape our interractions. But from what I understand sociology is one of the more corrupt disciplines so I'm concerned I might not really get what I'm looking for.
Any psychologists or students here with advise on direction? more insight into the different fields of psychology?Peterson in some of his Biblical lectures made the claim that he thinks the reason the SJW's are all about equity and even distribution of wealth and resources is because they are manifestations of the female psyche. Female humans back in hunter gather societies were responsible for evenly distributing the good's amongst the group. Thus the SJW's are a mere reflection of the deeper female psyche. 

I found that notion very interesting. In a Jungian sense. It was group-think on a societal level. 

Later on I came across a youtube channel named colttaine. The guy make really interesting videos on societal trends and the differences between the sexes. His hypothesis is the same as that of peterson's. That feminism is a manifestation of the female psyche in a societal wide basis. he has countless well researched, well put together videos on this.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX1GkAJdz_WF5Vyc2xUxZZw/videos

I think this theory is close to being true because, women in recent history have been kept silent as a group. Its been around a century that women got the right to vote. Most cultures around the world, throughout history have kept women silenced and in the house. 

Western culture gave women the freedom's that they have now. Their voices have finally been unleashed. 

Which is why I think the whole modern feminism and SJW thing is the female psyche gone rogue and they have manifested themselves as the radical left. 

For example there was a thread few days ago about animus possession. Basically a Jungian idea of how a women sees the world subjectively and everything she thinks is true to her  regardless of evidence, her feelings dictate reality. Which is why arguing with women can be difficult because what ever she say's is reality to her and you have to use the scientific method to disprove her claims. 

"In intellectual women the animus encourages a critical disputatiousness and would-be highbrowism, which, however, consists essentially in harping on some irrelevant weak point and nonsensically making it the main one. Or a perfectly lucid discussion gets tangled up in the most maddening way through the introduction of a quite different or possibly perverse point of view. Without knowing it, such women are solely intent upon exasperating the man and are, in consequence, the more completely at the mercy of the animus. "Unfortunately, I am always right," one of these creatures once confessed to me." - Jung

https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7sshdc/i_know_we_have_had_a_lot_of_cathyposting_lately/

Isn't this exactly what the post modernists are doing? they are structuring reality based on subjective feelings. Isn't the post modern neo marxist radical left just animus possession on a group level. They act just like how an individual woman acts. 


A lot of people have gravitated to this sub in the last few weeks which is a testament to the popularity of Dr. Peterson but much of the content during this time is uncomfortably reminiscent of Idolatry. Idolatry gave rise to the worst atrocities in the 20th century under the cultural process known as the Cult of Personality.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality

It's possible this period was the zenith of what begun with the Enlightenment and the imprudent decision to remove the Church and Religious influence from it's role both in Government and wider society. With God no longer the source of moral and ethical decision making it became possible for many many abhorrent acts to manifest, the Holocaust for example. The death toll in Europe alone during the events of WW2 was around 200 Million people which qualifies it for yet another zenith as the most deadly War in all of human history, ...so far.

The point I want to make and perhaps begin a discussion on is what I sense to be a growing Cult of Personality around Dr. Peterson. It's critical to remember if you aspire to pursuing what this University Lecturer, Clinical Psychologist, Husband, Father and former sufferer of crippling depression and alcohol abuse is advising, that you must try to keep your imaginations from running away with you.

I can assure you he is only a person and quite capable of making mistakes. Such as recently on the debate between him, William Lane Craig and Rebecca Goldstein. When raising a point with Rebecca Goldstein he appeared to misunderstand a distinction between Transcendentalism and Transcendent which Dr. Craig took the liberty of explaining to him. JP seemed to stall and even a little contrite. Also during that debate Dr. Peterson's style of delivery which is otherwise very agreeable seemed contrived and at times a little showy. On the whole he made a very solid impression but he did seem inexperienced in this company, not surprising given it may have been his first foray into Public debate at this level with such company.

It occurred to me that I was seeing something in him that was there before but I hadn't noticed. There is something charismatic about Jordan Peterson. With this in mind and the phenomenal growth in his popularity I wonder if it has changed him. I wonder if he as been seduced by the idea that with his star rising he may be something more than just a guy.

During the parades the people of Rome would have for Caesar on his return from successful campaigns, a man was employed to hold the Laurel above Caesar's head as his chariot made it's way up the Palatine hill. But this was not his only job. As the parade progressed it was also his responsibility to repeat constantly in Caesar's ear, "You are only a Man". I hope Dr. Peterson takes similar precautions to keep his ego in check.

I'm looking forward to his series on the Book of Exodus. In my opinion it's one of the greatest stories in the Bible filled with immense meaning concerning Identity and realising one's purpose. I'm worried that with the explosion of his celebrity in a demographic bursting with need and youthful impatience he might decide to take a break and completely drop out of sight for a time.

It would be kinda cool actually if he made it into a book. I think I'd be more prepared to buy that than what so many here seem to regard as his 'New Covenant', 12 Rules ...Something that really fascinates me is the fact that ideas can impact people to the extent that they have the capacity to override the fundamental human instinct to survive.  

Like really, The instinct to survive is huge, people will go through hell and out to stay alive. Everything that we as humans do is to stay alive and make sure that we get the opportunity to pass on our genes. 

The fact that ideas can grasp people to the extent that they would be living to give up their life for the cause is something that is really amazing. 

"If they fine me, I wont pay it. If they put me in jail, I'll go on a hunger strike. I'm not doing it. And that's that!." - JP 

JP is willing to put his life on the line to stand up for freedom of speech. But is that really rational? Why not just use the ze,zir pronouns and live a comfortable life? Why not pass on the problems to the next generation, you won't have to suffer. 

Why is this man willing to speak out against Islam in a muslim majority country? 

http://www.cairoscene.com/In-Depth/On-The-Run-An-Interview-With-Wanted-Atheist-Sherif-Gaber

"What happened to me sparked a battle for freedom of thought. I can‚Äôt run away now, I prefer to fight for my rights from within the battle itself, and not on the outskirts in some foreign land.‚Äù ‚Äì Sherif Gaber 

How can people value some ideas so much that they are willing to die on that hill. 

I feel that I just can't do something like this. I value being alive as the primary, and this is maybe what separates me from them. They are willing to die on that hill, while I am not. 

The beauty is that, after your dead it doesn't matter if the world is hell or heaven, it doesn't matter if your loved once suffer, you being dead won't be able to experience the pain of their suffering. 

Despite all this how can people devote their life to ideas? 

Are they brave or stupid? Maybe both.

Maybe these are the people who have found true meaning in life, meaning that justifies suffering and death itself. Meaning stronger than the will to live. As the title says, I have a friend (male, young adult) who told me he is somewhat "lost" in life, and what better time it is to try and enlighten him a bit. So i want to show him a few JP lectures to try and get him on track, but I don't know where to start, so what do you think are great videos to begin with

just a few things to know

he's got the time, so hour long lectures are fine

having the luxury of living in Asia, we are barely affected by the crazy political havoc happening in the West, but due to that he might not understand the more political lectures of JP, so non of that (im sure he'll discover it on his own anyway)

I think what he needs is are the "personal responsibility" and "clear your room" vids, but im not exactly certain which ones they are

anyway suggest away**Why I am making this post.**

/u/frrunkis, this post is to avenge you.

Anyone even remotely familiar with JP's work will know that the man is against all forms of identity politics. He say's in his own words that he is against the far left, and the alt-right as they both practice identity politics. 

Now the the followers of JP don't have to agree with everything the man says, but being against identity politics is one JP's most important messages. It's what defines JP, his hate for identity politics is what makes him who he is as he studied the regimes that killed millions and pulled out the one thing that they had in common, they practiced identity politics. 

In a recent post, which I think got brigaded by alt-righters, this one might too.  Every single comment was defending a white ethnostate. And the amount of double think and dis honest tactics being used to argue their positions in that thread really made me kind of angry which is the reason I am making this post. 

Being a JP followers, and posting in the JP sub but not knowing that identity politics is something that JP is absolutely against is like being a Christian but denying message of the Bible. 

**The Motte and Bailey Fallacy.**

The Motte and Bailey fallacy is a technique used by proponents of extreme indefensible positions to carry out a bait and switch and make it seem like their position is actually a reasonable one. 

For example; A feminist can go like, "Well the dictionary definition of feminism is the strive for the equality of both sexes, therefore if you are against feminism, you are against gender equality".

Anyone see the fallacy there? What 3rd wave feminism pushes is indefensible in many ways, thus the proponents of that ideology make it seem like defending that ideology would be the reasonable thing to do. 

**The alt right does the exact same thing.**

Whenever anyone accuses the alt-right of playing the identity politics game. They respond with;

"Well don't you want to preserve your culture and values and your lineage?" 

A good ole' bait and switch. You don't need to preserve the white race to preserve your culture. You can teach your kids your value regardless of what race they are. You can teach them your culture regardless of their race. You will pass on your lineage regardless of the kids race, even if a white man marries a black woman, the offspring will still have 50% of your DNA. 

Like the alt right refuses to realize that communists and SJW's are white people just like them, yet have radically different values. Your values/ethics are not tied to your race/ethnicity. 

**"If that is racist, then a majority of humans are/were racist"**  

Yes, they were.

This is an appeal to nature/ Appeal to masses fallacy. 

Just because most people are tribal, and have been that way for a long time doesn't mean, that is the optimal mode of being. 

Humans have practiced many barbaric things like murder and human sacrifice for the longest of times, it's totally natural, doesn't mean we should do it. You can;t just throw rationality out the window. It is as contrived as all the identities that Jordan Peterson disdains yet for him White Identity is axiomatic, a reality. Further he is doing **exactly** what he condemns the Left of by encouraging a sense of 'victim status' for White Identity. It is apparent in interviews he has with none Europeans that he is skeptically observing them, searching for something, as if waiting to lock into a frequency that will enable him to relate to them. He did it with Timon Dias at Geenstijl. He did it in a recent interview with an Oriental woman and he nearly lost his temper with the journalist who interviewed him for Vice. He's never exhibited the watchful, observing countenance when engaging with 'White' interviewers and this leads me to believe he is nurturing a carefully judged apprehension of those who aren't, so called, 'White'. If you aren't 'White', you have to earn his respect in a way you don't if you are.

I thought about pointing this out for a while wondering whether to do so may give him the means to modify his behaviour but now the evidence is established and he can't deny it.

The Far-Right can sense this despite everything he's said in condemnation of them and he is giving them succour during this time of audit that White Identity is enduring.I think the consequences for doing this aren't well known or understood. Possibly it's because we aren't able to discern them from all the other calamities that befall those guilty of Hubris. Nevertheless I suspect this may be a fatal flaw in the teachings of Jordan Peterson.

Beyond the horizon, I sense a great disturbance in the Force awaits."Having the right degenerate into identity politics does not seem to be a positive solution. One of the things I would say is: I understand why the identity politics that has been practiced so assiduously and so devastatingly by the left has been co-opted by the right. I understand that.

But here's what I would say to the people on the right, who are playing that game:

If you play the game of your enemies, and you win, you win their game. You don't win. That's not victory. You just become the most sucessful exponent of their pathology. How is that a good thing? " - JP

"I think the whole group identity thing is seriously pathological.

I think we've made big mistakes in Canada. I understand why, at least to some degree, in that respect, and large mistakes are being made across the Western world.

Where we're making your group identity the most important thing about you. I think that is reprehensible. It is devastating. It is genocidal in its ultimate expression. I think it will bring down our civilization if we pursue it. We shouldn't be playing that game. So what is the alternative?" - JPBased upon all of my experience on this subreddit, youtube, twitter and browsing a little on /pol/ 4chan, I think that many people here are Alt-right, or have a strong White identity. Around 20-40%

I think that they deliberately voted to skew the /r/JordanPeterson political orientation poll, or not vote at all. I think that they've successfully, in organized, coordinated efforts, upvoted certain content here.

It's extremely unlikely that this isn't the case based on the trends you for example see on YouTube and the following results coming from it, for example, Jordan Peterson negating the Jewish Question.

It's not a coincidence that many people think label Jordan Peterson as alt-right as many of his viewers are/were it.

Say hello to your fellow Alt-right subredditors. There is many here.[found](https://i.imgur.com/Cyy480C.jpg) while meandering through Portland's [City of Books](http://www.powells.com/locations/powells-city-of-books): [Open Letters - Selected Writings from V√°clav Havel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168742.Open_Letters).

as with many Orwell quotes, it turns out that "*in times of deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act*" is [largely apocryphal](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/02/24/truth-revolutionary/
)--and yet, the phrase captures the essence of the ideals of logos &amp; free speech. 

for those daunted by the Gulag Archipelago, reading Havel may be a great starting point. https://youtu.be/Iur3eWKynqE
Pretty much everything is said in this... It feels terrible. It's not terrible like it looks or sounds terrible, it's really dooming and terrible, I have nothing to hang on to in life. I've stopped it since February now but I'm trapped into that since so many years man. Probably near of 10 if not. 

I'm so shameful of my own existence right now. I'm empty and I don't experience emotions in general, I can't even reach parental love. I can't have genuine relationship and I'm dead already, I've stopped growing when I was probably still a kid. Are any of you familiar with this ? Despite JP's knowledge and advice helping me out a lot, it just seem's to me that no matter in how many avenues I improve my life, no matter how straight I stand with my shoulders up, I just can't seem to get my porn/masturbation addiction under control.

Before anyone tells me that porn is fine, its not for me. I am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that it has a patently negative effect on my life and it cripples my cognition,confidence,social awareness,energy and many other things. So fuck off if you wan't to tell me it's ok. 

I keep on trying week after week,day after day, I have been trying for the last 2 years. But I can't stop. 

I am a 20 year old male, who is quite fit and I lift, have a diet high in fat/protein so I assume that I have high testosterone. And I am single so the urges to fuck anything that moves is really something that I have a hard time controlling, especially with the fact that I go to college and I am surrounded by the fittest girls around. 

What can I do? What can I do? What can I do to muster the willpower to finally stop doing it, I am sick of trying again and again, I am sick of being stuck in a loop. 

I am tired of being narcissistic and arrogant and telling myself that I don't need to talk to anyone about this, This is why I am making this post for a change. 

How can I not fap and turn my life around despite the odds? I am a college student and even though my parents pay for my expenses, I feel bad for putting this burden on them. 

I go for driving classes and its a bit far from where I live. Since commuting back home cost's money I found a way to get free transportation back home. There is a staff transportation bus that drop's people off near where they live. The bus driver doesn't actually check if you are a staff or not, he will just do what you tell him to do. So basically for the past week I have been pretending to work there and get free transport. 

I know that this is lying, and not ethical what so ever. But the devil in my brain is working really hard justifying this by saying that its a stupid system, they deserve to be exploited for not having counter measure for a blatant loop hole such as this. 

I will actually go forth and pay them the next time I go there, but is this something other buckos have to deal with? (you have to pay to use the bus if you are not working there)

Stupid systems just waiting to be exploited but buckos still being honest for the sake of it? 
Since the most common response armchair socialists give is that "That wasn't real communism" I decided that giving real life examples of their ideology won't work. I will have to prove that the ideology is flawed in and of itself regardless of its outcomes or implementations. Like a mathematician shows the abstract proofs for his equations despite the fact that we might already know the equation works by plugging in the values. 

One of the points about socialism that don't get brought up much is that how it is sugar coated slavery.  

I mean by definition being forced to work against your will, Because let's face it, no one will work if he couldn't keep the fruits of his labor, is slavery.  

It's like that time an econimics professor gave everyone an average grade, only to show that the average will decline over time as the students who are above the average will have no incentive to work harder and study more and put in more effort if the fruits of their labour just vanish into thin air for all intents and purposes. 

This is the reason why socialism is fundamentally wrong imo. It is deeply deeply unfair. 

 At least for philosophy, it is safe to say that everything which has to be said has been said.

Jordan Peterson is the first philosopher to grab a large number of people's attention, since, I believe. Wittgenstein.

With the collapse of the Leftist and SJW narratives, history has ended for all practical purpose. The triumph of US and its values, the technical elites, the rich, the smarter people, etc are complete, once for all ; so there is nothing more to be said about anything anymore.

In a sense, Singularity has already arrived.

People will be much more conformist, unwilling to challenge the narratives, or rebel. Like good colonial officials who would abuse their compatriots to please the colonial masters, and would later become leaders of their regions after Independence, smarter younger people will find a way to adapt and thrive in today's environment, rather than waste their lives fighting a monolithic, overwhelming structure.

So, philosophy has ended, as well as history. Since there will never be another change there is no need for philosophy and history.

Centrism has won once for all. While JP's idea does not 100% agree with Centrism, to some degrees it does help to explain it.Like it takes a massive amount of intellectual dishonesty to even defend abortion. And I really wan't to debate someone in real life about this because I just think that there is no way you can defend it without harboring cognitive dissonance and applying a lot of mental gymnastics. 

The reason I wan't a real life debate is because I tried doing so online before and things just go south as people can say the fucking weirdest and most absurd things and not be held accountable for spouting stupid shit that they would have to think twice before saying in a social setting as they might expose themselves to the potential of made fun of for being absurd or being seen as an dishonest thinker. 

Like does anyone else feel that the left has become so damn extreme because of the internet? Like there is no way you can just continue to lie out of your teeth in real life and have no one call you out on it and not have the lies show in your face.

The culture war is like a stage drama to make things exciting, a bit like witnessing two football team supporters going at each other in the U.K. You're walking in the street and you're coming close to an Arena, a stadium, and on each side of the street there's the football team supporters having at each other, facing each other. For no fucking reason. They're yelling and screaming and throwing half-full beer cans. The tension is reaching soon critical mass and the inner hooligan in each is boiling.

All the excitement, chaos, to push the stagnant and boring order away.

To pass the Culture War is to choose to either pass through a crowd of hooligans, through a team , or to go in the middle, between the two "groups". A random individual walking through the two teams might break the chaos, even for just a moment, with even more chaos. You risk having a half-full beer can hitting you in the head, or worse, as collateral damage. 

I'm pleading to everyone to walk the middle way with me. I invite you to get out of your head. Whether it's through exercise, sex or cleaning your room.

If we are this way, and base ourselves on principles, no matter what group it is, we can make a great change. I'm hoping I'm there to support any individual.There are so much complication and badly-diagnosed people.

How do you even know you're operating differently than what would be considered as a healthy and operational human being ? (Also taking into account all the unconscientious individual   into that pack, supposing ADD is a manifestation of a brain dysfunction rahter than a raw manifestation of low conscientiousness) 

Brain dysfunction ? Who ever define this ? Since when psychatrist are scientist ? They don't know much about brain chemical reaction's (or at least they don't put much effort into evaluating the patient brain) and they're the one people go to, why aren't more people starting to call out this mess ?
I don't know much about this topic (And I tried as hard as I could to find evidence of such "dysfunction" in the brain, being myself exceptionally low in conscientiousness) but even the papers done on ADHD suggest that nothing have been discovered this far yet. The question is, is there anything to discover to begin with ? 

What do you think ? Also if people diagnosed could just give their input to the topic, it would be great thanks !!

All video games are not alike, there's the [battle royale genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game) to [action role-playing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game)

Take The Witcher 3 for example, based on a polish book series:

&gt;Played in an open world with a third-person perspective, players control protagonist Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher, who is looking for his missing adopted daughter on the run from the Wild Hunt: an otherworldly force determined to capture and use her powers. Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete main-story and side quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment. Its central story has several endings, determined by the player's choices at certain points in the game. ...

&gt;... The game focuses on narrative, and has a dialogue wheel which allows players to choose how to respond to non-player characters. Geralt must make decisions which change the state of the world and lead to 36 possible endings, affecting the lives of in-game characters.[19] He can have a romantic relationship with some of the game's female characters by completing certain quests.[20] ...

&gt;**Sales**
&gt;
&gt;Before its release, over 1.5 million people pre-ordered the game.[93] The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt debuted atop the UK software sales chart in its first week, when it earned 600 percent more than predecessor The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. It was the best-selling video game of the year in the UK, breaking the record held by Battlefield Hardline.[94] It debuted atop the Japanese video-game sales charts, selling 67,385 copies in its first week.[95] Four million copies of the game were sold in its first two weeks after release.[96] By June 2015, over 690,000 players had activated the game through GOG Galaxy.[97][98] The game sold over six million copies in the next six weeks,[43] and the studio made a profit of $63.3 million in the first half of 2015.[99] In March 2016, CD Projekt Red reported that the game had shipped nearly 10 million copies worldwide.[100]

&gt;Dr. Peterson acknowledges this bifurcation, conceding multiple times that economic conditions pose unique challenges for individuals with low IQs. But it‚Äôs not just low-IQ people, but also average-IQ people and also those with IQs that are only modestly above average‚Äìor in statistics terms‚Äìplus or minus a single standard deviation from the mean‚Äìalso face challenges.

The above passage says 1 SD, but personal experience shows that people more than 1 SD but less than 2 SD (i.e. 115-130) would see 'challenges' too as more items are automated and the power of AI grows.

Nobody , including Professor Peterson who is ultimately paid by the city of Toronto, is willing to say it aloud that if one's IQ is not high enough to at least qualify the person as 'high-functioning', they have nothing to look for in this world other than penury, gig jobs which will prevent them from making any long term attachment, and any luxuries.

Right now it might be 115 but it will grow higher. Theoretically 15% of all pop has an IQ of over 115, but since the world's average IQ is about 87.5 the actual % will be quite lower.

By analogy, those over 130 is theoretically 2.5% of entire pop but in reality it is going to be much lower as well. 

Offering words of encouragements will not do any good since their intellectual limitation will prevent them from being useful in this cutthroat, inimical and  brutal world.

It might be just better for everyone to let these people quietly pass into oblivion, like a large % of Russia's male pop during the 1990s. The proliferation of opioids should not be reduced - it might be better for those who take it to pass on, to leave more room for those not likely to take it.

The cold truth is, the smarties will inherit the world. JP and others know it but are afraid to say it since their jobs are gonna be in trouble if they do. 

It might be better to set up caste systems by intelligence, like what Korea did during the 14th-early 20th century (and it worked - more on that on request), to reduce externalities, stabilize society and end useless spending on people who won't be likely to benefit from education and other benefits of the modern world.Which one hold the greater influence on another ? Like, if you cut off ADHD from an individual, what's left ? The person he's supposed to be ?

Or does the kind of person he is, from the very beginning (in pregnancy) forces the gene to develop ? What are your thoughts ?


https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XYmPWq8QPQg This is total B.S. I can't believe the U.S health instutition regarding pathology and "disorder" is so FLAWED. Basically, if you're not happy with your life and you're trying to be and yet it doesn't work, you are basically recognized as disabled if you want to. Because what psychiatrist do is trying to make people feel good and healthy (whatever that mean and whatever the mean). 

This is an oversimplistic explication, but I swear there is no more to it, scientific support is fundamentally impossible as described by Jordan Peterson in the link I send in the other post. Very convenient to know for me, as I've been diagnosed with all kind of disorders. They're not real, just conceptual, because psychiatry doctrine's simply speaking establish a goal (disorder, diseases) and aim to achieve it (heal the individual from his suffering) 

I'm not sober so I can't articulate it better right now but you should watch this if you think this subject is adressing to personal issues  : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxJzWcwcRd0

Jordan is a professor so there are things he can't say. I am sure some people in Univ of Toronto do not like him, but because he is good at walking the thin they can't accuse him.

But, reality is harsh. I expect higher ability people, with more success, will stop treating lower ability masses as humans and will be able to get away doing whatever they feel like.

In the last paragraphs of Gatsby, Fitzgerald said people like Tom and Daisy Buchanan create mess, which will be left for others to clean up. Such was the norm during the 1920s; Europe was even worse. And that's where we are going back, since it is human nature.

The years of 1945-2015 will be  the only era in human history where higher ability people at least had to defer to the lower ability people, and look at the mess the lower ability masses have made. It will end, because the fundamentals have changed. 

I am all for giving extra privileges to higher ability people. Some of them may not pursue money and head to other directions. Such people have to be subsidized, just like many kings and nobles subsidized well known artists.

Giving the power to the higher ability people to do whatever they feel like to the lower classes, like pre-WW2, leads to a faster advance of Civilization. Professors should have the ability to expel students at the spot, companies should have the ability to extract restitution from the employ and take their lives if necessary, etc. 

Because, things have changed so the lower ability masses are no longer worthy to be considered equal to higher ability people(HAP), and because of IQ will never be able to rise to the level of HAPs. In the future they will be classed as another species, but that will be another story.

Much of JP's work is based on extracting value from religion. He also happens to get a lot of flak for it. In his recent talk at Lafayette College JP made the distinction that you don't really need to be an a theist or believe in a transcendent being to be religious. And that made a lot of sense to me. It clicked. 

Religion is basically the moral presuppositions on how we act. Most atheists act out a Judeo-Christian ethic. They might say they don't but they do, and if you don't act in that way they will get angry. Which only goes to prove JP's point. 

This is the reason I think the word Atheist is not accurate in the least. We need a word something like Arreligious or something when talking about people who have no moral/ethical or any presuppositions.   

AS you can be an atheist but still be religious. You can worship money,status or not worship anything at all but you still act under a set of presuppositions, and I don't think anyone in the world can actually be "arreligious". It's just not possible. We need presuppositions to live. 

If this so is the case, then it really doesn't matter if someone is an atheist or not. As a reader of this sub, I felt obligated to buy Jordan's book and I am glad I did. It had a lot of great insights.

However, I think that Jordan's book, while great for today, will have to be revised in the future when today's bifurcation is completed,

 with the higher-IQ people, combined with the already rich, own everything , the lower-able people living like pigs and dogs, and the pre-Great War era looking like a period of great equality,

the smarter people, the richer people and the more powerful people could treat the rest with much less impunity than now.

Because of biological and genetical differences, today's poor, marginalized, and less advanced will never advance. It is a fact, and it is now set in stone. A few people might creep in, but they will be outliers and for all practical purposes today's winner will be winners for ever.

The new 12 rules for the winners could be created to match the reality of that time, but the new 12 rules for today's gig workers, unnecessariats, etc could go like this.

1. Admit that your inferiority is because of what you are, not because of society.

2. Admit that there will be no reset to rescue you. Today's society is so efficient that there will be no big whammy, and even a nuclear war cannot stop the march to singularity. (I have argued about this at r/singularity as well.)

3. Admit that you will live an insignificant, unneeded and marginal life for the rest of your existence, and nothing will change it.

4. Do not rebel. Rebelling will do no good, and will make those around you to suffer.

5. Respect the rich, the smart, the successful, etc, since they are  better than you.

6. Equality never existed. Some are indeed more equal than others, and the smarter are more equal than you.

7. Find a way to feel dignity in your permanent shitty existence, like the butler in Remains of the Day or the clones in Never Let me Go, immortal masterpieces of the Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro, if you can understand it.

8. Expect bad treatment from those who are better from you, and any mistake will probably keep you from earning any living for the rest of your life.

9. Expect you to be fed when those better than you feel like doing so.

10. Like the Dalits of India, after a while you willl get used to it, and your descendants, if any, will be conditioned in that position.  So don't be mad - it is your destiny.

11. If you want to be better despite of all of that, just be a good cog. Be good at what you do. You will at least get more gigs than others if you are lucky, and will live a bit more securely.

12. Expect the elites to kill you at any time. 

I was outraged that the driver of Isadora Duncan's car was not punished when he drove the car to the Seine River to avoid a horsecarriage. His worthless life was much less than the lives of Duncan's children, who were fathered by elites of elites. He and his entire family should have been guillotined for murder. I was also outraged that no punishment record existed for the Guatemalan nurse of Eric Clapton's son; she should have been crushed by every vehicle Clapton owned. If she was alive after that she could walk back to Guatemala.

In India and Brazil, it is not illegal to kill your servants. There are laws but they are never enforced to protect the lower classes. Such measures will extend to the more 'advanced' countries.

Human rights for the less smart, less elite, and less able will be adjusted, and such rules will ease the transition a lot.Does anyone know of any interviews, debates, etc. where Peterson's touched on group selection?   


I heard from a commentator that he doesn't believe in it but I'm not sure how one can ground ethics in evolution without accepting group selection. It is said that Mexico's new populist, socialist president Amlo (Manuel Obrador, but everyone calls him that way in there) is slashing the wages of Mexico's bloated bureaucracy. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the highly paid , and relatively smarter (if they were fools they would not have risen that high) bureaucrats will find jobs in private sector rather quickly, where they can use their govt experience to deal with the people they used to work with.

&amp;#x200B;

That's how civilization works. Smarter people always find a way to use the situation for their advantage, and they tend to go to places where they are treated better.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally feel the higher intelligence people should get a lot of privileges which are added to whatever they are enjoying now.

&amp;#x200B;

The general public should accept the cold fact that the higher able people are indeed different from them, and the general public should be expected to sacrifice their own happiness in order to serve the higher able people who can drive Civilization to a higher dimension.

&amp;#x200B;

They should also get used to the fact that the higher able people don't really have any respect over them, and want to treat them according to their actual ability, but can't do that because of PC and other shit. Before 1900, the literati in China and Korea basically could get away with anything done to the lower classes.

&amp;#x200B;

Higher intelligence should be a privilege, which would lead to a greater power. Societies which treat higher able people better will get more of them, and advance further.Today is a watershed moment of Western Civilization, yet hardly anyone noticed. Of course, few people noticed the birth of a child in a backwater Austrian border town on April 20, 1889, but far more people saw the watershed event but few noticed its significance.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first time in the history of west, a major sports venue in the West was taken by a group of people not speaking any kind of Western languages, singing a language from a country which did not exist as late as 1947. In an earlier post I compared BTS's performance at Citi Field to the fall of Chalcedon (the town across the Bosphorus from Constantinople).

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Hj0CXmfCI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Hj0CXmfCI)

&amp;#x200B;

If MacArthur didn't bail the ass of South Korea back in 1950 we would not have to worry about this indignity, but it is just part of a symptom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think that the West should have excluded the rest from participating in Western Civilization right from the start, since no non-Western tradition ultimately has anything to contribute to Civilization. They have somewhat interesting artworks, food, and folklore but whatever they have did not influence the modern world by a single iota.

Charles Murray's Human Achievement has very little to say about non-Europeans, who are given their separate categories. (He gave concessions to Chinese, Japanese and Arabs, and no one else.)

&amp;#x200B;

In 1857, the Sepoys of India revolted, and Britain had a hard time subduing it so it had little forces to conquer Japan, and  decided to keep Japan as a Western Ally. In Jules Verne's 80 Days, every spot in the book touched by Phileas Fogg , basically the major trade routes of the world, was owned by Britain and USA (passing through France and Italy; they see Shanghai but do not actually land on it), except Japan. Already there was a fly in the ointment of the complete domination of the world by the West.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of traditions other than the West have now infiltrated the West, and now Koreans are running around  the world making a mockery of Western tradition. And amazingly hardly a voice is being raised to condemn it.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the cold truth is that while the West can live without the rest, the rest can't live without the West. Soon the weight of the Rest who do not exactly contribute too much to Civilization will be unbearable by the West.

&amp;#x200B;

Some authors forbid their books to be translated in certain languages, but JP allowed the Chinese and Koreans to translate his books to their languages. They will accept his messages in their own image.The last debate on anything was Ron Unz's argument about Asians in Ivy League. It was the final debate which was hot; after that, there has not been an interesting debate, because everything which should have been said has been said. period.

&amp;#x200B;

Chinese political thought ended on 233 BCE, when Han Feitzu, the last person who had anything important to say about Chinese political thought, died. I believe it was John Derbyshire who said the book on Chinese political philosophy only has a few pages after Han Feitzu, since anything after that was just commentaries on previous authors.

&amp;#x200B;

And, in a historical sense, western political thought ended with Yoshihiro "Francis" Fukuyama's End of History. First of all, an Asian saying something about Western Political Philosophy meant the West already had nothing more to say about its political thought, and after Fukuyama nobody has anything to say about neocon politics, which will rule the world for ever, and nobody will ever will. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl, dr, Neocon philosophy is hardwired with today's politics, economics, foreign policy, finances, and anything you can name. It is like the Confucian political thought which permeated everything in Asia up to about 1840, and still holds a huge influence over there although not as much as the old days. In other words, short of an alien invasion, today's political, economic, philosophical, etc structure will stay forever.

&amp;#x200B;

As today's winners will be eternal winners and today's status quo is going to be permanent, some kind of new social contract will probably take place. The new world will be a handful of winners, no more than a few hundred thousands, owning everything; and maybe 10 times that pop attending to their direct needs; and perhaps no more than 500 million people producing resources for them. After all, before Great War, about 4 % of the West's pop(incl Japan), or perhaps 16 million, owned most of the wealth; the rest of the West served them; and the remaining 1.2 billion , as far as civilization was concerned, simply did not exist.

&amp;#x200B;

As biological determinism , empirically proved, becomes more mainstream the winner, the able, etc will treat those who are worse than them much worse, or according to the latter's value. I predict such people will eventually be deemed as subhumans, and as today's winner become transhumans, their paths will diverge forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, JP is the Decartes of today, a bridge to a new world while remaining in the older world. We should make peace with today's permanent social order, and make a new system of thought which will last, probably forever.[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/9kg9ym/oc\_recent\_philosophy\_visualized/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/9kg9ym/oc_recent_philosophy_visualized/)

&amp;#x200B;

Greyenlightenment said the explosion of philosophy is value signaling, but I would like to disagree on his opinion this time.

&amp;#x200B;

Mankind has already seen such explosion of philosophy twice.

&amp;#x200B;

One, Ancient Greece about 405 - 335 BCE.

&amp;#x200B;

Although there were Thales and others, Greek Philosophy reached its height after Athens was decisively defeated by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. Socrates got killed, Plato spent time in Sicily and Aristotle became a tutor to Alex of Macedon. after Alex conquered most of the ancient world, there was not much to say about Greek Philosophy other than regurgitating the words of these masters.

&amp;#x200B;

Two, China during the Warring States about 350-233 BCE

Although Confucious and Lao Tzu lived way before, their ideas were sleeping in the shelves. They had their followers but they were only known to a few.

&amp;#x200B;

However, around 350 BCE, there was an explosion of Chinese Philosophy. A bunch of philosophers, peddling their way of thinking (called A Hundred School of Thoughts), traveled country after country to get adherents.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, like Ancient Greece, it ended after Qin Shihuang (Tsin Sh'ih-Huang) , the First Emperor of China, unified the land on 221 BCE, although it actually ended a bit earlier when , on 233 BCE, Han Feitzu (Han Feizi), the last of the philosophers, was killed by Li Ssu (Li Si), the prime minister of the First Emperor, because the latter decided philosophy has no place in a unified Empire so Feitzu(who was a prince of a country the Emperor wanted to conquer) was a dangerous figure.

======

&amp;#x200B;

Philosophy exploded when the old order died and nobody was sure about what was coming, while there was a huge, permanent change around the corner which everyone wanted to ignore.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, the end of old order suddenly created a lot of formerly wealthy and smarter people now out of a job and position, and it was too late for them to learn a new trade so they went into philosophy. The youths of Athens, now shorn of an empire and lots of estates to manage, flocked to the school of Socrates. Same for China; a lot of smaller kingdoms disappeared when the land was being consolidated into seven major countries, and the nobles of the smaller countries now had to work for the first time in their lives and they became philosophers.

&amp;#x200B;

And, there were the unseen dangers of Macedon and Qin respectively. The philosophers knew something huge, and eternal, was coming but didn't want to actually face it since nothing like that happened in their lifetimes.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Just like ancient Greece and China, the philosophy boom now signifies something huge is coming up, probably Singularity. The unification of the Greek World and China were Singularity events for the people living back then; the first lasted (with some hiccups) until Manzikert on 1054, and the latter, again with some hiccups, lasts to this day (Taiwan was NOT part of China and never considered that way until 1946).

Today's philosophical boom is a last blooming of thinkers, after the old order died on 1991 and something new (Singularity) which has not taken place yet. It will end not too long before Singularity; like Chinese political philosophy who died with the aforementioned Han Feitzu on 233 BCE, today's philosophies will be carved in stone after Singularity which will have no new philosophies until humans (or whatever forms they will take) will evolve into Human 3.0, maybe in a thousand years or so.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, the post-Singularity scholars will be discussing JP, Sam Harris, Tyler Cowan and others for the next 1,000+ years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;Some time ago I discuss that higher intelligence was worth Three SD in terms of wealth. However, it was concluded that a 3 SD wealth was a figure slightly less than a million dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

In the Renaissance and early modern age, it was actually rare for smarter men to marry and leave descendants. That was most propound in England, where Locke, Hobbes, Hume, Adam Smith, and many others died without progenies. Meanwhile, a lot of women who shunned the smarter men to marry nobles, landowners and other wealthier people with less intelligence still have descendants to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point of wealth, money begins to offset the benefits of higher intelligence. Although it is easier for people who are smarter in some aspects to make lots of money, in the end the old money laughs the last as the newer elites are eventually absorbed to the old one.

&amp;#x200B;

Newer tech making one able to play with genetics will not change things, and will actually be more beneficial to people with money but just above-average intelligence (the 115-130 cohort). Someone who owns a property worth $20 million and an IQ of 120 is going to be of a higher status than someone who has an iq of 145 and owes $200,000 as student loans. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a mate, higher intelligence people are less valuable than those who are already wealthy. Whatever money the smarter people might earn, it will be no match to those who can earn a higher amount of passive income without really doing anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

The old novels where the heroine choose the foolish son of a landowner are still true - a smarter but not wealthy person is less valuable indeed. And it will get worse as intelligence enhancement and gene manipulation will make wealthy dullars much smarter, so one does not need intrinsic intelligence - it can be bought.I have a dillemma at the level of the Individual, this subreddit seems to not facilitate higher Being to me, and I wonder how on earth it can for you? Because it's very odd to me that if you take J.P's advice for real, 100% responsibility for reality, you would post as you do here. I have to admit I am not perfect and I have been intending to take full responsibility for a few months since the discovery of existentialism and Being, but I've never gotten to it.

If you don't know what I am talking about, imagine as if reality is not the material world, and that it is not the ground of it all, but that consciousness is. Meaning everything that is occuring right at this moment, Qualia, and so on is the ground. It's a flip in perspective. Then you put an existentialism element into it which puts full responsibility of what's occuring in consciousness at the level of the Individual actions.

A majority of the links and selfposts here are just pointless, what exactly do we need to know all of these things for? We are just being primal chimps hopping from one branch to the next of unmeaningful pleasure, scattering our thoughts building up a deep need of a revelatory experience and change in this community. We're up to no good and the road is leading to a not so shaby-place, if we're not already at that right now.

For me so far I find it comes from not being able to find the ideal way to act and be in an area that's important to me.  
  
The most abstract example of this is trying to deal with anxiety makes me anxious since I don't know how I can think about it so I can improve from it.   
  
I found JBP through asking another broad question like this online so I thought it was worth seeing if anybody can point me to other sources of information that have a helpful view on the topic. I think that all which makes up a human except consciousness is due to brain processes, which ultimately means I think that we have no free will. I was wondering if any of you have accepted this philosophy that you have no free will and what you think of it.

It's clearly proven that this is the case.Is it his preaching of responsibility in general, or is there something about him that uniquely appeals to your ethno-nationalism?

I'm not asking this to be snarky or to make you feel unwelcome. I passionately disagree your worldview but I think everyone should sort themselves out. I'm curious because I've never met any of you in real life so I have no interactions to shape my understanding around.Here I am, wondering whether I should buy a set of books back again, just because they have a blue smudge on the edges. And that is the biggest thought that is keeping me up.

But what is the most relevant thing to me?

To be able to act so that I am able to tell the truth. However, I am unable to tell the truth about many things. I have painted myself in a corner.

--------------------------------------------------------------

1) I am doing a few online courses. However, since I was recovering from a major depression, I did not follow the courses since a long time. And I have not appeared for the examination. I am set to do that. But I have told my parents that I did, and two more examinations will allow me to get the certificate. I have been evading this question since a long time now, and it is exasperating for them as well.

2) My ties with my extended family are on the run low because of me having taken a sabbatical to study. And I have not studied. Most of them wonder if I am unemployed, or unemployable. And that's not far from the truth, but it has vastly different connotations. And I have not given this fact it's due importance.

--------------------------------------------------------------

So these are the two major issues that I have right now. And this probably needs more items to be thought about.

After coming out from the depressive episode, I have only a couple of happy personas, both of which are distracted. In the Petersonian sense, I haven't yet fixed an ideal and worked on it, developed my sub personas into that integral part. I am merely looking at amusing stuff or hanging out with friends as a means to enjoy myself.

However, most importantly, I have been getting some good exercise lately, and that is the only true shining light in my life.

I have had trouble setting up an immediate goal in my life, and it has mostly been impulse driven. I get up late, and then I don't want to spend the rest of the fractured day in studying. I wish to study a full day. I wish to exercise regularly, but I don't want to put up with aberrations with schedule.

So, my first intention is to have daily rituals. One of them is to post here regularly, about having a daily intention and then mapping on to it. Finding out how I did. Ofcourse it is going to get boring, but objective observation is important to reveal insights and some of it should be good.

Secondly, a goal once set is not necessarily rest upon. So, If I say I want to spend 30 hours on a course, I do it right the first day. However, I don't pick up on it from the next day onwards, while it is literally the simplest thing to do - just sit down and clock in some time. NONE of it all is difficult, and I see no reason why it should be, yet, I fail on this. And so, I intend to set another goal here: about focusing on this one goal, and going through it.

I have observed that once I start on the path to improve anything, I get stuck up in trivia. All the jazz that does not matter. Just like deciding whether I should buy a new copy of a book that I already have (just because it has blue spots). I want to have follow through on a major life goal.


---------------------------------------------------------------
So, to repeat, 
1 Create rituals, including one to update the on Reddit daily. (I already have one, to exercise, which is going well. Frequent, but not regular.)
2 Pick one goal, and finish it. (Probably the course). And to add a 3rd one,
3 Take stock of life. Past authoring, present authoring, future authoring, people, things, goals, possibilities, files on my hard discs, cleaning my room.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I should be sleeping by now, so I am out on scheduling. But the goals for tomorrow should be:

1. Exercise
2. Start working on the course again
3. Go out for some time.
4. Start the project that you have received.
5. Think about the rituals. Success: Atleast 3 that are relevant, and simple to describe. 
Throughout history, Civilization was always challenged by Barbarism.

The last great threat against Civilization occurred in 1683, when Poland's King Jan Sobieski saved Vienna from the Turks at the last minute. For this Poland was later divided up by other countries including Austria, which made a joke for the Polish for whom the phrase "Going to save Vienna" now means "do something needless".

But such kind of sacrifices were needed to maintain Civilization.

Nothing is more important than Civilization since  that is the main difference between advancement and barbarism. So, it has to be maintained at all costs.

In my opinion, human lives are not more important than Civilization, since human lives are replaceable while Civilization is not. In the rare cases where Civilization ground to dust, like some parts of Americas, the people returned to Barbarism until the Spaniards reintroduced Civilization by brute force.

We have to be consistently in alert to maintain Civilization and deal accordingly against threats, real or perceived. 

It will be brutal, since the force of those outside Civilization are very numerous, and thankless, as the Vietnam vets found out. But it has to be done.This is the second Day  of my cleaning up blog. 

 

A few highlights that I have uncovered. 

 

    I do like cheap pleasures, and have been looking forward for them. Probably because I have not yet fully articulated a four-five year vision and made a goal out of it. 

    I stayed up through the entire night, and ended up wasting a full day. 

    It is very uncomfortable talking about questions of employment. A full thought out idea of the situation in my head, and being able to articulate is necessary. 

 

Things I set out to do yesterday: 

    Start the course 

    Work on a project that I got 

    Exericse 

    Go out 

    Think of a few rituals to keep. 

 

I did all of them. Exercise couldn't happen because an unexpected meeting ate in the time that I had, and waking up at 3 PM and then starting the day at 5 PM did not make sense. I lost a lot of time there. 

 

This is another pattern, that is important. It could be a persona, or a behaviour pattern. That I have to get rid of. This is  the careless, worriless person who spends energetic, pleasurable states of mind in browsing sports and music. 

 

That is what took two hours of my time. To be precise: this was not  mindless browsing done while being dead inside. I really had energy, and enthusiasm. It was misdirected. There was the lack of intention. 

 

I spent an hour and a half (half an hour more than scheduled) on the course. The course did not move further so much. 

 

Here is one more pattern: That of getting diffused. Spending inordinate amount of time trying to configure software and asking yourself what the different tools are for. 

 

Anyways: 

Course, started, but not much work done. 

Exercise: Wasted two hours after getting up, got up late because I stayed up through the entire night, and then a meeting came up. COULD NOT DO THIS 

Project: I started it. So that is new. 

Think of a few rituals to keep. So yes, the rituals are blogging on reddit. Scheduling. Updating on HabitRPG. 

 

What will I do tomorrow? It depends on the question, what are the things that I must do to survive? 

 

    Finish up the project 

    Spend a little time on the course. 

    Start the process of examining and changing beliefs. 

    Lay out the different people in my life, and looking at my responsibilities with them. Examine all of it. 

    Perform a check up of all projects I have to be doing, assimilate them, and start working on them.  

 

Out of these, I MUST: 

    Finish the project to earn money. 

    Start the process of examining and changing beliefs (Chakras) 

    Spend time on the course. 

    Start HabitRPG, add all necessary habits there, once and for all. 

    Exercise TL;DR:  

 

    After making goals for the day, I ended up waking up at 2 PM, in a sad state of mind, and completely indecisive. The only thing I achieved was exercising. 

    I need a ritual for getting out of that state of mind. And also a way to sleep and wake up early. 

    The entire focus on confronting tougher questions and facing the entire family and the world, that is a different beast that yet remains. 

 

 

This day was an absolute disaster. Here is how the schedule went on: 

 

    Got up at 8, after sleeping at 3 AM. Slept, again, till 10. Then didn't wake up till 2 PM. The entire day was just fucked up after that. 

    After waking up, there was a weird sort of sadness going around. It made me feel unproductive. It made me feel just bad. And I did not do anything till 3-4 hours because of that. 

 

 

So, from the 5 goals yesterday that I had, I have done absolutely zero, except exercise. 

 

Exercise in itself was a very weird experience. It was already going to be 7 PM. So I decided I shall actually go out and complete exercise before starting anything else. 

 

The whole affair took another hour. And I was completely indecisive about how to do all of this. 

 

And the day just exposed me to one of my own failings: Indecisiveness, sadness, inability to change state of mind/matter. 

 

Compared to two days back, I am much better today because of the approach of ritually scheduling and posting an update on the Internet. I will go back and make the HabitRPG routine. And have that as a place to keep track of all of my little habits. 

 

Highlights: 

 

The problems I discovered yesterday were: 

    A strong sub persona that seeks out cheap pleasures. 

    Spending too much of valuable energetic state in aimless trivia on the internet. 

 

The problems that I have discovered today are: 

    Sleeping too late, waking up after 10-11 hours. 

    Strong feeling of sadness/meh mood that does not let the day begin; thereby wasting the entire day as I wake up at 2 PM and get nothing done. This is a HUGE issue. 

 

Solution: 

 

    There's a technique that I have come across, which is NAC. Its roots are in the Petersonian maxim that your greatest motivator is your ideal, and fear of failure will keep you from procrastinating too much. (NAC = Neuro Associative Conditioning) 

    I am taking the protocol from a book, and conditioning that the sad mood is a pattern that will make me fail. Will also come up with a ritual that will help me get out of that slump. 

 

Rituals: 

 

Now we have a few more: 

    One to get me out of a slump 

    One is scheduling in the night 

    Meditation 

    Regularly updating my progress here 

    Tracking daily tasks on Habitica. And maintaining a clean streak. 

 
Goal for tomorrow:

Carry over:

- Complete the project
- Start the Udacity course
- Start the belief changing process So I realised I wasn't actually cleaning my room a month ago, I was just half heartedly making my bed and I thought that it was ok. On reflection, there's quite a bit more to it which needs to be done to receive the benefits. 

Start by cleaning your room and aim to keep it tidy as much of the time as possible. I mean clean it properly. Sort out your clothes, make your bed, scrub the carpet/mop floor, hoover it, wipe down all the surfaces and the walls. Then declutter your stuff, place all your paperwork in files, store thing in a neat and organised way and buy a small waste basket (empty as soon as it's full). Make sure you have fresh bed linen and change it often. Oh and no food plates or cups to be left in their overnight. Open your window every now and the, even if it's freezing, it really helps freshen it up. 

Also, over the winter months, you may find you get condensation that can cause mould. This can be avoided by opening your window every so often, not leaving your clothes to dry in there and by buying some cheap moisture captures from Amazon. Many people have told me that I might have been overthinking things a bit. So, let's back off and take note of the good. 

 

I had a 1.5+ hour long call with a woman I am dating. 

I spent &gt;1.5 hour on working on the project that I had. 

I actually exercised, and meditated. Both at the same day. 

I had a good time outside. 

 

So, what were the failures? 

 

    Getting up and taking a couple of hours to get ready. 

    Having commitments such that I don't have any long stretch of time to work on a given goal. 

    Being distracted when happy/giddy. Just focus and have a good time doing whatever it is that you are doing. 

 

Goals for tomorrow:  

    I took an hour for the work that I did and finished some 3 articles. Hopefully I should be able to get the other 5 done in 90 minutes. So, once I wake up, I should be able to get that done in 3 focused bursts. 

    The Udacity coursework has been pending since two days now. I think I need to get a handle on that. Ideally, do one module each. 

    Start with the Belief Changing process. And use that. Properly. This also has been pending since quite some time now. 

    Actually sit down and make a goal for the entire week. And keep it. 

    Exercise. Run. 

 

Some observations: 

    It is good to update regularly. 

    Making daily goals is much better, then having a long goal that you keep putting off. 

    I have not yet divided my long goals in specific short goals. Maybe that will become relevant fast. 

 Same group now saying that this incident means they need an increase in funding. Hmm.....and the roadblock, as you guys have mentioned, is simply lack of a proper sleep schedule. The last week or ten days have been irregular sleep schedule infected. And that does nasty things. You wake up at the wrong time, you don't know if you can exercise or not. ANd if you do then you break your productive time up in useless chunks.

Anyways, today is god send. I slept at 11 in the morning. And woke up at 4, still feeling unrested. It has been an unproductive evening, but I am glad that I have a chance to sleep on time.

So, I am not fretting. It was not a day wasted, per se, because I went out for a run, and challenged myself there. So I did fight a small battle and had a small victory.

Summing up the days so far....

- I first discovered I need a few rituals to concentrate. So I respect posting on reddit and scheduling. I also respect meditation.
- I have discovered my own pleasure seeking persona can be a roadblock, and so I have a ritual to remind me that it is road to destruction.
- From getting no days at all in working, I have come to expect myself to work 1-2 hours a day. All in 5 days :-)
- Most importantly, I feel confident that every change I am making, is contributing to my life, and is permanent. It is not a whimsical approach to changing.  It is coming from a place of dedication, rather than desperate trial and error. It took years to come here, but now that it's here, I feel no problem.

So. There. I hope I may sleep better. :-) 

And yes, I did run 8 sprints of 250 m. today.Day 6 | Oops I did it Again

The last two days have been one step backward.

Yesterday and today, both, the only productive thing that I could get done was a bit of exercising. However today, it took me around 2 hours to finish sets that should take around 45 min to an hour.

Yesterday, I made a choice, that I will sleep, and wake up on time. I slept at around midnight, but I woke up thirteen hours later.

Most importantly, I failed again, at picking myself up from a bad day, and just spent the entire day that way, till It was too late and I had to make a decision whther I want to exercise or work. I exercised, and did not work. This meant, I spent time from 2 PM onwards to 7 PM, doing nothing. I have no idea why.

It has been two days now since I last worked. And this is getting into a worrisome pattern.

Now, it's a matter of real importance.

And I also need to sleep now, and wake up tomorrow, on time.

What dilemmas.

The single biggest task: of having a really fixed time of sleeping and getting up, is not being done, and that's frustrating.

------------------------------

Task for tomorrow:

Get up, exercise.

Complete half an hour on each project first, to get your head moving. TL:DR: 

 

    Third day straight where the only productive work done was exercising 

    Did nothing, really, for  11 hours after waking up (except getting errands done.) Will need to look at the pattern of spending time here. (More listed below) 

    I am spending  12 hours asleep. Something is wrong here. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Where do I even start? I slept at 4 Am yesterday and woke up at 4 PM today.  

 

This is VERY problematic now, because I am NOT REALLY getting lazy. My own body is getting in the way and I do not understand what is going on. 

 

On the front of productivity, I did exercise and run, so I kept that consistency going. However, after waking up at 4, this whole ritual took till 8 PM. And I do not know or understand how I could spend 4 hours in doing this. Maybe I was too unhurried, too relaxed about all of this. I will have to see. It does get frustrating too. 

 

It is now close to 2:30 AM. So, basically 11 hours have passed since i have woken up; and the only productive time I have used has been around 100 minutes or so. 

 

One of the biggest problems come from deciding whether I sleep and then wake up and do the work; or stay awake and do the work. Neither of them works. 

 

This is my story right now and this HAS been my story since years now. Caught up on a single project, unable to work on it due to a bad sleep schedule, and on repeat for days now. 

 

It puts my entire life on hold, for ALWAYS. 

 

I am trying to silently determine to wake up at 8 AM today, and hope that it all works out however. And do the work however possible.  THAT is the only way I am going to get anything done, be determined internally to wake up at a given time, force myself to wake up then. 

 

I think one more possibility is that I am too relaxed in the evening. After I come back home. And in this relaxed, happy mood I end up browsing the net trivially or reading random stuff. And this exposure to a screen costs me badly in terms of sleep time. 

 

8-10 PM also happens to be a good time to hang out with friends, and I have hardly resisted that option. Getting too close to it without doing anything would mean that I waste away that time. Nothing good happens after coming back home either. Post midnight time has also gone wasted. The one time I tried working hard post midnight, I stayed up till 5 AM, couldn't sleep any further after that, stayed up till 11 AM, woke up at 4 PM, did nothing the entire day and slept again at 11 PM to wake up the next day at 3 PM. THIS IS FUCKED UP. 

 

This has to go. I will give this today's time, but come back to it tomorrow after my major work is done. And give these patterns their due attention. 

 

This is slowly eating my life away. 

 

 A week back, I started out by trying to gather many thoughts in one place. Now it is all focused on one objective: getting some good steady time on a project that I intend to do.

The chief hindrance for that is a very unsteady sleep schedule. For example, the last time I slept, it was 4 AM two days back, I woke up at 4 PM yesterday and have not slept so far. It is midnight now.

I have been recommended the war of art. I will read it. That is my task for the night. Day tomorrow as well, maybe.

So, it seems that I am about to make a breakthrough. Not only is my sleep an issue, but unconscious resistance also is an issue, which makes my time just pass by without me even noticing. :-)  Hat tip to /u/sometimesometimes for recommending war of art to me after finding the underlying issue.

I think the entire process of logging the days was a very interesting exercise, and it has already given me many insights, plus one clear direction about taming internal resistance.

If you have seen my other posts, you'd see that I would go through an entire day doing an hour or two's worth of work without knowing where all the time went. And then screw up my sleep, to waste the coming day as well. Present focus is on it. :-) I read through the two parts of the three part book on the "War of Art".

It seems I just need to cultivate an attitude of getting work done no matter what. Because even though a fixed sleep routine is part of my work to do, I still generally had 3-4 hours everyday in the last 5 days that I did no work.

Where did these hours go? I can tell myself that if I started at 7 am, then I would get 8-10 hours of work done everyday. However, I am not waking up at 7. So, what's left? Squeezing work out everyday. And I did not have that attitude. My attitude was to wait out one day and go ahead. This has led to lost time in life. TOO MUCH LOST TIME.

But now I know the answer, I just need an attitude: A mantra: My work is not done. My work is not done. My work is not done. My work is not done. 

And to get there as fast as possible. And if something stops me, be really serious with me and ask, WHY? WHY do I need to do something else other than this?Ihad to run a half marathon. And I needed to sleep.
I couldn't. So, I stayed up and went to run the marathon. Then, came back and slept.
Woke up in the evening at 4, I guess, but haven't done much after that.

So, yes, the attitude is there. Work also is there.

The idea to do is to find a war to fight, tomorrow morning. And then to do well. War is to get really good work done. Take a hard look at things. Sleep on time. 

We are getting ther, but not quite there yet.I believe it was Epictetus, a former slave, who invented the concept of free will. It was the product of his wishful thinking that the mind was free even when the body was not (Epictetus was 'freed' because his master broke his leg (he limped for the rest of his life), which made him useless as a slave, and the master 'compensated' by getting rid of him), which led to the concept of free will.

Free will had its uses in the past. 

However, as the deadly efficiency of today's IT systems and financial structure have eliminated almost all variables, we are entering a deterministic society. Today's winners will be winners forever, and today's losers will probably be in the way out.

The world won't change, there will not be a reset which overturns all structure, and the world will progress as it is forever, barring a huge natural disaster which will 'seriously challenge' civilization.

People will be free to decide what to eat (according to their budgets) for dinner, but they won't be able to decide the destiny of their lives which will be proscribed by their ability and personality.

End of Free Will, which is coming, is not a bad thing since it diminishes reckless behavior, and also ends people wasting their resources for things which won't work out.

Determinism is wining again, and a deterministic society is more efficient because people know their places and higher-ability people have more power, rights and privileges. 

Taking free will out of question, so people who should not exercise free will would not be doing it, will lead to a better and more advanced world.I woke slept at 4 30. Woke up at 7 15. Stayed up. Tried and do some hour's worth of work. Couldn't do more than an hour's work.

Slept at 2 PM, got up at 7 20 PM.

And then pretty much did nothing.

Wars to fight? Well,
1) Get up
2) In the time that you do get after you wake up at 7, should've fought the war to go work. Instead, chose to go out and come at 11 PM. Then, did nothing, again. (It's 1 40 now.)

So,

What wars do I fight tomorrow?

1) First, get up, stay up. Fight, do the work.
2) DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT, go out unless you have put some amount of work earlier on.
3) Try and think about the last few days of work.Ethics isn't about Right &amp; Wrong. Ethics is about what is permissible. I fear Jordan Peterson may herald a move towards a rational violence as much as he may herald a move towards a rational religiosity. Europeans have always found a legal way to justify their conflicts with finding a way to excuse means to justify an end but it all amounts to the same, killing in the name of reason. I saw an interview with JP and someone who seemed to be his ideological nemesis on CBC News.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiijS_9hPkM

JP seemed utterly intransigent toward his counterpart in the interview and I have to say I did get a strong impression of him exhibiting homophobia. The two professors repeatedly referred to each other exclusively using surnames in way that felt extremely hostile. It really felt like two people who wanted to fight each other but wouldn't for admirable reasons. However, despite their best intentions these two highly educated and thoughtful people couldn't disguise how they felt toward each other.

Another thing that gives me cause for concern over JP is his description of the of the clash between Lauren Southern and an activist and the actions of someone who came to be referred to derisively as 'Smugglypuff'.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuJyEqbC3ts

We can't see Lauren Southern and we can't hear the exchange but I have seen it in another video and Lauren Southern is obviously taunting the activist in a very provocative and I would say cruel way which caused the activist to respond in the way (he(sheesh!)) did. 'Smugglypuff' can then be seen contriving in a provocative way a 'witness' account contradicting what the other side would say was unprovoked violence against Southern. Really, this whole situation would be ridiculous if it weren't so heavily topical. What bothered me about Peterson's account is he offers what I think, given his status, a pitiful reproach to the Alt-Right by saying he charitably found a "tiny bit of sympathy" for the guy who'd attacked Lauren Southern. Lauren Southern was plainly being bullying and Peterson excused this by not recognising it publicly as he should do if he wants to claim intellectual integrity. I bet JP would say that, in essence, bullying is wrong but could find virtue in it because it can compel the sensitive passive person to discover that violence is a legitemate means of political expression. The Alt-Right already know this, they know that bullying can elevate them above the mediocre and that violence, though frowned on in public, **is** a grudgingly accepted means to an end.

Peterson himself said he wouldn't have a shred of respect for a man he sensed wouldn't fight him under any circumstances, but he refuses to compromise so someone who plainly lacks the constitution to fight could live with some dignity. I have a quiet fear that he may be providing the intellectual superstructure to a blossoming neo-fascism.It was  days ago that I tried and articulated three goals for a day. And I realized my problem was sleeping through the day.

Now, somehow, I managed to wake up at 11 AM, which is earlier than all other days.

However, I did not manage more than half an hour of actual work today as well - as I got bogged down into writing stuff that I was angry about. And also discussing Peterson's univ. because I found it very interesting.

I lost the war today, even though I made a few minor victories. I exercised, I ran 3.5 KM at &lt;5:30  m/km, and I articulated myself. But I still did not commit to a professional outcome.

And my mother has been worried about the online courses, since I know that the material will only be available for ten more days and I have to finish the course by then and get certificates.

I lied to her that I had completed the course, and now I am caught up here in a project that I am finishing half an hour at a time.

In fact, given this day's division, I was fucking stupid at not prioritizing anything.According to JBP speed would be his big problem with YouTube, as he is a faster reader, but he kind of dismissed this on his own due to the fact that many are watching videos at 2-3x the speed.

If he was educating himself all over again but at today's age, I think he would just watch his own lectures. I mean sure, if they weren't there you had to figure all of this stuff on your own, and thus you had to read the books of giants. But it seems to me as all you really need to know is in his videos, roughly speaking. The books he recommends are simply the shoulders of giants he are standing on, and it doesn't seem necessary to me at all. Frankly, a waste of time. Why should you read the Gulag Archipelago, aren't you just preaching to the choir of your own certainty on the subject? The same goes for Heidegger, etc. They just say stuff you already know from watching YouTube, or at least the most important bits.

So I question whether it's **GOOD** and **EFFECTIVE** to read books, when you've already watched lots of lectures and have some idea of what's being put forth.

There's literally 103 books on his list. https://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/10/great-books/

Are you really going to read them?What is the biggest highlight of the day? I woke up at 7 AM and stayed up. And then ended up wasting time discussing some concepts on Reddit as well as obsessing over configuring media playlists on a computer. This brings me to two of my biggest time sinks: 

 

    Obsessing over trivial details like what file/tool/program to use 

    Getting drained in conversations about controversial matters. 

 

I have vowed NEVER to do that again, EVER. And hopefully that's a part of me that I know now and understand well. 

 

However, I slept from 12 30 to 5 PM, and have done nothing since then on the actual work. It is 6 30 AM the next day now. 

 

I did exercise, once when I got up in the morning, and an upper body workout after I had my complete sleep. 

 

The war still remains. I need just one good day.  

 

The following things await me after this: 

    My date, who'll visit me here in my town 

    Udacity courses 

    Plans for January 

    Plans for employment 

 

 

Currently, I am hopeless, in a way with my level of sleeplessness. And bad circadian ryhtm. Maybe I'll go read a book on insomnia and protect my world with  the care I give ANYTHING else.   It's a key realization to come to terms with the fact that the future and the past is a construct and it's all taking place now with change taking place.

It puts the responsibility for Being, the individual not at an imagined future but right now, and always, in a binary fashion. Either you're sorted or your not. When you're sorted you're always doing the highest potential good right now. It's not what's best for you, your family, your society, today, this week, this month, one year, five years and so on. It's that but every second, and thus the other measurements of time become irrelevant when it comes to this.

When we talk of the Kingdom of God, and when you're witnessing meaning, it boils down to this. There should also be very few if any thoughts, provided you are physically healthy, well-fed and rested. If you do nothing, it might appear as there is time because you think you're no longer present and then become present, when in fact you're always present except a different state of Being akin to daydreaming occurs. This is common in intellectuals and a complete waste of time, sometimes so much you become literally blind.

So it's always now, but we inhabit different states of Being, and there's change happening. This is but a fact of Being, and so too, that time is but a construct.Ever since Communism was discredited and America prevailed in the ideological struggle of the Cold War, the world has been struggling to rediscover it's moral compass. Post-Modernism is how this period has been characterised and it is plain now that what it amounts to is comparable to the world being a pinball bouncing around an ethical minefield. At the macro level, geopolitical turmoil and economic catastrophes have created instability on a scale never before seen. Closer to earth social progressives have increasingly fragmented society the more they've tried to bind the divisions. The only place the world seems to make sense is in the utterly imaginary world of movies. I suspect it was always this way but we live in Reality and Reality has always intruded on the world we try to shape according to our wills.

Frankly I wish Communism could've been made to work. I believe it may have been the apex of human civilisation and perhaps now we are on the cusp or descending curve of our decline. The Socialists at least had a working model of how society *should* be structured, whereas America, as the herald of Freedom, only had, ...well, Freedom. Freedom as a concept is vague with philosophical arrangements coalesce between the Liberty to act as one wishes in an arena where one can be free from the impositions of others. Frankly I think it's a phantom and I believe we are turning the clock back to an age comparable to the pre-Enlightenment era. In fact I predicted America, as it was, would fall because having defined itself as the bulwark against tyrannical government in the shape of Soviet Russia, when Communism fell, it lost a defining aspect of it's Self.

But what now?

America having lost a crucial element of it's Identity seems to have picked a fight with Islam. I seems to me that America, or more accurately the philosophy that underpins it requires an enemy, for without one it wouldn't be able to sustain itself. Being the last bastion of European hegemony in a world where much of the former colonial powers have been kicked out, it now seems to be pushing what in essence it always seemed to be, an attempt to define reality along the lines of racial superiority. So will it come to pass that all pretense will finally be shrugged off?  And in an attempt to cement the artificially constructed social identity of Whiteness, and in the absence of authentic Universal Values, will it openly and finally admit this motivation and embark on a global genocide?

I admire Jordan Peterson's deference to religious myths as a means to living a productive life and healthy self-esteem but I am sceptical about much of what appears to be his motivation. For example I can't accept that one can choose to yield to the will of God and keep one's sense of free agency. He speaks about the meaning of the word Israel, and how it means to Struggle with God but I haven't heard him talk about how Islam means to 'surrender' to the will of God. It could be that somewhere between these two positions we can find our True identities but Doc Peterson hasn't talked about this, I hope he will. In the meantime I fear that America's hubris in engaging in a vast conflict that really smells like an end time scenario IS a smack in the face of God and it will incur biblical ramifications. I suspect we may even be seeing this now as America is wracked with problems and Trump's big achievement has been to increase tax allowances for the rich.

It's just not feasible to presume one can conceit a belief and faith in God in order to alleviate suffering. You either believe in God or you don't, you can't *pretend*.

Yes, I did realize I was fighting a battle with my erratic sleep schedule.

However, I realize I had NO PLAN whatsoever to sleep on time. Wow. That is just so weird.

I bought a book this morning, Say Good night to insomnia.

And there is a section in there, about "relaxation response". It says that your mind can take your body into a different state if you know how. So, I will try and practice this exercise, which is essentially a meditation.

In other news, my date will come around here and I have time to prepare for that. Will have to discuss how we aim to take it forward once I move out.

My parents went off on a tizzy today, they were so shook. Tired of other people meddling about my unemployment - which is technically true, but it's true that I am studying, and no one is buying that.

My father bluntly told me that he does not have high expectations from the courses that I am talking about. He doesn't even believe they are worth anything and he doesn't even know if I have finished them.

On top of this, I have to deal with finishing all these courses in the next few days, because surprise, surprise! I have to finish the coursework before 31st Dec! So, that's another trouble that I am in.

These are the battles I will have to fight.

This is the state of affairs.

---------------------------------------------------

Well, atleast, I ran 5 km today. And that takes me to 68 kms in the last 30 days.

This is the biggest attitudinal shift that I have had. I have been running on and off for two years now, but never such long distance with such frequency. 

Whenever I picked an activity up, I had a voice inside tell me that you will never make this a regular habit  and can't get anything done. Now I know, know for sure, that this is for life.

This habit is for life. Whatever I am doing, I am not doing it as a fad, but to contribute to my life for the years to come.

Now if only I win this battle for my circadian rhythm.

Highlights:

- I read the book on insomnia, learnt about the relaxation response. Did it twice, I slept twice.
- Today, it took me little time to get down to exercising. Finished three huge sets. Even completed one that's supposed to take 36 minutes in 12 minutes. (Legit, just reduced the recovery time.)
- And that's about it?

I slept at 4 AM, but unlike everyday, today I slept by shutting the computer down and trying to relax. It was unnerving, but I felt lovely after a while. I did not even know I was asleep. Until I woke up at 7 20 to run water pumps for the home. I knew I had to sleep back again, but couldn't fall asleep for three more hours. When I did, I did at 11 30, waking up at 3 30.

What does this mean? The relaxation response works. My own habit, my sacrifice that I have to make is to shut the computer down. And make time to relax. And use that relaxation to sleep.

So, I have exercised, learnt a new habit - hopefully for life. (Long term, I will have to solidify these habits before I can take up more stress. That's a strict condition I have to put on myself.)

But the interesting bit is, when I woke up in the morning, abruptly, 3 hours just passed me by, while I was restless. (Until the relaxation exercise finally kicked in.)

After I woke up, I did a few chores and had a few conversations. But it was still 8 PM (4 hours) before I finished exercises and the chores. At 10 30, I had an outing and then I came back. Since then, it has been another 2:30 hours, out of which I had a conversation with my date for quite some time.

So, the game here is, I am valuing consistent exercise time above the work that I am supposed to complete, and I am letting the real work dominate my choices.

I was exercising while I was watching Maps of Meaning. JP said two things:

- If you have many hard things to do, your brain will give you a hard thing to do and perform but not the hardest. So the tougher part of your life will remain unattended. But you will still get some kick out of doing the seemingly hard task. And that's hwo procrastination makes you feel good about yourself.
- Your conscience is not perfect, and you have to train it, while talking to it.

The first part is true, even if I am at fault. Out of a waking time of 10 hours so far, I have managed zero on the actual work. Granted it would be very easy if I wake up on time and sleep on time, but still, this is pathetic.

The second part is true too. I have no inner voice telling me what to do. I haven't trained one. I have drowned out the conscience (at least while making choices of my work) over a decade long spiral downwards. And I have to train my conscience.

So, now, what will I do? I will hopefully  spend an hour on the project. Then relax and sleep,

And use this data, to understand everything in context. I think a good lookback and tracking the progress so far is also due.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: I have done it :-) I am halfway through completing this project. :-) I have worked on it for the last two hours and there has been some progress here, completing first draft of all the listicles that I have to write.
First I have to apologize for my low English level, don't be rude

I'm sure to have answered just as accurately as possible, and while I agree with the result I'm just going to lean over the extroversion result, 

EXTRAVERSION	24	
..Friendliness	42	
..Gregariousness    48	
..Assertiveness	7	
..Activity Level	6	
..Excitement-Seeking	32	
..Cheerfulness	55

And I found it pretty low 

The final result is the average of all the facets I get it, however I found it unfair lmao 
While I've hardly had any problem being sociable cheerful and funny in my lifetime ( I don't remember having experienced the "Overload" of the typical introvert because of being around people too much in the past, however my low activity suggests it not being abnormal lmao but don't judge quickly) I still score damn low on that trait 



When checking the facet you can see I'm nearly a turtle-paced person and low assertive (but probably not that much tho), which I agree with 

However even as such, I feel kind of extrovert, speaking in an authentic way I feel good around people and having fun, I don't encounter difficulty having fun to a party, even tho attending the party is, I must say, not always my favorite moment (I'm a lazy ass and agree again with the result) and 'Im not solicitating (sorry if the word doesn't exist) social interaction, tho I truly enjoy it

Maybe because the definition has been flawed all over the internet and people seriously introverted wrote these article and book themselves

Again, I'm almost fine doing nothing (not all time because I don't want to hit depression) most of the time, low-pace life is convenient to me

Also I doubt about my cheerfulness lvl I expected it to be a little higher if comparing with all the person I know on my island (yeah New caledonia is not that huge), what is frightening with the Big five is just how much some people can overate their own vision of themselves and you find yourself being lower than you expected to be because the result are based on the global population results'


So again which aspect should I look ? Global result or facets of the trait ?Freedom is a paradox. As a basis for a system of organising society it is vague and elusive. Is there even a functioning definition? No one is 'Free', everyone is limited in their actions by many factors. All that one can truthfully have is a *sense* of Freedom. But does that necessitate a blissful and willful ignorance? In fact one can *feel* a sense of freedom most especially when one curtails another's. We do this all the time from pushing in queues to unseating the heads of states we don't like.

It seems to me that we are being fooled by the use of this word. No one would openly condemn freedom, you'd be regarded as a monster. But it's a fucking horrible anathema that this word is used as an eternal get out of jail card, most especially by America, in the name of the revolting carnage that's been sown relentlessly in these early years of the 21st Century.


Universal Values are incoherent. Universality can only exist as a Moral absolute and we can only function in a subjective Ethical way. Universal Values are a hashtag designed to persuade, more specifically 'fool', the general public that our leaders are acting in the name of 'Right'. How strange it is that those who claim to be justified by Universal Values are now mooting that Bashar al-Assad has a legitemate claim to govern Syria. It wasn't that they were shown to be in error, no, it was because the proxy armies that were attacking the Syrian regime have been comprehensively beaten by Syrian and Russian forces.

The Ethical framework of any society is established by violence. Prevailing in conflict is absolutely imperative, not because it proves one's moral or ethical superiority, but because if you lose the fight you must accept you are wrong which is bullshit of course.
TL;DR:  

 

&gt;    I am too slow, with little sense of urgency when working, and this costs me a lot of time everyday. Between two activities I lose valuable time. A pattern that I have discovered. 
    
&gt;    I am not sleeping until I finish the eight articles.

&gt;    I have conquered sleeping to a single bit: I can introduce relaxation, and I will sleep. The next hurdle is excess arousal. I need to dampen arousal and induce a relaxation response. 

&gt;    I am extroverted but somewhat unskilled in talking to friends. Also I feel that my driving skills are also shameful, and I feel that I want to master them. 

&gt;    7 am sleeping,  6 PM waking up finally, with intermittent tasks done like Lunch and morning exercise routine, seeing people off. Still, 11 hours gone where, I do not know. 

&gt;    6-8 was the only productive work done: exercising. 

&gt;    NAC works: I woke up, and I realized that I have a terrible need to wake up there and then, otherwise I will be betraying myself. And so I woke up, and then I exercized. 

&gt;    I am too slow at getting things done, sometime, and I lose valuable time when I am not rushing to get things done. I displayed that mindset a few days back when I rushed a set of exercise to meet friends in time. But I need this attitude, ALWAYS, when I am working. Unfrenzied urgency. Even this writeup I took &gt; 1 hour to finish, because I got distracted in between. 

&gt;    I think that's it. I need to manage my time more graphically. Sleeping too. I want to employ a spreadsheet for this business. Will start doing this soon. Probably make a web form out of it as well. Or use toggl, maybe. 

 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 

 

Sleeping on time works. But when there's a lot of arousal, we need some way to settle down. A microroutine. 

 

Everything works. Which incidents were time wasting, though? 

 

    8 ‚Äì 10 

    10 ‚Äì 1 : Again, really. WHAT did I do during this time? I lost the war. 

    The state that made me lose? Think of it. Think of it simply. A simple case of being amused by trivialities. A computer which is not sorted. A computer which can produce an endless state of distraction. 

    There is a proper state that made me lose here, which is, basically, being amused in front of the computer. 

 

I had a couple of observations about myself though. When picking friends up at a railway station, I was struck by something. Think of a naive soldier going to war and then having PTSD. This is because he doesn't have a model of the world internalized in his prefrontal cortex that allows him to understand how people can be so evil as they are in war.  

 

And that is what I felt over there with my friends. I was feeling a bit dumb, and viscerally stupid ‚Äì VISCERALLY stupid, when I discovered that people could be comfortable around each other but I had trouble getting comfortable initially. That skill of identifying a person, reading a person and then talking very casually, without, without hammering them with ideas they don't want to talk about : being very casual, comfortable and knowing what comfort is. That is a state I ought to be in. And that is what I will work towards. This is what I have to work for. 

 

Regarding work, I failed.  

 

Slept at 7 am in the morning, but I need to invent a microroutine that I can damp my arousal down and then invoke the relaxation response so that I can sleep. 

 

I got a mail from the people I have been working with who said that they have been waiting eleven days now for the work, and it did not get done, at all. 

 

This is the second time it has happened. The last time it happened, I did not allow myself to do anything, locked myself up in a room and did not get out till the work was done. However, then I procrastinated so much that for 14 days straight I did nothing. NOTHING. Woke up. Slept. Amused myself. THEN after being tired of my own shit, I woke up and did not sleep till I finished the work and sent it in. 

 

So I repeated another pattern: that of taking up some work and then taking DAYS to even get started on any work with it. WHY? Because probably I have ZERO skills of getting any work done, planning or a routine that allows me to work productively. 

 

What else? Well, I did feel stupid when no one asked me to drop them to the station, because they don't trust my driving. Or they have different dominance heirarchies establishd already ‚Äì and I don't belong there. I will have to establish a solid identity at driving hard. But there's time for that. Professor Peterson needs to address the elephant in the room that is Race. Race is the existential dilemma that faces the civilised world in the post Cold War era and the ghoul hiding in America's cloak of Freedom.#TheWhiteRaceisaMeme- Specifically, how important is it to be White in America?

- What does this meme Identity say about those who claim it?

- What does it mean to be Black and what does that meme identity say about those who identify with it?

- Is there anyone here who denies these Identities?

- If you deny them, how do you Identify?I had come across a link to an online google doc a couple of days ago, which facilitated collective notetaking from JBP's lectures. I can not find it right now. Does anyone have a link to the online doc?Let us contrast King‚Äôs identity politics with the version taught in universities today. There is a new variant that has swept through the academy in the last five years. It is called intersectionality. The term and concept were presented in a 1989 essay by Kimberl√© Crenshaw, a law professor at UCLA, who made the very reasonable point that a black woman‚Äôs experience in America is not captured by the summation of the black experience and the female experience. She analyzed a legal case in which black women were victims of discrimination at General Motors, even when the company could show that it hired plenty of blacks (in factory jobs dominated by men), and it hired plenty of women (in clerical jobs dominated by whites). So even though GM was found not guilty of discriminating against blacks or women, it ended up hiring hardly any black women. This is an excellent argument. What academic could oppose the claim that when analyzing a complex system, we must look at interaction effects, not just main effects?

But what happens when young people study intersectionality? In some majors, it‚Äôs woven into many courses. Students memorize diagrams showing matrices of privilege and oppression. It‚Äôs not just white privilege causing black oppression, and male privilege causing female oppression; its heterosexual vs. LGBTQ, able-bodied vs. disabled; young vs. old, attractive vs. unattractive, even fertile vs. infertile. Anything that a group has that is good or valued is seen as a kind of privilege, which causes a kind of oppression in those who don‚Äôt have it. **A funny thing happens when you take young human beings, whose minds evolved for tribal warfare and us/them thinking, and you fill those minds full of binary dimensions. You tell them that one side of each binary is good and the other is bad. You turn on their ancient tribal circuits, preparing them for battle. Many students find it thrilling; it floods them with a sense of meaning and purpose.**

And here‚Äôs the strategically brilliant move made by intersectionality: all of the binary dimensions of oppression are said to be interlocking and overlapping. America is said to be one giant matrix of oppression, and its victims cannot fight their battles separately. **They must all come together to fight their common enemy, the group that sits at the top of the pyramid of oppression: the straight, white, cis-gendered, able-bodied Christian or Jewish or possibly atheist male. This is why a perceived slight against one victim group calls forth protest from all victim groups.** This is why so many campus groups now align against Israel. Intersectionality is like NATO for social-justice activists.

This means that on any campus where intersectionality thrives, conflict will be eternal, because no campus can eliminate all offense, all microaggressions, and all misunderstandings. This is why the use of shout-downs, intimidation, and even violence in response to words and ideas is most common at our most progressive universities, in the most progressive regions of the country. **It‚Äôs schools such as Yale, Brown, and Middlebury in New England, and U.C. Berkeley, Evergreen, and Reed on the West Coast. Are those the places where oppression is worst, or are they the places where this new way of thinking is most widespread?**

Let me remind you of the educational vision of the Founders, by way of E.D. Hirsch: ‚ÄúThe American experiment . . . is a thoroughly artificial device designed to counterbalance the natural impulses of group suspicions and hatreds . . . This vast, artificial, trans-tribal construct is what our Founders aimed to achieve.‚Äù **Intersectionality aims for the exact opposite: an inflaming of tribal suspicions and hatreds, in order to stimulate anger and activism in students, in order to recruit them as fighters for the political mission of the professor.** The identity politics taught on campus today is entirely different from that of Martin Luther King. It rejects America and American values. It does not speak of forgiveness or reconciliation. It is a massive centrifugal force, which is now seeping down into high schools, especially progressive private schools.

Today‚Äôs identity politics has another interesting feature: **it teaches students to think in a way antithetical to what a liberal arts education should do.** When I was at Yale in the 1980s, I was given so many tools for understanding the world. By the time I graduated, I could think about things as a Utilitarian or a Kantian, as a Freudian or a behaviorist, as a computer scientist or a humanist. I was given many lenses to apply to any one situation. But nowadays, students who major in departments that prioritize social justice over the disinterested pursuit of truth are given just one lens‚Äîpower‚Äîand told to apply it to all situations. **Everything is about power. Every situation is to be analyzed in terms of the bad people acting to preserve their power and privilege over the good people. This is not an education.** This is induction into a cult, a fundamentalist religion, a paranoid worldview that separates people from each other and sends them down the road to alienation, anxiety, and intellectual impotence.

Here is how one young queer activist described the cult. The essay is titled ‚Äú‚ÄòEverything is Problematic‚Äô: My journey into the center of a dark political world, and how I escaped.‚Äù **The author identifies four features of the culture: dogmatism, groupthink, a crusader mentality, and anti-intellectualism.** Of greatest relevance to our exploration of tribalism, he writes: ‚ÄúThinking this way quickly divides the world into an ingroup and an outgroup‚Äîbelievers and heathens, the righteous and the wrong-teous. . . . Every minor heresy inches you further away from the group. When I was part of groups like this, everyone was on exactly the same page about a suspiciously large range of issues. Internal disagreement was rare.‚Äù

Can you imagine a culture that is more antithetical to the mission of a university? Can you believe that many universities offer dozens of courses that promote this way of thinking? Some are even requiring that all students take such a course.

**Let us return to Jefferson‚Äôs vision: ‚ÄúFor here we are not afraid to follow the truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error as long as reason is left free to combat it.‚Äù** If Jefferson were to return today and tour our nation‚Äôs top universities, he would be shocked at the culture of fear, the prevalence of unchallenged error, and the shackles placed on reason.

https://www.city-journal.org/html/age-outrage-15608.htmlI'll be 40 in a few months so let's say I already am, if you'd like check a [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/7lc8ph/at_almost_40yo_with_no_career_should_i_persue_art/) where I lay out my suffering in career dept. So I lack in romantic relationships (involuntarily single for almost a decade), no kids, small circle of close friends I don't see often, a failed career in IT, no higher education (never finished anything), some debt (but managable), constant money problems (not earning enough to pay for bills) and a relatively high degree of anxiety (possibly hereditary).

I haven't failed though in the department of personal development, I've made monumental strides in the past 4yrs. I've transformed from a shy, fat, niceguy to a slender outgoing sociable and cocky person. Loosing 70pounds was a large part of this. I've fought my demons but they're still a few lurking in the depths of my psyche. I've done this all on my own with no professional help or with that of JP, only discovered his talks a few months ago (before him Alan Watts, Joe Rogan, meditation, yoga, selfdev books). Oh and turning from a resentfull atheist to a avid spiritual seeker was also a large part of this. I won't go into why it took me so long to 'wake up' there are many reasons for this but thats a story in of itself. Main points:

- safe but traumatic childhood (abusive narcissistic father, unavailable mother)

- no romantic relationships early in life (earliest was in my 30's)

- very low selfesteem (= same as father) which affected all other aspects

- very strong creative impulse (drawing, painting, photography) which was suppressed by social constraints

- high intelligence (acc to my friends and family) but low in motivation to finish anything = no finished higher education 

I'm progressing but it's slow because I have to constantly fight these internal battles that say it's too late for me, that women don't like man-childs like me etc. I need some guidance here guys, I KNOW I can be so much more but time is running out, I know that. I find sometimes when trying to do some deep thinking I want to do something sort of on automatic at the same time? Any recommendations?Why do you browse r/JordanPeterson?]

edit: Can I ask people who don't Identify as White to upvote? I think I'm pushing some buttons by trying to present this argument.I reject the notion that Western societies disintergration is due to a Marxist conspiracy. To me it looks like the West is sticking to the idea that it simply isn't capable of screwing up. It can't be us, someone **must** be causing this to happen to us. We are just super nice and everything.

It's ludicrous. The current angry wasp's nest conflict in UoT and across America is a *continuation* of the trajectory it has been on since probably it's inception. It's poison in my eyes that they've managed to put the blame on that cantankerous, self-hating Jew and beardy old fart, Marx. It's allowed the neo-fascists to flourish and it's preventing the West from owning the responsibility for it's own actions, **exactly as JBP says a dysfunctional person acts**. But here's a clue isn't it to why the West can't seem to accept culpability when it so plainly goes of the tracks. The way of understanding a thing in the West is in isolation, as a discrete aspect of reality with it's own properties, self contained and self explanatory. It's the individuals fault if they break conventions, it's the individuals virtue if the succeed. Every man is an Island and we rise and fall according to our own ability and choices. Meanwhile the jails are filled with Blacks and Whites enjoy the bulk of societies benefits. Indigenous people have been disowned of the land and the police are being militarised. Fear is growing and it is the Muslims and Mexicans fault.

I wonder how much longer America can keep itself upright.why do people love hitler so much that they will make music videos to express their admiration?

A deaf, not-too-intelligent, and someone not likely to contribute too much to Civilization woman in 1962 derailing research on an amphibian being with a bunch of losers, is the fantasy of those who will be left out in the Future.


Utilitarianism should drive Civilization - Strickland (a play on Charles Strickland, a name Somerset Maugh gave to Paul Gauguin who abandoned Paris (Center of Civilization until about 1940) for Tahiti) might be an asshole, but he was the only one in the lot who could learn anything from the amphibian critter. The losers who rescued it would not have added NOTHING towards Civilization.

Americans forgave the doctors of Unit 731, who came to have successful and lucrative careers at Japan, because the data they obtained from these military doctors outweighed the 'crimes against humanity' these doctors might have committed.  

Simply speaking, the feelings of the critter and the losers protecting it are much, much less important than what we could learn from the critter.

In real life, it would have been not too hard to put the deaf woman, and the string of losers around her, away. if people like them won every time, we would still be living in Caves.

In my opinion, Shape of Water is a mockery on Civilization.I always resist the massive urge to call the sjw's or the alt righters i get in arguments with idiots and what not, because truth be told many times over they actually are. 

But I don't for a multitude of reasons, one of them being I could be in their position some day where my views are considered idiotic. 

When do you buckos realize that someone is not worth your time arguing, and it for all intents are purposes being a jackass, besides the obvious ad hominem attacks and what not. Like for example if I came across a cathy newman irl, id simply not engage anymore after the first 5 times i gt strawmanned

We have live viewing threads each night over at /r/tucker_carlson, you are welcome to join us. I'm slowly but surely cleaning my room, I'm not looking for a way to have more free time but instead a way to just be focused on my studies work.

I have lot of work to complete but I just "zone out" even before I really start to focus on it and it often happens. Even with the book open before my eyes, with no distractions it's still not easy to really start to get down to work. I really want to do it so do you know something about increasing focus ? I'm open to all kind of suggestions, even drugs will do for me.We're seeing a barrage of questions asked on this subreddit, and many are low quality questions and some also seem to me attempts at finding approval "MY IQ IS SO HIGH HELP". Instead of answering their question and being a leech on people's lazy behavior or being a co-dependent similar to a circlejerk, consider not doing something that they can do themselves. If the question is very generic.

See the following article:

[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

**Fact:** This post is a perception.

Who sees it? No one, it's not a solid thing, you can stop reading, and look away, see that thoughts come up then -- perceptions just like this post.

Pretend for a moment, like an exercise, that YOUR EXPERIENCE is reality and not the material world. Even Jordan suggests this for Existentialism. So your vision is like a LCD screen floating in nothing. There's no vision outside it, no other people's vision. There's just the LCD screen. 

In this LCD screen, an analogy which I will now extend to consciousness itself, there's thoughts, emotions, sound, you name it. Everything's just changing in consciousness. Thoughts are just changing in consciousness. The so called "self" you probably identify with are just changing in consciousness. There's consciousness and there's the stuff that's changing. That's reality now, it's not an analogy. If you did shift what you think reality is.

There's more sticky stuff changing, stuff on a different level that you're attached to. But ultimately that can be seen through.

There's no control and there can't be because it's changing by itself, including thoughts, until you've seen through the illusion and they're gone. Because it's pointless to think unless there's two of you. One who thinks one who becomes conscious of the thinking. If you let go of the one who thinks-and just stay conscious of the thinking, the thinking might stop. If you're in charge of the thinking, stop thinking for 5 minutes, see how "in control" you are.

 Now I recognize I can't hold this realization of non-duality. So I have to practice and if you want to join me in holding truth by destroying delusion - practice by disassembling your current truths, your axioms, with an Eastern religious practice.

&gt;The goal of Eastern religious practice is the same as that of Western mysticism: the shifting of the center of gravity from the ego to the self, from man to God. This means that the ego disappears in the self, and man in God. It is evident that Shri Ramana has either really been more or less absorbed by the self, or has at least struggled earnestly all his life to extinguish his ego in it.

&gt;Sri Ramana is a true son of the Indian earth. He is genuine and, in addition to that, something quite phenomenal. In India he is the whitest spot in a white space. What we find in the life and teachings of Sri Ramana is the purest of India; with its breath of world-liberated and liberating humanity, it is a chant of millenniums... 

&gt;Carl Jung

The Eastern practice Sri Ramana recommends was simple: Think who am I? That's it. To whom has these thoughts arrived to? When am I?... etc.

Beyond  I  AM,  there  is  no  knowledge  to  be  found  in  the  dreamstate,  only
anti-knowledge; the knowledge of what‚Äôs not.  Beyond that, I can only interpret abstractions in a way that I find satisfactory, and lay out the available
pieces in a way that is not displeasing to look upon. There can be no grand
epiphany when studying reality.  One can never see the dreamstate clearly
because there‚Äôs really nothing there. I can explain the dreamstate and know
that I‚Äôm as right as it‚Äôs possible to be, but it can never rise above the infinite
regress of metadream interpretation.  The only solid foundation to be found
is truth, and the only place you find truth in the dreamstate is nowhere.
There‚Äôs really nothing left for me to do but play with Maya ‚Äì the goddess of
delusion, not the dog ‚Äì which, she is quick to remind me, all I‚Äôve ever really
done. All my clever idea of idea-play has kept me amused, but I‚Äôm still sitting
on a dead planet in the middle of nowhere and Maya ‚Äì take your pick ‚Äì is
my only friend. I‚Äôm not unique in this regard; it‚Äôs the same for everyone, the
only difference is whether or not you know it.

There‚Äôs nowhere to go because there‚Äôs nowhere to be.   Evolution is just a
name we give to the illusion of motion, and wisdom is a mirage.  Despite all
the talk of journeys and progress and growth, no one has ever moved an
inch.  You appear in the amusement part and you play the games and ride
the rides and when it‚Äôs over you go out the way you came in. There was never
any chance of making a difference because
you
were as much an illusion as
the rest of it.

Wherever we turn in this house of mirrors, it all reflects back so bendy and
distorted that no matter how hard we focus or how well we think, we can
never make it make sense. We assume the mirrors are reflecting something
real  and  if  we  could  just  get  steady,  get  right  in  our  own  heads,  the  images would stop wobbling around and snap into focus.  But we can never
see things as they actually are because nothing is as it actually is, and no
amount of steely thought or silent mind can make something of nothing.

&gt;If the doors or perception were cleansed,
everything would appear to man as it is, Infinite.
For man has closed himself up. till he sees
all things through narrow chinks of his cavern.
‚Äì William Blake

Blake‚Äôs doors of perception might best be understood as the distorting layers of ego.  The only way to see clearly is not to cleanse them but to remove
them.  Then, once they‚Äôre gone, you get to behold the infinite, but so what?
Great,  it‚Äôs infinite.  Duh!  So you turn to go back into the amusing albeit
unreal reality you left so you could behold the infinitely unamusing infinite
and, surprise, you can‚Äôt go home again. You traded the dream of something for the truth of nothing, and now you want your something back.  But you
can‚Äôt have it.

It‚Äôs not that you want to be under a spell again, you just don‚Äôt want to be
bored. Maybe in
The Matrix
you can be reinserted and have your memory of
the truth wiped clean, but short of a serious head injury, you can‚Äôt do that
here.  You stepped out of the theater, the amusement park, the dream, the
video game, and discovered that it‚Äôs boring out there and that boredom is
the one true enemy, so you sneak back in and try to reinhabit the dreamscape you once called reality.  It‚Äôs not easy, but if you can fool yourself even
a little, doublethink your way back into a light doze, you can be a little less
bored.  You can participate to some small degree, have a purpose to some
small degree, be amused by drama to some small degree.  You have to keep
moving, though, or at least create the illusion of motion, because as soon as
you slow down and allow your eyes to focus on any given point for any length
of time, the whole thing starts to dissolve.  Never focus, that‚Äôs the key.  Just
let your vision go soft and let the dreamworld shimmer back into place.
Ironically, the illusion your strove to escape is now something you must learn
to nurture and cultivate. It‚Äôs exceedingly delicate, like sleeping when you‚Äôre
not tired. You lay there and close your eyes and try to let the dreams come,
but you can‚Äôt fall asleep again.  Any thought, any sound, any disturbance,
and you snap back into alertness and the delicate dreamworld vanishes as
if it was never really there.

Let‚Äôs take a few minutes to prove once and for all that there‚Äôs no such thing
as God. (Just kidding, it won‚Äôt take that long.)
I Am is the only thing any sentient being can know. There is no higher someone that somehow knows something you don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not possible for any conscious entity to know more than I Am.  No one can have any other
knowledge because there‚Äôs no other knowledge to be had.  That‚Äôs not a
you
limitation of a
human
limitation, that‚Äôs a
consciousness
limitation.  No one
can know more than I Am, so what does that make God?  Can there be a
supreme being who doesn‚Äôt know any more than you or me? A supreme being who is entirely belief-based? In other words, delusional? Of course not.
Once we‚Äôve ruled out the possibility of knowledge, we‚Äôve ruled out the possibility of God.  Just that simple.  No God, no higher beings, no all-knowers
or insiders of any kind.  But don‚Äôt waste a tear on God or Allah or whoever
else you thought was up there, the truth is much better than the fairytales.
Beyond I Am, it‚Äôs all belief.  There is nothing to know because there is only
consciousness, and that thou art. Ignorance is not a matter of what we don‚Äôt
know, but what we do know that‚Äôs not true. In the dreamstate, false knowledge  is  everything,  and  true  knowledge  is
Sentio,  ergo  sum
.   I  am  aware,
therefore I am. I-Am/Consciousness.

So,  with  one diamond  bullet,  we have  killed God,  gods,  science,  philosophy, religion, and any and all other claimants to knowledge, and we didn‚Äôt
use  belief  to  do  it,  we  proved  it.   Not  bad  for  a  couple  of  paragraphs.   I-
Am/Consciousness is the weapon that destroys the universe.
Pashupatastra!

So now, having established that no one can possibly know anything more
than I-Am/Consciousness, that no other knowledge is possible, that everything else is just belief and no belief is true, we can go back to our earlier
statement that all of creation boils down to two things, one of which doesn‚Äôt
exist.  Awareness is truth and appearance is belief.  Instead of awareness
and appearance, we can say dreamer and dream, beholder and beheld, or yin and yang. There‚Äôs plenty to be said about appearance, but the only thing
you can say with certainty is that it‚Äôs not true, just as you can say with certainty that untruth does not exist.  Consciousness is true and truth exists.
The conten of consciousness is not true and untruth does not exist.
Although it‚Äôs not true and doesn‚Äôt exist, appearance is absolutely necessary.
Without appearance, there can be no awareness, but there
is
awareness so
there must be appearance.  Without anything to be aware of, awareness is
not aware. Without anything to be aware of it, appearance does not appear.
Yin and yang.

This begs a lot of which-came-first type questions,  all of which are nullified by the fact that consciousness does not exist within time.  There is no
causality,  no this-then-that,  there is only
Is
.   It‚Äôs not very satisfying,  but
it‚Äôs undeniable.  We are the dreamer and what we call reality is the dream.
That‚Äôs as far as you get when you start digging because no matter where
you dig in a dream, you just keep digging forever.  I don‚Äôt understand that
dreamstate, but I do understand that it can‚Äôt be understood. You can wake
up
in
the dreamstate and you can wake up
from
the dreamstate, but you
can‚Äôt wake up
to
the dreamstate. There‚Äôs nothing there to wake up to.
In order to explain the nature of reality, you would have to first determine
that  reality  actually  exists,  which,  actually,  you  can‚Äôt.   Yes,  reality  is  obviously  real,  but  the  fact  is  that  no  one  has  ever  proven  that  reality  exists and no one ever will because no one can prove anything.  There is no
such thing as
ob
jective knowledge and the only
sub
jective knowledge is I-
Am/Consciousness.

All supposed knowledge is really belief masquerading as knowledge, and the
word for belief masquerading as knowledge is delusion.  If everything you
think you know us really just belief,  and if belief itself is knowably false, then your entire reality can in no way be distinduished from a dream. There
is no truth in the dreamstate because, in truth, there is no dreamstate.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ubNbIGv8d98

At the beginning of the video it is stated that agreeable people need to be in intimate relationship 

Really ? Does it extends to all people like friendship and family or just a need to be in couple ? Kind of sounds like a weird question but I'm curious

For example this might sound silly but let's take my score results at UM, I'm moderately high in compassion and I don't think of myself as a fond of couple relationship

Am I wrong in the way I'm interpreting it ? Thank you in advance for great answers !Maybe you should get your life together and learn to save money.  Stop whining about it online.  Clean your room bucko.. save your money, don't be a failure.The self authoring program did an excellent job at pointing out what was bad with me, not just an aspect of my life but a trauma I was somewhat -conscious of- but didn't considered it as so... Yet it's still a powerful obstacle and pretty difficult to detached myself of.


http://eaia.mx/5%20-%20multimedia/ingles/libros/YoungReinventing.pdf

Recently found this on a thread commenting on the results of the UM test. 

I identify since a child (I don't know how much young but I guess it's relevant from the age of 11 maybe earlier) with the self expression lifetrap's subjugation. Quite high in compassion, I don't know how much in enthusiasm as a result trauma set aside.

What's interesting is how much those "lifestraps" let's call it  are overrepresented everywhere, you see that every time inn every day life if you pay attention. If you feel like you have some shit running all the way inside you or even that you're  conscious of what is wrong; Great chances are you will find  your problem in this book. 


I'm half relieved because I know considering my emotional condition, (that I learned to pay attention to recently) that I'm not doing well through daily live, either at school or home, and that my view of the world may be skewed at times. I feel chronically angry and unhappy deep inside. Somewhat glad about that. Now it's hard truth, I'm not comfortable at all and feel like I've been messing up my entire life until now.

I hope some of you will find something relevant in there to contribute to Peterson's cleaning room program. Still on my way, and wish the best to all of you.I watched this video last night, the religious lecture series where he talks about some people remembering 2-3 dreams a night.

Then last night I remembered 3 dreams! It's insane what the hell is going on. His words are like drugs. They change your brain. Whiteness is identification with a group based on mostly skin color, but also any associations with that skin color from the past and now. It's ultimately fine to be in a group - we're social animals as Jordan says. Whether that group is being in the "Jordan Peterson crew by posting on the reddit" or whiteness, or whatever. But group identity can be dangerous, it's been tried before, is being tried today, with disastrous consequences, and it's not really true. Moderation is key in the domain of being social by belonging in a group. Not too much, not too little. So you be white. But don't be attached to it. If you're attached, it's way too much of an emotional roller-coaster.

Be like a robot. You'll give your arguments for why whiteness has to protected, why you're white. But you'll never think that you're attached to that or that it's the ultimate truth. Because if anyone threatens what you're attached to - it might seem like an attack on yourself. But don't try and be calm to win points for your time. Be calm by not being attached. It's like someone attacks the idea of Santa Claus, and you know it's an idea, and you say you believe in Santa Claus, but you don't, but you still give the best arguments you can for Santa Claus. Because you think it's important. It's not lying if it's a short conversation, you can mention this "I say, but I do not believe", in a longer one.The importance of Santa Claus goes beyond any puny identification or attachments you have to it, since you realize you'll be an emotional roller-coaster if you were wrapped in the tornado of group identity.Consciousness is the apriori truth that destroys everything, as far as I can tell it's the absolute, which is the absolute truth. I AM is all that needs to be said to destroy the universe. Bye. Gone. I AM. That's all. 

Chaos/order is *something* someone's being aware of, but by who? No one, there's consciousness and in consciousness there's chaos/order. Whose responsibility is this? No one's, as there is no one.

This is the underworld. It's where you are at, if what's absolutely true your goal. Because what negates everything is our presuppositions. The one in our life day by day, moment by moment, and it's I AM, why would it be any different? 

There I AM, in every memory. Every single memory. There's no escaping it. No creature, no planet, no galaxy, no place where there's creatures. You cannot escape the absolute. You cannot escape Being. You cannot escape consciousness. It holds everything and everyone, forever and ever. Well you're it, so, there's that too.

Chaos/order is in a dream where the dreamer is consciousness. You know the dreamer is true and the dream is false. No matter which contents of the dream, you/consciousness are conscious of it it. That's the true part, the false is the dream.

So is cleaning your room, or making order out of chaos in an otherwise chaotic life. Dream stuff all the way from *you*, me, to cleaning your room, to making order out of chaos, to having a chaotic life. Sorting yourself out included.

Just because the dream is false, doesn't make it unnecessary. Without it there wouldn't be I AM, Consciousness. There's the Yin and Yang, perfectly. So really, it's false, it's a dream, you're the dreamer, but it's necessary. It's false because truth is all there is and there cannot be false. So anything that's not the truth is false. I already contradicted myself but it was important for me to realize what's false do not exist. Only truth. I guess it's important to say everything we think is true is false, though.

After this journey is the abiding truth of I AM, complete spiritual enlightenment, direct knowledge of it. You, me, whoever else is stuck in the underworld, let our attention drift from I AM, and truth, and become more unconscious. Then tell our discoveries to our dream world. I am simply beginning to descend to the underworld. I think I'll find some pearls of wisdom.

"Be vary of unearned wisdom, C.G Jung", though. It helps to write this stuff out and try and communicate it.

The good, old ways were not entirely good. The two world wars did kill the West's best of best, but it also ended the code of honor, duty, and all the Xtianity shit. The cold winters of 1944-45, and 1945-46 taught Europeans that if there was a G_d somewhere, it went AWOL.

The old ways had their purposes a long time ago, but after 1945 people learned they no longer worked, so the traditional values went into the crapper although some people, although they know they no longer work, want to hold on to them.

Andersen, a closet gay and a loser during his entire life, wrote a lot of fairy tales which are alien to today's world. Tl,dr, Denmark during his day was like the Guatemala of Europe (Norway was something like El Salvador), with desperately poor people and no opportunities.

His "Mother's tale" actually brings an ethical question.

The tale starts with a mother, trying to chase away death from her child. Chances are the child is her last surviving child, and whose death will shut her out from the gene pool. The Death takes away the child anyways.

The Mother chases Death, going thru a lot of steps. Death, whose job is on line since G_d will replace him by someone better if he fails, warns the mother that to save her child another mother will have to lose her child.

The Mother is paled, but tries to pluck two flowers from the Death's garden; one is her child.

Death now warns the Mother that the child, if saved, will have a 50-50 chance of having a great life, or a miserable fate.

Not a gambler, the Mother is won over by the Death's words, and asks G_d to take her child away. The Death has done his job well, and the Mother, now cut from the gene pool, only awaits a lonely and miserable rest of life.

=====

People after WW2 no longer understood the meaning of the story. They became much adventurous; a 50-50 odds is pretty good nowdays, and I doubt anyone will not take it. 

They know there is no G_d's Kingdom. There is no Heaven. I have read encounters of Auschwitz survivors who abandoned religion, since G_d did nothing for that kind of stuff so it is not gonna do anything for anyone, and no longer relevant and no longer worth believing.

So, why sacrifice one's place in the gene pool for someone you do not know, do not give a shit about, and would not even be aware of your sacrifice?

In today's retelling, the mother would have plucked the two flowers, say fuck you to Death who will lose his job, and a random child will die. Too bad.

Before someone stamps this as being off-topic,  I have to say that ethics prior to 1945 should be all discarded since they no longer represent today's reality, and rather than try to find lessons from days which are behind us, we should find new way of thinking to match what we see.

Tl.dr., old values, instilled by various fairy tales and dramatizations of the old stories, should go the way of the dodo since they do not help today's people who turn to figures like JP for guidance.

A modern retelling of the above story might be "The House of Fog and Sand". In my opinion, Jennifer Connally should have retaken the house after the Persians were cleansed out from it, as if nothing happened. Too bad about what happened about the intruders, but possession of that house, now probably worth millions, would have meant a great deal of difference for her progeny. Such is civilization.Consciousness.

Is the only knowledge that can be known. Here. You're it. You are the knowledge which only can be known. Consciousness is the absolute, because it's infinite. Nothing can contain consciousness, only consciousness can contain nothing, and everything. It's impossible to be any other way. It's truth, there is only truth. 

The absolute is the absolute, always. No matter which knowledge. There cannot be more infinite than infinite.

The leftists say that everything is relative and there's no absolute truth. No, truth is all that there is, how can it be any other way? It doesn't matter what happens. Because truth prevails over delusion no matter how delusional any society is. It's so funny. Even if you're in a torture chamber in 1984 and you've been told all your life that 2+2=5, it's all just relative. It doesn't matter. Consciousness prevails. Even the most psychopathic people ever lived who wage a war against consciousness ultimately lose, it contains them! You can't fight the absolute. It's here and forever and ever. Even if all consciousness disappear from this universe, there will probably some other dimension or timeline with it or inside some black hole.I feel that way since 2 years now, I don't feel at the right place. I'm turning 20 in 3 months, and I feel like I've lost time in my life. But that's not the main problem here. 

Since now 1 entire year I've been trying to figure out what was my exact personality, my own wishes, because I have no idea. It's like I don't really know what I want, what are my natural inclinations and I think it's because since little I took the habit to subjugate myself to the need of other people. This is SO frustrating on the long term, and it took me research and research before finding something on this : http://www.johnbarletta.com/documents/RemediesforLifetraps_001.pdf

Go for page 4

Such a sense of uselessness. I can't even be at peace with me. 

If I can't figure out who am I truly or have clear sense of identity, I will not be able to sleep again at night. 

I've looked to some picture of me when I was a child and nothing seems wrong, everything seemed fine; good childhood nice school, neighberhood, and I look fairly happy on them. But since I don't know exactly when this subjugation tendency started out I have trouble looking at myself objectively.

My only guarranted chance to even figure out how I score on the Big Five trait since I probably neglected some of my needs in the past years is to look at me as a very young child; or even a baby. I have yet to find valid assignement for infant on the internet for such a thing to happen 

Or I could ask my parents about me as a baby but I'm not comfortable with it, first I don't think it will be enough, secondly I'm being cold with them since several weeks now because I don't know how am I suppose to feel about myself as a family member, I'm not sure where my place is in it and I don't have this clear sense of hierarchy since I'm not even sure about my own identity now

It sucks...You are saying that JP is giving ammunition to his critics due to his tweets really need to think about it a bit more. 

1. Is what he is saying really ridiculous? I don't think so, it's just things that he would usually say said in an informal way. If the President of the US can talk about his big red nuclear button, a social critic ranting a bit once a month doesn't really amount to anything.

2. His "critics" don't care. They are not going to be charitable towards him regardless.  They bastardize what he says in his lectures and take them out of context and strawman them regardless of the way they were said. 

3. His critics are ideologues. They don't seek the truth. They will do whatever it takes to further their ideology. It's not like if JP spoke the truth calmly it will make a difference, (it didn't 100 times in the past.) They are not up for debate, they just want to defeat their opponent. 

I've discovered recently to my demise that a strong trauma was dormant inside me since my childhood, thanks to the Schema Therapy, which is a method to sort out all kind of trauma. Okay before coming to my initial problem I will introduce you a bit of **Schema** **Therapy**, and since I've hardly ever heard Jordan Peterson mention it (only through BPD's subject) I think it's good opportunity to share it. Each and everyone one of those can be summed up as the following :

http://www.davidbricker.com/clientsguideSchemaTherapy.pdf

http://psychology-training.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/young-chapter-one.pdf


Long term reasearch has been conducted by E.Young in those behavioral, emotional and needs dysfunction, he also publied  book to deal against what he described as "lifetraps" derived from lack of affection, love, control or anything else in early childhood. Just tap "schema therapy end bad behavior" on google and see by yourself, the study itself is well known in psychotherapy.

* Here are the 18 identified lifetraps within client's in a nutshell =&gt;
http://www.schematherapy.com/id73.htm




12.  SUBJUGATION  (SB)

     Excessive surrendering of control to others because one feels coerced - - usually to avoid anger, retaliation, or abandonment. The two major forms of subjugation are:
         A. Subjugation of Needs:  Suppression of one's preferences, decisions,  and desires.
         B. Subjugation of Emotions: Suppression of emotional expression, especially anger.
     Usually involves the perception that one's own desires, opinions,  and feelings are not valid or important to others. Frequently presents as excessive compliance, combined with hypersensitivity to feeling trapped. Generally leads to a build up of anger, manifested in maladaptive symptoms (e.g., passive-aggressive behavior, uncontrolled outbursts of temper, psychosomatic symptoms, withdrawal of affection, "acting out", substance abuse).


13. SELF-SACRIFICE (SS)

     Excessive focus on voluntarily meeting the needs of others in daily situations, at the expense of one's own gratification.  The most common reasons are:  to prevent causing pain to others;  to avoid guilt from feeling selfish;  or to maintain the connection with others perceived as needy .  Often results from an acute sensitivity to the pain of others. Sometimes leads to a sense that one's own needs are not being adequately met and to resentment of those who are taken care of. (Overlaps with concept of codependency.)


14.  APPROVAL-SEEKING  /  RECOGNITION-SEEKING  (AS)

     Excessive emphasis on gaining approval, recognition, or attention from other people, or fitting in, at the expense of developing a secure and true sense of self.  One's sense of esteem is dependent primarily on the reactions of others rather than on one's own natural inclinations.  Sometimes includes an overemphasis on status, appearance, social acceptance, money, or achievement --  as means of gaining approval, admiration, or attention (not primarily for power or control). Frequently results in major life decisions that are inauthentic or unsatisfying;  or in hypersensitivity to rejection.


15. NEGATIVITY  /  PESSIMISM  (NP)

     A pervasive, lifelong focus on the negative aspects of life (pain, death, loss, disappointment, conflict, guilt, resentment, unsolved problems, potential mistakes, betrayal, things that could go wrong, etc.) while minimizing or neglecting the positive or optimistic aspects. Usually includes an exaggerated expectation-- in a wide range of work, financial, or interpersonal situations -- that things will eventually go seriously wrong, or that aspects of one's life that seem to be going well will ultimately fall apart. Usually involves an inordinate fear of making mistakes that might lead to: financial collapse, loss, humiliation, or being trapped in a bad situation. Because potential negative outcomes are exaggerated, these patients are frequently characterized by chronic worry, vigilance, complaining, or indecision.


16.  EMOTIONAL INHIBITION (EI)

     The excessive inhibition of spontaneous action, feeling, or communication -- usually to avoid disapproval by others, feelings of shame, or losing control of one's impulses. The most common areas of inhibition involve:  (a) inhibition of anger &amp; aggression;  (b) inhibition of positive impulses (e.g., joy, affection, sexual excitement, play);  (c) difficulty expressing vulnerability or communicating freely about one's feelings, needs, etc.;  or (d) excessive emphasis on rationality while disregarding emotions.


17.  UNRELENTING STANDARDS /  HYPERCRITICALNESS  (US)

    The underlying belief that one must strive to meet very high internalized standards of behavior and performance, usually to avoid criticism. Typically results in feelings of pressure or difficulty slowing down; and in hypercriticalness toward oneself and others.  Must involve significant impairment in:  pleasure, relaxation, health, self-esteem, sense of accomplishment, or satisfying relationships.
     Unrelenting standards typically present as:  (a) perfectionism, inordinate attention to detail, or an underestimate of how good one's own performance is relative to the norm;  (b) rigid rules and ‚Äúshoulds‚Äù in many areas of life, including unrealistically high moral, ethical, cultural, or religious precepts; or (c) preoccupation with time and efficiency, so that more can be accomplished.


18.  PUNITIVENESS  (PU)

     The belief that people should be harshly punished for making mistakes.  Involves the tendency to be angry, intolerant,  punitive, and impatient with those people (including oneself) who do not meet one's expectations or standards.  Usually includes difficulty forgiving mistakes in oneself or others, because of a reluctance to consider extenuating circumstances, allow for human imperfection, or empathize with feelings.

Now to recenter this, I have defenitly some of theses lifetraps since very young, especially the Approval seeking. 

I'm a 19 years old male, and I'm broken deep down since the beginning. I have no one to turn myself to, not even me since I don't have a sense of identity. I don't know what my natural inclinations are, I don't feel like I even live. I feel so separate of "me" every time I step ahead.

I don't regard myself as a decent family member, I feel like a sider who is still tryinng to gain something out of my parents without ever reaching it, thus creating a distance since very young age.

I don't know how to deal with it, I just feel like my whole life has been an entire lie and I will not get out of it. Sorry it feels all over the place but I'm so lost right nowI see everyone repeating that conspicuous JP quote "Tell the truth, or at least don't lie!" around here. 

But I think its his most misinterpreted quote amongst his followers that is.  

People use the "at least don't lie" part of the saying as an excuse to not speak the absolute truth and speak white lies, as I have noticed many people in this sub talking about. However I don't think that lines up with JP's sentiment on why he said that. 

"At least don't lie"; In my view is just basically JP telling to avoid saying things that we know to be are false for sure. We can't always speak the truth, because we don't know the truth for sure, but the least we can do is not say things that we know for sure are lies. 

This is why I think we shouldn't let white lies slide by. Because we know for a fact they are lies. 

Sam Harris makes a beautiful case against white lies in this book Lying. 

https://samharris.org/books/lying/

And I think all of JP's followers should give it a read. 

Many of our personal and social lives suck because of white lies! 

If the dress makes your wife look fat, let her know. So she doesn't have to look fat in public. 

You friends food is under salted? Let him know! so that he can salt it better the next time. 



There are a thousand other instances on how white lies make our lives a little bit darker every time we say one. But the reason I made this post is to get a conversation on this topic started.
*INTRO: I humbly introduce a thought cloud that's been gathering in my head, to share with this fine community, because I think it is exactly on point here, at the very core of importance, and I think you good folks are exactly the right people to help refine and carry forward anything of worth in it.  I share it in the spirit of recognizing an important way that we as individuals must recognize and refuse to be compromised, and in so doing collectively solve an impending crisis:*

I think we are at a crisis for freedom of speech / freedom of expression, and therefore freedom of thought.  We must rise up to defend our freedom, but the classic narrative hinders us:

"Freedom of speech" is an unfortunate formulation of the principle, because it is easy to sway the public to abandon it, when they don't care much about the people being silenced, and when most have little ambition to speak publicly themselves.

And this is most often the case, because freedom of speech is seldom invoked unless someone is saying unpopular things, which a majority won't much care to defend being said, and would not be inclined to say themselves.

This is why we often hear idiots casually dropping obscene turds such as "Freedom of speech is fought for the hardest by those who have the ugliest things to say".  And yet if pressed, those same idiots would never in a million years be willing to answer the challenge "OK, then name the person who is qualified to tell you what you can and can't read?"

**FREEDOM** ***FROM*** **CENSORSHIP** MUST BECOME OUR ABSOLUTE DEMAND OR WE ARE LOST.
----

Freedom of speech is **the freedom to listen** (this is legally recognized) without arbitrary censorship.

https://www.news24.com/MyNews24/Not-freedom-of-speech-so-much-as-the-freedom-to-listen-20151005
https://www.thefire.org/say-it-again-for-the-people-in-the-back-freedom-to-speak-includes-the-freedom-to-hear/
http://www.theacru.org/issue-freedom-to-listen/

It may often not be the right of this or that asshole to speak that actually matters very much, but instead it is the right of the millions who will be censored from hearing whatever they, in their own wisdom, see fit.

It is WE THE MILLIONS who must REFUSE to be censored. Let us not be so distracted by worrying about some asshole who may or may not speak, that we stand mute ourselves while some self appointed petty tyrants decide for us what we may or may not be allowed to hear, and therefore to think.

As narratives such as "hate speech is violence" become increasingly popularized and accepted, we need a most powerful antidote.  That antidote is the back edge of the blade: Censorship is an absolute infringement of every individual's most fundamental right to freedom to listen and think, no matter how bad anyone thinks the speech was.  This message, made clear in the minds of the masses, so clear that every individual clearly feels the sting of being told what they may not hear, is the only hope to mobilize us against losing our right to listen.  No platforming must become impossible, not because the institutions wise up, but because the audiences refuse to be censored by people who think they have the right to appoint themselves as the arbiters of everyone else's rights.  I find it astonishing that the very urge to arbitrarily censor others is not immediately and palpably perceived by crowds as horribly repugnant and reprehensible behavior.  If it were, then self appointed censors could only entertain that urge in the face of guaranteed shame and humiliation.  It must be recognized as a motive so malicious that it immediately overshadows any "good intentions" the would-be censor might otherwise claim as justification to violate everyone else's most fundamental rights.

Finally, as far as systemic oppression is concerned, I note that people with real power will seldom be keen to promote freedom from censorship, because that message would directly challenge their ability to use their power to employ censorship as they see fit.  Governments are seldom if ever seen who do not censor, and we must assume that we are lucky to whatever extent they manage to be prevented from doing so.  If anyone is likely to defend our right to be free to listen, it will only be ourselves.  We The People must absolutely refuse to suffer censorship, nobody else can or will do this for us.ÔªøJordan Peterson is a Right Wing intellectual and apologist masquerading as a moderate who only seeks to bring all into a fold of equality. He is the Captain Kirk who seeks to helm the next generation of White Hegemony and perpetuate White Identity as a Group Identity that can legitimately claim 'victim status' and in being so, fight against the 'suffering' being imposed on it.

He is claiming to be doing this with a justification sourced from the Godhead.

&gt;Act as if God is real

HERESY!

**God is Real**, you can't contrive or fake a relationship with the Almighty. What "White" civilisation is enduring **now** is because of Hubris in the past that Peterson is seeking to prolong into the future.Is it me or is anyone else here getting annoyed by the constant opposition JP faces? 

I'm so tired of seeing the endless barrage of hit pieces one after another, and people mis representing this man and calling him a transphobe,sexist and racist.. 

It might just be the neurotic part of me over looking the good articles about him but. 

Like what the hell? 

Like even if you take all the politics into account, JP is a force of good. He has changed so many peoples lives for the better.

If someone helped me improve my life and had knowledge that would help me make things better, I wouldn't give a rats ass about his political positions. A net positive, is still a net positive regardless of the positive to negative ratio. 

I am not a tribal person and I really really really believe in the sanctity of the individual and repeat to my self a thousand times over that I should not think in a tribal way what so ever and I should always judge people for who they are not what they are. 

But. 

But. 

I feel this genocidal rage inside of me, that what if I just could burn all these ideologues down. These fucking pests whose only purpose in life is to bring others down. Who have nothing better to do.but writ hit pieces and lie. They are scum, they are trash, they are plain assholes with no redeeming qualities what so ever. I have no sympathy for them

Maybe I am a little too much invested in JP as a person, but I do keep up with him and spend time on his subreddit because his work helped me tremendously and it continues to do so everyday.

Anyone else in my position?

The fucking radical left is like a toddler poking a dog with a stick repeatedly, we are nice to them but they just don't want to play nice. They will keep on poking until the dog turns around and bites their ass. 

Like this is why tribal warfare is a thing, one tribe can just keep on harassing another tribe for so long until, the other tribe snaps and fights back, I really don't want anything bad to happen but with the current climate of polarization I feel like the radical left might be digging a lot of graves for the future with their bullying,character assassinations and silencing of people in the present

I think JP is realizing what needs to be done, which is to draw a line that they are not allowed to cross. As we saw with the Panjak Mishra fiasco. And a couple of troublesome weaknesses, here is an estimation of the results (took the test but since I'm not particularly self aware results were maybe not totally accurate)

Agreeableness 65th (70th compassion/47th politeness)

Conscientious 3th percentile (Industriousness 9th/Orderliness 3th)

Extraversion 20-24th percentile (Enthusiasm 36th/Assertiveness 18th)

Neuroticism 18-25th percentile

Openness 13th 

I'm not conscientious nor Open, and not extravert.

No ambition in life and I've developed a sense of personality disorder, I don't really know who am I (I'm consulting a therapist this week tho.) 

I don't know, til I've debate some issues with the therapist I just don't want to do anything probably because I'm depressed too. What should I do ? I spent the last week trying to figure out what kind of kid I was in my childhood, just to see from where I can start.Order &amp; Chaos doesn't exist, neither does anything else. That doesn't make it unnecessary. This subreddit doesn't exist, neither do you, Jordan Peterson or anyone else for that matter. These words do not exist either. It's necessary for one reason and one reason only: Truth. Everything is relative except truth, because it's absolute. It's the only thing that exists.

The ancient Indo-Europeans writing the worlds oldest texts called this Maya. Falsehood cannot exist. It only appears that it can. But if you take a perspective of reality that consider your experience reality, like Heidegger's Being or Dasein, you can see through what you considered to be existence or reality, previously, understand it's Maya and see truth. (including yourself, the great devil)

The great Aldous Huxley was into this philosophy as well, I guess it was partly through the religion called Vedanta.

&gt;In later Vedic texts and modern literature dedicated to Indian traditions, MƒÅyƒÅ connotes a "magic show, an illusion where things appear to be present but are not what they seem".[2][4] MƒÅyƒÅ is also a spiritual concept connoting "that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal", and the "power or the principle that conceals the true character of spiritual reality".

lmaoHumans are really imperfect creatures. The standard we're expecting our potential to be at is far too high. I think we're doing good just being imperfect. In fact, absolute perfection is our doom. First because we won't get there. Second because it doesn't matter. Third we're working at it as good as we can, without really trying.

Here on Planet Earth, we can succeed in the long run, or fail, either way, another species will have it run somewhere else, I don't know. What's probably going to be common between our two species is, well... This. Not what you see, that you see. But what you see is necessary as well. Today is what we will have in common. Not tomorrow. Not the past. Just today.
As many of you are familiar, The radical left when they can't dis approve your ideas will resort to character assassinations and silencing tactics. 

Sam Harris atm is being crucified by leftists for having Charles Murray on and had multiple hit pieces written about him by Vox (those bastards). 

Sam couldn't keep his cool and snapped, just like JP did a few days back and now his ultra liberal fan base is crucifying him. At least so it seems. 

r/samharris has been brigaded to hell by chapos and they are manufacturing dissent and sprading massive amounts of propaganda. 

Thing's got so bad that the mods on the sub are adding stickied comments on how the comments and post on the sub don't really reflect the views of Sam Harris. 

The same could happen to JP sub as well.

https://np.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/85n1ex/effort_post_we_need_to_stop_brigading/

I greatly appreciate the mods for keeping this sub clean from all the brigaders from r/enoughpetersonspam, r/badphilosophy, /r/ChapoTrapHouse. 

But the radical leftists have a few new tricks up their sleeves. Be aware of what you read online, no one is telling the truth nowadaysI loved the book, but I just can't get behind this rule. The doc would be the first to admit that even his house isn't in perfect order, but that doesn't stop him from criticizing the world. Nobody's house is in perfect order because perfect order isn't possible. Hell, it's not even desirable. Like the doc says, a little bit of chaos is necessary too.Across many if not all Western Universities, freedom of speech is being undermined, mostly not by law but by mobs of ideologues who are young with little to none life experience, and raised by the Government up from kindergarten throughout government schools. I'm generalizing what I see nearby and what I've gone through. I've had freedom of speech by law, for the most part, but certain topics you can't bring out without disastrous consequences socially.

For example, a student who was arguing with two female students about the over-representation of immigrants with crime, wasn't believed. So he wrote a text document with statements and some sources, not the best sources, and brought it in the next day. In the lecture hall he was shouted down by one student as a nazi, racist. Literally shouting. Later she brought immigrant friends waiting outside the lecture hall, waiting for him to leave, obviously for intimidation.

Afterwards, he was frozen out of a group-collaboration on a project, he was told by the HR-department he's under review to possibly be expelled, by the University, and no one's talking with him anymore after the Universities **Equality - Diversity - Equal Treatment organizer** and educational leader had a short talk in-front of class before a lecture. They talked about previous lectures held about discrimination and what was told what you're allowed to say, what you're not allowed to say. They said that it has come to their attention that recently there has been a case where it has not been in this way. They're happy if the students note when something has been said that shouldn't have been said. They can just contact the EDE organizer or educational leader. They said they do not want this to happen on the school.

My question is where does your responsibility lay if you take the Existential approach? How do you approach it when your University has been overrun by literal Neo-Marxist Postmodernists? Do you risk speaking up, and losing your education and reputation or not? It's very dangerous emotionally. Your heart rate is elevated and you're shaking a little bit. Especially since you never debate or discuss these topics, especially with ideologues.

How do you avoid corruption now?The path which Peterson is attempting to navigate has two potentials. Either he **is** a prophet in which case he must adhere to the word and will of God, or he isn't a prophet in which case he will seek to assert worldly power. Worldly power can only be wielded as a sword. We can look back in hindsight now at the figures from history who scaled the ladders of power but there must have been a time when they 'felt' what they were doing was for a "good cause". Even the boogie men that this board has will if it's honest admit that all their monsters from Stalin to Pol Pot and Mau were just ... Men.

I've been absent from this board for a while since it became flooded with those who think understanding means they are wise. But I've been keeping up with what Peterson is doing and he is blooming isn't he. The talk he gave at a Uni in Vancouver was it? When it was interrupted by two girls holding a small banner and the guy shouting from the balcony, Peterson laughed as his acolytes howled them down. They reveled in his pleasure and he in theirs, and in that moment it seemed clear down which path he was going. There is humility in Jordan Peterson. I've witnessed it and I've appreciated it but he is just a man, and he needs to be reminded of that.

I think many of you see a bright light ahead with JP it's herald, but it could equally be an enveloping darkness.

He's not the messiah, he's a very naughty boy.Anton Webern, a Viennese composer who made music you don't want to listen , was from an aristocratic family so unlike Schoenberg, who was Jewish, he had no need to flee the Nazis. He did protect Schoenberg's son, who stayed in the city, and a few Jewish friends as best as he could.

After the war ended, he was living in an American zone of occupation with his son-in-law's family.

In a November night, he was smoking a cigar outside of where he was living at when he was shot three times by a redneck soldier from North Carolina, whose name I do not think is important enough to be remembered.

No punishment was given to the redneck soldier, since the US military valued the life of the redneck GIs more than the life of the last famous composer living in Vienna.

The redneck later became a school bus driver and died of alcoholism. His family members said he felt guilt about killing Webern, but I doubt it.

The average IQ of rednecks around 1920s, according to Lothrop Stoddard's book Revolt against Civilization, was about 85-90. It is unlikely that the redneck soldier ever heard , knew, or cared who was Anton Webern, and it is also unlikely that the soldier ever heard a note of Webern's music. Ditto to all of his family members and acquaintances, who would probably have been lowlives like him and would have no time for a Viennese composer. In fact I doubt they had the capacity to know the difference of a Viennese composer and , say, Elvis Presley. I know that because I have dealt with rednecks for quite a while.

Given that job prospects for lower-IQ rednecks were dim even at that time, chances are he just lived a lowly existence, blaming all of his shitty life to killing a composer whose music his intellect would never comprehend.

Arthur Harris of Rhodesia said the entire city of Dresden was not worth the life of a fusilier. He was wrong, and Rhodesia is now a shitty place. The life of a fusilier, or a GI, is not very important.

The whole argument is a step for a debate to grant special privileges to higher-intellect people, and eventually adjust the 'human rights' for lower-IQ people according to their ability and value. Rednecks and other lower-IQ people are incapable of understanding what they do does to people of greater ability, so their damages should be reduced by decreasing their access to weapons and other opportunities.I'm thinking the Lobster King should be athletically fit. Muscle mass, muscle strength, and cardiovascular ability in the higher percentiles. He should be well dressed, educated with the Great Books of the Western world. The more unchangeable parts is general intelligence in the higher percentiles, healthiness, facial symmetry and an above average height. 

If you have that, you're pretty much a Lobster King. The younger you are the more it speaks of your competence too, to claim the throne of the Lobster King. I suppose an old Lobster King becomes a Lobster Philosopher. And a very old person who wants to sit on the Lobster King throne shall not become the Lobster King, something else.I read the interview of the lawyer who helped to acquit the 3 policemen in Detroit's Algiers motel incident back in 1967. A no-holds-barred , win-at-any-cost lawyer who didn't give a shit about what the case, or what the victims might have been, as long as he could win and collect money, he became very wealthy and is shameless about his success.

It is people like him who drive the future, and make the earthlings able to leave the earth to travel to the stars. In other worlds, the Future is made for assholes and ruthless dons, not for 'nice', 'people oriented' characters.

\&gt;[http://greyenlightenment.com/wealth-intellectualism-and-individualism-part-16/](http://greyenlightenment.com/wealth-intellectualism-and-individualism-part-16/)

\&gt;  a society that prizes, above all, individualism and ‚Äòvalue creation‚Äô,  

\&gt; where individuals are ranked by the economic value they produce or by  their social or intellectual clout,

\&gt; not character 

That is the reality.

Education is geared towards raising people with characters and those likely to help others. However, there are families who raise their children to become assholes, those whoa re able to take advantages of others' generousness, etc and they get ahead.

And, the cold truth is, because they are ahead financially and socially, they are more likely to survive the social upheavals in the future while the 'nicer' characters perish.

JP is a philosopher in a transition period, like Descartes who was a bridge between Renaissance and Enlightenment. JP will have its place in history like Augustine, but new virtues will be defined by those who are not ashamed to flaunt that they fucked a billion people over to become very successful.Is that possible ? In what circumstances IQ can diminished ? Is that permanent ?

Thanks for answersHello everybody, the title is a bit misleading, let me go into detail for you :
I have an ideal perspective already and as I was working towards it and have ACCOMPLISHED IT (I was genuinely fulfilled and did get all I wanted) I've started to "decrease", some people call it "self-sabotage" although I'm not fond of the term (It's when everything is too good your brain goes like chicken and start kicking you down. It works in the other sense, when people have miserable life oftentime there is this push coming of nowhere that just give them the power to change things and everything gets better. Same medicine in the opposite sense for me) 

And now to come back to the title thing I actually can take a rest from it but, I don't know if I really should. I have this basic fear like all humans of loosing what makes me fulfilled. That's hella problematic. It's been 2 weeks I'm struggling to find a way to do this correctly. 
Should I just let go and come back at it later ? Feels like the best option to me yet but it's hard to do and I really need an external bias on that. Thank you for answers.Hi Mr Peterson and hi everyone ! 

Last few month I've been through a transcendent experience of the being and I've found the term psychedelics corresponding to it on YouTube (also little parenthesis apart from what I'm about to describe but I've stopped looking for things on YouTube and I found it useful for health) and been through it as a partial ego death if I'm not getting this wrong. 

And so now let's be direct my question is if you do have this experience SEVERAL times does your openess to experiences increases several times FROM the first time you've been through a psychedelic experience ?

Does the number make the thing ? Or the intensity ? 

Also apart from that I'm extremely suggestible currently, I have some health issues that makes my brain do things that I specially don't want to do. It's as clear as I just written. But not as extreme. It's more a form of bad health issue, not close to a disease but still currently to take account of for me. I don't want know why I did just wrote this lmao. Maybe don't consider it in the writing of your answer(s).

Thank you Mr Peterson and thanks everyone for upcoming answers !!
Now matter the cost, once you've found it, remain faithful. Faithful to your path. I've never seen Jordan use that word and it bothers me, because at one point that's one direction I desperately need to hear. JP provides advice to today's centrists, who accept what we have and go the right way.

However, I don't know how long his idea will continue to be relevant, as the gap between the able, the smart, and the rich and the rest grows larger and larger.

I think that at some point, even if there is no transhumanism integrating themselves into machine, those who are able, smart and the rich (i wil just call them 'the able' for simplicity's sake) will consider themselves as a separate species from the rest, a phenomenon already being observed by younger, smarter rich who share photos of their lifestyle thru their snapchats without mentioning their names, knowing that those who know their names don't have to be reminded and others won't have to know who they are.

Social mobility is dying. No more enterpreneurship (newer businesses can't compete the older, established ones because rent, regulation fees, advertising, etc present an insurmountable gap), no more 'good' jobs because of AI, automation, etc. And the price of real estate and intangibles rising forever.

There is nothing to be done to the less able. A dollar spent on the able yields a higher return, than ten dollars spent on the less able. Smart money will invest on the able, and not bother with the less able who will grow poorer and more miserable.

Since the less able will not be able to compete against the able in the new world, they will probably be culed out.

Why waste valuable resources on the less able when they won't return anything?

Better to concentrate all available resources to the able, so they can generate higher returns and advance civilization.

JP writes his pieces for those who can benefit from them, which tend to be smarter centrists. People like I say what he can't say because of his status as a professor; it is necessary to see the reality as what it is, and stop helping the less able and let nature take their course so Civilization, human gene pool, and everything else can improve.This is the absolute abyss we should all avoid. I already encountered it once in my life REALLY back in time I don't even remember it period and it was not happy day man it was horrible. Fear is one. Thriving is another.

Am I missing anything ? Of great lifetime value here. I'm not looking for simple fact.
Thank you very much for answers again.You avoid the worst thing by spurring the medicine as one would say. You have to understand it's bad to not do it. I'm not gonna experience nihilism. But I'm somewhere in my path I have to understand how bad it is. You guess where I'm getting. 

Should I experience it right now or do you guys have any value lifetime advice to not ever go into it ?

Sorry for grammar I'm not perfect lexically. When encountering life blocks, or cinderblock or wall or whatever it is, put it at the right place. It's at the right place to be in. In the old days, nobles were only judged by their own peers. We should go back to such system to advance Civilization and making the Civilization Drivers able to work with a little less restraint and create a bigger wave.

There was an indie movie, called Another Earth, about a genius girl who was attending MIT. While driving she found there was another earth coming towards terra, and while she was about to call the news to her professor, she hit a car and killed a woman and her child. And they were no nobodies - the woman's husband was a music prof in a serious institution. She spent 4 years in jail and ends up as a janitor; what happens after that is more like a fantasy with little basis on science or reality so need not be discussed. As someone who thinks music has no value, I feel putting the genius in jail for killing people less smarter than her was wrong.

Alice Walton drove drunk and killed a woman. As a result, the state of Arkansas got a world class museum. Punishing her and making her move to another state (Texas, where she has  been absolved of all drunk offenses) cost Arkansas a lot of tax revenue. It is not known how much the woman's family were paid to hush up; not punishing people like Walton increases revenue and creates the 'greater good'.

Recently, in an Asian country, a taxi driver was run over by a BMW, driven by a safety director of a local airline. The taxi driver is expected to die. However, frankly speaking, the training the safety director received would be more valuable than the life of a lowly taxi driver, and if we add the loss of revenue because the director cannot work , and the difficulty of finding another personnel for his position (it is a regional city so talents are hard to find) would outweigh the life of a mere taxi driver.

In today's world, there are a lot of ethical questions to be asked. And, since some lives are indeed more equal than others, people who are important, either economically or intellectually, create more value just by being there. Just by being there, a rich person generates property taxes for the locale.

The lives of a lot of people living now are , I have to say, a lot worth less than the property tax bill for a multimillion dollar property.

Richer people are hard to come by. Smarter people who could do something, and create economic values, are even harder to come by. I think it is wrong to punish them for crimes they might commit against  the 'lower people'; not punishing them often creates a greater good by making them generate tax revenue or create better things. The rights, and dignity, of the 'lower people' are , I have to say, not worth punishing people who can generate value. Sorry.

It is time to treat the elites, the 1&amp;#37;, and the smarter part of population much better than what they are already being treated now. Like making them immune from any kind of punishment. Where to set the threshold would create some debate, but I say that people who are now worth more than $100 million, or people who are in the top 0.1&amp;#37; of intellect, should be forgiven from all crimes except if the crimes affect others who also belong to such categories. For example, a centimillionaire might want to put a hole at the head of a maid who bumps to her, and pay no more than , say, a year's salary for the damage and no trial, no prison sentence, no punishment whatsoever.

In the old days, nobles were only judged by their own peers. We should go back to such system to advance Civilizaton and making the Civilization Drivers able to work with a little less restraint and create a bigger wave.I've just discovered after digging by myself that I might have anxiety. And I was surprised to learn it, because I always thought it was people high in neuroticism who contracted anything related to anxiety, and I implement in my head that all anxious people are just naturally high in neuroticism. So wrong I am. On the big five test that I took one year from now several times I always scored low in neuroticism, that's like my signature move. So I was puzzled to learn it. First.





But anyway, here comes the real thing. Second. I'm anxious on a state of being "scale" (I lost a bit of my English recently by not practicing enough so I apologize for not use the appropriate terms time to times), as I was moving towards my desired goal I came to a point I accomplished everything I always dreamed of, making my life the dream I want. I did it, but my goal hierarchy was fucked up because I reached the ending point, and I began to self destroy. Little by little. (At first I didn't knew how to deal with that, but I figured out that my goals had to be redefined for me to move properly. Thanks JPB.) 




However I've been caught up in anxiety by the time already, and so now I'm here wondering about the best tools to get rid of that kind of anxiety.





How do I break down the little goals or problems to get rid of it ?


I've just seen Jordan video on it, describing anxiety he said that one of the cause of it could be high verbal intelligence, which I recently learned I was through testing in a professional lab 3 month ago (well not in English yet my grammar lacks)





Also by making the statement of this message to be an important message I really mean it, what I think I'm putting here is unbelievably valuable to move forward when you hit a wall. Existential courage, that's the medicine we're dispatching here, by breaking down the way to reach it out and fully explore competence.

Turn yourself on as the old one says.

But no I'm kidding, I'm infinitely grateful for all the knowledge you guys provides here, and I'm trying to do my "bit" on the side, really hope it will help anyone stuck in life in the same way as I am, looking for the best answer.






Thank you for any answers and I wish to anyone reading this the best on their own journey.In an article written about the latest fiasco over at *Kotaku In Action*, the author dropped this gem out of nowhere:


&gt;Gamergate, which took hold as a concept back in 2014, became a way to justify threats of murder, rape, and other forms of violence from women who¬†developed video games and wrote game reviews¬†under a smokescreen of ‚Äúethics in gaming journalism,‚Äù and KotakuInAction was a nexus for this activity from the beginning. **More recently, the subreddit is commonly graced by posts¬†defending Jordan Peterson¬†‚Äî a man known for recruiting vulnerable young men into the alt-right using tactics that¬†target people with depression**

I'm at a loss of words. What on earth happens to someone that causes them to be so misinformed, yet confident enough to spew literal horseshit into the world without hesitation?

[The article](https://theoutline.com/post/5383/gamergate-ringleader-experiences-moral-crisis-four-years-late?zd=2&amp;zi=xoxwx4wt).

[Archived version](http://archive.is/aCB1b).Hi Mr Peterson. Recently with hard work and faith I've came to a point where I put all my life together (or at least nearly since I haven't a family yet) and became unbelievably capable. My faith made me unstoppable, I was truly fulfilled and successful. Top Lobster if you want, I know what it's like. I've accomplished all the things I've ever dreamed of.

However, as soon as I was about to implement new life changing goals for living, I got anxious and I dropped down. Since I attended my highest goal the hierarchy wasn't prepared for that, so my brain got anxious and froze me down. 

And now I'm puzzled. I've discovered the reason of my fall, but I'm still not sure how to deal with the things when I will get back to normal (because part of my anxiety is to drive me further away from the way I wanted to be, and drive me away from the my normal state). And so now even despite all the progress I've done as an individual I'm afraid to loose all of it (actually not all of it but I'm expressing the global idea here). 

I still feel my "true normal state" which was the state I was in before anxiety kicks in so to say, beneath some surface or something else.

I'm not naturally an anxious person and I'm only fairly high in verbal intelligence, my global IQ is around average. 

What tools would you advice me to get back to normal and overcome my anxiety ? Thanks for any potential answers I'm grateful for that.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo3e0aYgGDw

I'm actually referring to the beginning of the movie and the intro credit scene, while the whole rest of the movie is on fun tone or doesn't even come close to the intensity of the beginning again, I had experienced an ego death before and not through psychedelics. 

And from everything I've done or seen so far watching Deadpool 2 is the closest you can get from it without drugs use or actually loosing a love one. If you really live that moment of loosing a dear one man it's beyond powerful it's beyond being itself. It feels more than just overwhelming, it's like the end of the world. 

Now maybe if you're open and emotional don't try to go to deep into it, you don't have to and you can appreciate it on an appropriate level. It feels weird to create a topic on Deadpool, don't know if this will be taken to serious however but this particular moment is just so special. 


So if you're curious I'm just laying it there so you can see what it's like. Face the truth. The blunt truth. As an example here is a song that really capture that : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l50L4GYhpLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l50L4GYhpLc)Hi Mr Peterson, I've been through 

Or when you go through an ego death of any kind. I've gone one standard deviation in openess to experience above my original score I guess, now I'm quite attracted by ideas and relatively more by art. From moderately low to moderately high. And fortunately enough for my own sake I was not even average before man I woud have freak out to go high in openess lmao

Naturally low in conscientiousness (oups) and neuroticism (fieew)

So my score isn't too high but I still have to deal with it how do I do that properly ? If anyone is willing to give advice I'm taking it thank you guysHi everyone and Hi Mr Peterson.

I'm a 20 yrs old male and I've gone to a point where everything goes wrong.

I have this sensation of fake emotion inside of me since the age of 12, and one weird things is it makes me move around a lot I seem more energetic or at least more assertive than I was. 

It seems to have its advantages but there is something I need to extract from that feeling, because I cannot depend on it I feel that. One of my question would be how do I extract the right info from that ? Can I actually live with it ? 

Am I just creating my own demons ? How do I know ?

Thanks Mr Peterson and thanks everybody for any answers

And this might be difficult to get rid of. Because deep down I've once, when I was 12 years old until at least 17 years old was addicted to people recognition. That's hard to get rid of because essentially you can find love with that. And I don't know man. There is another side to it. I would like to make it disappear and maybe even have greater meaning through life after all of that. What should I do ? Thanks to everyone Hi everyone, I'm a 20 years old male trying to get rid of past demons. When I was 12 years old I've addicted myself to social recognition I think. And I've been aware of it only at 19, last year when I started taking necessary steps for it.

Part of that is because I'm naturally quite high in agreeableness and low in assertiveness, so it's a pattern that was likely to occur. 

And so because of that I don't really know what are my needs or at least I'm not sure about them at all.

What would be some advice step by step to get out of this ? I've onced have therapy about it and it will be longer than one year to be gone. I can still feel the repress of my own desire for recognition, I can still feel that little bastard inside me. 

One way out of this for me was to figure out what was my personality like before 12 years old. Like, was I Open to experience ? more or less  Enthusiastic ?( I know I was emotionally stable at least) What would be the characteristic of a kid in theses trait in your opinion ?

Thanks for answer I would love to begin a little discussion about that. If you have any specific questions to ask about how I was as a kid I will be pleased to answer.Hi everyone, I was watching Jordan Peterson's video on Hugh Mungus and when I've saw that outrage woman ideologically possessed it's like I've felt what she felt and been on her side emotionally for a couple moment. This really scares me, I don't know why this happened it's like this bad feeling goes against my own reason.

Am I just understanding more profoundly what it means to be ideologically possessed ? It's scary because it's like reason disappear and I can't fight against it.  I'm grateful for any answer explaining what just happened to me. Thanks everyone.Peterson's primary audience is impressionable young men. In a recent AMA here on Reddit he was asked why he didn't ***explicitly*** assert that Christianity is the thing people should adhere, to which his reply was, "...because it's more powerful to assert it ***implicitly***." This is a clear admission that he is manipulating the minds of people who haven't yet reached the stage in life where they recognise that one's skepticism ought to skip the surface of cynicism when one is contemplating ones meaning and purpose. I agree with him on many things and originally I was very happy with what he had seemed to achieve; namely a coherent connection between faith and reason. I am gutted that he hasn't pursued this avenue of thinking and has instead seemed to have allowed himself to be drawn into the political mire of Identity Politics. Perhaps it was inevitable given the *reason* we have religion but because of that, on top of several other things, I am compelled to believe he is an avowed and unreconstructed [White Nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism). In the Munk debate with Michael Eric Dyson he petulantly objected to an accusation demanding Dyson clarify a remark alluding that current generations of so called Whites carry some burden of responsibility for the actions of former generations. This was straight out of the contemporary White Nationalist play book which on the one hand regards with misty eyes the accomplishments of their forbears but on the other, and with breathtaking hypocrisy, attempt to distance themselves from the litany of criminal and psychopathic behavior enacted by those same forbears.

This board is a shadow it's former self and has descended into a revelry of mutual acknowledgement and recognition between disenfranchised Whites. It really has become /pol/ lite where all explicit condemnation of non-whites has been set aside for the traditional mutual understanding that **all** 'White' people have something deeply in common other than their coincidental and monumentally superficial appearance. White Identity is an essential component and historical justification for fascism and the dissemination of one form of culture by means of violence. This boards character has been hopelessly corrupted and what intelligent, critical thinking there was here has been diluted to one of a simple dogma with an easily recognisable MO. If you disagree with Peterson and have legitimate reasons you are by degrees, an SJW, a racist (against Whites), unintelligent and, finally, insane. The latter being the ultimate expression and illustration of what finally shows what this board has become, a small mind being the sum of a million small minds. Because the reason one is accused of being insane is dual; One, you are acknowledged as having illustrated a failing in the dogma and, Two, ***you are questioning an unquestionable reality***.

I am mixed race and I have White near relatives who I am deeply, deeply compassionate towards, Love in fact, insofar as I'm capable and I am genuinely concerned for the peoples of Europe, even those who now colonise and occupy the traditional land of aboriginal peoples. I see and recognise the desire of Europeans to stop their bickering and animosity, to find some mutual area of understanding and bon-ami but I have absolutely no doubt that *going back* to some mythical source will only serve to renew their cycle of self-destructive behaviour. Jordan Peterson desperately and urgently needs to focus on what he elucidated in his decades long study of the importance of religion, namely it's universal purpose, the legitimacy of **all** Religious Traditions and **why they are important**. He needs to form a coherent and secularly acceptable concept of God that truly enlightens and informs without anthropomorphism and he needs to accept that the current audit of White Identity is not only necessary but crucial to it's reformation **and survival**.

White Identity is an *imposition* on reality that will not stand unless it grows and yields to the reality that we are all, *essentially*, The Same. The concept of White Identity is **entirely** abstract. It **literally** does not exist **in Reality**. We all know on some level that we as a species create our demons and this is a stellar example. There has been, is and will be killing done in the name of this imposition on reality, on this purely abstract and imaginary *thing* and we are reaching a critical terminus, fork in the road. In one direction lays illumination and enlightenment, in the other is darkness and misery. Jordan Peterson walks a very dangerous ground - it is hard to remain acceptable while saying what has to be said, so that shows his greatness.

I am more like a Spencerian, like Herbert Spencer. His unlimited laissez faire and social darwinistic philosophy, associated with Nazism although he died 20 years before the founding of that party, basically dumped him into the dustbin of history where he does not belong.

[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/23/tech-industry-wealth-futurism-transhumanism-singularity](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/23/tech-industry-wealth-futurism-transhumanism-singularity)

This is the Future, this is the reality and this is the cold truth.

There is simply no room for those not in the boat of Futurism, Singularity and Transhumanism. To get into the boat one has to have wealth and intelligence. 

When it is going to be certain that the less wealthy, the less intelligent and the less able are not going to make it, all the barriers will be dropped, political correctness will die and a massive 'readjustment' of population will take place, justified by the new Herbert Spencers of the day. 

Jordan is needed for now to keep the fight going, but like what I have said before , he is like John the Baptist or Descartes, foreseeing an age before its time. We should not stop at him, but should advance his thoughts to suit the reality, which will be heavenly for the rich and smart, and probably not for the rest.well?

edit: please give an exampleWith those emotions. I'm frustrated because I'm currently not doing the best I could do and I feel profoundly frustrated by this. I want to cry, because I'm genuinely frustrated and angered about it. I struggled with this all this day, I don't know if I should cry and I'm making my problems overwhelming by putting another layer on it unconsciously.

I tried to embrace my shadow today, because I felt so weak I wanted to developed it and give in to the part of me that needed to express itself without filter.

It is normal to self destroy like this ? What should I do 
Many people tend to forget that he is a professor at the University of Toronto, a public university funded by the taxpayers of the Province of Ontario.

So, although some people might be angry that he does not go all the way, like going into HBD or things like that, he is a prof and there is a line which he has to observe.

There might be people like Ricardo Duschene, prof at the University of New Brunswick, who does not hide his opinion of white superiority but JP has gotten too big to do that.

So, we have to understand that there is a limit to what he can say or write in public. He knows where to stop, which is how he has reached where he is now.

There are a lot of things about people who do not have the IQ level to function in today's society, or tomorrow's society where even higher intelligence will be needed. 

But, we will not hear more 'juicy' comments from JP about these since he has already gotten quite far with his remark that the bottom 10% of the IQ curve will have no place in today's world. It is not 10% (the median IQ of the world is about 88, so it is about 40-45% of the entire globe), and it is much worse than what he says. But he won't say more than what he has already said.When working on developing the opposite trait, if you're disagreeable and try to be kind to people but doesn't feel genuine about it, if you're unconscientious and trying to become industrious, or if you're Introvert and want to be more extrovert.

The feeling of fakeness is actually present time to times, how does one operates in making progress on his goal without feeling guilty about it ? Hi everyone, I'm not sure what to do with my life and what meaning should I give to it, and it became increasingly difficult to find out. Since I experienced a religious experience last couple of months, my psyche and sense of meaning is all over the place. I have quite a deep insight on life now, and with that comes along all the responsibility.

There are a number of thing I need to deal with like a past trauma but it's not the most important thing at the moment. I deeply want to show people "the way" to live and to share and to love in my current environment and that's my deepest goal, but it looks like I can't because my personality has became too much unstable these times. 

And now I find myself unable to fulfill this goal and I'm at loss. And it might be responsibility avoidance. I'm taking as an excuse a big reason (the religious experience) and maybe (unconsciously) I want to believe I can't do it so that I avoid fulfilling my responsibility. 

Or maybe I'm not clear enough on that goal. 

Anyway I have to take a stand as quick as I can, because I have to option : Either I don't incarnate the person I want to be and will be left with resentment
Either I do I take on the responsibility I get hit a little bit and try to maintain myself anyway.

I'm totally at lost right now I don't even know what I want. I might need a little break from the world but I know it isn't possible either.I don't want to sacrifice the future for the present. And it just pains me to think about doing it.

For approximately 3 month in consequence of my current situation in my current environment. 

What if I sacrifice the future for the present for a short amount of time ? 

Will I be the same person after that ? 

My guess is, I should do in my frame the most meaningful things I could possibly do at the current moment taking account of the constraint. I don't want to sell my soul. But this is so complicated man. I'm not even willing to detail it's not something I'm opening up about.

Right now I feel like I have already betrayed myself a little bit. What is worse? Self-Betrayal or silence ?

Everything is in the title.

To be more agreeable a disagreeable person can try to think about others more often and do kind things now and then.

To be more extravert a person can learn to enjoy social interaction consciously

To be more conscientious etc

But what if the changes were more profound. Changing one character is really easy, over months this can be done. But I find that the most beneficial changes are the most profound and durable ones.

Apart from psychedelics, which requires extreme caution with it's use (better used towards the wilful improvement of the individual, personal development and self awareness) it's not obvious that you can -or a set of experiences- change your personality traits at least a fair bit, in a profound and durable manner. 

So everyone's wonder is, how can one change his traits in the most durable, safe, and profound manner there is. To me the deepest changes seems to be the change in perspective of your life vision predisposed by your inherent traits. And to initiate such a deep change should be the goal. Because then it's part of you, no longer merely behavior. 

One might say the closest you can get to this change of perspective of the world determined by inherent traits is akin to discipline ++. Discipline is great, something that is part of you even greater. This might just be the hardest thing to even succeed in doing (but honestly who cares how hard it is if you're aim is so worthwhile; permanent and real change.)

Now I've also heard from Jordan that by venturing into the world and expanding yourself by exploring the unknown you turn on genes that are dormant within you that you're not aware of until they're on. How much does this apply to temperament ? To what extent ? 

If anyone can bring his own cake on the personality table that would be great. Hi everyone. I'm struggling with an issue I have, I feel like I've been lying for long time to people and friends in my environment about some of my personal attributes and now I'm self-deceiving myself in order to keep doing the lie (or what I considered today as a lie, something I wasn't considering when I was doing it purposely in the past) *in order to keep the whole environment intact*. I feel it as kind of a burden.

*Including possibly, saving my face, maintaining the relationship intact etc.* The truth is I may have to loose them.
It's a big lie guys. The thing is by now I'm already self-deceit about my authenticity, and I can't achieve my future vision. It's like I have an internal mask already put on my personality.

I've already done the worst. I've sullied my soul. And I'm aware of it, but until I genuinely redeem myself my life is gonna be hell. Advices would be greatly appreciated. Thank you it's hard lesson to learn that I'm trying to learnHi everyone ! I'm glad to say I've established a plan for the next couple of years. I will find a translating school and keep going in Australia.

I'm also working on improving some traits. Here are my results :

Agreeableness : 75th compassion 36th politeness

Conscientiousness : 11th Industriousness 5th Orderliness

Extraversion : 36th Enthusiasm 22th Assertiveness

Openess to experience : 70th intellect 60th Openess 

Low neuroticism

I'm planning to improve my overall conscientiousness.
But more important, I want to improve my extraversion *trait* durably.

It's very easy to act confident in social setting, but I'm planning on making durable change on my actual trait. I want to go average in enthusiasm, like fucking 47. Durably. As a trait. That's my aim and I don't settle any how for it. I will in the same way bring my assertiveness to 30 or at least very near. It will take time, but I will manage it. 


Did you managed/or have you tried to make durable change regarding personality traits ?Although some Americans (and Canadians) who think they are learned prefer to include North America into Western Civilization, personally I do not agree with that view.

&amp;#x200B;

Before 1918, when USA invaded Europe (I consider the Wilsonian invasion of Europe that way) the Civ in USA developed without much connection to Europe. Some people, like T.S. Eliot, Missouri native and Harvard grad (back then nobody outside USA took harvard seriously), ended up in Europe since they didn't like the Civ in North America. I don't think Canada had much to say about Western Civilization until after WW2.

&amp;#x200B;

Right from start, USA had a sizable number of population who could NEVER be assimilated because of their appearance and severe difference of inherent intelligence. And that part of population crept up over time, and formed a huge part of USA's pop culture.

&amp;#x200B;

After World War 2 a lot of European intellectuals migrated to USA. However, they didn't bring USA to Western Civilization, and instead were absorbed into what the Americans had.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it is kind of akin to the Greco-Roman Civilization, which are bundled together for convenience (they worshipped the same gods called in different names, etc) but were actually light years different.

&amp;#x200B;

Now influx from Europe having been dried because Europe never recovered from the world wars, exacerbated by Americans, USA tries to augment its brain skills with influx from Asia, India and middle east, which is not much different from Rome trying to augment its declining skills from Germans, Goths, vandals, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The very fact that the most notable political scientist in the last 30 years is named Fukuyama tells what might be all we need to know about American Civilization; it was never part of Western Civilization, wanted to be part of it and bullied around it, but had to resort to someone NOT from the Western tradition to develop the post cold war theory showed the weakness of it.

&amp;#x200B;

(It doesn't matter whether Fukuyama was born in USA, doesn't really speak Japanese, etc. He comes from a non-Western tradition, and does not really belong to what we call Western Civilization although he would fit fully in what I am proposing as the American Civilization.)

&amp;#x200B;

==

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know too much about Canada to propose a separate Civilization for Canada, whose most famous intellectual is none other than JP himself.

&amp;#x200B;

But there would be benefits to separate the Western Tradition and the American (and possibly Canadian) tradition, to make it clear that USA and Canada are not part of the West, but something else. Western Civilization would have had no time for Yoshihiro 'Francis' Fukuyama, and affirmative action scholars producing tomes which won't stay the test of time, etc but American Civilization would have room for them.

&amp;#x200B;

==

&amp;#x200B;

When Civilization is at its dotage, they tend to award big things to those who don't belong to it but try to preserve it. Ireland made a big deal about Patricius and made him Ireland's patron saint. Britain, which in my opinion is just a generation from barbarism, made Kazuo Ishiguro a Knight. However, no matter how much they try, they can't be part of the West.Okay not really, since Marxist's and Postmodernist's pass off as intellectuals. I will say that postmodernist's were intelligent to a certain extent, unlike the Marxist's. 

However, there is no denying the fact that new atheists are massively overrated. 

Their intellectual pursuit is so damn superficial and easy. They built their careers on disapproving fundamentalists. Like that is a hard thing to do. To be honest its not, its one of the easiest intellectual pursuits ever, in terms of intellectual rigor required. Fundamentalists always retort to mental gymnastics and logical fallacies when asked with the real questions. Really what the new atheists did was make it more socially acceptable to fight the fundamentalists, because for a long time, insulting or questions another persons religious views were considered off bounds. 

Really JP was right when he pointed out that the new atheist types never dealt with the ideas of the serious religious thinkers like Nietzsche. If they did they wouldn't counter the "ethics needing to be based on the transcendent" argument with something as stupid as "so you're saying atheists cant have morals".   

What do you guys think?Imagine what happens to the protesters at JP's talk. Does JP just allow them to come in and blast their white noise all over the place? The answer is no! he gets security to kick their asses out. 

How are brigades any different? They actively try to suppress our free speech, and in a malicious way too.

I am not saying the mods should just ban people, but we really need to come up with a plan ASAP, before this sub becomes /r/samharris  

In light of all the brigading, I put on my theoretical online hazmat suit and ventured into the far left subs that are vitriolic against JP. 

After talking to them for around half an hour, I gave up. due to the mass number of mis-characterizations and blatant lies that were being passed around. 

One thing however that I took away is that, theres no reconciliation.

These people consider JP their enemy, most of them were confident that their behavior is justified, including the behavior of the protesters as JP is a "sexist,misogynist piece of shit" who's ideas will "destroy the lives of many transpeople" and thus he cannot be treated kindly. 

They openly consider JP their enemy, and will do anything to bring him down. 

Jesus Christ.  I've experienced (since now several years) kind of a shift in my personality, regarding the context I'm in I'm more extroverted or introverted. Basically, I'm more of an introvert but I developed skills that's normal, but I feel like I experienced this shift also internally, that I'm more of an extravert and that's so weird because when I am, let's say, more extravert, it's like if temporarily a part of me was taking a backseat. This state of higher "capacity" (if we call capacity talkativeness and confidence in social situation in that context) can last for long periods of time (months) if I make it so, it seems like it has no real limit other than my free. will I'm surrealistically assertive. But also partly disconnect from reality. Or at least, experiencing it on a different way or different level. I thought about the alteration of consciousness. On a surface level it seems to make sense. I'm still there and I have control over what I'm doing externally, it's like if I've cut off some ropes internally. Do you have any explanation for this phenomena ? Thanks for answers 

P.S : Ironically my ocular accuracy seems to diminish when I'm in that state, and I feel more foggy overall.Identity Politics. What's it all about? I've heard it spoken of incessantly but nowhere have I read anything that seems to illustrate it's importance, it's relevance, it's *meaning*. Does anyone know why it's the open wound it is and why it seems so impossibly resistant to being salved, healed? Could it be we are all trying to assert through it what we *want* to be instead of who we *Are*? What is it after all if it is not that which we *Are* and in being that; the thing that we would be most content to be, our *Selves*?

So if the first question is, Who am I? What must be the second, or at least what must be the question that most authentically directs our thinking toward that which constitutes **Self**, and how is one able to discern it in this world of almost infinite distraction?

Surely it can only be God.

Or perhaps you may be content to source your sense of Self Identity from the constantly shifting kaleidoscope that is our material world, and pitifully "act" as if God is Real.[buried](https://old.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/8gxep3/letter_i_have_to_admit_to_privilege_to_pass/dym0r32/), but JP recently replied to [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/8gxep3/letter_i_have_to_admit_to_privilege_to_pass/).

his advice isspecific to the situation described in the post--a high school student who claims that he's asked to "Discuss what opportunities [I] have or do not have due to the level of privilege"--but i believe the remark applies to online discourse at large as well as this sub:

&gt;**Never write anything that transgresses against your sense of right and wrong**

a welcome reminder in light of the [ironic provocateurs](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/), idpol fetishists &amp; straight up trolls that have been making the rounds.

read, think, write &amp; speak truth--with care &amp; deliberation.

not because JP or i suggest it, but because it's a way to call forth your best self.

godspeed to all.

Hey guys so been seeing a lot lately people are calling us Peterson fans incels and betas in need of an authoritarian man in our lives. Is there any good way to prove actually the opposite is true and more likely than not we are chads and not incels? Jordan Peterson is the greatest philosopher since Wittgenstein, but he is also a product of his days. In the new age, there will be a new one, although we don't know who will be the person.


The world is being bifurcated as we speak.

The rich and smarter will get richer and even smarter, and those who are not will not have opportunities as the threshold for functioning in the high-tech economy is moved as of now. 

Those who won't be in there might gnash their teeth and raise their fists, but there is nothing to be done about them, sorry.

A mass extinction of those who won't be 'in' will take place, but some people will say it is off-topic.

During the 19th century, and a bit after that, people knew their places, those who were higher-up in their ranks treated the lower-ranked people like shit, and very little respect was paid to the masses.

And things like honor, duty, obligation were emphasized.

After the World Wars such notions disappeared, but as society becomes more stratified,

and social divisions become permanent and eternal,

such notions will be more prevalent.

As 19th century philosophy was driven by those who could afford to study in universities (i.e. no lower classes and very few middle class), 

the return to such days will be a shoo-in.

All the postmodernism, etc will be discarded as the masses are disenfranchised and lose their human rights, and philosophy will also evolve to suit the reality of tech advances, etc.

I think the false notion of equality, welfare, etc will be replaced by the cold truth of status, intelligence and ability, and the new philosophy will emphasize it.I'm writing this here since a lot of people here are really high in the openness trait and might be willing to experience everything, or even anyone with internet as a tool at his disposal with a minimum of curiosity. 

Protect yourself against the external world, particularly the internet world, it's dangerous, and if you don't set limitations for yourself you will end up having those limitations imposed to you in a range you would have never imagined or even walk in if you knew what was awaiting you out there. Yesterday I came across this strange topic on ego death, I even watched Dr.Peterson commenting on it and it's after effects, and I checked out another video of a dude who seems to be quite high talking about several steps in this ego death. 

I understood the mechanism behind it and while I was sleeping I trapped myself into that higher state of mind, (which I will talk about if you ask, I prefer just not deliver it like that because it actually works and it's NOT something you want to experience) I had a lucid dream and when I woke up the morning, everything was blurred out. I had no body, I was everywhere. I was really, really, BAD tripping. I had no body anymore, I couldn't feel pain and I was detached from my own thoughts process, I was experiencing things at an higher level, third person like. Tremendous willpower is what made me come back from that state. I'm a bit blurred but I feel better. 

Don't look to escape suffering through such an experience, I've seen all the ad around ego death, this is not something you go into like that for fun shit. People stays in that state. Get your shit out because from the point of view of a 20 dude who has not a life better than yours, EGO DEATH is not and must NEVER became an alternative to bear your own existence. Up to your conscience, you can do it, but you'll lose everything. I'm still young, can't talk on anything else than my own experience on it, but this is no joke.
Thanks for reading and please be mindful of this warningI came across [this story](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-anarchy-symbol-1.4664192) on /r/Canada.

I'm not entirely up-to-speed on the finer details of the story, but I'm fascinated with how the article is written.

* You you got favorable quotes from people associated with orwellian-sounding organizations like the "New Anti-racism Centre". 

* You have a passing mention of the $100,000 in damage this anarchist group caused, and more words spent taking about how their building was vandalized too.

* A quick jab at White Nationalists, just to remind the reader who the real bad guy are:

&gt;Princewill Ogban, the head of Hamilton's new anti-racism centre, told CBC News he's never really heard of the anarchy symbol being classified as hate material. He did point to¬†one instance in California¬†where a specific anarchist group was linked to white nationalism, but said that group was essentially an outlier.

* A nuanced attempt of explaining the complicated history of the the Anarchist symbol, with emphasis on things in life are not black and white.

* Then with a cherry on top, the article ends with a nice reminder of just how successful anarchists are at brand recognition and PR

&gt;Today the circled-A is one of the most successful images in the whole field of political symbolizing

I don't think I've seen a more sympathetic article written about a group that has no qualms with causing ungodly amounts of property damage. ANTIFA has been classified as terrorists in some places in the US. I fail to see how this group isn't itself a terrorist organization. 

And I would give my left nut to see and equally sympathetic article written about people trying to protect free speech who are center-right-leaning.I live in the UK and I regularly watch the shows he's been on and listen to the stations he's being interviewed for. Up until now I didn't realise the obvious ideological tilt they have, which is overwhelmingly to the left. Every interview, seems to be the interviewer trying to trip up and ensnare Dr Peterson, rather than probing his views to try and help the listener understand more. Always, the host will side with a guest challenging Peterson and never the opposite. It seems their intent is to craft a narrative of Alt-Right hero and Marxist conspiracy peddler around him, despite several different publications and platforms failing. 

So much of what they say just seems to be the same simplistic rhetoric and platitudes, which fall apart with little scrutiny. There's no well reasoned depth to any of it, it's just to signal you think the right way. 

Without a worldview predicated on the existence of an omipresent, oppressive, white supremacist, capitalist, patriarchy, the modern left has nothing to stand on.

No matter the question or issue, that's the foundation the left necessarily has to fall back on. Anything that makes cracks in that narrative must be ignored, downplayed or outright suppressed. No matter the counter-evidence that's presented, this worldview is too valuable to be discarded.

It is no wonder why people like Thomas Sowell, Christina Hoff Sommers, and Peterson are vilified in academia; and it's no wonder why establishment media goes into absolute meltdown mode over [Kanye West](https://youtu.be/rCPUoCpOX0E) or Ben Shapiro. It's no wonder why detractors on the Left, like Bret Weinstein, are exiled. 

It's no wonder why Left-leaning individuals can't stop themselves from taking about it all when the topic was supposed to be ***Political Correctness***. 

#IT'S ALL THEY HAVEFry suggested during the debate, and during a [CBC interview](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/stephen-fry-political-correctness-1.4662626) that they don't seem to be people who agree on a whole lot. I know Fry is an Athiest in the Hitchens ~~sense~~ style (as am I), so maybe that is his point of contention. It would suck if that was the case because as a New Athiest myself (I grew up with Dawkins and the like), I have learnt a lot from Peterson.

Either way, I would love to see a kind of debriefing between the two so that they could at least discuss what they just experienced.This was a pretty good debate but aren't there any of you that think JP seemed uncomfortable, kind of incongruous? He exhibits to me a sort of awkward self-consciousness and wasn't able to appear 'natural'. The same thing happened in another debate he took part in with William Lane Craig and Rebecca Goldstein. It occurs to me that his charisma, though effective in certain environments appears gauche when in the company of less manneristic speakers. My guess he has become accustomed to speaking in the way he does and now it's simply part of his character. It's kind of strange to me that I didn't really notice it until I observed him in these debates and my suspicion is that the same thing has happened to the majority young people that seem to compose the core of his support. It's hypnotic and therein perhaps is a legitimate criticism that can be leveled at him. What he talks about is of substance, of this there's no doubt but maybe, just maybe, in his delivery he is actually undermining the substance with a subliminal dog and pony show.

A lot of you are doing your best to denigrate Michael Eric Dyson but the guy was nothing short of brilliant. Like Peterson I found some of how he delivered his thoughts to be pretty distracting, too Black(?), but nonetheless he outshone Peterson, very nearly eclipsed him. He's too fond of almost rapping though and I'm not sure why he felt it necessary to attack JP in the way he did. Peterson provides a lot of ammunition to his detractors, I'm not sure it was needed to attempt to humiliate him.

IMO Peterson is the best chance there is at the moment of achieving a compromise between the conflicted parties in Western society. Unless he is concealing or even perhaps unconscious of his own motives. I'm still very suspicious of his awareness that he doesn't **know** where this career track is headed. It illustrates something is lacking in how he has constructed his philosophy. I think it's that he is unselfconscious of being White and not reflecting on what it is to be 'White', believing it not necessary for White Identity to undergo a reconstruction at this time.To all of you lobsters who are libertarian, how will we go about a revolution or evolution to a libertarian or anarcho-capitalistic society? What do you intend to do?

I want basically a libertarian society to happen, but I don't know the best approach to do it. 

Quotes in Utopia as a joke. I don't think a libertarian society will be utopia, just consistent morally.Trump's administration has shown that the public's power does not mean jack shit, and the elites , backed by financial, insurance, and real estate power, are too strong to be even challenged at all.

Centrism and Opportunism by the more able will be the norm.

After the age of idealism is gone, the age of careerists arrives. When competition for 'plum' position is very fierce, and wealth is even more concentrated to the top as the top performers claim all of the profit in a winner-take-all, nothing-for-runner up society, careerism and not deviating from the official narrative is the way to go.

I think eventually a Chinese-style Bureaucracy will take place. It will work differently from what occurred in China long time ago, but as there are no more room for entrepreneurship, etc one's position in the leading companies will probably dictate how one will live, behave, etc.

The faster people accept the truth that the End of History has arrived, the Elite's rule is permanent, and everything will be determined by innate ability (i.e. what genes one was born with),

the faster the transition will be, the lesser the disruption will be, and the less waste would be made. (example: WWi and II, Vietnam, etc)

Jordan is like John the baptist to the new era. Like Lao Tzu before Confucious.

The only thing which will end the Status Quo is the Singularity (including, but not exclusively, Artificial General Intelligence), which the Elites are poised to benefit first and the rest will be like Neanderthals facing the Modern Man.Does anyone have any real advice on how you decided what you wanted to do for a career?  Like something that is overlooked when deciding and was the key for you in making your decision?  I am a classic overthinker and have been absolutely stuck for a few years now faking my way but still without definite answers.  Thanks in advance for any advice.This board can be summed up in three words

Be. Your. Self.

I'm not inviting questions or a discussion but if this bewilders you then a conversation needs to take place between you and your creator, who resides within all of you.

I would only add that this conversation can't be authentic if you *only* 'act' as if God is Real.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT7Iyk8LoEg"... In Marxism, ‚Äúthe end justifies the means‚Äù is axiomatic. Marxists are allowed and in fact encouraged to lie - it‚Äôs explicit in their playbook. For a Marxist / communist, literally anything is justified to bring about the Dictatorship of the Proletariat ‚Ä¶ i.e., the dictatorship of Marxist activists and ideologues. (Yes, right-wingers lie too, but at least some of them actually feel guilty about it.)

Marxist strategists long ago announced their intention to subvert and control America by mass deception and the systematic infiltration of its power structure, including academia and the mass media. And what do we now see? Extreme leftward bias in the corporate media, monopolization of intellectual commerce and high-level employment by leftist indoctrination mills / credentials factories like Harvard, politicians openly funded and controlled by Marxist organizations and front groups, Marxist platitudes and policies coming out of their mouths and pens and legislative deliberations in great profusion, and the openly hostile presence of certain problematical ‚Äúmarginalized‚Äù groups which did not arise in the US, but are being imported by the millions with full governmental knowledge of their unassimilability and the danger they pose to American unity and security.

This unmistakably implies the presence of enemies within, and our ‚Äúfriends‚Äù the Marxists are looking very good for it ‚Ä¶ certainly better than anyone else. It remains only to note that as always, the Marxists are secretly in bed with the wealth-and-power elite, as we see by the fact that corrupt corporate fascists like George Soros are funding domestic socialist groups, paying rabblerousers and demonstrators to riot, and generally fueling unrest with no resistance or explicit disapproval by the government. The ultimate goal has become obvious: a 2-tier neofeudal society with corporate fascism at the top as always, and communism for all the ‚Äúlittle people‚Äù down at the bottom (that way, people won‚Äôt ask why the rich have so much and they so little; they will concentrate on trying to stay alive while jealously watching each other to make sure that their rich masters have no annoying competition from lowly members of the proletariat).

Every time the Marxists take over and rule a nation, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before its citizens are disarmed, relieved of their freedom, and standing in bread lines, where they talk in very low voices lest the wrong word send them to the gulag, reeducation camp, or killing field. Meanwhile, the party elite - and of course, those by whom they are financially leveraged - fatten on the blood of the people, gorging until their wealth, power, and privilege exceed all bounds. This is the way it went in Russia, China, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Cambodia ‚Ä¶ and how it‚Äôs going right here, right now, in the Americas. It‚Äôs a massive, murderous, phenomenally abusive pseudo-utopian scam run by con artists with big ambitions and very little in the way of humanity, and it‚Äôs strictly for dummies.

If that‚Äôs really what you want, it can only be because you think you‚Äôll be part of the inner circle, the Politburo, the Supreme Soviet. But the problem is, so do you all ‚Ä¶ and at best, only a handful of you will make it. So the question is, how much of your soul will you sell to make the cut? ;)]"

The Individual should have the goal of doing the maximum good. By definition entertainment is not the maximum good. 

No TV shows. No movies. No video-games. No YouTube. No Reddit. No music. No traveling. No new experiences.

Only creative maximum goodness.Solzhenitsyn was a cold war hack. I do not feel he is worth reading, considering he died kissing Putin's ass.I haven't really done any research on the topic, but I have plenty of anecdotal evidence. A lot of my roommates had been abused physically and emotionally by their girlfriends. It surprised me because all of them had a macho, alpha facade but it quickly became apparent that their emotional weakness made them prey.Nothing other than tapping into the spiritual-religious drive humans are equipped with. He dissects scripture and provides a Jungian, self-help interpretation that I find to be more articulate and goal-oriented than Campbell's interpretations. His popularity shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone who understands that the West, more specifically the Anglophone Americas, have their cultural roots deeply embedded in Protestantism and the subsequent philosophies that were born out of that movement during the Enlightenment. However, I am convinced that he is missing a key component in fixing the West's ails. Explain to me exactly why staying informed of politics will aid in staving off evil. You're not voting very often, we (I assume, most of us) don't live in a direct democracy.  Sum total of all of your informing only makes a decision once every few years, still only of a representative.

I know I am quite wrong, but roughly, this is how I see it and I think you are understanding my point. Wrong in the sense that I can't speak of all countries, since they work differently politically, in the U.S you can call representatives, be informed of bills, etc. So there is more than a couple decisions a year.&gt;The socialization is way more important than the education anyway.


This is an interesting claim. Is the purpose of education to allow the child to develop into a fully functioning and autonomous individual?I've often thought if you're worried about who's on corporate boards and who's an MP, you don't have real problems, or if you do they are of a spiritual nature.

Virtually no one is an MP or on the board of a major company, as a percentage of the population. If you're in the running for either of those things you already have it great. So it is very hard to take it seriously compared to the real, grim poverty a lot of young men are facing without help. The classical Western traditions. They, especially the stoics, provide a pretty good justification for traditional values including the pursuit of objective truth and more importantly the pursuit of excellence. The latter point, the pursuit of excellence, seems to go almost entirely missed in his lectures. I'm of the opinion that the pursuit of excellence is more helpful to the nihilistic and the downtrodden than the pursuit of truth. You can't eat truth. You can't keep warm with truth. Truth doesn't necessarily give people meaning. However, pursuing excellence in something provides a goal, possibly monetary incentive, a sense of status and identity, a sense of fulfillment, etc. 

*EDIT*

It also strikes me that knowing the truth is a necessary component of pursuing excellence. So maybe he's trying to start at square one? Either way, it would still be beneficial for people to hear that they have a cause/talent/purpose, it's their responsibility to identify that (truth) and pursue it in order to reach their full potential. To tie it back to the classical traditions, the highest moral of the Greek heroes was arete (the pursuit of excellence). It was applied to males and females, warriors and wives, etc. because it transcends the mundane to speak to the human condition. Learn your local laws, obey your local laws, read Geoff Thompson, he's written the best stuff about avoiding violence and seeing the danger before it's too late. The best self defense is knowledge and being switched on.Epictetus "The Art of Living" and Marcus Aurelius "Meditations" are two of my favorite texts. I've always found the similarities between Stoicism and Buddhism quite fascinating, so if you like them, maybe check out the "Dhammapada." Meditations &gt; The Art of Living imo. skimming a summary of Rules for Radicals, it looks like [Rule 12](https://www.cheatography.com/davidpol/cheat-sheets/saul-alinsky-s-12-rules-for-radicals/) appears to have been deployed, *hard*, on JBP.  little did they know who they were messing with.


nasty, cowardly fuckers.Have you read Tolkien's *Silmarillion*? It's his mythos of Middle Earth as told by the elves. One of my favorite things about Tolkien is his, as you put it, understanding of the purpose of stories. He's another reason why I wish universities were still offering philology degrees. I've gotten really interested in evolutionary political psychology since I started listening to Gad Saad's lectures. I'm a political science major and one of my gripes with field is how much they're starting to borrow from sociology. I think bringing evolutionary science into all the humanities would steer them back towards the scientific method. I'll definitely have to check this book out. I read over your proposal and I have a few problems. It's basically trying to incentivize charity--that kinda makes it *not* charity--in the same spirit as social welfare programs. The government uses force (taxation) to build up a coffer. It then turns around and bribes talented individuals with the money it just took from them. 

I think it would be more productive and more moral for individuals and communities to breath some life back into the West's dying civic society. Churches and philanthropists were the pillars of civic society in the 20th century but that's now come to an end with our declining participation in organized religion, the introduction of the welfare state and globalism.91th percentile in matrix reasoning, yet 106 IQ, hmm. I'd guess maybe an accurate IQ test does include other tasks.

Can you try taking the iq test at iqtest.dk and report back your scores? It should be low by around 0.5-1 SD (7.5-15 points). So you'd score around 91-99 around this test.

It's a non-verbal raven's test. If you score higher than that I'm not sure what to make of multiple task tests vs. something like raven's. For example verbal ability seems a bit more crystallized if I think about it.Do you think collectives/collective action can be moral? 
*Symposium* and *The Republic* were my first exposure to Socrates and the Socratic method. I owe a lot of my debate style and appreciation for intellectual competition to Socrates. A thought arrived, loosely, that LSD in the 1960's was leading the way of postmodernism and other ways of seeing the world (even my own writing is infected by a flavor of postmodernism).

I knew that from my own test of low dosages of the substance, proved it to be a remarkable useful tool for something that I don't know how to explain properly. But my intuition tells me it, depending on the dosage, deconstructs the ego linearly in relationship to the dosage.

The effect of dissolution of the ego a little bit can make you see very clearly the untruth of whatever you're doing, which you know in the back of your mind. Or a certain bias which don't make you as reasonable as you can be. If you are for example very disagreeable, it can increase your agreeableness, or vice-versa, merely as a way of coping with the dissolution of the ego.

It had that effect on me and the only way for me to feel good was to submit and surrender that I was wrong, and that I need to clean my room, that I need to be nice and so on. (I am very disagreeable).

But after watching a bit of the latest Jordan B. Peterson video, she seems to, very clearly, not put LSD in the same ballpark as the rise of postmodernism, etc. [Also, the Foucault 1975 LSD trip changing him and his writing was very interesting to read about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/73et6x/foucault_after_his_1975_lsd_trip_neofoucault_and/)

I want to be very judging now, and say it straight in as few of a words as possible, which is a very packed way of seeing the world: The ego is the devil, and postmodernism is the ego run amok infecting the rest of society.

The minions who've been indoctrinated by government schooling, teachers, social and mass media, and the continuation of it, is worth being aware of. I have grown up and lived in a postmodern society and I've known that something is off ever since 1st grade.Heh, that's always the question isn't it? Although interestingly enough, in medieval Europe, through to nearly the present day for that matter, the king's mistresses were usually at least ostensibly married as a cover. Monogamy was such a strong institution that even the king couldn't openly monopolize more than one woman.Yes, the irony is movies have taught us that you claw to the top by screwing over as many people as possible. If you do that too often (and in some industries, once is too often), people won't do business with you and you'll tank. Even the psychopaths hide it and maintain some allies that they treat justly as a survival mechanism. Being a dishonest psycho by itself gets you weeded out.

Not that there isn't plenty of bad behavior, it's just that it's bad behavior within a context of what's tolerable and what's not. Like the mafia.What is your SAT score?Eh, I asked it because I've been mulling over the question for a few days and wanted an opportunity to talk it out with someone I assumed would answer yes.

So if I'm understanding you correctly, there is a difference between moral good and productivity. Collective, in this case government, action is justified if it is productive. Government action should be used but with care or else it becomes the archetypal Devouring Mother. Social welfare essentially embodies the Nurturing Mother but is inseparable from the negative aspect.

Why take the risk? If the Nurturing Mother and the Devouring Mother are one in the same, why should we trust the government to take on these roles?

It's certainly easier to correct something in the market than it is to correct the government's misuse of power. A bad company or organization doesn't last because they lose their customers, but a bad government has captives for customers and the power to compel them on a whim. 

The scores on iqtest.dk puts your IQ at 112.5-132.5 +-7.5
Your 2009 score was in the 83th percentile:
https://blog.prepscholar.com/sat-historical-percentiles-for-2010-2009-2008 

Conversions from SAT to IQ:
http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/SATIQ.aspx (121.04)
https://pumpkinperson.com/2015/04/11/converting-the-2400-sat-scale-to-iq/ (125.6261)

Your IQ seems very likely to be in the 120's.
What do you think?The SAT is an IQ test, and it correlates with other IQ tests at like 0.8-0.7, I haven't seen a low correlation with the little I searched. It's very likely his IQ is above 120 based on the SAT score alone.

The 83th percentile is a really high score in comparison to the general population with a large percentage who never do the SAT in the first place, that's another reason why 90th percentile IQ isn't that big of a stretch.

&gt;His IQ is likely around 106, but elements of his fluid IQ could reach 120. 

I think you mean crystallized.

&gt;I'm not sure if I understood this properly, but how far you can grow your verbal IQ is dependent on your fluid - so maybe he could take his verbal IQ to 120-125 by the time he turns 30 (since that's the end of the fluid plateau, and when it starts to drop).

You can for example memorize definitions with spaced repetition and likely score high on that part of the test. But so with any part, apparently Mensa thinks there's a ceiling in how high you can score from repeated practice. I reckon it's not a very high one. But they probably know IQ stuff, so I might be wrong.

&gt;Individual distribution is why having a particular score isn't a death sentence. I'm probably in the same boat, and I would take solace in having an above average verbal IQ, if my conscientiousness is at least moderately high - or whatever is deemed acceptable to succeed well enough.
Although I'm not certain, his matrix reasoning is probably more important in that category. To be at least 90 percentile is good.

I don't understand, what do you mean with individual distribution? Do you mean in occupations? Sure, one can probably work harder and optimize in other ways, there's plenty of factors except IQ. I think what slate star codex says in his post, I presume you've read it by now, to be good. Yours truly 90 IQ on 500 mg caffeine and 2 hrs sleep is featured in it.
http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/27/against-individual-iq-worries/Your SAT to IQ conversion with writing is 125.6261 while SAT verbal&amp;math is 121.04. So it's inflated by ~4 points...?

Didn't you say yourself that the average score is inaccurate if there is a huge difference between the subtests? I read a comment on a /r/mensa thread, which one guy said they don't even bother calculating the average score if there is a huge difference between subtests. I bet you can read some manual on the test to see if it is the case by yourself.

What I would do in your situation, I would increase my working-memory by dual n-back, and have the benefits of a high WM, for a high avg IQ score or not, and then practice something similar you scored low on. Rubik's cube come to mind, but there's probably something else.

Combining that with meditation for laser focus and low/medium-intensity, sustained, aerobic exercise. Then do the test again.

Why are you so interested in your IQ score anyway? If you took the SAT 8 years ago I presume you already have an occupation.



40 ug.

Other effects were: Feeling of being high and becoming higher, change in vibe of room &amp; certain colors, music was different, increased difficulty reading text &amp; pictures. Actually feeling &amp; being the music rather than listening, how I can describe it is in example, your arm has now become the drum beat. At the peak I had one strong closed-eye 'visualization' but it was only for a few seconds.

Emotional states were varying throughout the trip, I'd say it was tipsy an hour in, overwhelming towards the peak, with some lessening due to accepting the trip, then it slowly calmed down with the effects I explained in my original comment.

This video is on point: [The Acid Come Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diTGNucKVm0)Vaguely informative, kinda interesting. Not nearly as powerful or as pointed a message as the standard stuff from JBP. Thanks though- interesting to hear how regular Jungians think and talk. Speaker is sleepy, like Bob Ross. Just my own opinions.Both hold their utility, and are as important as eachother. Mapping out which is within which is kind of a matter of perspective. Where do you stand at that moment in time? 

Naturally if you're at the LHC you're not going to look toward folklore for your scientific predictions.  
But at the same time, the Data you get from the LHC has no utility unless it's processed by a human as Information, giving it some meaning to the human perspective.

The argument here comes down to an inherent human component in extrapolating meaning from data, which is consciousness. It's definitely important, but it doesn't mean one is nested within the other inherently. That's a huge misstep in the argument.

You can muddy the water by saying there's an inherent faith you need to have in the scientific method. If you want to go down to the quantum level, there's supposed evidence of an interaction between conscious observation and the nature of the nature of waves/particles.  
I agree there's a "blindness to consciousness," but is there a reason to go straight to the other side and say "Consciousness is at the very top level?"
 
I'm genuinely asking, it's a complicated argument and my thoughts must seem all over the place.And similarly, the human concept of God has come from the observation of reality to begin with. I trust that's not just me being pedantic.keep sorting

I don't mind it I just want to read the content I guess

#HYPEI have a year left in my under grad (Political Science) and every year I've noticed things getting a bit worse. Most of my prof's have been alright except in English, History and Sociology classes. They've all been Postmodern zealots. For example, my history prof this semester told us all that there's no biological basis for race. I think if it weren't for the fact that most of my Poli Sci profs were raised under communist regimes, they'd be just as bad as the others. 

The stuff that's been getting worse has been happening at the administrative level. They opened up a "Diversity and Inclusion" forum on our student website that's pretty much devolved into the typical SJW, Postmodern rhetoric. The admin has also invited a bunch of thinly veiled anti-white speakers to give guest lectures some of which are mandatory in freshman classes.

The students, mostly the women, aren't much better than the admin. I'm taking an online Poli Sci course this semester and in the class forum practically every female has been trying to argue that there's no biological difference between men and women and that psychology isn't linked to biology. We've also hosted BLM, an AntiFa-esque student socialist organization and several racially segregated student organizations. 

EDIT

Oh, and a lot of the school's surveys, some written by students others by profs/admin, are offering non-binary, etc. as options now for gender identification. I wrote a lovely note on the one my Health prof handed out about how she should stick to science if she's going to teach. Made me laugh out loud I listened to that podcast too.

I haven't tried Kundalini but I have had periods of super intense investment in Buddhist meditation and philosophy. I can attest to the mental benefits of that and I'd imagine Kundalini/yoga more generally would be similar. This is slightly off topic but what did you make of Brand's "surrender yourself," the individual is an illusion stuff? 

On some level I agree especially when they were discussing how people exist in relationship to one another--I'd expand that to all things. However, it sounded like Brand's ideas were a stone's throw away from slavery to whoever is smart enough to realize how easily dominated people who sacrifice their individuality are. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(linguistics)How many buckos has Niccolo sorted? Cause I'm pretty sure that bucko got sorted out of healthy shoulder sockets by the Medicis, and wrote a book on how buckos can unsort other buckos.The notion of an afterlife gives religions a carrot and stick. Behave properly in life and you get the carrot; behave badly and you get the stick. If you don't interpret these things literally, like JP does, then you create heaven and hell in life by your own actions. 

The rest of this all poor trolling. It's not worth the effort to address. I've noticed. It's easy to point out low quality trolls. It's also sad that so many of them are in fact low quality. Ah, the glory days of trolling when they were intellectual satirist instead of angry, celibate teens. I'd rather not share its name but I'll tell you about its circumstances. 

It's not particularly old or well known. It's rural and best known locally for its dentistry and nursing schools. It's publicly funded. It's got a fairly significant number of foreign students from the Middle East, India and Europe. Most of the American students are from the suburbs and rural communities. Another smaller portion of them are from major urban areas. I think a Christian view of this is it is not recommendedneeds more dank may maysTo be honest, I think your current state of mind is interpreting it as such. Which it is likewise for anyone else. I don't know why we're so different.It can be considered a part of IQ, e.g SAT has math and verbal section seperate. Generally I think SJW's are probably more intelligent than average.Why would that matter?Huxley had a hypothesis that the brain was a reducing valve for Mind-At-Large, which in Peterson's words is, roughly, One generic brain, that is the brain of the species, then we have a specific individual brain (like you and me), which has to be working as you have to take care of yourself as specific localized phenomena.

I have the hypothesis that certain brain networks/regions are more of a reducing valve than others, like the default mode network, which is mentioned in this article as the universal processor of stories. It links together with Being being a story:

"What the infinite lacks is the finite. ... If you could do absolutely everything you wanted at any point and be anywhere you wanted and be anything you wanted, if there was nothing that was out of your reach, there would be nothing to do. Because you'd be everything at once. When you're everything at once, which is, at least in principle; The position of God, there's no story and there's no being, and there's something about being that is a story and without limitation there's no story."

Psilocybin, for example, reduces blood flow to the parts of the brain which the default mode network is located at. This reduction, leads paradoxically, to an increase in experience. In many cases, it leads to a religious or mystical type experience, with direct experience of being Mind-At-Large, or this One generic brain along with positive emotion to turn it into a religious/mystical type experience.

Autobiographical tasks - like the one done in selfauthoring suite, is linked with DMN activation. I'm wondering what use and how the DMN and stories should be incorporated into one's own life as a specific localized entity, with the knowledge of cosmic consciousness. I myself do not have the realization.

Many say this to be an experience of 'ego death' and those who has continous experience of Mind-At-Large, might simply say that they're dead, with a body that remains. I wonder if this is efficiently a defense against totalitarianism. Worthwhile to be aware of.

[1984 Room 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3U83QLoATU)What you've written seems like a generic statement passed along by word of mouth. It isn't applicable to this website at all. It's not about clicks in the way you mean. It's about spreading their ideology. At least a clickbait site is about making money.

I'm not sure why clicking and complaining on a phony article is positive for the article, do you mean in something like google search rating?

This seems like a SJW website, which takes donations and does articles/videos like the one shown.Every time this gets brought up the opening lines of the Dhamapada come to mind:

&gt; All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriages.

&gt; All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.

Talking about mental health problems doesn't make you weak. If anything, it's an attempt to make yourself stronger. If you have a broken arm, you don't refuse to go to the doctor because seeking help is a sign of weakness.

My understanding is that things that make you weak are essentially negative self-talk (critical self-talk is a different beast) and lies. Don't tell lies to other people and don't tell lies to yourself. If something is causing you anxiety or some negative emotion, it's a sign that there's something in your life that needs changed or something that you need to do differently. &gt; Debunking blank-state denialism&gt;which can increase the site's position in search results

Please show source.

&gt;increase ad revenue, affect the type of ads which are promoted to you, etc

Why does it increase ad revenue?So, I'm asking for evidence, and all you have to provide is that it's novice-tier internet/advertising knowledge?Huh? Where in this Wikipedia article does it say clicking a link can increase the position in the search results?So you're assuming that google is able to record clicks from here, and therefore increase its search ranking result? Even if what you are saying is true, which I doubt, because anyone can run programs with web proxies and click their own site, or others and increase its rank. You have no evidence either way, just that it's obvious?

&gt;Then when people get on these websites you get another advertisement loop, where there will be ads on any particular website that if clicked on will send a small amount of revenue to that website. (PPC advertising). 

When was the first advertisement loop?

&gt;So the more clicks a website gets the higher the likelihood that it will get more traffic from search engines thus generating more money through PPC advertising once people are actually on the website.

Where are the ads on this webpage?&gt;I know google can record clicked links, because I used to manage the income stream of a few websites a friend of mine set up 2 years ago. Also because that is explicitly google's business model. They have incredibly intelligent algorithms which they use to detect people frauding on PPC advertising, as you would know, had you read the links sent to you. 

How can google record clicked links from reddit?The reason why I write as I do, because I know what you're saying is *incorrect*, I'm not sure why you're arguing for something you should know is *incorrect*, it's pretty fascinating to me. Obviously, google is not recording clicked links on reddit or an impression of site to increase pagerank. What the picture says which you've linked is outbound link existence. Meaning, simply by the link being there - the google bot considers this a 'vote', along with any other information provided on the page. But they've might have changed their algorithm.

Fascinating to see people talk about things which they really know nothing about. Like I said previously to wa001, what he wrote was simply a generic statement out of word of mouth. The rest what you all wrote was in an equal manner, completely irrelevant and seems very artificial / confirmation bias / ideology to me, respective to the context of the website. AGREEABLENESS: 57

The $ per traffic visitor most likely goes down by people, linked through here, who visits the site. Because for this website it's probably $ donated per visitor, which would go down as I don't imagine many would donate from here. It doesn't lend credibility to your original thesis.No, the revenue model of the website is donation-based, it seems, and the money-making is completely casual to the amount donated, with the information we have. That means that as long as people don't donate, they will not get a single more dollar. But it's useful for them in general to know that for example 100 visitors a day gives them $50, therefore 1000 would return $500 a day. So if they gain traffic from solely people like previous prediction was based on, revenue per visitor would stay approximately the same.It's the opposite. When I asked how google records clicked links on reddit, is a testament to his lack of knowledge, by linking pagerank.

&gt;you're talking to a person fluent in the questions you ask because of work that they've done.

Fluent in the questions I ask? I haven't really seen any proof of work, that could be determined in correctly answering my questions.

&gt;they speak from direct personal experience and corroborate it with evidence from elsewhere.

What evidence? Questions I've asked have not been answered.

&gt;you ignore good information, make unfounded objections, and ask redundant questions. none of your activity in this discussion has been in good faith.
what's the agenda here?

Nothing that was said was really true. I still can't believe people are unable to see the limits of certain heuristics, like that "visiting = money for them", when it comes to websites like this. Since he's an alt-righter, he probably developed the heuristic on YouTube, where it's accurate, as viewing videos still gives views, and engaging with the content also increases search result.I've listened/watched to a lot of Alan Watts, unsure what the similarities are though.If you need a woman beyond what she's desperate to give you you're only putting yourself in a position to hurt yourself. Agree or disagree?I did suspect that, but that information feels too unreliable and questionable to be used to have the most relevant search results for a specific query. &gt;Either way, acting like this website, or any website for that matter, does not care about the amount of traffic it gets is absolutely preposterous.

The not so thought out comments is not good. I asked simply, why does it matter to not give them clicks, to /u/tempaccountnamething and /u/wa001 with 7 points responded the following:

&gt;"Clicks drive website traffic metrics, which drive ad dollars. ... You are not paying them - the advertisers are."

Which is a completely irrelevant statement and is preposterous, as there are no ads which make up "ad dollars" in this statement, on this website.

Then /u/3bedrooms doubled down with 4 points with the following statement:
&gt;"... increase ad revenue, affect the type of ads which are promoted to you, etc. ..."

Again, a lie or foolishness.

Low and behold,  yours truly /u/Lo-G come to the rescue, saying you blocked 3 ads, I don't see any ads, it might've been simply trackers, and therefore you perpetuated misinformation.

I am surprised of the amount of people unable to see the obvious reality here, good to know. It makes your out-group even stronger.&gt;You were right that this website's main source of income does not seem to be advertising goods, products or services. However that is not the main point of this conversation, which is about whether or not clicks matter. The goal of this website is to spread ideology. 

Which I've said myself in my first response:

&gt;It's not about clicks in the way you mean. It's about spreading their ideology.

.

&gt;However that is not the main point of this conversation, which is about whether or not clicks matter.

No, this IS the main point of the conversation, it's you who think otherwise. I have not been trying to refute this, but the inability to acknowledge the technical errors 'the end justifies the means'-attitude is downright despicable in my view. I asked why it matters to not click, and someone could give the hypothesis that it they receive funding as per amount of traffic their ideology reaches, which is a reasonable argument. 

That would be appropriate for my original comment and not down the chain, and I admit I made the similar mistake of not allowing the discussion to tangent of out of the original ad comment not being applicable here.

If the traffic reaches the opposing view, isn't that a waste of money if everyone who reads it has already made up their mind? So that hypothesis isn't that good, and in fact, it's a conspiracy anyway, it's not known to be the case. It's speculation, we can't know that the revenue by is proportional to traffic (not out of donations), but we do know it is by donations.

This is what happens when people do the straw man fallacy endlessly, no matter, I know now that people justify the end with the means of technical errors.My response to your comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/74rlqa/the_mob_is_after_jbp_again_conversation_with/do34r6y/

Was in most part response to your first statement: 

&gt; "So, in other words, if more people click the link, the website makes more money? "

So that added to the confusion and I shall make sure I cite better what I respond to, sometimes.

Just wanted to add that, nothing more, or less.To ruin the joke, but that answer is incorrect. It didn't ask of one's opinion on time, past, future, duality, existence, meaning and so on. Not everyone likes to give The Independent clicks and archive.is isn't working for me right now. I just posted the whole article in the text box for those reasons. This sounds very similar to what he said regarding sorting yourself out, maybe this is the predecessor that gave birth to Sort Yourself Out.

Turn Yourself On.That is a good point, can you post your article elsewhere? For instance on reddit?I don't think putting rights in a hierarchy is helpful or a solid way of framing them if your intention is to keep them. Maybe it's helpful in personal situations where you're faced with a decision to sacrifice one in order to preserve another, but then applying that personal hierarchy, something you really only need in extreme situations, to society provides a nice utilitarian/altruistic argument for eroding those at the bottom. If life is more important than property, then we should give up our property to help people who can't survive. If the right to self-defense is more important than the right to free speech, then we should silence people who we perceive to be speaking violently.Indirectly signaling high IQ since it's so correlated.How does it feel like to be smart?Can someone send me a PDF please can't find itThe pdf is corrupted I think it wont let me view it in google drive and when I download it it dosent work eitherhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0No problem buckoagreed, it does exist, JP is wrong here imo .

Don't bring the Chinese. The Chinese was affected by the migration of white tribes following Alexander's conquests, and was stuck in the same way for 2,000 more years until the Brits visited.Prior to 1913 the world was built on richer people. The poorer people simply did not matter and we are simply going back to these das.

Poorer people don't know where his castle is, and chances are it is well protected. And poorer people do not think that they are being exploited by Zuck, since they don't pay taxes to him, etc. so they have no reason to attack him. But when Zuck and his friends begin to buy out everything which directly affects the lives of poorer people, things will change.

Many parts of the Bible have to be taken literally as they are spoken of as such: a literal Flood and Noah's Ark, literal Adam and Eve and a talking serpent, etc. since Jesus talks about the end of the world being like the literal Flood and the New Testament talks about the death of Jesus being a sacrifice for the literal original sin of Adam and the sins of the world.

Here's a study reviewing human interventions, which hasn't received a grant from the National Dairy Council , which, unlike rat nutrition studies, are applicable to humans. If you have a pet rat, advice the rat on the literature, so the rat can decide for itself. 

Note: I haven't read the studies, only skimmed the abstracts, etc.

&gt;The increase in the LDL to HDL ratio for each % of energy was 0.038 (95%CI 0.012-0.065) for ruminant trans fatty acids, and 0.043 (95% CI 0.012-0.074) for conjugated linoleic acid (p = 0.99 for difference between CLA and industrial trans fatty acids; p = 0.37 for ruminant versus industrial trans fatty acids).

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2830458/I meant macro-balance in comparison to refined vs. unrefined foods and health.&gt;When more carbs are introduced and the body can no longer hold glycogen, you turn it into adipose, body fat.

No, the body prefers to store dietary fat rather than converting carbohydrates to body fat, because the conversion costs energy. So an excess in calories leads to a direct storage of dietary fat.

It's just plain wrong. Search de novo lipogenesis and how rarely it occurs.

&gt;Your body prefers to use glycogen first, so if you want to lose weight, you use up glycogen first. Then and only then does your body use stored fat. 

You lost the glycogen, which is weight, but I'm not sure why you'd be keen on simply losing weight, like water and muscle. A more noble goal is to lose body-fat and retain or build muscle mass. Carbohydrates is completely irrelevant for this goal.

A 80% calories from carbohydrates diet and &lt;10% from dietary fat has shown weight loss, a reduction in blood pressure and reducing or eliminating completely blood-pressure medication and diabetes medication, fasted blood sugar levels dropped in those which had a high level to begin with

note: have only read a review, not the study itself.
&gt;As for fat? Well the Inuit eat meat and blubber, they're not fat, not heart attacky. Pre-agriculture, we probably ate some version of keto---fat, protein, veggies, and sweets and starches were treats but not available daily. 

It is an appeal to nature.

&gt;So yeah: if you cut sugar and flour entirely, and limit natural starches and sweet fruit to occasionally, fat and protein are good, and you don't even have to watch veggie carbs at all

Fat and protein are not good or bad, because both are macro-nutrient, it's what makes up the fat and protein which is good or bad. You don't mean that it's good respective of food source? This is just lazy thinking.

Not sure what you mean with natural starches, again a category, how annoying.agreed--it's a great example of LCK's ability to find thin wedges of truth between hilarity, awkwardness &amp; tragedy. 

[this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHrXtzYC0Jc&amp;t=2s) isn't necessarily representative of the main show focus, but it's a great illustration of finding humor in contentious situations that simply don't lend themselves to any resolution except a kind of negotiated empathy. Which is what I think as well. Macro ratios as a health intervention isn't that relevant **in comparison to** unrefined vs. refined food, is my point. If you just quote that paragraph, then obviously it sounds off.Doctors have very little to none nutritional education.I don't think the study is flawed, but drawing unjustified conclusions from it to address public opinion on a certain diet is dangerous and irresponsible. Diets specified by macro-nutrients are on a spectrum of healthiness, due to quality of foods which make them up. So this study shows that high-carb, low-fat *without* accounting for food quality or processing leads to these results on an epidemiological level. 

I think the debate should be whether we should follow government policies at all. The policies tell us, reduce this, that, increase that, replace this. It never shows us the science of what's best and then let us decide for ourselves, rather it tends to not go overboard as they believe the public won't follow the advice if it's too radical. I'd rather know that my lifestyle is unhealthy and choose to pursue it on my own, due to time restrictions or whatever, rather than believe that it really doesn't matter that much. That it is only about reducing consumption of certain foods and increasing of another.&gt;The food pyramid defined nutrition for an entire generation. It shaped how the market changed over the last 50 years.

It was introduced in 1992. That's 25 years.&gt;You're saying that high refined sugar, high animal fat diet that the majority of the USA follows is based on diet guidelines?
&gt;They bathe in refined sugars and fast food, how is that a guideline?
That's just a crazy conspiracy. People eat what they want to eat.
All popular food is heavily demonized as unhealthy (red meat, bacon, sodiepops, etc.) yet people still heavily consume them. People don't give a fuck. If it tastes good, we'll eat it.

Those are the guidelines yes, "natural sugar" in the forms of refined grains and low-fat milk. Plenty of diary, animal fats and protein without any regard of source, like excluding red meat.

https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/archived_projects/FGPPamphlet.pdf

The guidelines were bad, but the naive belief that anyone would follow them from those who made the guidelines, is even worse, and it turned out to lead people believing fat = bad, so they built a marker around "low fat" foods with plenty of sugar. It's especially good for maintaining the circadian rhythm, if you eat breakfast (break - fast), exactly the time you want to wake up and/or do wake up, as J.P recommends, then eat for 8 more hours with a timer. If you have to work or go to school soon after you wake-up it doesn't work as well as you don't have as much ability to eat, so you'd have to wake up really early in those cases. For example 5 a.m to eat food until 8 a.m. and then again at lunch 12 a.m to 1 p.m, and begin fasting until 5 a.m again.Keto is not good or bad. It matters what more of the quality of foods you eat than the inherent macro-nutrient composition of your overall diet. That doesn't mean the latter is unimportant. It just means you can't say keto is good or bad in general.Whether the food is processed or unprocessed, or minimally processed. For example, nuts is better than olive oil, although olive oil is pretty good, because you get the dietary fiber and the structure of the food intact. In the same way oats are better than refined wheat flour, which is processed wheat with the shell removed, removing a lot of dietary fiber, minerals/vitamins, and the structure compromised. Some foods release certain compounds that are beneficial due to structure compromise, probably as an evolutionary adaption, like onions and garlic, that are good for us. But you don't have to mash them, just chop.

Consider eating a whole-foods plant-based diet monitored using cronometer, and supplementing vitamins, minerals and certain dietary fats which are necessary. Cronometer is a tool which you put in your foods and see if you get enough of everything each day. Let me know if you are interested and I can go into more detail, what you have to supplement, etc.Because people were eating "too much dietary fat" according to the government, they decided to focus on limiting dietary fat to bring the dietary fat level of the whole population down. I suspect this indirectly lead to the belief that dietary fat is bad, through whatever mechanism. It also probably built because people believing bodyfat = dietary fat in some fashion.

When wanting to become healthier, one believed that a fat-free source was the better choice. That would include meats "lean meat", sugar-filled fat-free yogurt, etc, and that refined grains were good to eat.&gt;Yet still USA per capita eats the biggest amount of meat in the world. Even if it is just poultry it's still much more calories than vegetables per mass.

Since meat was included in the guidelines, I presume people eat as much meat as they want.

&gt;Health fads are propagated by health gurus not government. If people think fat-free or gluten-free or whatever makes them healthier it's because there was someone selling them that narrative and the consumer liked it.

Government policy is what decides school, hospital food, etc. So you can't exclude government policy. Obviously schools teach the food pyramid and other government policies, and that influences the market.

&gt;I'm pretty sure that the most popular faddists today are the antisugar ones, yet people are still sick and obese because they eat what they want.

What's the problem with being a fad if it's legitimate? Like an anti-sugar fad, which doesn't seem to be that popular and thus a fad, if as you say, people eat what they want.That's not nutrition.I know many people do that, I wonder if it can lead trouble with the circadian rhythm. It's naturally done because it's hard to fit in your meals with responsibilities, unless you work and study at home for example. I intend to simply wake up very early and go to bed early to do intermittent fasting.

If you mean anecdotal evidence, there is none in the article as far as I can tell.

Here are two paper which were cited in the article:

https://sci-hub.ac/10.1016/j.amjmed.2014.04.003

https://sci-hub.ac/10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.839

I haven't read them.Let me know if you find anything to the contrary. I use nutritionfacts.org and skim the sources (studies) it cites.Jordan B. Peterson got famous, in my view, because of the YouTube algorithm favoring him with "alt-right", due the SJW attacks on him. It has obviously attracted people of different opinions in that sphere who flocked to him.

I, too, have read some post histories like you have done and been very surprised, but I don't feel the need to call people out on the spot for what they've said in the past, in fact it doesn't really address the argument at hand I am arguing against. They might've changed-which we do every moment of the day.

Obviously, white identity is on the rise, which is fine, it's just boring, but memes in that sphere are funny. J.P has spoken a lot on this. I'm sure those who identify as their race and turn on the temperature here knows about it, or is still working on it in the background.

https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/76e04x/post_from_rsamharris_about_this_sub_being/Let me be clear that parts of nutrition, like molecules, biochemistry, metabolism, isn't what I mean here, but the full-scale impact of diets and other lifestyles have on the body as that being "Nutrition". For example, if a patient has type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, [it can be reversed](https://sci-hub.ac/10.1186/1475-2891-13-99) (have only read article of the study) and arteriosclerosis, high cholesterol, (no source) with a whole-foods plant-based diet. It says in the second article (which you mention), with citation 3:

&gt;The most recent statistics on the hours of instruc-
tion were released in 2010.
3
A study of 109 medical
schools found that the state of nutrition education
had barely changed, if not deteriorated, in the 25
years since the National Academy of Sciences report.
The share of schools requiring a dedicated course in
nutrition had fallen to 25%, and the average amount
of nutrition education for students was down to 19.6
hours.

The first study says:

&gt;Nutrition education is in even shorter supply following medical school graduation. 
A 2013 document from the Accreditation Committee of Graduate Medical 
Education (ACGME) specifies detailed requirements for specialty training in 
Cardiovascular Disease.
Training must include, for example, performance of 10 
cardioversions, interpretation of 150 echocardiograms, and participation in 100 
cardiac catheterizations.
7
However, in this 34-page accreditation document for cardiology trainees, there is 
no mention of a requirement for nutrition education. And in a 35-page ACGME 
document for Internal Medicine residency training, from which many doctors go 
on to serve as primary care physicians, the word 
‚Äú
nutrition
‚Äù
 is absent.

&gt;Accordingly, physicians frequently lack substantive nutrition knowledge and 
counseling skills necessary to successfully guide their patients. A recent study 
found that only 14% of resident physicians believed they were adequately trained 
to provide nutritional counseling.
9 
Paradoxically, patients believe otherwise. A 

&gt;survey of the public conducted by the American Dietetic Association in 2008 
showed that 61% consider doctors to be 
‚Äú
very credible
‚Äù
 sources of nutrition 
information.
&gt;Also not sure what you mean by NIDDM being reversible. Blood sugars and a1c levels can be controlled through diet, but they're still going to be diabetic.

What if a1c levels drop below 6? Or to what is considered normal, isn't that considered non-diabetic, hence reversing diabetes?Have you tried beans like lentils, with proper soaking and cooking?

I remain skeptical on focusing on macro-nutrients. You can still eat unprocessed and balance macro-nutrients. Makes no sense to choose to eat processed but balance macro-nutrients and think that's healthy.&gt;thermogenic properties of micronutrients

Macronutrients is the correct word here.


Weight loss isn't that interesting, bodyfat loss is more interesting. If  you don't eat enough protein, and don't weight train for example, you lose a lot of muscle, and think it's good. So for body fat loss, macro nutrients and training do matter.&gt;That thread doesnt cite a single source to back its claims either.

Which claims? It's common sense that soda and beans are different and that you can compare them. Unless you've been living under a rock, trans-fats and processed meats is also well-known for what I stated, and the latter, for decades.&gt;using animal fat for cooking is apparently a one-way ticket to obesity, even though cooking with animal fat has been all but eliminated from the American diet, yet we're fatter than ever.

No, but heart disease.Traditional Okinawa diet. Where they eat mostly purple and orange sweet potatoes. They're probably also quite social, rest and avoid bad stress (exercise is good stress),Sure, calories in/out do matter significantly for body fat loss. 

A certain amount of Omega-3 and Omega-6 is necessary, as well as overall dietary fat intake due to the necessity it has in taking up minerals, vitamins from food. Polyunsaturated fats seems to be optimal to me, from for example walnuts. The ratio between unsaturated to saturated is key here, walnuts is better than cashews, for example. I don't like the raw taste as much as cooked btw, if you don't like it.&gt;no matter what the macro-nutrient composition

I think you mean no matter what the quality of the foods. Still the Keto diet can be bad for other conditions. You'd rather not have epilepsy and not have a diet-related disease, I'm just stating the possibility.

&gt;CONCLUSION:
A low-carbohydrate diet based on animal sources was associated with higher all-cause mortality in both men and women, whereas a vegetable-based low-carbohydrate diet was associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality rates.

~~Excellent film, thanks to Jordan I noticed the archetypal high disgust-sensitivity occurrences &amp; order during my re-watch, among other things~~


~~When he was on the bus and made the soldier/guard get out by triggering disgust was excellent.~~

That was a situation in the movie. Here's one about order and disgust. Maybe there is a transcript somewhere. Don't have any reading, sorry.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBWyBdUYPgkCan you explain your joke?we should create one OP

it's basically just journalling about your past, present, and future afaik so I'm sure you can get some benefits from just doing that in general - journal about how past problems made you fel and work through them, present problems and planning on how to overcome them, and problems you want to solve in the future?That may be, but I wouldn't count on it. Seen it go the other way all too often.Very conservative with the socks, today. Is he OK?&gt; Do you think Dr. Peterson sometimes says things that can make people feel bad?

Yes, and personally I don't really think it is necessary. It is possible to discuss and work on the same problems without resorting to such language, and other successful people do take this approach.

You could make a case for some people benefiting from a more "blunt" approach. Others are made worse by it and "rebel" against the messenger, and it is not good to use such an approach for them.

Maybe just take the things you love that he says, but translate them into more positive language?jus b urselfwould not trust even JBP with that, definitely write offline edit: additionally JBP should be openly criticized for having sensitive personal info like this on his servers, even if it is not personally identifiable - he may not know better about the tech involvedfor a little something different from a stateless-capitalist viewpoint, privatization is different than free speech. That is to say, that on your private property, do you usually allow criminal speech and other opinions you don't like or would you voluntarily censor them? There is a lot of private censorship that is ok. Censorship has gotten a bad name, but we censor all the time - we choose to listen to things we like and avoid things we don't like.

So understanding implications of private property has given me a totally different view of free speech. I think I would only allow it within certain contexts on my property. I wouldn't want to invite SJWs over and have them constantly speaking abrasive comments. And then if society was entirely privately owned, then each person would be engaging in this voluntary censorship to varying degrees. There would be free speech zones, but also a lot of places with speech codes. Yet no one would be forcing people to be a free speech zone or to have speech codes, that is the difference. 

I'm not sure totally free speech would be entirely desirable. There's also the point related to this that we currently have regulations on speech, like against defamation and libel and things like that.&gt; Peterson believes that a statement is "true" if it assists the survival of humans

yikeshttps://twitter.com/i/moments/851713200537993216?lang=en  
Don't know if you trust this list, but it's what got me thinking initially.As above with the request for [citation.] https://twitter.com/i/moments/851713200537993216?lang=en

I'm not saying that all rapists become male feminists, or that all male feminists are rapists.  
I don't think feminism in males causes rape, personally. There's no A-B line there in my mind.  
I can easily imagine a rapist becoming a feminist in an attempt at redemption.Bingo, when you call someone a Nazi, you are trying to give social permission that hurting them, maybe killing them is alright. The accusation is the verdict, doesn't matter if it's true.As long as it's through a hole in a sheet.About 34 year old man, this might be where the thought came from. I've carefully looked into the void of internet pedophilia and pedophile talk pages in less wonderful places around the net.  
What is interesting is that, they tend to say that "pedophilia is normal," after all "there's a lot of porn of women dressed school girls on the internet" and "videos of girls proclaiming they're barely 18," as if the pre-action 'interview' was there simply to reenforce that.

This seems unrelated, but there's something there. I noticed that to the pedophiles in pedo chat rooms, everyone else is a pedophile too, and he's just being honest with himself.  
The end result of ideas is different, pedos want to be accepted as normal. It's probably a higher level of delusion than a rapist wanting to stop others from raping.  
I could maybe thing it was misguided yet valient for a rapist to stop rape, even though they can't stop themself.

You're clearly trying to say something here and I just don't understand, sorry.&gt; a protester who had reportedly hit his vehicle with a baton

hitting the car with an instrument while the people were in there was definitely provoking them, and they did not hit the target (perhaps did not intend to but only to scare them), I guess we need more info to know exactly what happened

https://www.thedailybeast.com/3-men-charged-in-shooting-after-neo-nazi-richard-spencers-speechI'll use more formal language if it makes you feel better. 

The occurrence as evidenced several times over to be a theme among male feminists who make themselves quasi-public figures seems to point towards a tangible percentage of male feminists being sex offenders.  
The reason this is of concern is that it runs counter to what, on the surface, a male feminist idealises in terms of general male-female interaction.

As for GamerGate, obsessing is a strong word. The movement has broken up, but the sentiment still exists that game journalists aren't representative of game players. I wouldn't call that unique to games, but hey, I don't control culture. The wording is, "let me pose an idea on why rapists BECOME male feminists."

Of course, there are male feminists who aren't rapists. Perhaps a majority, I'd say that's likely. At a conservative estimate, I'd guess there are 1 million male feminists in America. Normal rape statistics don't even fill that estimate. Nevermind news reports of self-purported feminists turning out as rapists.  
I say a majority aren't rapists, like I'd say a majority of Muslims aren't suicide bombers. If a Majority of Male Feminists WERE rapists, I think the feminists would actually have something to complain about.i liked this exchange--both make valid points. good posts.This thread is becoming even more interesting, if anyone qualify (or not)has an answer to this I'll be pleased to hear about it Don't want this to go down that's an emergency Thanks for the advice I might do so since I can't think of something right now I have it somewhere I'll upload it when I get to my computer. If I don't just reply here later to remind me.I will check both out. Thank you.

I've been procrastinating reading it for a week I think, but once I got going it flowed through smoothly. 
I highly recommend reading the entirety of the article and not stopping, in one go, schedule the time if necessary.

The top content warning said the following: 
&gt;"Try to keep this off Reddit and other similar sorts of things."

But I think it's an important article bringing the kind of feeling to me of stepping back, taking a big breath and seeing *what's really going on*.Yeah I'll send it later today sorry forgot to yesterdaylegalizing the free market might be easier than UBI schemes? ? ?

The value of the dollar has declined 96% since the Fed was created in 1913 (roughly 20x). So if minimum wage was $8 somewhere, and all else equal, the minimum wage value would be worth $160 an hour. 

This is only one strong example of what regulation of the market has done.

Edit: Secondary source citation - http://www.zerohedge.com/news/41-years-after-death-gold-standard-look-how-we-ended-economic-purgatoryThese make my day, thank you.good on you to inquire in good faith.

you're unlikely to find a monolithic opinion. "the folks here" in /r/JordanPeterson vary drastically on almost every subject. some of the opinions are carefully considered, some seems poorly--perhaps barely--thought out. monitor threads that you find to be interesting in &amp; of themselves &amp; reach out directly to those who you believe make cogent, careful points.

i view gender manifestation as a component of individual autonomy. i privilege the individual's ability to self-shape over almost everything else--to the point where many others find my views peculiar. i view broadly accepted legislation on drugs, seat belt use or federal anti-discrimination to be fundamentally flawed &amp; well-worth doing away with. as such, i favor giving cognitively functional adults as much ability to self-determine as possible.

all of the above is different--in some cases, directly **opposed**--to favoring laws which allow individuals to **compel** expression upon others. using legal fiat to mandate pronouns is both authoritarian as well as, given the absurdity of the ever-expanding list thereof, sinister. the freedom, right &amp; maybe duty to **self-determine** does not involve the freedom, right or duty to **dictate to others**. there's a reason politeness isn't law, &amp; it has to do with the trade off in personal autonomy. 

separate &amp; aside from my objection to laws that regulate expression is the maddening conflation of cultural concepts, by definition malleable, with broadly established biological facts. the idea that gender, spectrum &amp; sexuality vary independently is so demonstrably wrong, so evidently &amp; conclusively wrong that i view its proponents with the same level of skepticism reserved for self-avowed stalinists or white supremacists. 

some numbers:

as of july 2014 via the national health interview survey, **1.6%** of americans self-identify as lesbian or gay.

as of april 2011, about **0.3%** of americans self-identify as transgender.

from the **0.3**% who self-identify as transgender, **98%** report to be attracted to the opposite sex after the transition--**meaning that 0.006% of americans are simultaneously "trans" and "gay."** to purport that the existence of this population proves variability is either stupid or mal-intentioned beyond belief, intersectional navel-gazing notwithstanding. we're looking at a binomial distribution with statistical noise, not a "gender spectrum."

your family members must be free to pursue fulfilling relationships with transgender individuals, and for those individuals to have the **same** protections under the law as any other person. simultaneously, i view the right of ill-mannered neighbors to mutter "faggot-ass he-bitch," and your own right to retort with "shut the fuck up, you hateful piece of shit" as sacrosanct. 
From your link :cough:
"Non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression may very well be interpreted by the courts in the future to include the right to be identified by a person‚Äôs self identified pronoun.   The Ontario Human Rights Commission, for example, in their Policy on Preventing Discrimination Because of Gender Identity and Expression states that gender harassment should include ‚Äú Refusing to refer to a person by their self-identified name and proper personal pronoun‚Äù.  In other words, pronoun misuse may become actionable, though the Human Rights Tribunals and courts.  And the remedies?  Monetary damages, non-financial remedies (for example, ceasing the discriminatory practice or reinstatement to job) and public interest remedies (for example, changing hiring practices or developing non-discriminatory policies and procedures).  Jail time is not one of them."Absolutely, if I had to do it all over again, sales engineer would bear some thinking. The sales engineers I work with seem to make bank and just take orders, they don't even seem to have to run around "prospecting" or chasing leads. Just pay attention to what's in the RFQ, talk to the customer like a human being, and cash hefty checks.It's an intelligence test that is oddly enough the official intelligence test of the NFL. :(

Damn right on target man
I was sad because I feel overwhelmed by the fact that my new classmates were all knowing each other and seemed to have another clown  quite manipulative who appears to be in the same class and seemed much more accepted in the group than I was 

So I "disguised" myself into someone that have a tragic event in his life and decided to be more cold for that other believes that I'm not hating the fact that I would not be able to be the clown once again because I felt part reject and didn't felt able to do confrontation for this. That would have been pretty stupid... But today I know what is stupid and what is not :/

But being that much alone didn't help me at all, I endured major depression and I lost my ability to be quick on my feets

I remember when I was hanging out with my friends that I met before I endured this depressive episode that I was telling them that I didn't felt all right at all, that my own think process was fucking slow and have difficulty speaking normally. 

Yeah, I even lost the speech ability during this

I've always been rather popular so classmates who didn't knew me heard about me and my craziness and those who knew me tries as hard as they could to make me come back again but that was not that easy, even tho I was cooperative I couldn't be back to normal in just few weeks, so most of them gave up and I lost almost all of them 

Afterwards when I move on I was obviously under social anxiety, so much isolation had me killed and I struggled as much as I could to get back to normal, after several month I managed to do so. 

Right now I'm good looking if I was to compare myself now to this experience, however I've recently broke out of rage and isolated myself one more time two weeks ago (not for the same reason) because I couldn't go to a party, I was too much pushing myself even being physically and mentally tired, and this because I neglected my own well-being, I was so much preoccupied by running after people that I literally forgot myself last few months.

Not even a minute of introspection. That's why now I don't want to fuck up anymore with what should I do later, where should I look for my own well-being, I'm revisting my past self and trying to reconnect with it, but I'm afraid that's counterproductive 

That's why I managed to get the Self-authoring program that I recently started, (I've done present suit, now I'll be on past) hoping that it will help me to finally reach my best self and find the right place for me to fit in. 

That was long sorryhttps://introvertdear.com/news/introverts-alone-time-science-marti-olsen-laney/

Okay this article seems to explain more about it 
Maybe because I'm so engaged with my environment I can get tired by the end of the day lol 
I was under the impression that an extrovert one couldn't even bare being alone a night 
Probably true for some tho Bingo, human beings hate anyone being in their blindspot. I try to stay out of others blindspots for this very reason.Just as an aside, I think it's a mistake to think of Peterson as an orthodox Christian. From listening to him, he's more Christianity friendly than someone that would be recognized as a fellow Christian by other Christians.

That being said, if you believe Christianity is true it is ultimately pragmatic looked at from a timescale of eternity. There's nothing more useless than going to hell. Again though, you have to believe it to be true.

If it is more "useful" to you to use some Christian techniques, you are not a Christian in the traditional sense. Same way that I use stoic techniques from time to time, but I am not a true stoic, it is in service to my own Christianity, or at least it should be.Where it explicitly says that what Jordan Peterson is afraid of, criminalizing using the wrong pronoun, is possible. It then threatens someone with dreadful punishments but "no jail time" which will disappear if you do not wish to submit to the fine, or other court directed action. So saying Jordan is lying seems like a serious stretch, when this quote seems to confirm exactly what the man is saying.Or, alternatively, it will be used as an excuse to goon political enemies (Mark Steyn, et. al.). I see where you're coming from, but I don't trust the judgement of the enforcers or the vagueness of the way the law is written. All of these types of laws are put through with the "reasonable" explanation that they will "only" be used a certain way. Then human nature takes over.

What if JP persistently refuses to use statements or phrases he believes are false? What if YOU do? Why are we regulating what people say AT ALL?&gt;They have not articulated to themselves that it means anything other than "fairness"

the ambiguity is a feature, not a bug. it creates space for for the logical inconsistencies inherent in intersectional theories. 

orwell's animal farm gave us the language to skewer pretense at equality ("**all X are equal, but some are more equal than others**") but no such cultural scaffolding has been erected to  define &amp; defend "equity" or "fairness." it seems as if both terms serve more to obscure than clarify--which is entirely in line with post-modernist theories on power struggles &amp; representation in language.

this is not a unique phenomenon. think about phrases like "pro-choice" or "pro-life"--they're absurd. the pace at which this is happening on all quarters of public life is increasing: witness the serial imbecilities that assaulted us during the u.s. general election.Once during a soccer match when 7 or 8 yrs old (yeah my parents registered me against my will) I was at goal and I didn't pay attention to the game, I was living myself somewhere else lmao 

Jurassic Park was my favorite movie ever 

Yeah that's an important fact you'll get it 

After like 10 minutes of match I've started mauling in air and acting like a T-rex, I left my  goals (cage Idk how to say in English) and I imitated the T-rex for like 5 minutes and my mother and their friends were dying laughing 

Same for the my team and my coach left confused and disconcerted witnessing such an uncommon event, I cooled down by myself when the match was over 

I didn't do it just to make them laugh, I was enjoying doing it by myself 

Damn Rexy is so badass after all, no shame given in 

So yeah I'm not firstly interested in physical things I guess, doesn't prevent me from regularly doing workout today tho 

Sorry this has nothing to do there lmao just feel like sharing itIM LOOKING FOR APPROPRIATE ANSWERS 

Thanks for cooperating, I know they might be not easy to find out :DA little OT, but oddly pertinent...
:real conversation had by me recently:
(Watching a lobster tank while waiting for service at a restaurant)

"When one of the lobsters who's at the bottom of the pile wants to get out, what does he do?"
"I don't think that's a decision he gets to make."Excuse me my English may be bad 

I'm going to write it again clearly so that you understand the problem ultimately a religious question to me, sometimes religiously it is important to break the false "peace" with some free speech. Other times not so much, and in many other non-religious cases not so much

edit: I wrote the above BEFORE reading the comment. Homosexuality and abortion are sins and morally wrong, people shouldn't go overboard making gays and abortionists "feel guilty", there can be excessive shaming, but both of those activities are seriously wrong - total silence would also be seriously wrong in the face of such topics (although there may be cases where, since the people involved cannot be improved by speaking, that silence is prudent and ok)I am wondering about this as well, but until then there are a lot of MOOCs and other things online offering what I think he is trying to dooverly sensitive leftThis is gold, trying to achieve a style that isn't how you actually talk is a great way to sound weird. on one hand, i agree. a general reluctance to broadcast somebody's name strikes me as wise, especially when wielding such a massive bullhorn.

on the other hand, i question why and how people who very publicly engage in strong political discourse (which is a charitably way to refer to ANTIFA antics) &amp; demonstrably false accusations deserve to be insulated from what **they themselves seem to invite**: more attention. 

both of these facebook profiles are public, and both prominently feature political claims. both have engaged in demonstrably bad faith arguments by accusing JP of "*campaigning against human rights*" and, laughably, having "*open associations with neo-nazis.*" 

what, very precisely, is un-ethical about drawing attention to who make these absurd claims, **especially when they themselves volunteer that information?**


agreed. u/HoboSelf, why did you use this term? it seems careless at best, malicious at worst. thanks for sharing this perspective. unsure why it warrants down-votes.

some of what you mentioned--"internet arguing feels like a strategically bankrupt approach" can be applied to your own disinterest in overtly political content. remember that you're in (nearly) complete control of your reddit experience, and various tools (RES is a life-saver) are available. controlling the signal/noise ratio is important, and it's an interesting challenge to force yourself to react to quality rather than just "*things i don't like*."

a final remark: there are partisan politics one can avoid (a majority of this sub would find my strong atheism, objections to current institutions of monogamy &amp; other such anarcho-cap tendencies risible) but there's a basic sub-stratum of axiomatic arguments about how society functions that can't be side-stepped. i can go back &amp; forth with a socialist democrat on the merits &amp; risks of progressive taxation or universal income, and there's a broad range of opinion open for contention--but when somebody makes claims about "speech being violence," or "ethnicity being destiny," that **has** to engaged with &amp; repeatedly, endlessly proven wrong &amp; dangerous. &gt;Or are they actually so brainwashed that they truly believe those things on the poster?

here's something worth noting: if they genuinely believed these claims, they would be unlikely to object to JP himself re-broadcasting the message &amp; take the opportunity to articulate their arguments. 

two of the people JP linked to on FB have immediately resorted to claims of harassment--because he drew attention to what **they had already made public, through FB**. he has literally created a wider audience for them without making any further claims about their intent.

this seems to indicate both these people are well-aware of how indefensible their claims are, &amp; are playing their only "out," an immediate pivot to claims of harassment.  thanks for the response.

&gt;posted online for malicious intent

&gt;painting a target

you're not a mind-reader, so don't make claims about JP's intent. these careless phrases are not helping you establish you as a thoughtful party to this incident.

is drawing attention to authors of demonstrably false accusations "malicious"? what of the fact that these two people have public profiles prominently featuring similar political claims? 

JP appears to refrain from making similar counter-accusations: he's broadcasting the original message, **which is clearly intended for public consumption**, and linking it to **people that have already broadcasted their association with it.**

i'm on record, repeatedly, for anybody who cares to dig through my post history, as fundamentally opposed to justine sacco-ing anybody. but this is drawing attention to a public (and malicious) argument, and two people who had already broadcasted their association with it, with little to any other further commentary. how craven &amp; disingenuous can somebody be if their immediate reaction to having their political arguments broadcasted is to immediately retreat into claims of harassment?

all of that said, i do agree that what he did may be **unwise**. even when having shit slung at you, it might be best to simply duck, &amp; pretend it didn't happen. but i object to hyper-ventilating on the subject of two mindless, petty shit-stirrers, having their **public** actions available for the **public** consumption they themselves invited. 
&gt; I'm not making any claims about JBP's intent

ok, good. then don't write things like "posted online for malicious intent." 

i often revisit what i wrote &amp; edit posts that are days old because i make similar mistakes.

&gt;I'm concerned because he seems to be stepping into a trap

legitimate concern. 

further still: because it engages with trolls (more or less) this may sap his credibility with those not already aware of his work. part of being a public, relatively powerful public persona is the ability/expectation to shrug off unfair attacks. in this particular instance, the presence of these posters near his home seems to have made a difference.

"explaining" his behavior involves mind-reading of sorts, which i've already stated my displeasure with. he appears to be drawing broader attention to the spurious accusations made by these two people so that the disapproving reaction will serve to dampen the impulse to malicious actions they &amp; others similarly inclined have shown.

it's not doxxing, and the more i think about this, the more i'm inclined to find the reaction well within the realm of what's acceptable. still not the best course of action, nor do i find it terribly wise. 

let's take a look at what you just typed:

&gt;private citizens

public FB profiles which feature affiliations with similar political claims. in case this isn't already clear: **these two have already made it public, as in, anybody with a computer, can find out that they both disapprove of JP, as well as have participated in the dissemination of the flier.** 

did you even read the previous post? /u/Holger-Dane clearly pointed out: "**Look at it - he has 1300 people on his friend profile wherein he discusses this. That's not a private gathering, that's a public speech platform.**"

&gt;228,000 followers who venerate you

to follow somebody on twitter is to 'venerate'? even in this sub, a rarefied selection of those interested in JP, many vocally disagree on any number of topics &amp; often make fun of his foibles or excesses. what are you playing at here?

&gt; these individuals have wronged you

they have. the claims being made about JP are self-evidently, maliciously wrong. do you care to argue otherwise?

&gt;you love Peterson

what are you projecting, man? 

i resent the equivalence being made between people who provably lie about a man's character in posters that go up in his neighborhood, and **somebody who points to the authors of those lies, which have already been made public on FB.** if the latter is "pretty fucked up," what is the former? 

at what point in time do people with **public** profiles, making **public** statements, have to live by what they have deliberately put forth to be consumed by a **public** audience?

&gt;Also, I can't help but laugh about how so many seem up in arms about who is allowed to use what bathrooms, yet here we are literally complaining about bathrooms

that made me chuckle. i'm pretty sure the OP was well-aware this is something of a shit-post.  

generally speaking, the opinions of those intractably concerned with gender assignments when it comes to public toilets do not merit close examination. literally a bunch of solutions in search of a real problem.an entirely unoriginal thought: the only winning move is not to play. Men are to be the authorities, feminist "equality" is impossible and shamefully rebellioushaha the madmanhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/i0fu7xhv4q41sy0/jordan.b.peterson.quotes.multi.7351.pdf?dl=0As soon as a new class opens up.More that they weren't in what we think of as hell, the eternal place of torment of the damned, but were in hell, the underworld where the righteous and unrighteous before Christ all reside.

this information is publicly available.Depends on his mood probably.I don't think *not* telling us would make any difference. Every generation goes through a phase where it rebels against the order that their predecessors established. The Boomers had the 60's counter culture, Gen X had the 90's music scene (punk, grunge &amp; metal) and we Millennials have social justice. Typing that out made me realize that the prior two generations had art as a guiding force of their rebellion; I wonder if the decline of art in the 21st century has anything to do with what's going on now. an insidious thing about arguments of representation--e.g., this quasi-mandate on 40% of course reading being authored by women--is how it closely comes to embodying the "biological essentialism" boogie-man that self-styled intersectionalists persecute with abandon as soon as statistical claims are made about populations.

either sex is a **defining** fucking feature, and maybe we should discuss about what that means in terms of optimizing for fairness *and* effectiveness in academia, jobs, political office or any other spaces, or it's **not,** and then let's shut the fuck up about chromosomal ratios already.

or maybe--most likely--it's an extraordinarily complicated, precarious middle ground somewhere between the two extremes above. what's completely untenable is this quantum super-imposition of two diametrically opposed positions being simultaneously true: sex both completely and emphatically matters, and is completely and emphatically irrelevant. 

&gt;Democracy has its place, but it is not on my course and not on my reading list

this seems like an over-reaction. it's not exactly "democratic" that a few extremely vocal dissenters are undermining a professor's course, is it? seems something of a heckler's veto.antifa have been putting similar posters around my neighborhood about people they consider nazis and encouraging the locals to notify these targets that they are not welcome.  I called the police, but they didn't want to do anything about it.  they suggested I remove the posters if I don't like them.  I tried pulling them down but they're glued on real good.  someone else seemed to have scraped a few of them off.I appreciate it but I already paid $20 on the patreon so I don't feel right spending more.you can choose to take it as such. at face value, it's a platitude. this is as close to a real-world embodiment of trolling as one can have: an intentionally vacuous or aggressively stupid statement purposefully designed to entice a disproportional reaction.

"it's ok to be white" seems about as self-evident as "black lives matter." that either statement can be construed as "malicious" is more of a statement on one's frame of mind than the phrases themselves.

&gt;racist pumpkin

what exactly is this about?yes, all of things--with the possible exception of the "communist" one--are ok. what, precisely, are you claiming to be the issue?i found the [article](http://www.metronews.ca/news/edmonton/2017/10/30/a-stupid-little-pumpkin-university-of-alberta-investigating-racist-jack-o-lantern-found-on-campus.html) linked elsewhere in the thread--thanks u/Cryusaki. again: that a pumpkin with feathers in it can be reasonably characterized as "racist" strikes me as bizarre. 

i'm not sure trolling is always malicious--it seems, roughly speaking, analogous to sarcasm. it **can**, &amp; often is malicious. it **can** also be a tool to puncture irrational or unreasonable perspectives. in this instance, the intent was clearly spelled out on 4chan: use an innocuous statement to cause an outsized reaction, which in turn would create a backlash: read more here: http://archive.is/pHMnG mission successful, one can say. 

one can call all of this "**malicious**" in the sense that it targets a sensibility, but then again, using that criteria, [piss christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piss_Christ) represents an apex of malice. is this a tenable perspective?

i don't find trolling to be wise, even when successful, but i'm not sure this merits the hyper-ventilation it prompted. similarly, much of the absurd Buzzfeed-style nonsense posted to r/JordanPeterson appears to be calculated trolling, specifically designed to design outrage outside of non-intersectional circles. is this what you meant that "this is coopting the divisive tactics of the left"?

on balance, it seems as if what you're articulating is that you find the trolling to be more worthy of opprobrium than the university president stating that ‚Äú*the university is aware of several incidents of racism*" and that such fliers "*would not be tolerated.*" is that reasonable? 

edits: readabilityagreed, appreciate the response.H3h3 and Jordan Peterson my two favourite YouTube channels this is going to be good.

Edit: Jordan with the fat rip, yeah boiii!!!consider if their "evidence" for razors is paper cutsnot the onionban the assault postersDon't say "unsupported premise". You may not accept his support (a variation of the prime mover argument if I'm not mistaken), or his interpretation of existing evidence, but unsupported doesn't work. Instead you just dismissed his evidence out of hand, just an assertion "you're wrong". In other words exactly what you accused him of.

Real logic and reason is hard work. Wikipedia's articles on the subject are actually pretty good, a free education in logic. No, that's not an argument from ignorance you have there. 

He's not saying, "I have no explanation for why the universe exists, therefore: God". He's saying that order and motion in a thing usually means that that something was acted upon by an external force. It's the watches have a watchmaker idea. "I don't know where the watch came from, but it probably has a watchmaker" is NOT an argument from ignorance. That is reasoning we all use successfully all the time.

You may not find this convincing, but glibly dismissing it out of hand, as opposed to addressing it. If you think I'm getting it wrong, feel free to explain it to me. Don't just shout, Logic!TM. Actually use some reasoning.

Again, learn the terms you're using, if you just use them and you get them wrong, it makes you look like a poser. I'm not saying you are, but I am saying you seem to have been just making assertion after assertion so far. You need to prove he's arguing from ignorance not merely asserting it.You look it up,  "It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true"

He's making an argument from design, which is not that.

"We use it all the time" is only a problem if I'm making a claim of absolute certainty as in "we use it all the time, therefore it's true". We use it all the time because it works at least an extraordinary amount of time. Which is evidence of good reasoning, good reasoning corresponds with reality.

Do you assume total ignorance about your car's origins just because you weren't there when it was made? Or do you make inferences about how it got there?

You can't just waive LogicalTermTM and expect people not to notice when you're using it wrong.No it's only a "fallacy" if the argument says that it is conclusively proving, absolute certainty, that such and thus is the result. A real syllogism style certainty. Saying it seems more likely, or it indicates that something is probable is fine. Not necessarily fallacious, although it might be. But not a fallacy.

And no, it isn't assuming a designer. It is saying, designed things look like x, upon closer examination this one object looks like x. And so does this one, and this one, etc. So it seems likely a non human intelligence is responsible. That's all it's saying.

If you're looking for abolute, unassailable, certainty, good luck. There's no really unassailable argument against solipsism, for example.

Enough inferences put together and you come to a conclusion, and that is the only way anybody lives their actual life. You make assumptions all the time about deadly important things without establishing complete unassailable certainty, you couldn't function otherwise.

Based on all observable science, physical objects don't just move on their own, some outside force moves them. Is it more likely than in a materialistic universe something that never has been observed to happen just happened and blew all the astronomical odds of life developing like it has within the limited time frame it would be acting under, or that an Intelligence exists and moves these things?

If you think that's a totes obvi simple answer, you're not being serious with yourself.

A little off topic, but if you're looking for establishing say the supernatural at the very least, from a legal perspective, not necessarily scientific, it's a done deal. We have more witnesses of what appear to be supernatural events living today than you could know what to do with. Otherwise sober minded people have witnessed things that science has no easy explanation for. I'm not talking myths and legends, I'm talking people who claim to have seen and conversed with angels, demons, seen miracles, been rescued from certain death, etc. 

So either sane normal people are prone to the most astounding hallucinations every single time this occurs, or the supernatural is real. It's about probabilities. &gt;No. A lot of historians doubt that the Ukrainian famine was "deliberate".

this phrase alone indicates that you're not interested in something approaching genuine inquiry. 

if you care to bring yourself a bit up to speed, i recommend *The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine* or *A Hunger Most Cruel,* by an ukranian author.Understood, sweet.i don't, because i know next to nothing of what you're referencing. ethnic cleansing, regardless the circumstances, is indefensible.

i would appreciate a suggestion on how to educate myself.
ok. thank you. something worth looking into. don't follow the connection to this particular thread, but better historical awareness is a good thing. Wait is that a meme? I swear I've read that verbatim somewhere else, this is driving me crazy.quality fucking post! this is the kind of stuff that continues to make me hopeful about JP's aggregate impact.

i continue to be fascinated by the question of how much of these kinds of readings are uncovering deliberately architected narrative structures, &amp; how much are we plumbing one own's psyche for meaning. once the proverbial mythological shades go on, everything is shades of chaos, order &amp; rebirth.

only seen clips of the movie; looking forward to experiencing in a theater. I'm not disputing the information one way or the other, I've just read that EXACT wording somewhere else identically. Replying to that very same "Could you elaborate?" message. 

I might just be having some horrifically vivid dejavu. do you believe the results reasonably describe you? although the big 5 model is one of the most valid constructs around, people are still more themselves, with their unique array of characteristics &amp; peculiarities, than any set of percentiles.

if we're playing "match the archetype," i suggest contract/temp work in law, program management or consultancy for a big 4 accounting brand, or any number of narrowly focused consultancy firms: 

* solitary vs. team-oriented - moderate agreeableness/high neuroticism/moderate to high conscientiousness
* temporary contract work - high open-ness/high neuroticism
* client facing - high extraversion

more broadly, the themes seem to be: independence, structured, task-oriented work &amp; narrowly time-constrained assignments.great answer. thanks for contributing. &gt;Christ is treated as an invisible person who doesn‚Äôt talk back

i share similar difficulties in engaging with most denominations--i think there's something to be said about the distance created by the rituals present in traditional catholic &amp; orthodox rites.

toate bune, frate.seconding /u/Ko77's advice below.

traveling is dreaming in real life: self-directed exploration of unfamiliar territory, replete with ambiguity and risk. you'll be placed in situations that you're uncomfortable and have to improvise, and your actions will have a sense of elevated import, in that they're all consequential to "what happens next."

when in an unfamiliar topology, there is a wonderful sense of perspective that arrives almost unto itself, and otherwise quiet seconds seem to fill themselves with significance. some of my foundational memories have been walking through deserted streets, late-night, in places like macau &amp; iceland. nothing special happened: and yet, i experienced moments of numinous reflection. triple star post. well articulated.

&gt;He's buying into the identitarianism centered in race

there it is, one of the most disturbing political trends in the last couple years. i'm unhappy about the absurdities bandied about by the intersectional usual suspects as well as the corresponding backlash, and the awakening of something resembling a sense of "white identity."

for every action, a reaction. identity politics truly are cancerous. &gt; But so what? I don't see why if party A and B agree on a law why A would decide to not move forward with it just because B agrees with it also.

Because B doesn't really care about the law to expand C's rights. B is using it as part of a strategy to dominate A. Once B dominates A, A's rights (that are more fundamental than C's "extra" rights) would be taken away. If A wants C to have those extra rights, but granting them would bring B one step closer to dominating A, I think A shouldn't support the law.

&gt; Then he says at the same time that he thinks it would probably do some good to extend the bounds of traditional relationships.

It probably would, but gay men account for only 5% of the population, and I think that's a fairly liberal estimate (accounting for lesbians complicates things). Is society OK with ushering in Gulags to grant 5% of the population some right that they *de facto* already have and most of them aren't going to use anyway? That's not a trade worth making to me, and I'm gay.

Edit: I'm not totally convinced of the premise that legalizing gay marriage is a stepping stone for Marxism, but I'm making this argument as if it were true, as JBP seems to believe it is. &gt; when you need more anarcho-capitalismThat's valid, but I think that's a really low-resolution way of understanding the gay marriage issue, to the point of effectively distorting the picture. 

Western civilization is the first ever to give marriage rights to gays. Even civilizations that were arguably friendlier to gays - like the ancient Greeks - did not feel like marriage rights were necessary. We're alone in doing this.

In light of that, I think a healthy dose of skepticism is in order. No other civilization has pushed for this, so why are we? Who is pushing for this? What do they want? Does this serve some greater end that we should know about? JBP obviously doesn't have a problem with gays. He's erring on the side of what we know as he considers these questions, and I think that's a very rational, very wise thing to do. Have you ever looked at a survey? If there's no mystery, tell me which survey about gay marriage will reveal all the different groups and factions pushing for an objective, the politics and dynamics of the groups, who influences those groups, what the historical consequences of their ideologies are, and what future trends their ideologies can take.

Otherwise, stop acting like we can make sweeping changes to society without having to worry about the unforseen consequences, because we don't have it all figured out. Every civilization has it's swan song, and very often they don't know what made them sing before it was too late. Although, ironically, that's part of the point.If the combat takes place it will just waste more resources in vain. better let everyone just stay quiet and accept their fate.Japanese culture died at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Mao killed the Chinese culture. And these countries have adopted the McCulture, taking the easier parts of Western culture.

The 'Net is mostly English, and even foreign users have to understand a bit of English in order to search for anything useful. I think the process should be expedited.Correct. Every culture has its birth and death - and if they are not competitive they should not be spared.Except the 'traditional' cultures are not competitive and can't win a fight, and by the time the dieoff of West starts (assuming life extension tech is not invented), there would be no sustainable traditional cultures remaining.True, and abandon all the inconvenient stuff.Isn't it the natural law? Survival of the Fittest.Until Hiroshima, the shinto thing and the divine rights of emperors and all that trappings had some meaning. After the Emperor bowed to MacArthur and women were running to ensnare US soldiers, people lost their traditional values. Some residues of traditional Japanese cultures still remain, mostly for the consumption of the upper classes who think pretending to like such things is cool (although they prefer to act like Europeans in most cases), but the masses don't really care about these things and instead act as the cheaper version of Americans.

Ditto to China, where traditional values died during the cultural revolution, and all that remained was the ethos of Get Rich Quick.The rot began when G.H. Hardy allowed Ramanujan to stomp Cambridge around like a little Maharajah while the real students were dying at the trenches. I don't think Asians should have been allowed to study in the Western Universities, but that's another story.It won't, since there is not much to buy from countries with nothing to offer.I have some answers in mind, but I don't have it figured out completely. That's why I'm defending Dr. Peterson here. You can see in the video that he has the urge to support gay marriage, but he stops himself from doing that completely because he's conflicted about the impact it's having on a movement he thinks is dangerous. I think that's reasonable, and any thinking person would do the same.

&gt; Do you have anything more than a vague anxiety?

It's not a vague anxiety. Do you actually follow current events and try to understand their undercurrents, or do you just read /r/enoughpetersonspam so you don't take any criticism of progressivism seriously, especially if it comes from this sub?sorry to hear! 

i don't know enough about career-pathing in industrial engineering to have an educated opinion. if positions that meet the criteria above exist (solitary vs. team work, client-facing, time-bound projects, etc) then sure. 


shorter term: seems like you already know the benefits of rigorous physical training--preferably weight lifting--every couple days. commit to that. aside from an appropriate (regular/sufficient) sleep schedule, i can think of nothing else that more dramatically impacts overall emotional regulation. 

i share the high openness trait &amp; had some success with mood-stabilizing nootropics. i recommend noopept &amp; ashwagandha (the KSM-66 extract in particular.) both helped even out sentiments of frustration or dissatisfaction. 

another helpful habit: i would invest some mental resources in planning out events or activities that seem creatively fulfilling--travel, engagement with art, etc. even if you're not par-taking in them in the moment, thinking about how &amp; when you'll be able enjoy them give you goal-posts that specifically speak to your need for new experiences.  All humans beings have value but some have greater value than others. 

A producer, someone who invents, builds or presents things of value to society, is greater than a consumer or a criminal, but the value of a producer is not proof that others are valueless. 

If you want to bring this back to Nietzsche, you could call producers masters, higher men, etc., but that doesn't necessarily mean that consumers and criminals are slaves. What makes a slave is their nihilistic value system and their contempt for life because they feel as if they are destined to lose. Consumers could very well be the last men and criminals could very well be slaves but it's not a guarantee. 

I don't understand why you want to integrate the types. Master-types, higher men, producers, whatever your particular philosophy wants to call them, should not be hindered. That's it. They should be provided the liberty to do what they are naturally inclined to do because it will progress humanity. Slave morality is what hinders these kinds of people. Slaves become resentful of the higher men's success, so they create a value system that makes servility/conformity the highest and individualism/creativity the lowest. If slave morality permeates society, then higher men may restrain themselves to maintain their social relationships (e.g. if Galileo had given in to the pope, then he'd have been a prime example of this). The US education system lowering the grading scale, affirmative action, the propensity for teachers to suggest medicating students, our growing disdain for the wealthy because they are assumed to be cheaters, litmus testing companies, movies, video games, etc. by looking at how racially and gender diverse they are are all examples of slave morality in society. All those polices outright restrain or at the very best dampen the achievements of higher men. There's no integrating the two. Slave morality needs to be repressed, a byproduct of this is greater liberty, so that humanity can progress. I'm getting this from reflections on a number of Nietzsche's texts. (I'm not trying to establish ethos or appeal to authority or any other pointless tactic)

A good way to conceptualize the dichotomy is slave morality = communism = radical egalitarianism and master morality = capitalism = Libertarianism = Objectivism. 

I'd also warn against trying to use the Bible as a solution to the problems Nietzsche identified. He though of Christianity, particularly faith and the institutions, as examples of slave morality (Antichrist, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Human All Too Human). 

In Human All Too Human he states that religion has value but he admonishes faith and organized religion. The value Nietzsche saw in religion was purely utilitarian. It can unify and inspire people but it has a tendency to become oppressive in the long run (science denial, valuing servility/conformity, altruism etc.). Nietzsche's big question was what do we do now that faith is dead; how do we ascribe value to things without metaphysics. His whole ubermensch concept is a man who no longer needs religion to provide him morals because he, through his own reason and mental faculties, provides himself a moral framework. This isn't to say that honesty, a Christian moral, is bad or should be disregarded by an ubermensch. However honesty needs to be valued and justified without Christianity as the basis of the argument. &gt; I've only read Zarathustra besides BGE and maaan that's a doozy.

It's one of the most dense books I've ever picked up. haha Honestly, I reread parts of TSZ every once in a while and it's become a bit clearer. I think the problem with TSZ is that it relies heavily on symbolism and allegory so a lot gets lost in translation. This is part of the reason why I threw German on my languages-to-learn list haha

&gt; One could argue that JBP's version of Christianity isn't really Christian per se. I interpret what he's saying as it being more of an evolutionary and cultural byproduct of the human psyche, much like the hero myth in general, right? He's trying to underpin certain "truths", as it were, with examples spread across time and space, by finding them crystalized in myth and storytelling.
I rrrrreally dig what he's doing, but it's so hard to articulate in an easy-to-communicate-and-understand manner. At least for this caveman :)

I agree. What JP's doing is pretty great. I feel like he rides the fence on some things but his view of religion, definition of god and the truth value of religious ideas has been super interesting for me to think about. 

You should pick up *The Age of Reason* by Thomas Paine and *Human All Too Human* by Nietzsche. TAR is the easier read but HATH is probably the easiest of Nietzsche's books.

The elites of Brazil is NOT affected at all by the culture of the poor and in fact try all they can to distance themselves from it. In America, other than some food  which were quickly Americanized, the culture of Indians did not affect America at all.

The younger people of Japan find the older culture boring. Traditional arts are only practiced by those who have done it for families; it is like a family business. Things like Kabuki, which still carry some patina, will be practiced (although many Kabuki actors do add to their income by acting in modern-themed shows in TV). Others, probably not. 

It's interesting to me that the only humane forms of communism known to exist were invented by Christians and Jews: the monastery and the kibbutz.

Also notable for being voluntary.Plus I often find a failure to distinguish between "normal" rare corporal punishment (occasional spanking for a child willfully doing things that seriously endanger them) and just beating the hell out of your kids like an abusive maniac. Stef himself doesn't really make a distinction on this point.I disagree. Academics should be held to account for what they write, especially if they use strong language like this. 

For this to not bother me, Ignatiev would have had to radically change his views over the past decade. I personally don't know any academic, especially not one with this vein of thinking, who has changed their views that much. Honestly, they've gotten more radical, so I'm inclined to think his views are worse. 

Academics use research that are decades old all the time. This is fair game. 

Edit: if this was my view as an academic, and I changed my mind, I would make it my professional mission to correct for my error. A quick Google search of Noel Ignatiev shows that he has not only not changed his mind, but has doubled down on it. what would JBP think of Wallace&gt; My point was don't use information about a person that is 15 years old to make a judgment. 

For private citizens, sure, I agree. For professional thinkers, it is not only reasonable but it is our obligation to judge them based on their writings, regardless of which form it takes -- especially if it is within the usual lifecycle of academic work.Brazil shows that cultural amalgamation is a myth and a bullshit. The lives of the rich and the poor in that country are completely apart that there will never be any interaction between them. It is almost like they live in separate planets.

One may say innumerable things and promote almost any idea under the sun, but naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very covenant of preserving and protecting private property, such as democracy and communism. There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and removed from society. -Hans-Hermann Hoppe https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Hans-Hermann_Hoppe

 "Unlimited" "Free" speech can be a left-wing value, Christians for instance are not going to want to allow heresy and blasphemy to be openly taught on their property; some relative free speech can be good when in a controlled discussion to illustrate points, though if you have a club space that is for Jordan Peterson appreciation and "spam"-tier comments constantly posted, this would be another example where "unlimited free speech" would not generally be tolerated. Everyone engages in "voluntary censorship" - this is not necessarily a bad thing - although perhaps it's good for there to be free speech and restricted speech venues (I enjoy using both at times). Also things like libel are illegal. 

While I might consider criminalizing speech in other places to be counterproductive, on my property I would not necessarily advocate for total unrestricted free speech (or might want to restrict and open the policy depending on what company is present)

A counterpoint thought to this idea of needing to support "unlimited" "free speech" in order to support freedomchildren out of wedlock, STDs, and all these other things makes it easier for Christians today to not seek out such temptations to adultery, fornication, etc.&gt; 2017 is the year white people wake up to the truth of how based white people have always beenTwo comments to this: can we create our own self-authoring program, like this subreddit?

I agree that socialization is a key aspect of education, and oloug above is a bit of a prick about this- I know myself well enough to accept the fact that homeschooling could well be worse than public education given the unsorted person I am.


However, I do agree with Cabbagepant that the use of the word is definitely significant, even if people rationalize that it actually means something different.I've read them, but to borrow from JBP, I wonder if homeschooling is too much cure for the disease.ya know, I aimed to imply in my original post I didn't want to "take X to the absolute, screaming edge of reason."  Philthrowaway28 managed to notice.  hope you felt big there, bucko.Just a bit of a reminder, Postmodernism is inherently averse to defining. You may say it's X, Y and Z based on your own reading and research, but a Postmodernist, because their philosophy disregards metanarratives, can come along and say "No it's actually A, B and C in my opinion." In my opinion, my lived experience, etc. are phrases that declaw counterarguments by shifting the conversation from one on a particular topic with the intention of reaching some sort of objectivity to one entirely based on relating subjective experience with no clear end or solution. If you're going to debate a Postmodernist with the intention of changing *their* mind, I've found that you have to first make a case for objective reality. If this can't be done, then the debate is pointless. If you're debating a Postmodernist with the intention of changing the *audiences* mind, then assume that they already accept objective reality and focus on providing logical, concise, fact-filled counterarguments in order to discredit and expose your opponent as an individual holding infantile beliefs about serious topics. Those are at least the strategies that I've found most effective. Make sure to have a goal before you engage and know who you're *actually* speaking to (other debater or audience).

Last tip
If they try redefining terms, question them or offer up some thought experiments. I've had some success with "racism" and debunking the power+prejudice definition that they throw around a lot. Who has the power to collect taxes? Precisely the assholes which they are trying to punish. Sorry that is the way it is.based upon many personal observations. A hypothesis becomes a theory when enough people study it, and becomes a law when the powers that be admits it.I am not blaming high functioning aspies on anything - in fact I am a bit like that too. I am just stating a fact.But now tech is being developed to make human interactions unnecessary. People in supermax prisons are not there by killing a few. being treated like that is part of the punishment.

Again, in the future, genius lieutenants will play in their air-conditioned control room, moving one automaton after another, while the gristled Sergent gets home without a limb or two , ambushed by the insurgents who can never hope to win an open fight. Peterson is an academic, drawing salary from a university. He has certain things which he can't say. I used to be in StarCodex but fought with one of the mods, who appears to be Korean and whose vote was more equal than other mods in there, so that is why I ended up here.But in the past the asshole at least had to pretend to be nice sometimes because he/she needed the help of others. Now the need is being phased out.Actually not that bad. The high iq assholes seem to be quite happy on where they are, although those around them would not share their opinion.Sorry. Things have changed so the little rats are on the way out of the evolutionary ladder. They can't function in a high-tech world which needs a minimum of a certain IQ, depending on whom you ask.

JP personally said people under an IQ of 85 will not have too much place in the workplace. And I pointed out that about half of the world's people (the median IQ of the world is not 100, which is based upon people in the advanced countries - it is more like 87 or 88) are under that IQ, and won't really be useful to the world.

The little rats could stop playing, and those who own the means of production can care less now they can make their own rats as robotics improve.Then maybe a new reality where high functioning people are assumed to be insane will arise, and the 'sane' lower, poorer people can watch them from behind barbed wire.

Self-repairing machines might be expensive and far away, but once you send enough machines the enemies will retreat and low-paid laborers can carry back the machines to the camp where they could be repaired rather cheaply.

Most likely so. Although such people do not seem to think that they are miserable themselves - they seem to be happy , in their own way, to be in that state. As their wealth and power grow even further, empathy will make a retreat from the ethos of the day, and everyone-for-himself among those who are more able will be the prevalent thought.Not if the home is well armed by remote security and equipped by drones who will spread lethal gas to the face of the invading rats.Well, that's power of MGTOW. Not having to worry about such time consuming stuff.The customers can be served remotely without the need of interaction. And that's why richer people hire lawyers to handle the dirty stuff with regulators, etc. There are plenty of people, many of them assholes themselves (although not to the people who pay them), who will be willing to do anything for a price.&gt;I need to know what they're thinking

Gonna have a hard time with that seeing as it will be difficult to track any of them down 'cause, you know, ***they barely exist in any large quantities or density***.In most cases during the middle ages, the lord rarely left the castle if there were no wars.

Smarter blacks know that they can't f'k around whites for too long, and set their own barriers which is best for both sides.

"Good fences make good neighbors" - 'Mending Wall', Robert FrostLike, this is everything wrong with the discussion on this topic right now. Other than the hosts obviously not caring for a proper interview and more wanting to tell someone off for not being a good thinker.

They conflate transexuality with homosexuality even though there's nothing akin in either scenario other than maybe, not acting the way that's standard in western society, which is absurdly nebulous as a category.  

Homosexuality is, for lack of better term, a perversion. It's more or less a bit of a fetish with a loose social identity attached to it. The closest thing that it's related to could possibly Openness, given that homosexuals have a higher rate of intelligence and tend to be a bit more leaning into aesthetics. Although the stereotype of their fashion is hilariously garish.  

Transexuality is related to a mental disorder. A serious one, one where the sufferer doesn't believe their body accurately reflects the concept of their self. And in a more dramatic way than the Persona and Self, or the Honne and Tatamae. Like, maybe it goes to the level of a disease of how the mind maps the body or something.  
And I don't understand that. As one who's introverted, I find the distinction between my Persona and my Self is something that exhausts me horrifically, but it's not something I'd kill myself over. I've got absolutely no basis for mapping what i know onto what it must be like, and that in-and-of itself distinguishes it drastically from homosexuality, that it can't be mapped accurately as an experience over one-another.  
I'd actually like someone to help me understand this.

There's some genetic bases. There's physical proportions and such that seem to be aligned toward it, so there's clearly a genetic element. Bizarrely which direction your crown swirls, in men.  
I'm not saying there's not something more complicated at the back end, but what it presents itself as is a perversion. Gay people don't really have much else that differentiates them from the standard male or female outside of Openness/Intelligence -- and that's even in lesbians who would have "male development in their female brain" to liberally paraphrase you.  

And I don't know if "female development of sexual feature detectors" is a viable explanation, because autism in men presents with a generally greater likelihood of homosexuality, in spite of it being linked to higher-than-normal levels of testosterone which would heavily develop these "feature detectors" in a Male manner, in their Male Brains. 

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10803-006-0159-1

A source for the last one, because I don't want to seem like I'm baseless. Humans are a rare species of animal that has recreational sex. Sex is a highly social activity between partners. I'm not arguing from a point of prudish puritanism.

A perversion is simply a deviation from things that generally accepted mainline sexual excitement, or when some regular aspect of sexual intercourse excites one to a bizarre degree.  
The one unifying aspect of this definition is that they're largely auxiliary to the main "PiV (Maybe) Pregnancy" event. And I'll admit what constitutes a perversion isn't exactly a fine line, it's not simple to catagorise and might even differentiate based on time, era, situation and cultural environment, as well as typical genetic non-recreational facets. 

However what certainly is far outside of the line of straight intercourse that results in baby, is gay intercourse.  

And I want to stress that I'm not saying gay sex is unacceptable, I'm just saying it's weird to want it. Like, ["4% of the population at best, including bisexuals and transexuals even though they may not strictly count"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States) weird. Homosexuality is at least 10x less common than having a [foot fetish.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_fetishism#Relative_frequency)&gt;Is that what you intended to convey, or did you mean something else?

I just meant that it's not a normal thing to want. Perversion in a sexual context is just something abnormal. I'm not trying to create a social connotation.  
And I'll stress my use of the word isn't improper, and it conveys my intention perfectly well, but I'll pick out a few definitions to make sure that we're crystal clear.

[2: a perverted form; especially :an aberrant sexual practice or interest especially when habitual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perversion)  
(Aberrant meaning unusual, deviating from the norm)

[4. any of various means of obtaining sexual gratification that are generally regarded as being abnormal.](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/perversion)

[1. (Psychology) any abnormal means of obtaining sexual satisfaction.](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/perversion)

&gt;If you think homosexuality is bad, what consequences is it having that are a problem for you?

I'm running out of lumber for the crosses I keep burning in their front yards, it's putting a lot of financial strain on me when I have a wife and 3 mistresses to support.I don't know why you've gotten downvoted, because I think your idea is just as valid as mine, and I've heard it quite a few times. I think you've got half of a solid theory that I would buy into if there were a lot more research done that would dissuade me from the "male autists present higher likelihood of homosexuality and transexuality in spite of their higher fetal testosterone levels."
  
But I'll ask you not say that I'm calling homosexuality a degeneracy, because that's not representative of what I said. I'm not making a social commentary.No argument. But wanting you dick sucked by a woman or man is a different thing. Women's Lips are evolved to look slightly vaginal, and moustaches tickle.I don't appreciate words trying to be put in my mouth on the JBP subreddit of all places. OP is suggesting something that he thinks will improve the sub (by clicking the submit button), and inviting dialogue about it. I don't see what's wrong with that. Sounds like the beginning of an echo chamber. How is that different from "blocking" or "following" people on Twitter and Facebook. It's not bad when people use those tools responsibly, as you do, but that probably shouldn't be the policy. If he checks in on the sub regularly, he's probably just as qualified to offer advice as someone who submits low-quality posts regularly.

Regardless of his posting history, we should consider and discuss his proposal rather than shut him down because he doesn't contribute enough for you. 

How many of the 20,000 subscribers have posted at least once? I bet not many. It might be wise to listen to them anyway. Maybe if we do, they'll be inclined to post more. I think a stickied post is a good idea. We've all heard stories like the insane ones you link to. Posting more of the same adds a lot of unnecessary noise without much value, and does come off as a circle jerk. 

That being said, those sort of posts keep getting upvoted. If the subscribers keep upvoting them, we ought to have a really good reason to impose new rules on them. I'm not convinced there is enough of a reason to do that. 

Great solution, but not convinced there's a problem. That's doesn't sound any different, fundamentally, from Twitter's justification for the block button. People should be free to get on Twitter and read JBP, Ben Shapiro, and Glenn Greenwald tweets without getting distracted by racial slurs or harassment, or so the argument goes. Is that what most people use the block button for, though?

Either way, we should all be free to determine our own Reddit habits. I think voting is enough, you want more control over what you see, and both of these are fine. Disappointed to see this trend catching on. I know of several people from my (small) university who used it while I was in school. I'm ashamed to admit that I considered it too, in my worst hour. 

There's an internal logic to it. If sex is so casual that it doesn't have much meaning or long-term purpose, why not at least make some money out of it? allow to me to suggest that:

- 1. you may not have a good handle on what JP's precise objections to the excesses of postmodernism are
- 2. there's a broad range of opinion on JP's take even among those who find his contributions valuable &amp; his perspectives well-calibrated. there's quite a few thoughtful folks who post here regularly that estimate he's throwing a bit of the baby out w/ the bath-water, even though most of his diagnostic is accurate.

the questions u/Inaspe poses below are a good starting point in discerning whether you buy into some of the excesses or absurdities that are constructed through the analytical tools postmodernism deploys--[my own view,](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/6jy1oh/where_are_all_those_postmodernists_jp_constantly/djixsst/) which I believe to be broadly similar to JP's own, follows:

&gt;tools aren't deplorable, tool uses are deplorable. 

&gt;far as intellectual tools go, the axiomatic claims of postmodernism are "dangerous" in the sense that a chainsaw is more dangerous than a fork. broadening the scope of analysis outside of established hierarchies (epistemological, ethical) is destabilizing, and it seems extraordinarily hard to stop judicious intellectual ventures from spiraling into cancerous ideologies. 

&gt;to re-iterate: this doesn't make the process itself "bad," in the same way that the risk of chopping your own hand off with a chainsaw doesn't make chainsaws "bad." it simply means that greater care, honesty &amp; effort needs to be put forth when attempting to use the tools in question. 

i admit to difficulties in tracking your last question on atheists discarding "the uncaring universe." for what it's worth, JP's approach, integrating bio-evolutionary theories, neuro-science, mythology, clinical psychometrics, etc has solidified &amp; under-girded my profound skepticism toward claims of the supernatural, especially in religions.
&gt;[...JP doesn't...]  see any usefulness or redemption in postmodernism

it's a long one, but worth watching, as he repeatedly "gives the devil his due," i.e., acknowledge some of the points both postmodernism as well as Marxism make that have to be grappled with:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfH8IG7Awk0Those who moved to France were sent back to USSR to be killed, with the blessing of Clement Attlee. (Some of them did flee to other countries, seeing where the wind is blowing). The people around Putin seem to be fairly intelligent.At the beginning of civilizations, maybe. But Western Civ is a mature one, and those who belong to the higher classes tend to be selected for generations and tend to be more superior than others.

The smarter, hardworking and non-elite people will fail to reproduce with those who do matter. And in rare unions like that children from such union tend to be childless (i.e. D.H. Lawrence, Anderson Cooper) and the upper class laughs last. 

Capitalism is dying, being replaced by techno-feudalism. Shares of major companies or prime real estate are more important than brains.

JP is now getting better known. He will get more lucrative speech offers and his books will sell more. Will he or his descendants enter the upper class? That is an open question he would probably rather not answer.He is just a clown to distract pundits in the West. The people who are running the show under Putin appear to be fairly competent , since despite of everything Russia has not become batshit yet.

Not according to Gregory Clark, who proved that there are no descendants of the laborers and practically every person in England was descended from those who owned property back in the 15th-18th century.

The Top out of Sight, a class first described by Paul Fussell.

(Trump and his cohort will never join them)Not really. He is one of the people who game the system by going thru the loophole (and I am sure the college has now closed it by going thru its database and quietly rejecting such cases). However, that will not bring the class of such people higher.We will see, but Russia was not dealt with good cards so he and his cohort are playing them as best as  they can. (Although, I do think that Russia should be dissolved and its resources should be appropriated by the West in order to advance Civilization, but that's another story.)Eisenhower bent backwards to kiss Soviet asses. I think the borders of Eastern Europe should be significantly readjusted, to reflect tradition. Half of Poland should go back to Germany, but Poland would be compensated by annexing all of Belarus. And that is just the beginning of undoing centuries of damages done by Americans who couldn't tell Moscow apart from Muskogee.

I think that Russian should be a dead language, but that's another big topic.To atone for the enormous harm Russia did to civilization and its own people.Russian literature died when Tolstoy died in 1910. There were some afterglows, but after WW2 there has not been anything worthwhile to read which had been written in Russian.this abdication to click-bait peddlers is not helpful.

[this](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/arwa-mahdawi) isn't a journalist, it's a professional outrage-monger whose sole purpose is to get page views--congratulations, by paying attentions &amp; linking, you've helped her &amp; the editors who think these kind of articles deserve publication. 

i see more &amp; more bait like this on the sub, &amp; i wonder if the appeal of indignation is displacing the impulse to sort one-self at the individual level. Glenn Greenwald. He might have some SJW tendencies, but I've never heard anyone more committed to rational debate than him. 

He's a progressive, but he goes after (and defends) conservatives and progressives alike. He appears on Tucker Carlson to talk about liberal media, he'll go on CNN and on their network call them out, then the next day he'll be hanging out with Noam Chomsky talking about western imperialism and the police state. 

Free speech is his highest virtue. He's a gay Jew, but as a lawyer, he defended the free speech rights of neo-Nazis (if I remember correctly the real kind) against the American Bar. 

I've been following him for years. There's no public figure - on the right or left - who I respect more than him. 

Edit: like you, he's also made comments about how disappointed he is with Rachel Maddow going full blown hack. fair enough--that context makes the post more interesting to consider, although one still wonders about the extent to which that kind of source is worth paying any attention to.this account was created for the single purpose of worsening the signal/noise ratio in r/JordanPeterson. there's zero attempt at argumentation, structured dissent or even trolling, which in some cases has value for its humor or puncturing of orthodoxies.

contemplate that for a second: that somebody is so angry that they're willing to sacrifice their own time, attention &amp;, presumably, emotional continence solely to attempt negatively impacting the very periphery of others' lives. i find the origins of such behavior to be an almost unfathomably bizarre place--not even dark, since this can't properly be categorized as malicious, being so trivial in its scope--just... hopelessly, utterly muddled.

at any rate; my whole point is: [get res](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite). very few people should be banned on this sub, but for your own sanity, get a tool to manage your own noise/signal ratio &amp; ignore lost clowns like this one. &gt; Sometimes modern skepticism is called scientific skepticism

I think this article is attacking skeptics, but there is also a problem of faith in the wrong ideas today (for example radical Islam - the truly destructive kind)

Also it may forget that such "skeptics" often believe in something (atheists may be anti - theism, but they have also been called "pagan" or naturalist), and that the belief in something by someone who is otherwise skeptical may mask that they would otherwise be considered a "skeptic". For instance, I have in mind someone who grew up around secular people who are "skeptics", but they decided to become a Christian - that person was "skeptical" of the "skeptical" secularism around them, and is in a sense a skeptic (but wouldn't be called as such typically necessarily - this skews the perception of who the "skeptics" are and critical thinkers).hey man, everything [i wrote here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7dvvrn/blue_states_practice_the_family_values_red_states/dq1f9xa/) applies. 

not a good idea to ban people unless they obviously break the guidelines, which seem thoughtfully articulated.

&gt; If you decide that people lying, misinterpreting, laughing and hating us one minute in their subreddit and the next brigading here should be able to roam freely you might lose people that want to actually discuss topics, instead of discussing if and how much evil Peterson and this sub does.

we're in near-complete charge of our reddit experience. 

install res, follow those who write things that you appreciate &amp; curate what you consume. **you're more than able to manage your content consumption.** the way you react to careless, silly or self-evidently un-constructive comments is training for real life argumentation. 

finally--please don't take this to be an attack; it's not meant as such--what you stated is a modified version of the "*words are violence*" pablum that self-styled intersectionalists invariably resort to in order to avoid having to confront the inadequacy of their ideas, or the frustrations of having to sort out **what**, exactly, they think &amp; feel, and **why** they do so. 

once again: i'm not suggesting that you're alike to the confused, at times malicious people i've mentioned. i'm pointing out that "sorting oneself out" involves, in as far as online interactions are concerned, the ability to **filter, curate &amp; appropriately engage with the meaningful content** while ignoring or dis-incentivizing throw-away nonsense.

fundamentally, i believe this community has the resilience &amp; thoughtfulness necessary to separate the chaff. 

**edit**: fudged the last sentence, fixed now. meant to convey confidence in the community, not the other way around. /r/privacy privacytools.io

this, there is absolutely no reason to save sensitive writing on there, just write offline somehow (typed or handwritten) if you really want private writing. 

People should really "lobby" JBP until he takes down saving this personal info, it's just too insecure of an idea to keep up (unless you don't mind that info possibly being leaked) ... he should just have the questions and you have to type it up on your computer or offline, not save it on there.

To me that he even had people save it on there looks like an honest mistake but it sounds like a bad idea from the beginning and otherwise surprises me he would have people do this&gt; Has anyone else had the same experience?

naw, I grew up probably more like Peterson's (skeptical?) "metaphorical-Christian" mindset and became more "fudamentalist" Christian (since I don't think that things like Noah's Ark or the Genesis Fall as some kind of original sin can be anything but literal in some sense as they're described as such in the Bible and Christian tradition)

I don't think this makes me any less skeptical or critical though, I am critical of atheism/secularism/"liberal Christianity"/etc.this looks like a list of multiple philosophy coursesafaik damore did nothing wrong?

&gt; He was fired from Google for arguing that men may be more suited to working in tech than women. Now James Damore opens up about his regrets ‚Äì and how autism may have shaped his experience of the world

I respected him for not backing down, but regrets and tying this to autism? Not happy to see that, it's fine - men are more suited to work in tech than women, who should be homemakers. His message before seemed alright&gt; Tomorrow morning still in my bed, his voice manifested himself in my brain,

lol all these people with dreams and weird stories of JBP daydreams

&gt; Shoulder your baggage! Everyone has some baggage in their lives

sounds like Jesus saying to take up one's cross&gt; can't seem to find any reassurance that things will be okay

worry less and schedule more? ? ? &gt;I've never stated anything close to "words are violence".

you're right, you didn't. let me try a different angle: would you agree that the following paragraph is a fair summary of your view?

&gt;some of the current incursions into /r/JordanPeterson amount to briganding. there are those who lie, misinterpret and engage in displays of hate toward JP &amp; this sub's regular readers. it'd be best to ban some or most of these users, because they are obviously mal-intentioned, &amp; they're preventing meaningful discussion to take place.

did i get your basic point(s) mostly right?if you find the back &amp; forth sufficiently unpalatable, bailing out of the sub is an option. but let the record show that my opposition to increased policing is this:

&gt;some of the current incursions into ~~/r/JordanPeterson~~ **this university** amount to ~~briganding~~ **intimidation tactics**. there are those who lie, misinterpret and engage in displays of hate toward ~~JP &amp; this sub's regular readers~~ **marginalized group**s. it'd be best to ban some or most of these ~~users,~~ **hate activists** because they are obviously mal-intentioned, &amp; they're preventing meaningful discussion from taking place.

the obvious retort being that a subreddit isn't a university, &amp; the the admins have, in theory, better discretion over what constitutes a lie, mis-interpretation or display of hate compared to the average campus intersectionalist. sure: it's an analogy, not a one-to-one equivalency.

not to belabor the point: i understand having to hash through chaff isn't pleasant. but i believe it to be a tremendously fitting activity for those genuinely interested in JP's core message of self-sufficiency &amp; individuation. In all fairness, the invasion of Poland initiating the Second World War was a joint German-Soviet invasion. The Soviets clobbered Poland from the East, while the Germans clobbered Poland from the West. 

The "accidental" nature of the deaths of millions under communism makes communists morally culpable once they became aware of the problems they were causing. Instead they doubled down. Once you know the course of treatment is killing the patient, if the doctor perseveres in it he's guilty of malpractice and worse.Bingo, "postmodernism"(as the term is commonly used) isn't an ideology it's a tactic for gaining power. That's one of the reasons why conservatives have been losing for so long, they keep arguing about what is true and the other guy just doesn't care.

These guys don't actually care about what is true or not. We can defend Peterson as not a Nazi, because he isn't and no sane man would think he was. But it doesn't matter because that's not the point.Don't worry, by accepting anyone's claims to be trans regardless of scientific evidence we're only mutilating sick people so other people won't think we're bigots. Giving hormone blockers to children is a small price to pay so the right people think well of you.Cool, I understand the impulse.

Past a million dead bodies I don't feel the need to split hairs about who's more evil or who is "just as bad" as anyone else. It's like one axe murderer killing fewer people than another because his arms got tired. It kind of doesn't matter. Communism as an ideology is wading through such a river of blood as it is.

I understand also that authors don't have a choice about what people do with their writings. However at this point, attempts at total command economies have all ended so poorly so quickly that it makes one question the motives of those who argue for them. Scandinavia is often used as a counterpoint but those were more social welfare states on the West German model. And even that model isn't working anymore.

As a smarter man than I once put it "Low delusion is the highest IQ".She said she would teach it if it was relevant to the contentIt really worries me too, it's like no one is asking the question. If we're wrong about this we are mutilating and experimenting on the mentally ill and on children. That is judgement-of-God level crime.&gt;For the record: Jordan Peterson is a transphobic YouTube crank with basically nothing interesting to say about free speech or gender expression, and who very obviously has no idea what any part of the phrase ‚Äúpost-modern neo-Marxist‚Äù means. He is a bad political and social thinker, and many of his ideas about gender roles are genuinely dangerous. (Tabatha Southey has already written his intellectual obituary by clocking him as ‚Äúthe stupid person‚Äôs idea of a smart person,‚Äù which is immediately obvious to anyone who listens to his **awful honking voice** for more than thirty seconds.) 

this was very amusing. he's not wrong about the bolded part.

the real fun is digging into his history of incisive internet content, e.g., "[this donair meat webcam is sex](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/ne35xd/this-donair-meat-webcam-is-sex)." the self-appointed JP opposition, everybody: brazenly psychopathic borderline socialites &amp; their vice contributor attending knight.
In perhaps the first western (as in cowboys, etc.) novel, The Virginian, the author captures the musing of an Old West bartender that the coward is the most dangerous man because he's unpredictable and overreacts.Well, sort of, yes, and not really.

To say that third world countries live under capitalism isn't really accurate. Many of them explicitly do not (all of the "People's Republics of _____"). The rest don't really have a free market, but are governed by gangsters who just plunder, like a totalitarian state writ small. Capitalism proper does not exist without rule of law.  That being said, economic theory alone doesn't really explain everything, so I can agree with you there. It's not capitalism versus communism, it's culture and civilization versus communism.

We've also seen some countries like Ethiopia and Somalia who have experienced both. Ethiopia was much safer and better off without communism. Ironically Somalia is actually better under near total anarchy than under communism! Bizarre I know.

Calling the western expansion genocide doesn't really cover it. The United States didn't invent war or conquest, nor did we import it to these shores. But that's a conversation for another time. Regarding our foreign policy, another pile of "it depends" and "sort of". We've had a schizophrenic foreign policy.

You can tell better and worse by where people vote with their feet when given the chance. Even apartheid South Africa had enormous immigration from neighboring African countries. Apartheid was considered easier than living under a communist maniac in Angola. I'm not defending apartheid! I'm just saying equivalencies are really messy. 

I guess what I'm saying is consider not just good and bad, but better and worse. Capitalism isn't great, but it is way the hell better than communism, at least in practice regardless of what any one may say about it.Better get tested. People with lower IQs do not bother with Jordan Peterson. Your IQ is probably much higher than you think.There's a talk between Colin Flaherty and Jesse Lee Peterson you should listen to. No whites are not being genocided. However we are being discriminated against legally (in practice if literally every other group gets preference in hiring when an option) and face routine violence for our ethnicity. 

DISCLAIMER: I believe actual racism (that ethnicity has anything to do with character or chosen loyalty) is insane and the alt-right really is flirting with dark forces it doesn't understand.love this post. the first paragraph is a remarkably accurate diagnostic.

the internet has facilitated a frenzy of new content as well as a painfully protracted death-rattle for some traditional formats. to your points on quality of writing &amp; low opinion on readership, it seems as if many publications are caught in a death spiral of collapsing revenue =&gt; miserable compensation =&gt; abysmal contributors =&gt; worse content =&gt; further collapsing revenue.  

sarah hoyt's remark on the process, felicitously phrased as "**[roll hard left and die](https://accordingtohoyt.com/2016/11/19/rolling-in-the-deep/),**" remains a powerful explicator as well.

 whoa. this took me by complete surprise:

&gt;Adria Joel, who holds the unwieldy title of **acting manager of gendered violence prevention and support** at the university's diversity and equity office

is this real? not the title posted on linkedin, which is "Employment Equity and AODA Officer at Wilfrid Laurier University." (although the information is public, i'm refraining from posting the link as an excess of precaution. 

well, fuck. had no idea the "cultural swells" i bandied about a [few days earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7c5fec/thought_police_strike_again_as_wilfrid_laurier/dpndu53/) are already here. 

Well if they understood it, they wouldn't be choosing such a loser of a  philosophy.Of course I would argue that Christianity absolutely does have the dark feminine present. From Solomon's warnings to the Whore of Babylon.

EDIT:  The whole idea of the material world being evil is not only not Christian, but that idea has been explicitly condemned as a heresy numerous times (the old Gnostics, etc.). That he follows it up with the "opposites", seems to have Gnostic tones to me ironically.don't be a wilting flower.

that's encouragement, not reproach. 

we're in control of our online experiences: download res, ignore those who appear to be primarily motivated by producing noise or appropriating a fraction of JP to their nefarious ends &amp; keep posting thoughtful stuff. i found your contributions in the former ISIS prisoners thread to be valuable, for example--&amp; more broadly speaking, i like a range of experiences &amp; perspectives in a venue that is, predictably enough, majority male. 

i don't mean any of the above to be dictatorial: of course opting out is fair game, especially when more pressing needs in life present themselves. reddit is, fundamentally, diversionary. for those who do find value in some of JP's content, however, there's a measure of responsibility in engaging appropriately with some of the communities that purport to do the same. I click sign but nothing happens?Visual Metaphor for Step 1 &amp; 2 - https://youtu.be/V4akMaeZ0-kThat's a lot of weasel words. Sure but compared to all the dead cops in Dallas, Louisiana, and New York, one idiot panicking is tragic but not much evidence of a systemic threat. And gang violence dwarfs everybody.

You have to look at what people do, not say. Leftist violence is consistent and wide ranging, especially since everybody gets to be a Nazi now, including Jews (Shapiro), gays (Milo), Christians (Crowder), and JP of all people. The left initiates again and again, and saying "but you guys had one asshole!" just doesn't cut it for me. I can't hear you over the sounds of your actions.If I had faith they knew what a Nazi was it'd be less worrying. Now it's shorthand for "person I hate".DuPont rotation is brutal, you can semi permanently jack up your sleep patterns that way.Compared to the communist blood mountain? Yeah, it kind of is.And I hope they give him the chair if that's true. We aren't  shutting down and assaulting speakers or shooting cops. All you've got is one guy with an agenda that most of us on the right hate anyway.

Can you blame us for calling people communists when they say communist things? Can you point out anything the speakers I've mentioned have said that is a Nazi thing?Two sides argue they can't both be right but they can both be wrong.

Maybe I'm wrong but, Obama and the modern Left are WAY closer to communism than any traditional American conservative is to Nazism.It's a tribal thing, ersatz war in a way. A healthy alternative to the real thing.

That being said it's entertainment, so it can be abused.I've disagreed with you elsewhere today, so it's only fair that I say you're exactly right. Orwell was a man of the left his entire life.Whoa, you said fucking, so I know you're serious.

Nationalizing industry, obsession with class distinction, Frankfurt school, etc. All communist stuff.

NOBODY on the right wants to gin up concentration camps, found a national socialist regime, etc.Wirt's the hero of the story. His basic traits are self-doubt and hopelessness under which is a creative, refined intellect (poetry, music, architecture). His foil is Greg who is essentially the story's Fool. Greg never approaches threats with the gravity they deserve. He doesn't fear the wolf monster in the first episode and eventually asks the Beast for help. His boundless optimism--maybe ignorant calm is a better way of describing it--contrasts Wirt's readiness to accept being lost in the Unknown.

The Woodsmen is an example of what happens to people become incapable of moving forward. He bargains with the Beast believing that the Lantern, the manifestation of his anguish, is the spirit of his daughter and that harvesting Edelwood oil will keep her alive in some manner. The Beast (nihilism) took advantage of the Woodsman's grief and lied about the true nature of the Lantern.

The Beast also tempts Greg and Wirt throughout the story. When Greg approaches the Beast for help, he gives him a series of impossible tasks to complete. Because of Greg's Foolishness--meaning his being an archetypal Fool--he manages to accomplish each one. Eventually he becomes exhausted and begins turning into an Edelwood. So the Beast doesn't convince or force Greg to give in; he just wears him down all the time expecting him to "give up."

When Wirt confronts the Beast, he realizes that the Lantern, the burden the Woodsmen bears and Wirt almost takes unto himself, is really the Beast's soul. Releasing the burden, blowing the Lantern out, ends the Beast and frees the brothers and the Woodsman.

To decontextualize it all, nihilism creeps in when you can't let go of something and keep moving forward. It wears you down until you accept it and allow it to drive you. In the end, it is your choice to move forward or keep wandering around the dark unknown.

I find the scene where the Woodsman blows the Lantern out particularly powerful.

I also think that Adelaide and Auntie Whispers are two sides of the Oedipal Mother.this is JP at his best exploratory self, speculating in convincing fashion across religious, psychological, evolutionary &amp; literary domains. most of the topics are derivative or iterative, but they're explored more clearly, more succinctly &amp; with production values worth praising. 

might be the best "intro to JP" video yet. while I commend the interest in articulating a counter-perspective in your classes, i'd like to suggest that you should (re)focus on the quality of your own thinking. a few examples from the above post:

&gt;athletes are just whiny attention whores

&gt;black people (...) should stop committing so many goddamn crimes

&gt;The black community in America is a fucking disgrace

these are low resolution, careless thoughts. they lack appropriate differentiation or analytical insight: some athletes may indeed be opportunistically grand-standing, but some aren't. we can slice &amp; dice criminality data points along ethnic lines for ages, but that still leaves an overwhelming majority of people with a bit more melanin in their skin who are not just law abiding but constructive participants in their communities who end up in unpleasant circumstances due to no fault of their own. if you're unwilling or unable to see how individuals suffer due to collectivist thinking, and how unfair it is to be perceived at the resolution of one's intractable physical characteristics, then you've missed much of what JP himself is attempting to argue for.  

similarly, there is no such thing as **the black community,** much as there is no **white community** or any other ethno-block. this is the kind of crassly superficial, identity-centric thinking that leads to intersectional claims of recursive power games. 

don't take any of the above as an attack: i'm merely illustrating what i mean by "low resolution, careless thoughts." you can &amp; you should do better.&gt;There is a black community. Are you actually serious? Do you think that black people don't live together in communities? That's what I'm referring to

i'm serious. my post history speaks for itself.

you've volunteered a good example of what i meant by careless thoughts: there's a world of difference, both tonal as well as substantive, between an observation of demographic clustering, paraphrasing what you typed above, and "**the black community in America is a fucking disgrace**," which is what you stated, verbatim, in the original post.

if you don't see that, then it's best that we disengage, as we inhabit different versions of reality. 

(in passing: it seems untenable to simultaneously claim to "*take an individualistic approach*" while insisting that "*the black community*"--in the U.S., presumably, has any merit as a functional descriptor. how "*individualistic*" can one be when collapsing the enormous differences in social strata, age, geography, nationality, cultural affiliation, educational accomplishment, etc, into a single monolithic "*black community?*")
 
&gt;I think individual black criminals should be held responsible for their crimes, both by society at large and themselves, to the degree that the individual case allows it, just like we do with any other person. That should not be controversial at all.

agreed--entirely uncontroversial.

that's not, however, what you originally posted. you stated:

&gt;**black people (...) should stop committing so many goddamn crimes**

once again: that's tonally as well as substantively different from what you offered above. if you meant what you offered on the second pass but instead came up with the above, then you're essentially agreeing with me, that you thrust forth careless, loose thoughts without proper differentiation. 

&gt;Some are victims, others are perpetrators, and the perpetrators are the problem. It doesn't matter that the majority are not perpetrators, because the problem of the perpetrators still exists, and they are the ones victimizing the black community and creating an atmosphere of violence and fear.

all of the above is so flailingly imprecise that it's hard to engage with. i'm not sure who the perpetrators are or what they're perpetrating. criminal behavior, i'm guessing? ok, even granting what i **think** you're stating, which is that both statistically as well as numerically, black victims of crime tend to be exploited or targeted by those who are also black, using whatever arbitrary criteria one chooses when chopping up race, you don't think that a statement like "**black people (...) should stop committing so many goddamn crimes**" are profoundly unfair AND untruthful in the way it lumps people who **do** vs. people who **don't** commit crimes on the basis of their blackness?

how about this: according to [2016 FBI hate crime statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2016/topic-pages/offenders), 46.3% of known hate crime offenders were "white," whatever that means. how do you feel about the following:

&gt;**white people should stop hating and committing so many goddamn hate crimes**

is that an individualistic approach? is it a precise, carefully considered statement? &gt; Explain how it's careless, or fuck off.

in my original reply, this is what i volunteered:

&gt;(some of your statements) lack appropriate differentiation or analytical insight

i mean **exactly** that: it seems as if some of your statements either don't appropriately delineate (the examples i provided in the first reply) or they're self-evident (e.g., the "*I think individual black criminals should be held responsible (...)*" paragraph.)

you differ with my assessment &amp; have found my examples wanting--that's ok. i've not down-voted anything you posted, &amp; my intent, even if i've done a poor job, has been to provide an appropriately skeptical but constructive perspective that might help improve the quality of how you think &amp; how you express yourself. if that has not been the case, that's ok too--here's what i wrote on [managing one's own reddit intake](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7dvvrn/blue_states_practice_the_family_values_red_states/dq1f9xa/). maybe that will prove to be more useful.

&gt;why are you implying that "white" and "black" are not real categories of people? That's fucking absurd.

these categories are far too ambiguous &amp; all-encompassing to be useful except for very niche situations (i can think of a few examples in the domain of medicine, but little else.) a recent [sam harris podcast w/ charles murray](https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/forbidden-knowledge) probes this territory in the context of approaching IQ along racial lines.

re-stating: it seems untenable to simultaneously claim to "*take an individualistic approach*" while insisting that "*white and black are real categories of people*," and that such categories represent an appropriate resolution of thinking in most situations.

&gt;But let's say for argument's sake that white people committed 99.99% of all hate crimes. That would be a troubling statistic, and in that scenario I would have no issue with saying, "Whites need to stop committing so many fucking hate crimes." I would completely agree with that statement, because a lot of white people are committing a lot of hate crimes.

let me play around with this, because it's a good way of illustrating the problem of carelessness.

if white people committed 100% of all hate crimes, it'd mean that according to the FBI, **5,770 hate crimes were committed by white people** in 2016.

5770 out of a population of 223,553,265 (2010 census) means that **0.00002581040361902118%** of white people in the u.s. committed a hate crime in 2016.

do you think the statement "**whites need to stop committing so many fucking hate crimes**" would be an appropriate way of approaching the statistic above?

at any rate, you seem under the impression that you're being personally attacked, or that the skepticism you're experiencing is primarily motivated by aversion to something like "hard hitting race realism." maybe, but my guess is not. 

note that i offered a statement that has nothing to do with race that is just as careless &amp; vacuous as the other example, "*athletes are just whiny attention whores*."

at this point, it'd be best if i followed your suggestion &amp; "fucked off," but before doing so, i'd like you to consider exactly why you posted here when you "*don't like Peterson much*" &amp; you're not "*buying into Peterson's bullshit*"? i mean, if you'd like a more receptive attention, let me help you: r/uncensorednews is that way. good comment. looking into what exactly when into producing the toxic stew now known as chicago southside is tremendously educational. Turns out ancient Greek and Hebrew don't use modern terminology and classifications.

Who knew.With respect... If they didn't make the distinction back then, you can't retroactively hold them to a distinction that was made later. If "fish" as a category is understood as "thing with no arms or legs swimming in the sea", you can't say, "Aha! Centuries later we will define fish differently so you are wrong!" Kind of like how the word "sea" for us means "salt water body of water connected to the greater ocean", but "sea" merely meant "great body of water" to the ancients, and the sea of galilee is what we would call a lake, you can't say "Aha! The sea of galilee wasn't a sea!"

If you want to make the case that the KJV is inerrant, all I'm saying is that this is not the best argument you could use.

EDIT: Meant to say "make the case that the KJV is NOT inerrant"I have a gut feeling if it was a man they would have been way harsher. Just have that feeling.Nope.

Capitalist countries are capable of not butchering their citizens, I mean plenty of them manage not to. Communists can't seem to help themselves. Communism isn't the only evil, there are many others. Free markets create prosperity because they're the only thing that ever has.

You think communist countries don't kill people through lack of health care? Health care is "free" in cuba because THERE ISN'T ANY GODDAM HEALTHCARE. 

I know socialized medicine in Britain kills people that would have survived in the States, I lived there. Read about the tragedy of the commons. The only real economics is free market economics, it's how humans actually act. It can be more or less humane, but there's no comparison.

EDIT: Addendum, people are breaking their backs to enter capitalist countries and getting shot trying to leave communist ones. What kind of person defends that, and what kind of person do  you want to be? 

I want you to look at some photos of the Holodomor and tell yourself "This is fine." This isn't a cute little discussion topic it's flesh and blood human suffering at stake.It's no accident of history that the "reddest" parts of Italy became the "blackest" parts with the rise of Mussolini and back to "red" again.That's not how language works. If a word makes the distinction you need it to make at that point in the languages history, it isn't wrong. You're confusing what language is used for, a direct referent or a metaphor. Scientists say "aquatic life". But not all aquatic life is in the same family. What a bunch of idiots, right? Using the same phrase to capture stuff that isn't in the same family.

Listen, serious scholars don't use this argument for the reasons I've mentioned. Communism as a "stateless system" is a mythical creature that no one has ever seen. I'm using common parlance. But I'll correct it for the sake of amity: Socialist Cuba doesn't have any goddam healthcare.

Who says they don't? What do people choose when they have a choice is the point here, and they run like hell from one and towards another. Why is that and why aren't you curious?

Of course it's not fine. But what children, where, and how exactly is capitalism responsible, and not a civil war, natural disaster, etc.? And is it in countries that rely on food packages from the capitalist West? 

Socialism is wrecking Venezuela, like it wrecked Russia, China, etc., and people who weren't starving before are starving now. Coincidence? Why does full blooded socialism never work but capitalism, you have to admit at least sometimes create prosperous societies?Not a blatant lie, it's been debunked so many times, there's nothing more I can tell you. Al Jazeera unbiased enough for you?

http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/06/201265115527622647.html

Pay special attention to the free market creeping in when it does work, it's all there in the article. Why do you think anything in this world can be had for free? Why do you think the government running something means "fair and efficient"?

But they weren't starving. Ukraine was feeding Europe. 

Literally no one is making that case, only that they are responsible for actions that directly caused the deaths of many. Read the Gulag Archipelago.Back in college I would often look at the studies supposedly backing up a particular claim. Frequently the study made very limited claims, "Assuming some stuff, and using this methodology with these problems, we think there's a connection. Maybe." By the time it filtered down to class or popular periodicals, these modest claims became the TruthTM.ok, let's take this claim of lacking differentiation seriously:

the key insight of classical marxism was that various social mechanics serve to establish, perpetuate &amp; defend wealth hierarchies.

[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality), for lack of a better source: 

&gt;"Intersectionality proposes that all aspects of one's identity need to be examined as simultaneously interacting with each other and affecting one's privilege and perception in society, and that these facets of identity cannot simply be observed separately.[6] As such, intersectionality is not simply a view of personal identity, but rather an **overarching analysis of power hierarchies present within identities**.[6] 

do you disagree that these two methodologies depart from the same fundamental premise of viewing most--perhaps all--human interaction as elaborate power hierarchy games?

i'm not making any other claims than the above. do you find it reasonable?ok. excellent! 

[take a read](https://thecharnelhouse.org/2014/02/02/postmodern-origins-of-intersectionality/) &amp; see if you follow the argument that post-modernism's basic claims function as facilitators of the link between classical marxism &amp; intersectional theory. 

a quick aside: i fundamentally agree that JP is often cavalier about "postmodernism." it's too large of a category to be functional, &amp; he would do well to start filtering his critiques to more specific figures (derrida) or theories.He works for a University. There are things which he has to say, and we should be more understanding of it.A lot of creativity originates from debauchery. Plus, freeing the mind from consequences can lead to amazing things, although those around them won't like it too much. There is always a price to be paid - one could have more restrictions from the cognitive elites and have a lesser degree of civilization or one could have a less restrictive society for them, increase some immediate suffering, but improve civilization overall. For me, reaching a higher standard of existence is more important than the collateral damages.Sort of, and of a religious, not racial nature. We don't like making those distinctions now, but it is a whole different animal.Because they misunderstand free speech and the concept of rights. 

To my knowledge, there are free speech restrictions in the US in the case of captive audiences. This was the basis for the court rulings forcing the Westboro Baptist Church to protest at certain times and at a certain distance from funerals. 

The right is the right to speak. Being heard, platformed, etc. is a consequence of exercising that right *not* a prerequisite for its exercise. It's also a key distinction, religious choices versus accident of birth. To the best of my knowledge he did not support any violence or dis-appropriation of Jewish people, he did however believe that they had a crucially defective religious opinion. Vastly different from the racialists and perpetrators of pogroms. I have nothing but contempt for leftism for example, however I'm not suggesting that harm should come to them.If the Big 5 measures a biological predisposition toward behaving in a particular way, then I don't see how changing certain things in your life would change those biological predispositions. Sure, changing certain things *may* reduce severity, frequency or provide better ways of coping/controlling certain behaviors, but that doesn't mean they're cured. To me, it's like giving a clinically depressed person medication. The medication may make life easier for the person but it doesn't fix the depression in the same way that a flat tire can be fixed by putting on a spare.

That being said, I've experienced a ton of benefits from meditation; therapists usually call it *mindfulness training*. When I was meditating daily, behaviors and feelings that would fit under neuroticism decreased and my ability to focus over prolonged periods of time increased. The underlying issues remained but their severity was mitigated by meditation.

My experience teaching my younger siblings (7 and 8) some basic techniques is that they don't fight as much. If one tries to pick on the other, the other is more likely to find an adult instead of engaging. Well yes and no.

Who? Whom?

Who gets to decide and why? Where should the line be drawn and on what basis do we make that decision?

If I choose not to abide by it? What gets done with me?

I'm especially worried as a Christian. In the UK, pastors have faced down the law for things they've said in their own pulpit. Their words apparently justified their imprisonment. There are millions of us and we believe things that aren't progressive and we can't change just because a "law" says we should. Christianity was born in the fire of dying in the face of unjust government edicts. How hard are you willing to hit us to get us to stop? Will you be surprised if we eventually hit back?

Or, alternatively, unless it's a direct call for violence everybody could just be an adult and not be cowardly in the face of words. I've heard horrifying things people have said about my faith and my co-religionists and I don't want to prosecute anybody.lovely to read this. appreciate you sharing this. for those wondering how deep the rot goes, and what exactly the throw-away "dismantles master's house" is about, here's a primer:

the full phrase is: "**master's tools will never dismantle the master's house**," the title of [an influential speech](https://www.muhlenberg.edu/media/contentassets/pdf/campuslife/SDP%20Reading%20Lorde.pdf) by Audre Lorde, dated 1984. here are a few choice quotes:

&gt;What does it mean when **the tools of a racist patriarchy** are used to examine the fruits of that same patriarchy? (...)

&gt;If white American feminist theory need not deal with the differences between us, and the **resulting difference in our 
oppressions**, then how do you deal with the fact that the women who clean your houses and tend your children while you attend 
conferences on feminist theory are, for the most part, poor women and women of Color? **What is the theory behind racist feminism**? (...)

&gt;Women of today are still being called upon to stretch across the gap of male ignorance and to educated men as to our existence and our needs. **This is an old and primary tool of all oppressors to keep the oppressed occupied with the master's concerns**

and now you know in what ghastly collectivist, resentful filth intersectionalism's ever-putrefying roots are moored in.

i recommend everybody interested in identity politics to read audre lorde, especially [sister outsider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Outsider). take it from lorde herself: if you're not a socialist black feminist, **she wanted you crushed**. she was extraordinarily vocal in asserting that absolutely everybody who did not look, fuck and voted like her is an enemy worth hounding until they surrender or expire.

don't take my word: just read her, then add on some adrienne rich for good measure. A lot of great music, literature, and creativity originated in drugs, orgy, and other things the prudish old style teachers would not approve. And, creative minds tend to be assholes who regularly cheat their underlings, and harder to deal with. But they are allowed to get away with them since what they do create more economic value so it is a good thing.Actually something like that did occur in Ancient Greece. It did last quite a while until the Macedonians arrived.I'm not an anti-Peterson troll, but the "community" around Peterson is insular and bizarrely collectivised -- something Metokur points out himself after being on the sour end of it.

I think that a lot of people here might be using following Peterson as a substitute for actually sorting themselves out, to borrow a phrase. But I'd like to see where this comment thread goes.Not big fans of the family when you have single mother baby farms. Or purity for that matter if the attitude is "as long as the baby is Aryan, we don't care how it got made". Not a fan of Christian traditions when you "euthanize" the infirm, and start throwing crucifixes out and imprisoning priests and pastors. Also, it's hard to support natural hierarchy when you try your hardest to overthrow the natural hierarchy that was already there. 

They never met a pillar of German culture they didn't try to cut down. Except for all the statements condemning racism and collectivism and the compelling arguments he makes against identity politics. They also aren't his only influences by a long, long, shot. 

Darwin said some really racist shit and I'm pretty sure you'd be cool with him right? If you threw out everybody with an objectionable opinion, toss yourself on that pile too champ, because I guarantee you've believed some ignorant shit in your time.Don't downvote this.

Whilst it was only one instance, I really think this was a poor move by Peterson. And if it wasn't his decision, he should've let someone else speak about it.  
I've got no sympathy for the alt-right, but the idea behind a free speech event is that all speech is of equal value before it's evaluated by audience members. Disallowing someone is clearly contradicting that their speech is of equal value to theirs.

It's the one glaring instance of brazen hypocrisy I've seen by Peterson, and I don't think I'd stand for it if it were anyone else either.I'd like you to elaborate more on this so that there's something to grab onto.  
Do the other members give the impression of being pseudo-intellectuals?  
What do you mean by Crpyto-SJWs? People still trying to shed the ideological baggage, or follower people who have just found someone else to lead them? Something else?  

What's the end point of having been Red Pilled to you?I don't think this is a good path to follow. You aren't wrong about his content, but the repulsion isn't something you should act on.  
You're looking at a fire, and fire has destructive and constructive uses.

As Peterson says, your enemies are the best people to get criticism from. Or how he likes to quote Neitzsche as having the critical edge of a hammer. The criticisms are more than valid.That's a /pol/ insult, I believe.Thank you very much.I'd say they're obviously two sets of people. But I think Peterson should be confident in his convictions that he doesn't need to distance himself, as he's quite clearly not alt-right.Fair enough.I'm actually less surprised, CS Lewis was a myth guy, that was his academic specialty. He was unique in that he viewed Christianity as the "True Myth", all of the other stories were foggy mirror versions of the "myth that happened".

EDIT: Addendum, check out Screwtape Prepares a Toast as wellThe intellectual heritage of Christianity is so incredibly deep and bare knuckle about epistemology. Treating it flippantly shows more ignorance than anything else, it's why the new atheists seem so odious on first glance. 

Ironically, they're the "ignorant" mirror image of the stereotype of the "ignorant" hillbilly fundamentalist. Repeating what they've heard, not thought through, louder and stronger more than thinking.The way he described his interactions with "new talent" as a music PR guy was quite something. "You have to give the audience your soul". Coming from an atheistic Jew, you realise how much there is there to unpack.I think it was found that what Trump was doing was intentionally filing for bankruptcy as a method of tax evasion? I think.  
I mean, it's not a great thing to do but I admire his consistency on the whole lowering taxes thing. And it's also a very well calculated move. Look up the virtue of eutrapelia. It basically means "right recreation".

Human beings can't live without play. Even slaves and guys in prison pursue recreation, and the most primitive tribe has some sort of recreation. 

The rule of thumb for me, is whether my recreation is something I enjoy or if I find it dulling. I get dull if I play video games, etc., too much, so I then know to roll back. As long as it doesn't take much time but I enjoy it and it "sharpens" me up, I view it as probably good.That's an interesting argument. That both sides are entitled to their speech and only one side can be defended.  
That's not how it tends to work, though. Both sides are defended, the police are there as mediators to dispel undue acts of force.  
Therefore, the side that begins acting in actual violence is the one that becomes policed.  

Now I'm willing to assume that it's the case historically that Anti-fa engaged the violence in all the examples in his video. I know Anti-fa is willing to jump to violence on their own terms, so often, so blatantly and so disgustingly I'm not going to give them the benefit of the doubt here.  
But I'd be willing to have someone correct me on this. It just can't be as simple as immigrant=good, though. We also shut the doors at various times in our history. 

I've been hearing arguments from the left and right for years, for different underlying reasons (the left likes the new voter base and the right likes the cheap labor). But there has to be some limit, when you start preferring the foreigner to a fellow citizen, can you be said to represent them at all?

We've got poor black, poor white, and poor hispanic citizens who's lives and communities have been vacuumed out by labor that doesn't have to play by the same rules. Don't rule out that last one either, here in Texas some of the most anti-immigration men I know are hispanic. Yes, for whatever reason I've dated some Eastern European girls, just kind of happened wasn't something I sought out. It was like dating a normal adult human being and I was actively weirded out that they seemed to be putting in as much effort as I did. You still had different "tests" or little arguments, but as long as you acted like a man they'd calm down and go back to being affectionate.

I don't want to turn this into a slam on anybody and I'm sure there are plenty of great Western women, but I'd never dated any American girl that seemed to put any effort in. If you acted like a man they gave you grief, if you showed weakness, they showed contempt. There was no way to win. And they weren't "bad" women either. 

I got into the habit of asking women, any women, what they thought their job in a relationship was. Nobody really had an answer. Some were just silent, some had to think hard for a bit (my interpretation is that's because the thought had never occurred to them) and always seemed to come up with an answer that was basically "whatever I was going to do anyway".Greater community does not equal no nuclear family, I threw my back out trying to make that leap.Well sure, I think I would put more weight on cultural reasons, though.True, but I believe that North Africa wasn't actually black before the Arab conquest, during the Roman period it was an ethnic mix if I remember correctly. 

But yes, if we have to take back all the conquest eventually we're just going to be cramming everybody into tiny enclaves in the Caucasus, Africa, etc. No one is suggesting that, or should be (you can never tell), so we kind of need to just accept that we're here now.Most of that question still stands though. Put on a burka and hope nobody decides you need FGM?Peterson gets a salary from a university, which means he has to not deal with people the universities are not likely to approve.I think that is where we might genuinely disagree; I see cultural differences as massive in practice. People always say we have more in common than not, true enough, but the differences can be life and death. Colombia is a beautiful country but in practice it's dominant culture doesn't really care about honest governance by comparison to mine. That isn't minor.

I mean, I understand where you're coming from. However I think it's also dangerous to ignore pertinent differences; the other fellow may not be as tolerant as we imagine ourselves to be. Thomas Sowell has written some great stuff on culture that you might find interesting.By comparison, oh hell yeah? I can go to the cops and not expect to pay a bribe. 

Just because nobody's perfect doesn't mean one place isn't safer or better than another. We complain about corruption in our own politics in America but compared tho most of Latin America, Russia, China, etc. our crooks are downright quaint.Sure, but it's what I have to go on, nobody's going to fund a study titled "Do Western Women Suck?: An Investigative Analysis". On the other hand, if I have this experience and I keep meeting guys who say the same, I'm kind of a dope if I'm waiting for multiple peer reviewed social research studies to provide some kind of scientific consensus.

Maybe, semi-serious relationships with 4, 1-3 dates with maybe a couple of dozen. Eastern European women, 2 more serious relationships, arguably 3. Plus a plethora of female friends over the years from both.

You've got to go on rules of best evidence, it's how you live your life in the absence of absolute certainty about all matters. Also, don't think I'm saying more than I am. I have friends who are married to Western women who are real sweethearts, so I know they're there. Maybe the nice Western women don't want to date me, but the nice Eastern European women do! You don't need to have the nominal feminist endorsing radical Islam for there to be an alliance between the two movements.

Consider the alt-right a year and a half ago. At that time, a lot of the alt-right really were just young people who hated Hillary Clinton and trolled like Milo, but didn't really have serious racial hangups. But they made an alliance with the more unsavory sects of the right - because after all, white supremacists are also trolls and they also support Trump - and those sects took over the movement, as it were. 

Milo, Gavin, Lauren Southern and company never endorsed white supremacists, but nonetheless the more radical people rode on their coattails and rose in prominence and influence. 

How is the feminist-Islamist alliance different?Maybe alliance isn't the right word, but consider this analogy. I don't know if this is literally true, but it's pretty close. 

Let's call Milo and his horde of trolls (I like Milo btw), the crew at Rebel (Gavin, Lauren), and few other loners like Tommy Robinson and Mike Cernovich the "alt-light." 

The broader goals of the alt-light seemed to be fighting SJWs and getting Trump elected. I don't believe they had any racially motivated goals. 

But -- guess who else wanted to fight the SJWs and to get Trump elected? Richard Spencer, David Duke, and Christopher Cantwell: what used to just be the radical wing of "alt-right," but is now is the main part of the alt-right. To them, Trump and the SJWs were just a piece of the white agenda. 

Think of it like a train. Milo and Cantwell are on the same train. At some point, Milo jumped off it (it obviously wasn't a black train), but Cantwell stayed on. Milo didn't like where the train was going, even though he arguably jump-started it. 

Maybe he thought he would be able to stop it when he got off, maybe it never occurred to him that train would keep running, or maybe he just didn't give a shit either way. I don't know, but eventually he denounced the alt right.

Now, keep the same story line, but just change the characters. Instead of the alt-right, the cast is made up of the intersectionality groups: feminists, gays, blacks, transtrenders and Muslims. 

Here are three unresolved questions about the plot, and I think this is really what we should all be trying to figure out. 

1. It's been said that the alt-right is made up of about 500 true believers and the rest are just fat, lazy fedora lords in their mothers' basement. Is this true, or is the alt-right something we have to urgently contend with? 

2. Are Islamists (here's another issue: which Muslims?) a dangerous group to Western civilization? If so, how should we influence the culture so that Muslims don't thrive, and/or what policies should we enact to keep out their immigrants?

3. If Islamists are a threat, when will the other intersectional groups (who control all the major institutions) jump off the train? 

Edit: I got a little carried away. To answer your original question: I don't think it matters if "alliance" is the best way to describe the forces that we're seeing, because either way they're propelling the train in the same direction.i'm unsure male *under-representation* in veterinary schools (or nursing, or teaching, or any number of "care-taking" jobs) "matters" substantively more than, e.g., male *over-representation* in CEO or political roles, just as an example.

not necessarily dismissing the submission; just attempting a survey of what goes wrong when engaging with the idea of proportional/fair representation in various roles. too often, a "side" is picked &amp; a great deal of cherry-picking &amp; tap-dancing goes on to make broad claims of victimization, which in turn lead to policy proposals designed to benefit narrow interests. i'm sure veterinary schools would be pleased with the establishment of a few well-funded male-targeted scholarship funds, just as an example... cui bono, indeed. 

there are large, macro trends that appear to favor personality factors that lean female--agreeableness, &amp; many higher ed fields seem riddled with ideology or rank incompetence, &amp; i suspect ongoing automation will further disrupt male-dominated professions, transportation, it &amp; beyond. what to do about any this is murky, &amp; i remain profoundly skeptical of any suggested solutions that depart from collectivist assumptions instead of focusing on maximizing the autonomy &amp; agency of individuals regardless of their sex. 



My *opinion* is that the SJW wing of the left rely on a variety of victim groups as a fuel source to keep their movement relevant. Muslims have disproportionately been victims of US foreign policy in the past few decades, so there's the foundation for why they should be included. this seems about right.

a paradoxically charitable thing that can be reasonably said about those firmly gripped by the ideological fervor du jour: they inhabit pockets of profound privilege--not the absurd, intersectionalist take on the term, but in the sense of a day-to-day life of astonishing prosperousness, if not profligacy. 

i find JP's admonishment that looking in the mirror, **the overwhelming majority of those currently living in north America are the global &amp; historical 1%,** or perhaps more accurately put, something like the 0.1%. 

and so: a cavalier distaste for uncomfortable or dissenting facts about history &amp; the world, and tragi-comically unmoored perspectives. 

here's a thought: before anybody gets into any institution of education past high school, they ought to spend a minimum of 6 months living in another country and another 6 months working in the retail or service industries. i think we'd have vastly more grounded &amp; deliberate people, &amp; more importantly, way more resilient to ideological pathologies. 
&gt; We

No. I was never part of the alt-right, in any iteration. Nor did I ever become a white nationalist. I did like Milo quite a bit, but I never thought his flirtation with the alt-right was a good thing. I don't like your use of "we" one bit. Oh, ok I understand now. Then I have a couple of questions for you, because that changes everything. 

1. How many of you would you say went from just alt-right to ethno-nationalists? If you had to put a percentage to it. My impression was that after Charlottesville, it became real to a lot of people and they jumped ship.
2. How do you view people like Milo, Gavin, Lauren, et al? Never true believers to begin with, or did their legs just get wobbly and they tapped out? 
3. What do you do to promote the cause outside of the internet? 
4. What are you drawn to about JBP? Is there something about him that appeals uniquely to your ethno-nationalism? No, I'm not conflating the nominal Muslim with radical Islamists. My point is that SJWs don't care about the distinction and so they support Islam, not just the nominal Muslim over Islamists. I was bouncing in between this and trying to look at the big picture of my problems. I'll stick with this one and see where it takes me. Thank youIt depends on the individual! If the Colombian writer Nicolas Gomez Davila was being mass produced I say bring on the incredible dancing Nicolae!

But when you squeeze the poor out of employment by importing borderline and actually illegal labor and they're pissed, they're right to be pissed. It's basic economics that wages can't rise as long as the labor supply is basically endless. Not to mention the aggressive number of criminal gangs that we're not aggressively deporting, or at least were not.

Plus, I agree with most of what you said, I just don't think pouring an extra million people a year on top of it is the way forward. I'm not trying to win a morality contest, but we're here now. Strikes me as one of those jobs that's closer to being a calling. Like a minister, or a true professional soldier.I would say that it does matter substantively more, vets are essential for food production, CEOs and politicos don't usually add as much value as you think. If the under representation starts impacting food supply, that's a major issue.Yeah, my impression is that if real ethno-nationalists - like in the Turner Diaries - came along, 90% of these people would jump ship. &gt; The day that fit, intelligent, and otherwise valuable men start joining up.

You're absolutely right. Thankfully, these men usually are the ones that don't need causes to give them pride in something. When they start dabbling in racial politics, I think that'll be a sign that there are worse things going on. OK, I'll preface this with me not engaging with the question, but more that I'm engaging with how poorly asked the question is.

That "Who would you want running a boat?" example was shit.  
So, you, who would vote, wants someone educated in seafaring to be the captain? Hey, whatever floats your boat.  
Why would you also not vote for someone educated in countryfaring to be ruler?

The fact that anyone you would ask would say "I want the captain to know how to be a captain" ultimately defeats the argument it's making.  
That doesn't sound like one of Socrates profound insights at all. I'm casting doubt on this.Sort of. Justice is to each their due, and lying is an offence against justice, if it is what the other person is owed.

There is a line of reasoning that you don't owe a murderer jack, you do owe his victims protection. Generally you owe people the truth, sometimes you owe them silence, they are not entitled to know, sometimes you owe them nothing. That last one is extraordinarily rare though. I'll share mine

I agree with like 100% of what I read. Can anyone suggest a career path for someone high in openness and low in consicoutunesness Yeah basically my life's problem...i do computer stuff (web dev + many other things related to entrepreneurship) now but lack discipline and focus I guessThey couldn't even get the man's ex-wives to say something bad about him. That alone should give anyone pause.Heh. See what I mean?They find the gay gene every 3 or 4 years. Like they find "life on Mars" (you know, signs that maybe kind of point to evidence that could be bacterium related) every 3 or 4 years. People are just really invested in the "right" outcome.In general , yes. They are quite replaceable. In the very rare cases there are irreplaceable, like Henry Moseley who has proved to be more irreplaceable than every single Turk who has lived since 1915 (including Orhan Pamuk, Turkey's sole Nobel laureate (in literature) who has chosen to live in Paris now). But that is a very rare case.Human lives have limits. Civilization has a much higher limit. The stuff we shot to the space will fly around for quite a long, long time after every human alive now perishes. 

The last person born in the 19th century, an Italian woman who did not accomplish anything important, died earlier this year. But the Mechanicsville hydroelectric station, built in 1897, still works. (And it is two years older than her)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanicville_Hydroelectric_PlantIf might be irreplaceable for the person in question, but in general, most people are disposable.

Marx is just another product of the rationalism of 19th century. He never lived in a Marxist country, and I don't think he would have lasted long in such regimes.

Civilization is advancing tech, conquering new territories, and expanding the horizons. Not some soap opera.Cheers, man. 

I would much prefer to post it publicly, and post it daily.

Infact, I would like for this subreddit to equally focus on a sortingyourselfout community. Very strongly.

If we could have a dedicated sorting out subreddit from within ourselves, that would be awesomeI am currently in the process of sorting myself out, and I think this time it's for real and I have a feeling that 2008 is going to be a really good time.

I have made myself a ritual that I will blog here, DAILY, as a self post, on what my updates are. I will have daily goals. I will acquire skills and habits that allow me to carry the work that I do.

Currently, I am trying to write and clear my head out to make goals, I am trying to set up scheduling habits, I am trying to set up meditation, exercise, and also, spend time on the actual work.

Today, however, it took me 1.5 hours to write things down and schedule. Maybe it was because this was the first time I tried doing anything like this.

So, that's one thing. 


But I would really hope that the community rallies together and has a dedicated subreddit to peopel trying to sort themselves out.

Edit: It was a long post, but I thought I would break it up and post it as a different comment.I think we as a community should really support the sorting yourself out process, taking inspiration from religious experiences. Good rituals can be designed, like a sacred time sitting down, writing your possible schedule for the next day and then seeing if you can go through it.

The possibilities are endless, but with enough people talking things out amongst themselves, you can give people...

...a place to come to in times of dire needs.

A place to articulate their issues in life

A place to encourage self authoring

A place to practice the art of consistency, scheduling, and good habits, where the sort yourself out community/subreddit can cheer for everyone. Patterns, Pitfalls, New habits, Things that upset you, can all be discussed: and more importantly, challenges can be held.

Maybe doing an exercise for seven days consistently. 

You get the drift.

But a community that is dedicated to people sorting themselves out, and a community that can empower each other with it's experience, and also extract patterns from it's users: this would be amazing.
Just did the IPNP short test.

I think I had the best results possible, except two major outliers.

96% on Trust.
5% on Conscientiousness, including 1% on Dutifulness and Self Efficacy.

So, gullible and unreliable! Haha!

But here's the good news: I am 37 on Neuroticism, including just an average on the trait depresssion. This in itself is a huge progress in a couple of months.

Even in low conscientiousness, I think my problem is not being lazy, but being more clear about the goal and then showing up for it. It's a matter of skill and not personality for me, is what I assume.

I think I should be very high in conscientiousness in a couple of months.start with a few of his documentaries--they allow a peek inside of a turbine of a mind, dangerously sharp &amp; forever turning, turning. it'll also introduce you to his instantly recognizable teutonic sputter, a memorable companion on whatever journey he's filming:

[lo &amp; behold, reveries of a connected world](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5275828/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_3)  - on internet, the madness &amp; ecstasy thereof

i wonder how many maladies--cultural or personal--can be tracked to a lack of meaningful modern bonding rituals between men and women, especially of different generations.
wish posts like this wouldn't get down-voted--something that either disagrees with a "JP premise," if you will, or else posits a reasonably different perspective. 

one thing to bury poorly thought/written chaff, or the trolling, subtle or otherwise, that invariably finds its way on the sub. what was it--"act as if anybody who's telling you that you're wrong might be **right** AND doing you a favor.

&gt;What about Finn? He seems to fit the male hero role despite the fact he is a supporting character.

don't know about this. he's used primarily for comedic relief, and his chronic incompetence doesn't seem a function of hardship/struggle, which is part of a natural heroic cycle, but rather a consequence of his jittery, comic persona. there's a good reason the internet's take on finn's note-worthy battle was an infatuation with an otherwise [disposable stormtrooper](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tr-8r-the-stormtrooper). u/TheseNThose has [a few insightful comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7isxmp/star_wars_has_it_all_wrong_and_it_has_unintended/dr1hway/) on how finn could've been set up for a story arc that emphasizes an archetypal journey toward agency &amp; self-determination.
Your point is valid, but john adams is basically dilineating a precise motivation for getting rich.

As a student from a third world country, I can confirm.Yes, I was wondering. Thank you&gt; Most of my memories of my mother from my childhood is about her either talking down my father, or just trying to negotiate us kids to her side. My father on the other hand was not too fun to be around. Short temper, high standards, loud voice. 

Right there with you, my friend :-)

&gt; I've been lost the last few years. Gained weight, lost friends, I even thought I've lost my mind from time to time. I'm desperate for a direction in life, I want to be proud of myself and those around me, and I want to build something that will remain.

Right there with you again, mate. :-) 

I am here, on my own journey. Keeping a long story short, I think I have immense potential, but have essentially spent the last four years bed ridden, and the four years before that in full blown panic attacks. You can take a look at the other post of mine, where I have made a ritual of posting my daily updates, with a focus on scheduling and identifying my dragons to slay.

I hope that I see you around this journey, and wish that you can really find a strong direction in life. Maybe that ends up happening here in the next month. Maybe this year. But I hope to see you around.

I would love to see your journey of finding yourself and hope that I can contribute in trivial matters atleast through this community. See you around :-)

University of Chicago still counts as an achievement. :-) Here is the NAC for waking up late:

The Steps to do an NAC can be summarized as follows: 

 

    Define what you really want and what is preventing you from doing it. 

    Associate massive pain to not changing now and massive pleasure to changing right now. 

    Interrupt the limiting pattern 

    Create a new empowering pattern 

    Condition the pattern till it is consistent 

    Test it, do an ecology check. 

 

So, let's do the steps 

 

    Define what you really want and what is preventing you from doing it. 

        What I really want: I want to get up and be productive. 

        What is preventing me from it: 

            Waking up late, groggy.  

            Waking up in a low state of mind 

            Waking up and then getting hooked on the computer 

            Being indecisive. 

    Associate Massive Pain to not changing now, massive pleasure to changing right now. 

        Massive Pain: Think of Dad. All bad memories. You don't have to look farther than that. 

        Massive Pleasure: Change the state of mind, can work. Feel the feelings, look at the picture. Get up. 

    Interrupt the limiting pattern, scramble it. 

        Waking up late, groggy. Interrupt. 

            After getting up, stay vertical for two minutes. 

            Count numbers. 

            If you sleep, you die. 

        Waking up in a low state of mind 

            Loud noises in the head / Recite a poem, a song lyric. 

            When possible, listen to a good song. 

            Yoga: a couple of poses. From sleeping, to erect, to sitting, to Pranayama. 

            Do Arul's exercise, even if out of order. 

            Read the manifesto, from the Mandir. 

    Empowering Pattern 

        Get up, Do the exercise. 

        Go to an office space is possible.  

        Drill down a couple of pomodori before you do anything else. 

        Meditate for 5 minutes, if you are right on time. 

    Keep conditioning this. 

    Keep doing an ecology check. 


And I think that is it. Current thoughts: It is not just enough to do this thinking through. It's important to do this when it happens. Then, it is also necessary that you keep conditioning this regularly, as a ritual. Because, forming this habit, and forming it fast is the biggest thing that you have in your life. It is the difference between life and death.

You actually have to sit down and do it. :-) 

Taking that to it's logical conclusion means you couldn't ever charge someone with neglect, as it's their choice not to use their body to care for their child. Not only that, you'd have to be in favour of all the other consequences of the absolute autonomy argument. So you believe pregnant women have absolute autonomy, but mothers don't? Oh yeah, I see him and my hindbrain shouts "TOFF"It's a real mixed bag. I've liked some of their stuff, but other parts have left me thinking "you've got to be kidding me".Thanks for the reminder, mate. :-) 

From the outside in, it probably looks like that. And who knows, maybe I AM trying to change too much.

From the inside, however, my problem is that even getting 3-4 hours of regular work done is an impossible task, because of all the other bad habits.

I am focusing on incremental change, and only just now figuring out what I can change. Sleeping on time, getting up on time, getting some focused work done, scheduling to get yourself excited about the next day. The little habits.You're doing way too much my friend. You're overthinking everything and trying to achieve too many goals at once. There's a reason Dr Peterson says to start by cleaning your room first. Maybe go rewatch the lectures where he talks about it. You don't need these fancy protocols and you aren't productive enough to achieve a lot yet and that's ok. Picking up the heaviest burden you can, means you still have to be able to move with the damn thing! 

Start by cleaning your room and aim to keep it tidy as much as possible. I mean clean it properly. Sort out your clothes, make your bed, scrub the carpet/mop floor, hoover it, wipe down all the surfaces and the walls. Then declutter your stuff, place all your paperwork in files, store thing in a neat and organised way and buy a small waste basket (empty as soon as it's full). Make sure you have fresh bed linen and change it often. Oh and no food plates or cups to be left in their overnight. That's a fair bit to be getting on with, cleaning your room is no small matter and it may take you months to even do this and learn to keep it clean. 

Then you have to try and improve your sleep pattern, without that it's going to almost impossible to progress. Now a clean room and fresh linen should make it easier to sleep. Following basic sleep hygiene (google it), will also help tremendously. Key thing is to get up at the same time, every morning and eat breakfast. Exercising and leaving the house will also help to a degree, but you shouldn't be focusing on them as a goal if you haven't got a sleeping pattern sorted yet. You might need medical intervention, a short course of sleeping tablets can help you set up a routine. 

I'd also recommend getting some kind of psychological help if you can. Talking therapy can be extremely beneficial and help get at those underlying problems. Regular appointments help create routine and give you a reason to leave the house. 

  

Am a Yorkshireman!Thanks man :-)

I am sure I am overthinking it a bit, because that has been my sin, my flaw. I will not argue against it. But I am pretty fit psychologically and physically, and just not in a productive state of affairs. For example, I can do a 5K run in 30 minutes and run for 1.5 hours without fatigue. I lack skills of scheduling, actually making time, and then sitting on the whole thing to do it, consistently, day after day, everyday.

I like your concern, man. It means the community knows what the theory is, and what the right way is.

I have done cleaning my room, and I have cleaned my room, my hard drives, my folders. I am completely off porn, and I am also dating. So the basics are all set.

My main concern here is to drop off bad habits, or seemingly harmless habits. :-) That's the hard part for me, where sleeping at the right time is an issue, getting in the swing of things, and getting a few hours of focused work done is a challenge right now.

I was waking up at 7 AM as recently as 10 days back, but I felt back on this comfortable routine again. I will try and get back to waking up at 7.You'd be surprised at how many people can't even iron a shirt.  Do not kill yourself!

If you fix one major problem, congrats, you're now down to two and no longer a lost cause. 

Just don't do anything you can't take back. I don't know your situation you might be in a terrible way that would make this understandable. The only real thing is that there isn't necessarily peace in the grave. It's a terrible bet to make. Are you that sure?Wow, it's like a disease. That isn't anything OP has direct control over as far as I can tell. 

Do you have some swing in politics? Neither do I. I don't think this helps OP.

OP, listen to a lot of the comments on this thread, pay more attention to the positive ones first, don't make decisions in a "hopeless" state. Men have found ways to be happy in concentration camps, read some Viktor Frankl. Your life isn't over by a long shot. I'm not minimizing, just saying and it is a process. But this is temporary. Just in case I'm ever in a magical coma, and a kiss can save me, I give consent to be kissed. Even if it's by like a troll (you know a literal troll, not the internet kind). Dude, just stop.

This guy's depressed. Telling a depressed guy, "Hey here's how you're extra screwed" is the worst thing you can do.

It doesn't matter how you or I feel about healthcare, just try actually helping and turning off the politics for five minutes to see a human being in distress.Dude, switch on. How does saying "hope you're Canadian and if you're not you're screwed" actually help him? Dare I say it, doesn't it actually HURT to focus on this when you can't do anything about it?
Sure let's tell the depressed guy he's fucked. Switch ON.

BTW, he personally even if he is a poor American, may not actually be, he may have local resources to help. I have had that exact same thought. 

I think they're so joyless and negative that they've gone blind. The fact that they freaked out so hard over the "it's okay to be white" posters (if you can call them that) gave the WNs such a massive entre. They actually flipped over and said it's actively wrong to be white. So if you can't help how you were born and you don't want to lay down and die, how receptive are you going to be to alternative opinions?

It's like a story in 48 Laws of Power about two Chinese generals who had missed their rendezvous point, a death penalty offense. One asked the other "What's the penalty for treason and what's the penalty for being late?" "Death" "Well, we're already late." Then the rebellion began...They really do see any kind of objective categorisation as inherently exclusionary (which it is) and therefore something to be deconstructed. It's paradoxical that they promote diversity so religiously and yet seek to end something as fundamental to human diversity as national identity. Thank you all, for your support.Have you done self authoring, especially past authoring? I think that is a good place to start. And the other things would be to start journalling.

Conscientiousness might not come in by grinding yourself. I don't think people low in conscientiousness have the mental urgency and thought process to increase it. It might lead to another spiral downwards.

Maybe the way of increasing is to pick very relevant goals, and start with very achievable sub-goals. And this would require future authoring.sorters.club seems like an awesome place for people to specifically focus on sorting themselves out.

I would sign up in a heartbeat if I could only use my reddit id to login. Or maybe have an anonymous login not connected to my email/google/facebook logins.Hey man, I had a friend like that with me who became increasingly violent. But then he had a breakthrough in life and he started feeling better about himself. He's still dealing with low conscientiousness. But he's much better now, much more balanced.

I think the first step would be to do a past authoring. Get a past authoring suite and work through it. And keep posting your daily updates. And do it. Do it well. And even if you stop, start again and do it. Then tell us how you feel.Low intellect might mean a lower disposition towards thinking philosophically. I have a high percentile on that, and I can tell you I think the shit out of things. It's a very rich - and noisy at times - thought process that craves a lot of information, and seeks to understand everything, to the point of being obsessive about it.

I doubt if the Big5 intellect has anything to do with IQ. This low score might mean that your thought process is much more pragmatic.

Seeing your high score on conscientiousness, I can say very easily that you prefer getting shit done rather than thinking "useless big" thoughts.

This is an amazing score to have. It's VERY balanced, little neuroticism, getting shit done and at the same time, high openness to experience. You'll do well in life :-) 

I would just explore the intellect score more.Day 4, not Day 5 :-)thanks for posting this. the extent &amp; corrupting nature of lorde's influence can hardly be overstated.

days ago, i [gave some context](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7gghcm/the_wlulindsay_shepherd_controversy_was_never/dqj48c7/) to the phrase "*the master's tools will never dismantle master's house,"* &amp; u/SenseReferential [comically suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7gghcm/the_wlulindsay_shepherd_controversy_was_never/dqlprdo/) that i reign in my " reactionary hyperbole." 

i didn't care to argue against the suggestion because it seemed self-evidently born out of illiteracy with regards to lorde, &amp; his posts betray a similar pattern of cavalier ignorance (regular r/enoughpetersonspam denizen, it looks like) but it's a small example of how under the radar this deeply corrupt figure flies. 

remember this article the next time a well-meaning (?) by-stander suggests that:

&gt;[Lorde's message] seems to be for feminists to stop being hypocrites, focus on educating one another about feminism, and stop focusing on trying to educate men about feminism

better yet, **just read her**, attentively and seriously. I am completely unaware about Dr. Peterson's view on this. But I can speculate here.

Social isolation does mean that you are really not engaged in any productive activity (except maybe learning a solitary skill, like programming.) . Not having a goal, a productive activity can actually suck any drive out of you and cause a dip in conscientiousness. 

It's just speculation.Liberalism came way after the decline of monarchism. 

Royals in the UK hold a tremendous amount of power, we're a constitutional monarchy still. The Queen still requests the formation of the government and can veto Bills if she wishes and refuse royal ascent. Prince Charles also has this power. They royals also have tremendous soft power in the UK and excercise it. 

You claim they're opposite and yet countries who have retained a monarchy, the most liberal in the world. I think you're conflating 'Western Values' with a a very modern kind of liberal/libertarian political conception. A lot of people here seem to be using 'alt right' to cover a very diverse group of political ideologies. Making no distinction between a monarchist and someone who frequents Storm Front, is very lazy thinking. The Barons at Runnymede were really very liberal, were they? Whilst Liberalism undoubtedly focused a lot of ideas antithetical to monarchism. You can't say it had sole responsibility for its decline. &gt;my interpretation of it was pretty accurate. 

the odds convincing you otherwise seem slim.

i'd have to get you to agree that intersectionality is a mechanism that allows for marxist claims of power imbalance &amp; oppression to be opportunistically applied ad nauseam, to ever-fractional sub-sets of purportedly marginalized populations, and that lorde is using that mechanism as a way to assert an ethical imperative to "white feminists" to take side against "the master's house"--which, as the editorial astutely observes, turns out to be the a priori assumptions of rationalism &amp; liberalism.

i surmise you disagree with much, perhaps all of the above. 

similarly, i disagree with your interpretation &amp; find it to be "*self-evidently born out of illiteracy with regards to lorde.*" 

&gt;If you were intellectually honest you wouldn't have tried to paint my comment as an evaluation of her entire body of work. 

my original post expanded on lorde as a focal point of interest in the propagation of identity politics: "*i recommend everybody interested in identity politics to read audre lorde.*" the speech itself was linked &amp; quoted to illustrate the origins of the "master's tools" quote.

it might be fair to point out that you did explicitly state "*[you] don't agree with the article,*" and that i might be over-stating your interest or inclination to defend lorde at large, or that my purple prose betrays too much emotional investment--but then again, why bother? accusations of *less-than-intellectual honesty* are more in keeping with the r/enoughpetersonspam ethos.

&gt;I also seriously doubt that you actually finished many, or any, of her books. One of Peterson's big things in his work is that you should be honest with yourself and others. So, you pretending like you are very literate in this regard

you've reached this conclusion on the basis of two posts--enough evidence to call me a liar, intellectually dishonest &amp; self-delusional to boot. this is from somebody who volunteered that one should keep a "*cool head when making criticisms,*" an appropriate piece of advice for a minimum of one of us.

liar, intellectually dishonest, self delusional: fair enough! but perhaps you could give me some kudos for masterfully [planting posts on lorde 8 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/60k6rd/female_chauvinism_inherent_to_feminism_or_an/df77hit/), or  posting on the [origins of intersectionalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/5odzin/opinion_notch_the_narrative_that_words_hold_power/dcilp7c/) 10 months ago, or [objecting to ethnographic literary analysis 3 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/26l2nm/asianchineseamerican_literature_dominated_by/chsr15i/), and most of all, for [securing an english degree from the belly of the intersectional beast itself, berkeley, more than a decade ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/6qf13h/gulag_archipelago_story_im_only_2_chapters_in_but/dkwx0ms/), for the purpose of buttressing otherwise unfounded claims of familiarity with audre lorde when posting anonymously online. 

the long con, at long last, fulfilled.

at this point, i will follow [my own advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7dvvrn/blue_states_practice_the_family_values_red_states/dq1f9xa/) on "manag[ing] your own noise/signal ratio" &amp; make use of res. 

godspeed &amp; good will to you.Depends on what you are hoping for man. If you have anybody in your life who loves you you will be burdening them more than you can possibly imagine. 

And what if you're wrong? What if you check out and you miss out on something amazing? What if you're assumptions about the after life were mistaken? What if you screw up the attempt and they're just keeping you barely alive and feeling worse than you do now in a hospital for years and years? What if you gave up too soon?

You may not want to hear it but I've seen the church fix people who were broken beyond belief. JP doesn't quite want to go there, but it has helped people that the professionals have given up on, that's why no therapist worth their salt really discourages religious practice, even from a purely secular perspective.
If you've tried everything else, why not try belief? You're looking at the grave what have got to lose?
‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.‚Äù

http://bible.com/1/jhn.3.16.kjv
&gt;Another way of looking at it is if one thinks there is some merit in the statement (in this case 2 potential problems of national identity) does one need to state a counter point to bring balance? 

unsure if a counter-point is **needed,** but it might be **wise** to include one, especially if the stated purpose of the textbook (or course, or lecture) is to introduce a concept &amp; disseminate the basic context surrounding it in order to facilitate individuals doing further diligence in formulating an opinion of their own.

i really liked this [topology of care](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*nI2E1CGErAXDZzdlozgb1w.jpeg), in the sense of the sense of aspiring to be deliberate, accurate, fair &amp; thorough. the complexity &amp; range of perspective on certain topics invite the presentation of points/counterpoints.

https://www.google.com/amp/amp.dailycaller.com/2017/11/12/professors-its-not-okay-to-be-white/

"Dear White People", etc., Just Google it's not okay to be white and you'll find results from the left saying that it is and that it is not, I never said everyone responded that way.

I understand what you're saying, but when the knee-jerk response to it's okay to be white is to scream that it's racist, it's hard not to interpret that as racist. Kind of like how the All Lives Matter thing went down.Dude, I know. I think the NYT goes further than you think, but that's not the main point.

But if they thought it was OK to be white, these posters would not have gotten the response they have at all. Switch the word white out with any other race and nobody would be talking about any of this.But they are saying it's not OK to be white. The NYT guy is telling his kids they can't be friends with whites. Adding an addendum of 'btw jk lol", doesn't really cover it. They shout one thing then whisper the opposite. I'm focusing on the shouting, you're focusing on the whispering, as far as I can tell. The knee jerk response tells you who they are.Awesome, they why doesn't his headline say THAT? Switch the races and find and replace with Obama and is the NYT going to publish that? If not, why not?

And what exactly is my worldview champ? Who do you think you're arguing with?You don't iron casual shirts? I mean shirts, not t-shirts? That's great, man. It is no small achievement. If you have done that, you are so much better off than so many of us around here. You have  something really good going for you, and that good thing is the hardest for many people. :-) Others might have friends/social groups/decent grades, but no difficult achievements under the belt. 

In this scenario, I'd say you have climbed Mount Everest, but your problem is just as difficult as running a Marathon. 

Anyways, let me try and share some experience of mine, which might be useful. I will leave Dr. Peterson's view in it as well.

-----------------------------------

You speak about social rejection, and you are also trying to find out why you were rejected. And this, on the face of it, is a good thing to do. Except it depends how you are engaging in it. Writing it, thinking about it, concentrating on the details, is a good way to learn. The other is engaging in painful rumination.

And rejection hurts. If you follow Peterson's work, you'll know, Rejection hurts and it's physiological. I have gone through that, and I have conducted myself in ways which are inferior to what I think of myself. It felt painful that the people I loved would have to see me behave that way, clueless in social settings or something of that sort.

So, what is useful here? 


The logic is that the brain is terrified of situations that it does not understand. You can watch one of Peterson's lectures on PTSD, as how PTSD is mostly about people unable to grasp the malevolence that they have faced. And so the PTSD goes away only after they have developed a sophisticated philosophy of good and evil.

When you actually do your past authoring, you will look at all those instances, relive the painful events and then try and find out meaning from them. You will see what went along there.

Hopefully, you will understand not just that you were rejected by an amorphous society, but specific people, of a particular personality, did not appreciate you in a given situation. And you can understand those things still in the broader context of social interactions and "the ability to play games together" as another one of Peterson's lecture emphasizes on.

I would recommend that you do the past authoring twice-thrice. WHY? 

Because your brain, and specifically yours, will capture more data and abstract more philosophical/scientific perspectives once it has dealt with the primordial stuff. You can relieve yourself of the pain, try and formulate a good understanding of social behavior, flaws that people have, our fantasies, our fears, anxieties; and come back again to the past authoring to understand what happened from that perspective.

NOW, now, you have a different problem: which is becoming more and more social.

This again seems like a monumental task, but going by Peterson's logic about PTSD, it appears so only because of a lack of understanding, the lack of your psyche's familiarity with the setting. And so you can start observing things from different perspectives.

Here is a suggestion:

- You can take a personality test, either paid or a free one, and understand how those traits apply to you. Then, you can start observing how those traits and their strengths apply to people around you. You might realize that social grace does not come from vague social charm, but just being perceptive and possibly, cheerful.  You might find it difficult to engage in conversation with others, but you will see that complimenting a conscientious person on their work ethic will make them open up about their behavior. 
You would be able to perceive people exhibiting traits, and then exhibiting those traits in different situations. You can understand that, and also find your own style of a conversation.

And using your own understanding of theories with consensus and also some bit of common sense, you can progress much more in these situations.

Going back to the past authoring from here, it would do good for you to separate wounds of your school time to your understanding of how people work. You might have a vague idea of what popular people are like, social people are like; and you can update those vague ideas with more comprehensive notions about how different hierarchies, settings, time, age, place, demographics change what is valued. This would get you out of that situation where you feel rejected, and you have no way of figuring out why you were rejected, and spending your energy on enhancing your personality in a way that you don't even know works.

--------------------

I think apart from this, the only thing that is relevant for you is to drop all goals and focus on the very central issues. If you your school going well for you, then keep that protected. And concentrate on getting past authoring done.

And keep us posted. :-) 



&gt; You sound pretty self-aware but possibly not as aware about others. It's very easy for us to put ourselves into a corner rather then have somebody else do it for us. 


I wholeheartedly agree about this.
Agreed! Learning the reasons might do you well. Maybe the motivations of people who did that. And probably also an understanding of what gave them that motivation. I hope that you draw a line between understanding and being obsessive about it.

I am confident your trauma is impermanent, and that you'll do well.

Have you done Past Authoring?https://selfauthoring.com/purchase.html

Here you go! :-)thanks for posting this, i wasn't aware this was a vague transcription of the original phrase--how embarrassing for a self-professed groupie of dear mr. blair!

&gt;endorsing or advocating the situation described

not at all! orwell remains, although many decades later, warmly embraced by other political factions, a  hard-line leftie. a principled, honest &amp; self-reflecting one. his emphatic anti-imperialism reflects both classical marxist orthodoxy as well as the revolting realities of colonialism's death spiral through the interwar period. 

JP's own meditations on the road to wigan pier don't much engage with this, or with the vicious thrashings administered to a daftly consumerist bourgeoisie, either too insular &amp; apathetic or too morally inert to know or care about the untenable plight of their own country's underclass.

with regards to imperialism, one wonders if or how his views would've evolved after quarter century of western involvement post ww2 in germany, japan or south-korea. 

at any rate, orwell's opprobrium on imperialism or kipling aside, the point remains that those who stake positions against systems they benefit from with little to no acknowledgement of that benefit do not deserve a mantle of moral imperative. that's applicable to those who refuse to acknowledge **any** impact of race, sex or income on distribution of opportunity as well as those who rail against phallocentric hegemonies of whiteness at ivy league campuses.Yeah he's doing an event in the Netherlands in Jan. It was on his twitter a few weeks ago. glad you liked it! credit goes [here](https://medium.com/cum-grano-salis/how-we-act-in-the-war-of-ideas-afcbb604dbe6) &amp; to u/nmaro for [posting it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7j3d0m/how_we_act_in_the_war_of_ideas/).I have no idea, man! Seriously. It's a bad habit I picked up in college and has stayed that way ever since.

This should be taught as part of every highschool curriculum. &gt; Peterson violates established UoT standards is different from demanding termination of academic courses on the basis that they fail to meet Peterson's standards.

Universal, timeless, self-evident standards.

FTFY&gt;unavoidable example of the power and primacy of race. 

this is in diametric opposition to just about anything JP has ever discussed, and in direct alignment with intersectional claims of recursive collectivism. 
It has more detail on her site, but it basically sounds like Keto/Paleo kind of restrictive diet. So meat, leafy greens and fat. Very little, to no carbs. 

I think the idea is you severely restrict your diet for a month and then gradually add things in and see what happens. no, no we shouldn't. 

what kind of bizarre question is that, anyway? the fact that something happened somewhere else in the world tells us precisely zero about the desirability of that fact. should "we," whoever this "we" is, be taking notes on maoist struggle sessions, just because they took place somewhere else in the world?

i don't trust people that set up arbitrary "do x or else bury heads in the sand" dichotomies. here's a third option: don't be an ethno-collectivist ideological puppet.I have heard of the book a number of times. Why do you recommend it?

Any positive breakthrough or insight?The part that touched on something I've been thinking about lately is how bizarre it is, that if you were to go onto Tumblr or something, you'd see the feminist types also Retweet (Retumbl?) very masochistic sexual acts, and romanticise forms of submissive bondage.

Now, I was going for the Freudian kind of explanation, because that was what I knew. I thought,  
"Well, they want complete social freedom, free from society, and they want empowerment in all spheres of life. Clearly, the need for some kind of dependency and security in another's control is coming through, as though repressed."

But this is an idea I'm gonna have to play with. The idea that all of it stems from masochistic self hatred certainly is a simpler more unifying answer, and it doesn't require a vague "Sweep it under the rug and it turns up under the sheets" mechanic.

To be clear, the video presumes that the masochistic rioting tendencies stem from self hatred. The want for confrontation, and how they can lie in the street in front of moving vehicles, etc. That sounds really amazing. Like you have a plan. 

Tell you what, if you don't have any mental images of yourself from the experiences of your area, making friends might be very, very easy for you, much easier than it seems.

Do tell the subreddit how it goes. :-)indeed. 

individuals have a the right--and fundamental **obligation**--to self determination. this includes keeping instinctive, meat-puppet reactions in check, constructing a hierarchy of values &amp; behaviors that integrate constructively. 

e.g., this strikingly pathetic paragraph:

&gt;For every woman turned on by intellectualism, thoughts, and feelings, there are fifty who are turned on by crass, vulgar displays of wealth and physical power. **Driving a big, loud car, verbally abusing or bullying someone or punching another man in the face are the sort of behaviours that make the majority of women see a man as alpha, dominant and worth breeding with**.

maybe it's up to every individual to adjust their expectations &amp; behaviors so that they don't do fucked up, ignorant or cruel things to get fucking laid! jesus christ, it's not rocket science. we've all got sufficient brain power to figure this out.

efforts to shift autonomy from individuals to nebulously defined identities ("toxic masculinity," "toxic femininity") however well meaning, to be profoundly misguided. i jumped straight to it because it was an easy illustration of how absurd careless statements like "*black people (...) should stop committing so many goddamn crimes*" or "*white people should stop committing so many hate crimes*" both are.

do you disagree with that?

i'm not sold on the merits of legal frameworks differentiating "hate" vs. plain vanilla crime either. but i suspect this is an elliptical view on a relatively obscure topic. 
&gt;the hate crime stat irks me 

not vested in disputing your perspective--just that the number seems, all things considered, on the low end. injustice, no matter the scale, is worth excoriating, but one has to prioritize. 

&gt;the assertion that somehow the crime and poverty in black communities is all white peoples fault

this is not something i asserted or believe--i'd estimate than only the most extreme cases of self-inflicted ideological pathologies believe this. 

if i can "steelman" for a second, what's fair to note is that a broad combination of societal factors materially impact both financial status as well as incidence of criminality in specific demographics &amp; geographies. 

note that the above statement is racially agnostic &amp; bounded by location, as examples of various extremes of affluence, poverty or criminality along almost any demographic axis can be easily spotted in various places around the world or the u.s.I cringe whenever I read 'Petersonian You need to do one more thing, understand Peterson's lectures and narrate it in your own way.

Maybe you could write an essay about it and see what more could you write about this, because otherwise there is merely a recital of Peterson's words :-)

For example, you could expand on the "a desire to civilize men deep down" with questions that you would ask on your own and then the answers to themselves. For example, where does the desire lurk? Are there any popular stories where this plays out? What tendencies or quirks does this desire show up in. Think about the questions that you come up with, find their answers, articulate in your own words....

...and then you will be just as powerful. :-)Could not have put it in simpler words. :-)I think it's alright to talk to people after you have your results. If they get repetitive, we will get the mods to do an FAQ.&gt;many of the "socially constructed" things are deep multi-layered equilibria solving a complex and decentralized computational problem across time. 

excellent summary! 

the resurrection myth seems to intuitively express this idea of society as an iterative optimizing process, with holiness functioning as proxy for the ineffable complexity of distributed problem-solving over time. 

&gt;not like a story, in the sense that you can just make up any random story and that would work just as well. 

picasso is often attributed the apocryphal utterance "*learn the rules like a professional, so that you can break them as an artist*"--it's an analogous sentiment, and here are some thoughts on [camille paglia expressing the same.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/69qnug/socjus_feminist_camille_paglia_calls_for_free/dh8z64t/)

Huh, you want to change something ha? Can you clean your room? Be off weed for a week? Get a woman to respect you and admire you erotically? 

No? To all of them? Fuck off mate, the nation does not need you. You need you. And youaren't being very helpful to your  self.

Something with that subtext :D 1:29:22 for 14 KM.Yes, ofcourse. I think that's an inbuilt pattern. You let students grade each other's work, but then at the same time, maintain a standard by grading some of the work yourself; thereby giving more weight-age and reputation to someone who has put in genuine effort. 

Or to put it differently, have a user type made of professors who give your user account more points and weightage when they grade your work favorably. Uhhh no man. It'd be very interesting. As soon as an entire class realizes that certain points have not been accepted or have been penalized, that can be taken up as a separate issue and delved into further.

BUT, it'd be interesting to see how a corruption can be stopped when the entire Anglo-spheric universities have been corrupted simultaneously. Yes, if I recall correctly, the MCQs themselves would be designed and contributed by the group of students, who would then vote the content up based on their reputation.I think it CAN be accepted in the market, once it's proven that people on this system are far better than the ones in university.

In other words, if you actually have to think through your submissions everyday, and grade everybody else's submission and apply thought to it - every single day; you'll do far better in a year rather than in four years. And it will show up. It will show up in your performance.That's an interesting point. However, if you noticed "Evolution", emergence of a competence hierarchy/dominance hierarchy, it's all about young people challenging competent people to learn their place. So, it's not that the blind will lead the blind, it's just that everyone will try to challenge everyone else, and a dominance hierarchy will emerge.

In the real world, dominance hierarchies emerge based on survival and competing. In this virtual market it is possible for the hierarchy to devolve into a corrupt one, one that ensures everyone in it gets a good grade without putting in the effort. However, if the focus of the hierarchy can be maintained by completing real world tasks in some fashion, the hierarchy will evolve to become competent instead of corrupting itself in to grades.Check my comment here:

If the focus of a module can be kept on solving something of real value, some people will rise up to that challenge. When they complete the challenge, they get the credentials to judge what work others have put in. And the others themselves try and judge others.

Some people would be happy with what others have assessed about them, some people won't be. Everything would require a new thread/discussion/writing object and everything will be assessed. And so there is endless writing, till you refine and clarify all points.

This is far more effective than a schooling system where everything ends up focused on a couple of questions that can be asked on tests. And no interaction happens among peers.&gt; Educate yourself.

Limits of condescensionon one hand, it's comforting to hear those bearing witness to the corrosive effects of intersectional orthodoxies. 

on the other, these seem like lonely voices in otherwise dysfunctional humanity departments in north america. in the commercial sphere, many large organizations seem to have largely succumbed to somethinglike  pre-emptive diversity theory, hr-coordinated gambits to both market the brand as well as defend from accusations of oppression, no matter how absurd. even more broadly, in our daily lives, i dread the long-term effects of social interaction being commodified (online echo-chambers, outrage-baiting as a mechanism for monetization, whole platforms dedicated to soundbites &amp; posturing instead engagement.) 

these do not amount, to put it mildly, to a positive trend.

to compound the problem: anti-rationalism &amp; identity politics have planted deep roots into various quarters of the left **as well as the right**. trump is the obvious example, so are self-proclaimed ethno-statists. even more broadly, there's a surge in something like "white consciousness" in deeply apolitical people, a natural but profoundly unfortunate reaction to intersectional dogma accelerating both in preponderance &amp; vitriol. 

i'd like to be more sanguine about the next few years, but it seems as if we're in a reaction/counter-reaction cycle of escalations, &amp; those straddling the tide are simultaneously vilified by all parties to the identity wars. 

i've got plenty of my own self-sorting to do, and that's what's important. but when i attempt a quick survey of my surroundings, it certainly feels like chaos is howling louder &amp; louder with each passing day. Wellll, I have had several teachers in my life that have graded on a curve. As one example, one professor would read all the submitted papers and divide them into grade piles. The "best and worst" papers were obvious. How is this any different beyond decentralizing the authority?Oh yes. But I have a hypothesis here. A guess. 

I have been discussing and debating on forums about things that I find interesting since time immemorial. And there has been no particular motivation to that except just sorting out my thoughts, being provoked or consciously debating to learn something new. 

Stuff people do on forums. And that is far more strenuous than regular university stuff (except a large part of engineering work). And then again, it is the best way to learn if people find out about it.

In other words, there is a lot of internal motivation to do the work on our own. That sort of solves the market issue: people won't need that incentive to get started. And maybe this would help them in getting through the universities without feeling demotivated by the uninspiring coursework.Thanks a lot :-)I'll be a less sarcastic critic of the guy.  
I admire his plight, and he's got a pretty valid criticism of western materialism, in general and specifically regarding scientists who ironically, basing their knowledge on what they know, make presumptions about what they do not.

But he goes too strongly in the direction of spirituality to the point of detesting western civilisation. There's a reason that more spiritual cultures aren't developed technologically, there's a reason they can't feed their people like we can. The very money that "could be spent on saving the Rainforest," as he complains, wouldn't exist without the same soulless machine that is the West. Like most great fictional villains, we surrendered our soul for power.  
In his reluctance to address that we have great power, and in his reluctance to give scientists their earned applauds, he makes himself out as blinded by his fascination.

We may have made the atom bomb, but we have also made Nuclear Power. We may have made DARPANet, but we also made the Internet. The Portable Two-Way Communication Radio used on the frontline became the Mobile Cellular Telephone.  

We've lost our spirit and we've killed God. Perhaps what we've lost isn't everything that matters, though. Death is a necessary part of rebirth, if you hold desperately on to what you've lost it will anchor you.  
If we don't destroy ourselves senselessly, perhaps we'll live long enough to see our culture become great once again. If you can live long enough to become the villain, maybe you can live long enough to become the hero."self-help" guru is such a misleading term, because of the weird connotations of scaminess that it has.

Although to think about it, Guru means one who clears away the dark, shines a light on the path ahead. Self help is to become more capable of handling yourself.

That way, self help guru is a very strong descriptor of the guy.Can confirm this with my experience.

there's zero evidence of the assertion on the beliefs of "*many Peterson fans.*" Marxism is cavalierly equated with communism, which is careless historically &amp; philosophically. the term "nihilism" appears to be used to mean as proxy for "nothing ever matters," which is not the philosophical definition. 

terms like "*liberal individualism*" and "*the collective*" are not appropriately defined. no evidence of the grandiose assertion that the former "creates the false notion that individual behavior doesn't affect" the latter.

your opinion is garbage, and you should feel bad for continuing to posture in this sub without any intent to engage in good faith. 
&gt; stick to what you know to be true

If you can define knowledge, what signifies being able to 'know' something, I'll explain why I **am** expressing what I believe I **know**.

I call it homophobia because JP's objection isn't racial or otherwise prejudiced, it is, according to him, an issue of free speech. What struck me in the interview was the unspoken and unspeakable differences between these two. To be so visibly emotional illustrates to me that the topic of the interview, doc Peterson's objection to being 'forced' to adopt the Orwellian 'newspeak', can be defined for discussion purposes as an issue of free speech but he himself has stated again and again that he won't be told how to express himself. He even said he would go on hunger strike if he were prosecuted under bill B-16. To him this act of the secular establishment is an attempt to emasculate him.

His opponent who I described as his nemesis, Professor Peet, appears as much like a transgender person as can be exampled. In conventional society people like Peet **do** experience social humiliation and marginalisation and the reason is that masculinity is regarded as normal, aspired to and respected. If it isn't already common knowledge, homosexuals yearn for the companionship and affection of masculine men. Gay hyper-sexualized fantasy figures are overtly, exaggerated caricatures of male sexuality. Tom Finland is a good example of this,

https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=tom+finland&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii7eL05pbYAhXHJ-wKHV_lBfMQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=769

I suspect it is a source of pain and suffering for homosexuals that they don't possess masculinity in sufficient amounts to be anything like archetypal Men except as a grotesque parody. What is more, when they resign themselves to their inescapable femininity, they yearn for the same archetypal men that women do. Doc Peterson found it in himself to drag himself up from what I suspect he felt was a source of suffering and in this way found dignity, pride and healthy self-esteem which he regards as his masculinity, his credentials even to a claim to manhood, the qualification to regard himself as a 'Man'. Doc Peterson's MO is too help young men rediscover their purpose, to make them own their lives, take responsibility for them and be Men. I don't think his path to enlightenment allows you to engage in hedonism, especially of the homosexual variety. He refers constantly to male virtues of discipline, training, controlling your Self and this is especially painful to genuine homosexuals who simply cannot do this. It is poison in their eyes and a particularly hurtful aspect because they *know* what it is to be a Man but are biologically unable to do it.

I think this is why they are gradually becoming intolerable and why Doc Peterson is gaining such notoriety. Gay activists and social justice advocates, whether they are aware of it or not, are threatening the foundations of masculinity using the law as figurative secateurs to make eunuchs out of Men. 

alright neither of us can speak for him but he is causing anxiety to the lbgtxxx community. Are we not giving any more fucks for these people? I didn't get that memo. What bothers me, what concerns me, is his authority and credentials are being sourced as a means to justify neo-fascism by a section of that part of the political spectrum. He has stated often he is not a bigot of any flavour but his conclusions are open to exploitation by political extremists.

let me ask you a question

Do you think the person who attacked Lauren Southern did so because he was defective or prejudice against 'normal' people or do you think he sensed something from Lauren that poked at a wound (he's) been trying to protect for a large portion of his life? The incident itself lasted less than second or two but the pain it brought to the surface is probably what has been torturing for years and years and years. I think Lauren Southern is a revolting person reveling in the misery of those struggling to exist in a very superficial society.mate, you are coming across as revolting rick &amp; morty fan.[laughs hysterically]I would say i don't like most people or love them. I have high standards. I think of many ideas and don't implement them because who the hell can implement all their ideas? I wouldn't say that characterization is accurate or in the ball park of my personality type. I also don't love ideas, I think ideas should be challenged and battle tested.The question entirely depends on your personal values, I suppose.  
I believe we will suffer for it, and the world will become a far darker place.

At the same time, I don't think that logically and scientifically minded visions of the world are too unnatural process, though, if we can adjust to it so easily. The science is just far too divorced from its spiritual counterpart.

Furthermore, Evil is something that would exist regardless. What I'd like to focus on is that your use of Hubris ridiculously accurate. It's actually a Greek word that means "to be Presumptuous to the Gods," "To show arrogance to God."  
Hubris may have come about as a part of evolution, informed by these religious beliefs. My experience with people seems to show that Hubris is something that comes out from one's personality, and it seems to be an outcome of misplacing yourself in relation to the divine. I believe it develops a blindness of ones' limitations.  
Admittedly outside of the etymology that's a mere anecdotal supposition.

As the chinese say, it is the most confident swimmer who most often drowns.I also think I might be good at that but have had 0 previous interest.I'm 2nd percentile agreeableness and 0th percentile conscientiousness.

Basically, it's hard to make me care? I have 0 respect for authority or people in positions of power. I think there's a political element in terms of ladder climbing that is associated with lackey type individuals. 

I respect entrepreneurs and self made people, or artists that aren't fake.

I've been fired at or left on bad terms with probably 90% of all the jobs I've had. I'm not a good employee and am currently working on my freelancing business as a web technology consultant. 

I don't respond well to commands or and sort of posturing against me. I will respond immediately and shut it down. I was the bully, never the one bullied. 

I just don't give a fuck, I do what i want when I want how I want. I don't take advice and I live on my terms.Yeah it does feel like they want to eradicate unselfconscious masculinity for reasons you can only speculate about. I can't help but think there is something underlying the whole movement to create 'a level playing field'. It feels like they want to compel people to adhere to *their* standards and practices and don't even entertain the thought of compromising to accommodate the traditional paradigm. I guess they feel they've been understanding for long enough of so called 'normal' peoples anxiety about unconventional people and now it's time for the conservative establishment to be understanding of their's.

I have a problem with the constant referencing of Marx as a source for all this. I know a little about it and the Frankfurt school yada yada yada but it did sound like a conspiracy theory. Western development and social progress has been a linear process. The idea that Marxist origined social theory has somehow been insinuated into Western society to undermine and destabilise is ludicrous. This trend in society and universities isn't incongruous, it is totally in line with the trajectory of the development of these institutions.

The decline of Patriarchy in the West is concomitant with the rise of Matriarchy and the growth of Women's influence where it was traditionally Men who held these positions.Does Peterson criticize feminism for it's role in undermining masculinity? I've heard him criticize Andrea Dworkin, even suggesting she may have had serious unresolved psychological issues but Feminism is exclusively a Western phenomenon, especially 2nd and 3rd wave which famously grew out of liberal intellectual think-tanks in New York during the 60's and 70's. Is Feminism an aspect of cultural Marxism?

Why the fuck does the West always shift the blame for whatever ails it instead of looking at itself for the source of it's fucking issues? Why even bother with pretence on a fair trial. I feel like I have to defend the puppies, pet therapy can be really helpful. I've seen it work wonders for clients I work on the Autistic spectrum especially. 

But I can't help think, these all seem like cheap replacements for the religious practices that were once common in our lives. Communal meals, physical spiritual acts and group activities aren't novel ideas. I think America isn't self-sustaining. It has no integrity given it is utterly contrived as a country, as a political entity, as a Nation and most significantly, as an Identity. Nothing about it is bound in material reality as previous cultures have existed; for example origined on explicit ethnic lines. Jordan Peterson talks about Europe being in trouble with it's discreet identities threatened, presumably by Islam, but American identity, and Canadian identity for that matter, is incredibly fragile because it is an utter contrivance. Western axioms are dissolving constantly and they don't seem to be stopping, if anything they are accelerating. Even Matt Damon has been embroiled in the Hollywood sex scandal for goodness sake! What next!?

Did you know that Academics refer to America as 'the American experiment'?Doc Peterson says he hopes AI would act ethically but I think he means morally.I use the term as it stands in common parlance, not as it's determined by international law. I'm talking about a widespread enmity between races and specifically between those who claim a 'White' identity and people who are excluded from this identity.

Why do you want to change? Why can't you stand up for yourself?very misandrist film that demonizes masculinity and exalts femininity. Haven't watched it in a while but I recall thinking that the male characters in the film where either stupid or tyrannical. It had strong psychological elements and illustrated them quite well but I think the controlling emotion in the mother was Sadness. Interestingly she looked like a strong womyn. I just remembered thinking all the negative emotions were represented by males.

It's like if Lebron went to the G League, it's not a competition. He's playing 8d Go, they're playing checkers.i like the thoughtfulness of this post. 

speculation: some of the downvotes are probably reacting to a perceived sense of transgression against something like "enshrined cultural reference point," or, perhaps more dubiously, "identity-specific cultural artifact." 

these attitudes are, ironically, adjunct to that most imbecile of concepts, cultural appropriation. 

&gt; I would choose the actor who had the best overall ability to deliver the lines, swing the sword, wear the costume, and ride the horse. 

ultimately, that's what matters. the essence of "the mythical character of Achilles" is embodied by these attributes, not skin color.
Personally, I wish I had read '7 Habits' a decade ago. It's kinda the foundation of most modern self-development and teaches principles such as having clear goals, thinking win win, and prioritizing gaining clear understanding. It's a bit drawn out, but pretty good all around.

'The Rational Male' is primarily about 'inter-sexual dynamics' and argues that women have a dual mating strategy, seeking out both the best genes for their offspring and the best material provisioning - which might now come from the same man. Generally, it's a bit pessimistic and political for my taste (and it's horribly written), but it's interesting and contains some useful insights.

'Sex at Dawn' takes a starkly different approach to most evolutionary psychology, beginning with the premise that the few hundred thousand years of hunter-gather existence is as influential as the 10,000 years of subsistence farming which followed. 

'The Power of Habit' is a close look at what habits are, how they're formed, how they're changed, and how they're often engineered or manipulated. I think the main takeaways are part of common understanding among self-development circles by now, but it's an interesting read nonetheless.

'The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari' offers some practical advice on more mindful and simple living, presenting practices like visualization and meditation in an easy to understand and follow manner. 

'How to write better copy' is the first book I've read on writing, and it's helped make my writing a bit clearer.

'The Richest Man in Babylon' is a goldmine of simple advice for better managing money.

*I'm always interested in recommendations if you have any*well stated!

&gt;There is no place at Marvel Comics for writers and editors who harass critics, manufacture outrage, and dismantle the legacies of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in order to gain street cred with pink-haired SJW freakshows

eerily reminiscent, in tone as well as substance, of ostracizing screeds authored by militant intersectionalists. leading with a bit of condescension ("*adorable naivete*") tends to be less than constructive. 

let's leave that alone &amp; circle back to my original post. no claims were made regarding the prevalence or incidence of intersectional orthodoxies in the entertainment industry, so i'm confused as to why you chose that angle to respond. i simply put forth an (ostensibly logical) argument that as far as i'm concerned *the essence of "the mythical character of Achilles" is embodied by these attributes, not skin color.* do you care to argue against that? if so, why, and how is your argument different from claims of cultural appropriation? 

but ok, let's grant the observation above. presumably, the state of affairs you described isn't desirable, &amp; there should be less identity theory packaged with various pieces of entertainment. 

to achieve this, is your suggested solution to bend one's thinking along the lines of intersectional assumptions, insisting that characters are more defined **by their skin color, rather what they do &amp; how they act?** that seems counter-intuitive. perhaps it'd be more productive to take note of the end result in each specific project &amp; then either praise or criticize it on its merits--in this case, the prospect of a poorly crafted Achilles.

would you object if this series ended up being a well acted, beautifully filmed piece of drama that did well to convey the complexity of characters &amp; conflicts in this re-telling of iliad? conversely, would you be less or more satisfied with a horrifically amateurish version that featured a strapping blonde lad as the protagonist? 

consider that adopting such perspectives does more to validate intersectional theories than combat them.

the off-putting (*offensive* has turned into mush; i strive to avoid it) thing about idris elba or scarlett johansson in **the dark tower** &amp; **ghost in the shell** respectively was that both movies were poorly written, poorly conceptualized &amp; whatever effort was put into engaging with the original content was minimal. &gt; I honestly just think that's what JBP is. **Someone on the left who is willing to speak about reality.** 

accurate. 

Morality IS Objective. Ethics are Subjective.

Example: Morally it always wrong to kill. Ethically, killing 'can' be appropriate.&gt;Morality could be objective, or subjective.

There has to be Objective principles otherwise we couldn't claim to be Human Beings. Peterson gives the example of the king who would annually need to prostrate himself before the priests and people and show how he had fulfilled his duties for that year. Even the King was subject to the myths that formed the basis of their culture. That's why Religion is still our only means of inculcating an Absolute Truth to our societies. Religion is the assertion of Objective values which even the absolute Ruler has to acquiesce to. The fact the Universal Values need to be *forced* on people demands we infer there is no such thing as Universal Values (as defined for the purposes of American foreign policy). Personally I happen to believe that there *must* be such thing as Universal Values but our current understanding and grasp of reality means they aren't able to be defined. Also I would reject out of hand that Moral Relativism is a legitemate field of inquiry. Where Morality becomes relative is the field of Ethics, not the same thing at all.It's not possible to judge anothers motives. For example, Barack Obama cited Universal Values as a legitemate justification for American foreign policy in the Middle East, the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the deliberate undermining of regimes across that region. I don't think he did so harbouring a doubt about Universal Values, I think he truly believed them to be coherent and reliable. But I think he was wrong. I think the West is pursuing an agenda not based on a moral code but on it's desire for other more profane things; Oil and the need for Israel to cement it's place in the Region. It's no accident that all of the regimes that have been removed are existential threats to Israel and I think this is why you are able to find inconsistencies in the motives for what's happening. For some reason they can't openly say that Israel is at War with it's neighbours and America needs to control Oil because the dollar would be worthless otherwise.

He who controls the Spice controls the Universe!I don't know though. I think it's arguable that we have an inherent sense of right and wrong. Barring those who possess a thoroughly distorted perception or sense of how to interact with others, we can *feel* when we are doing something 'bad', so to speak. I think this is the basis for the legal defence of '√≠nsanity', or in the delightfully convenient world of American jurisprudence, 'temporary insanity'.

What you seem to be arguing is a case of having your cake and eating it, which isn't a rebuke to petulance, but an axiom that states you can't hold two mutually exclusive positions in anything, including abstract concepts, and hold that their Truth is relative.

*but you can if you're insane.I don't think it's hard to *begin* to define Universal Values. I think it's reasonable to assert that a Value we all hold to be Universal is the right to Live. This seems like a no brainer and yet, current Universal Values are sourced as a justification for War and widespread indiscriminate killing.

We need to abstract to be able to reason but where an abstraction is demonstrably wicked we must be compelled to accept it is 'wrong'.I didn't get it from any philosopher. Unless 'Universal Values' means something other than values that apply in all circumstances, you don't *need* an appeal to authority.&gt; Why is it bullshit to accept you are wrong?

When it comes to War no one is 'The Goody'. This is only determined after the event by who remains to say what history is or was. It's like the saying goes, War doesn't determine who is Right, merely who remains. There is widespread opinion that the British fire bombing of Dresden in the 39-45 War was a War crime but the Allies won that conflict so it's acts of War by the Axis that are considered War crimes. Morally, Might isn't Right. But Ethically it is the only way we are, as a species, able to settle irresolvable disagreements. What's interesting to note is that the kind of disagreements that qualify as this are always about material wealth, resources or territory. God and Religious views are only ever cited as an ultimate justification, that is until the Enlightenment when classical European philosophy began to shape the policies of Political entities. It's *extremely* interesting to note that since then the technology to wage war has reached a point where we could claim to be able destroy all life.

There isn't an international arbiter of Law, a sort of World Police, or indeed an international forum where it can even be discussed. The UN is meant to be the forum but it is a fig leaf for the foreign policy requirements of the West and specifically America.&gt;What is moral here?

What's moral is to do the right thing but this can be impossible. We aren't all Christ or Buddha or Mohammed. Even all these guys would take a different tack to the problem you describe but to be frank it sounds like you haven't grasped that morality isn't subject to anything. It doesn't depend on how you *feel* about someone.

I dunno bud. I've thought about whether or not this board is a kind of surrogate Father resource for boys seeking paternal advice. Peterson certainly seems to be trying to provide that (for a price). But I understand that there is a popular term regarding problem relationships as toxic friends and I guess it boils down to whether a relationship is bad for you and your development. In the end though it's you that will have to shoulder the responsibility for **acting** to change the relationship. You will need to find a justification in what you deem unreasonable and you actions will need to be as appropriate as you're able to measure.

That will completely depend on you. You know, this is what Peterson is talking about in taking control of your life and taking responsibility for it. You won't be able to blame some guy on Reddit for what you decide to do.&gt;Why are you looking for a fixed definition here?

How can we make informed decisions or even think critically without axioms? A basis for an argument, as with the foundations of a building, need to be resolute. It's only from this point one can begin to build an argument. There should be and are many provisos to the concept of Freedom but they are seldom used when Freedom itself is being cited in Politics. Examples might be freedom of movement, freedom of worship, freedom to own property so it seems that 'Freedom' should only really be regarded as an addendum to a state of being, and not a sacred justification in and of itself. It could be put a lot better but what I'm trying to say is that *the word* 'Freedom' is vague without reference to a situation and it shouldn't be used otherwise.

As a basis for organising society, freedom needs explicit qualification and without checking it I think it is qualified in the American constitution as the freedom to own property. This doesn't seem very substantial to me and given the period in which it was written, property also applies to other men. But I guess they weren't regarded as men under the definition in the Declaration of Independence where it states that all 'men' are created equal.

&gt;curtailing freedom

Have you ever been bullied? Do you wonder why they do it? It's because witnessing their victims suffering accentuates their own sense of agency or 'freedom' to act. When I bully get's his ass handed to him it's the Bully who then experiences a curtailing of their freedom and the person who's dealt the blow becomes Free *in relation to that situation*. However it is completely derived from the Bully's suffering and coercion to moderate their behaviour in the future. The Bully will have lost a degree of his freedom in the establishment of his victim's freedom. So an exchange has taken place and it is curious to wonder whether there is something limiting to the means of experiencing this freedom. Is it possible there is only so much Freedom available to us?

&gt;get out of jail

George W Bush said he believed that Freedom was the future of all humanity. You can see it here at the beginning of Adam Curtis', the Trap.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y97Ywl7RtUw

I still don't get this. What did he mean? It seems to me that the kind of Freedom that is being promoted as defined by America **IS** adversarial. What is there to illustrate that it's not? I'm sure there will be those who disagree but it really seems to me that in exercising it's Freedom, it is **taking** Freedom from others, even their freedom to live.I answered in the threadIt sounds like you're talking about the development of a cultural code of conduct, specific to a cultural setting and social group. There will be elements of morality to it but it isn't the situation that will develop the morality, rather it will be morality that defines best action.

Do you see?

It sounds like you are sticking to the idea that Morality is subjectively determined over time with cultural or ethical sensitivities influencing *that which is Moral*. What I am saying is that Morality is an Absolute value from which we develop ethical attitudes. A code of ethics is the nearest I can ascribe to the phrase, 'an emergent morality', because Morality doesn't emerge, it **is**. Put it this way, the nearest I can quickly ascribe a philosophical position is to say that Morality is Platonic. It exists in and of itself, not dependent or contingent. In this way I would argue that Morality is an aspect of God, definitely not an expression of man.  If you're really interested in this you should take a Uni course in Philosophy and maybe specialise later on. I'm not an expert but I am aware of some distinctions such as the difference between morality and ethics. Morals are absolutes such as it is morally wrong to kill. Ethics are the field which determines what is the right way to act in the circumstances, so, it **is** morally wrong to kill, but it can be permissible in certain circumstances. This is the distinction; Morality says what you must do in every circumstance but Ethics is about *what is permissible*.

The question is *who* is qualified to determine what is permissible.

I'm not sure what Peterson's position is on this but he seems to be saying we ought to look to religion to determine ethics which I agree with because I believe in God and am sceptical about the motives of Secularists whose morals seem to originate from classical European Philosophers and which have lead us to the absurd social dichotomies Peterson is campaigning against.&gt; What happens though when you remove the boundaries and I know longer know what I can do where?

This is why Law is sacred and necessary but it is very culturally specific which is why Law is changed as societies evolve.

and yes, Freedom as a concept doesn't seem to have coherence which is my point.We are in a trap. Peterson operates within a strictly structured code of Ethics that is the Academy. His motives for advocating against Bill C-16 aren't clear enough for me to totally agree with his actions. He does seem to have a personal resentment toward Prof AW Peet which I sense is homophobic. They do seem to be extremely antagonistic and I have a strong feeling that Doc Peterson may feel that Social Justice Advocates are trying to emasculate him using the Law as secateurs. I admire his position on the ethical soundness of following the lessons of scripture to order one's life but then I do have issues with Christianity. Peterson's basis for right action seems to be the alleviation of 'suffering' which he has stated frequently but I think a truer course of action is derived not from suffering as the existential dilemma but mortality.

We are all going to die regardless of how much you manage to eradicate suffering from your life.

Our actions in this life ought to maintain a relationship to the fact we have a legacy, not just a responsibility to make ourselves happy. I had another example of what I thought was selfish interpretation and from another devout Christian who told me, "It's okay to believe Christianity, even if you think it's false". This is exactly what Peterson is advocating and it is rational and it would achieve what he says it will but it seems weak. He has said in recent conversations that Israel means, 'to struggle' with God. I would like to know what he thinks about Islam and the meaning of the word because Islam means, 'to surrender' to the will of God.

Are you saying that he has said animals are capable of Morality? That would explain why seem to think it's an effect rather than a cause. I'd be surprised if he says this. I've seen him talking about chimps and how tyrannical pack leaders get stomped but his position stems from a belief in the validity of myths that stretch back into the mists of time. These myths have reproduced over millennia but all contain a uniform lesson of establishing order from chaos which he is arguing the Bible is our contemporary rendering of.

&gt;Morality is a species trying to survive, not an impersonal set of universal principles somehow discovered by contemplation.

I actually think you have really managed to grasp the fundamental truth of what Peterson is arguing for. However, somehow you've managed to get it completely arse about face. We **have** managed through a process of contemplation and the unfolding of history as the roadmap of our experience, come to a concept of Morality as an absolute in the religious symbol that is God. 'God', is the symbol and Jesus was the personification. I'd argue that Peterson, if he rejects this, has an inverted perception of Christianity.Is that you Doc!? That would be so cool and a wish fulfilled. If it's not, you write how Peterson talks.

Yes it isn't directly connected but his rejection of Bill C-16 **is** an expression of his personal philosophy which I sense is founded in what he regards as a 'rational' faith in what his trade regards as irrational superstition. I really do admire him for what he's done and I was very relieved to read a tweet in which he claims proudly to have persuaded young men from nationalism. He is exactly what's needed in these extraordinary times but I still feel he is steering clear of sacred cows in the Secular system most especially an unequivocal critique of feminism which he seems to have appealed to women to address. Perhaps he is right but in my experience, well adjusted women respond very appreciatively to assertive masculinity so long as they sense it is paternal and not tyrannical. In fact, women are incredibly sensitive to masculine perversity and can contribute immensely to a mans healthy state of mind. Men are not infallible as is true of women and we are intractably bound to one another not just to procreate but also to function as a person.

regarding what appears to be our disagreement. I agree that Morality *appears* to be emergent because we *arrive* at an understanding of it in the way you ascribe. However, my position is this; Morality is an abstract concept and has always existed before to our apprehension of it. I have a clip I'm very fond of to illustrate this and I think it fits neatly into Prof Peterson's postulation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4oxrTSRkC0&amp;t=2s

;_;

I hope you haven't blocked meyeah I made a mistake.

Morality determines what is 'wrong' so in circumstances where you repeated me in saying what we 'must' do, I should've said it tells us what, in the best of all possible circumstances, we *ought* to do.

However

This could necessitate us doing something equivalent to what Jesus did and only God is capable of that. No, we are thinking beings and capable of reason but we are only aspects of God. Jesus, I would argue was a personification of God whereas *we* are only aspects of God.

The social dichotomies I'm talking about is the current controversy that has brought Prof Peterson into the public conscience. Western values creating laws that are incongruous with Western Virtues.

Edit: *Western Virtues/Values(?)tautological? phew

"...you can believe in belief, without being able to believe yourself"

aka, hubrisI love this clip for how it illustrates that these virtues are what qualifies Homo Sapien to claim the mantle of Human Being. To be Human is to be the point where the material realm yearns to join the 'perfect' conceptual realm. It requires constant effort, sacrifice and discipline. To be able to claim or think of yourself as a 'Man', demands you walk this path and doing so makes women admire and respect us. Further it encourages them to be faithful and to emulate their own model of virtue.

I don't agree that they are 'lies'. I think this is lip service to current attitudes toward religion and the myths of Religious Traditions. But even using that term the point stands that we manifest Virtues, this seems to be something like, or a part of our purpose. I see this realm, this dimension, as the sum of all possibilities which includes action as the activity of living, and right action as our justification. Wrong action is an expression of losing connection with reality or seeking to control it instead of work with it.

Who invented it? I'd argue it comes from an awareness that our reality is contrived, it's not actually what we are, merely what we like to think we are. However, this process of shaping ourselves and our societies is bound to a cycle. Our cycle seems to be closing on itself but it is still very real to many and still a matter of life and death to some. Reinvention, or more likely rediscovery, comes about when someone within the cycle realises that the consensus reality isn't true reality, but a model of how we can thrive in a hostile world as individuals and society. Ironically it is often regarded as madness when a person tries to express this perception because to people still operating within the cycle, it is Reality, and to suggest it isn't means that person must be insane.

I think the stories in the Bible and Genesis in particular may offer a hint as to the discovery of abstract Virtues. It talks about Adam and Eve in creation as the original Man and Woman but later on their sons have wives who themselves have families so what it could mean is that there were many [people] but Adam and Eve were the first people to become aware of abstract concepts which is what God would be as the source, thus the object of veneration.

&gt;It means to develop an ego (make yourself competent) and then to surrender that ego to the universe, and work for it.

I haven't seen this before, where's it from? My understanding is that supplication to God needs to be an act of authentic humility, rejection of vanity and the obliteration of the Ego. I believe that our purpose as determined by God and not the artificial social construct is to be our *Self*, not a caricature of our Self. This is what the phrase, I am That I am, alludes to. God is entirely Self, with no distraction, deceit, delusion or desire, God simply **IS** and as such, is the source for everything. In the West, Islam looks like it could be the source for people returning to God. Doc Peterson's actions are laudable but when we're talking about Life &amp; Death, I doubt a hipster sort of religion is going to cut it. You must release your Ego to have an authentic relationship with God, it's ludicrous to suggest that Islamists are larping or otherwise acting out. interesting. thanks for posting. deliberate writing.

&gt;‚Äúracism‚Äù and ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù and all the others are exactly what everyone loudly insists they are not ‚Äì weapons ‚Äì and weapons all the more powerful for the fact that you are not allowed to describe them as such or try to defend against them.

if one departs from an axiomatic assumption that the world is best perceived, conceptualized &amp; engaged with as a series of power games between various identities, then the logical conclusion is that one must play the power game using the most effective tools available. 

long before 1984's chilling "war is peace" moment, dear eric blair put forth brilliantly [a thesis on the decay of language invariably leading to political corruption](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit), as well as suggestions for remedy. no coincidence that the rot began in the softest of humanities, especially literary studies, and spread from thereon: **power games with words.**

&gt;Sometimes when I think I made a good argument I copy it over into my own notebook which I hope to develop into some consistent book at some time that contains my philosophy. **I'm doing this not with the aim to publish anything, just to get better with my thoughts.**

you're living out JP's core message of owning the quality of your own thoughts--may even soul.

&gt;As for unsubscribing or slogging through -- I don't know where this sub specifically is much different than reddit in general. **I read 10000 comments to find a pearl**. It's the pearls that challenge and change my thinking and sometimes life. I**f I don't read 10000 comments, I won't find any pearls**. 

this comment is a pearl. godspeed!The entire Western Political Arena is a fucking krank house. The West is drowning in debt it accrued to win the Cold War and now it wants a Hot War to erase that debt.&gt;Back to the right, what is sick in ethno-nationalist thinking

- lack of regard for the autonomy &amp; self-determination of individuals
- lack of precision/care in arguments
- appeals to emotion rather than rationale (circumstantial 'evidence,' opportunistic appropriation of inflammatory incidents, e.g. the murder of kathryn steinle, word games around "race realism," where "realism" obdurately ignores inconvenient historical or cultural factors)

the list goes on, but these apply uniformly. 

i found your following phrase to be insightful but would suggest a slight re-formulation:

&gt;only the individual is divine and while the individual may rely on certain supports (rights and values) of the state

how about something like: *the primary ethical justification for the state is to enable &amp; facilitate the welfare of the individual*. 

&gt;Do hyperbolic trolls and crypto accelorationists deserve a different handling than straight forward ethno-nationlists or can they all be lumped together?

i'm a big fan of precision &amp; individuation, so i'd answer **yes**, although "*different handling*" doesn't necessarily entail more or less opprobrium/disapproval. the devil is, as JP constantly reminds us, in the details.

i'm more wary of a "civil discourse ethno-statist" who's active in local elections &amp; engages in concrete actions that advance such an agenda than an overtly racist person who spends copious time spraying abuse on social media but otherwise doesn't actually **do** anything. I know- I tend to wrestle with the whole idea that the voice of the crowd across time is somehow equivalent to the voice of God the Father- well then what exactly would someone like James Damore then have to think about the voice of the crowd at Google?  You've still got to listen to what's within you.  It's tricky, man.The concept of Race still hasn't been resolved. How do you feel or what do you think about the claim that everyone in America is deracinated and yet Race is a critical component of American Identity, perhaps the core?

Or would you disingenuously claim the core of  American Identity is something less superficial?you're being evasive&gt; I am white as well but that is pretty much irrelevant to my identity.

Do you live in America?which one?Okay so, as a European a very different issue faces you but I'd like to know your position on the Identity that is "White". My position is that it has **no** basis in reality. It is a legacy of European colonialism and is destined for the trashcan of history. It's just a matter of time.&gt;  are you a jew?

hah! I'll take that as a compliment.I think the issue isn't simply one of racial predispositions. I agree there are different races. What I'm drawing attention to is the fact that there is no such thing as a "White" race. There are many Europeans who claim to be "White", but what exactly does that mean?

Define what it is to Whiteokay you seem to have a simple understanding of what it is to be white and I suspect it's because you come from a relatively homogeneous place. What I think you don't fully appreciate is the importance this issue will have in the future. When Socialism lost the ideological struggle that was the Cold War, American values became the de-facto framework for future society.

This being the case, it is American concepts of Race that will apply which is why I specified American concepts and how they affect society there. I am very confident that Europeans have not yet fully understood this.&gt;What meme are you referring to?

I am referring to the socially constructed Identity that is "White". It is more than merely a phenotype, or appearance. White identity infers things other than merely coming from the European continent.It's heartening to read this but I am old and I suspect you may be as yet unaware of the depth that a White identity penetrates American culture and values.

People are getting very very angry about this and it is a growing contemporary controversy.I think Ethnicity is the more real Identity than race. America seems to me to be an attempt by Europeans to establish a conceptual identity as real and those who associate with it, eg. Blacks, have not only been deracinated, they've been depersonalised because they were enslaved.I'm cautious about answering the question because I am puzzled about what point it has. what's an ethnostate, I mean what do you think is an ethnostate?

What's your nationality?r/escalover has r.u.n.n.o.f.t.White Identity is hazardous to everyone, not just Jews but most especially Jews. You're in for a very sobering reality check if you think you can be an existential threat to the Jews again after what they've been through.wow, neo-nazis are so fucking dumb.&gt; BBS

what's this^^? Are you threatening me?That is an amazing summary, actuallyfuck yeah, R.A.H.

decades later:

&gt;[If we all reacted the same way, we'd be predictable, and there's always more than one way to view a situation. What's true for the group is also true for the individual. It's simple: Overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It's slow death](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/quotes). 

i continue to be saddened by the cheap simulacra we got condescended to instead of a live action ghost in the shell that embodied the complexity, beauty &amp; ethos of the original. such shame.in praise of u/TiredUnicorn for posting this--very useful to toy with.

[results](https://i.imgur.com/d5vA8hx.jpg). 

the conceptual framework is fascinating. it could use much more differentiation to improve predictability/validity. 

strictly as an example, it'd be difficult to derive from my own results that i score off the charts "down and to the right," as in, extremely permissive in social &amp; financial policy. similarly, u/ElectraCute's high scores probably don't translate to strict/traditional policy views--chime in here if i got this wrong, please.i stand corrected.

would be helpful if others who took this chimed in in terms of predictive validity.To paraphrase JBP: I'm not saying you're incorrect.  I'm saying it's too much cure for the disease.


(I believe he put this in a tweet addressing MGTOW)


Or, put differently: you're cutting your nose off to spite your face.


Put differently yet: you are choosing the ego over [wholeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_5:48)/[teleios](http://biblehub.com/greek/5046.htm).JPB [tweeted this out](https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/946138431511437312) along with: 


&gt;The Oedipal maternal never defined better: "an invitation to infirmity"


Now here's my issue:


And what about those of us who are 99th %ile in trait Neuroticism / Negative Emotionality (per the Big Five)?  To what standard should we hold ourselves?


I've pushed myself- *hard*- toward things I believed were part of destiny.  I embraced the attendant suffering along the path.  Eventually, my unconscious crept up on me and I found myself at the brink of self-destruction.  I had to retreat.


I doubt this advice should be applied universally.  Those of us who can easily push ourselves right in to self destruction may need to respect those parts of us which will emerge and destroy us if we do not honor them.


Also: was Patton right to slap that guy?  If not, then where does one draw the line?


Is the whole "Highly Sensitive Person" thing a beckoning Oedipal mother?  Or is it a compassionate urging to embrace your nature and *take care of yourself* for goodness' sake?whoa there pardner.  again: just saying: too much cure for the disease.  not denying the problem.


regarding risk: did St. George stay safely within the walls of the city?  Did Hercules say "nah, I'd really rather not go to the underworld"?  I'm not saying one should be blithely naive about the risks.  they should know them thoroughly.  it's the courageous ones who engage life, knowing the risk.


I'd venture to guess that all of your ancestors placed a high emphasis on marriage and parenthood as components of a complete life.  they faced myriad risks.  used to be that 1/3 of infants didn't make it.  and women died *routinely* in childbirth.  It takes big brass ones to deal with that.  that's a risk we pretty much don't have to deal with, but Matthew certainly did.  I mean, why bother marrying and having children if most of them won't survive anyways?


JS Bach had like half his kids and his first wife die on him 300 years ago.  But I guess he just wouldn't understand how hard we have it nowadays.Every time I squat heavy, I think of Peterson saying 'shoulder the largest burden you can carry'.Ugh im so sick of internet kids who give such little value and then stick a patreon link in their bio or post or whatever. The entitlement is realThese kids need to learn that asking for hand outs is a bad strategy and looked down upon.Thanks a bunch people, the veil obscuring my future has lifted a bit ;) So much great advice to incorporate. You see I respect JP a lot but he tends to talk in a very matter of fact way which often bothers me 'if you don't have all these things by the time you're 40 then you've failed' or something along those lines, if you disagree then you're wrong not him lol.

On my bday I was lost at night in a strange city with no one around to talk to in a language I couldn't express myself in ... it was a day of lonely introspection, but I felt no dispair. I've come to realize that I'm a strong and resilient person, considering that most of my cousins are still deeply troubled and conflicted people. It's a pattern on my fathers side of the family and they're still trapped in the mindset that what family thinks of them is way more important than what they think of themselves. I'd say I've faired well all things considered.

I'd like your view on a more practical issue I'm battling with right now, my current job. It's 2nd line techsupport and I don't have the required tech knowledge yet to properly do my job, I can learn it but my coworkers have their doubts because it's a complex infrastructure, they wonder why I even got the job !. My manager (who's not a techie) says I have to suck in all the info then I'll be good but she has no idea of what we actually do, no wonder she hired me lol. It's also a long commute to the office while there are enough similar jobs in my city. Should I quit ? There are also some layoffs coming next year and temps like me will be the first ones out, why waste mine and their time ?. Your offering is worthless. Step it up kid.

I checked out your insta though, your drawings are pretty good, keep it up.thought provoking comments. appreciate reading the other side of the popular argument. 

many moons ago, when the original "white genocide" tweet was made, i similarly thought that the reaction was disproportionate.

that's not commend the man. his scholarship is execrable, his ethics questionable at best. the two books he has penned on venezuela ride a fine line between absurdity &amp; mendacity--witness the apoplexy-inducing "[building the commune](https://www.versobooks.com/books/2337-building-the-commune)," an paean to "direct democracy" under chavez &amp; maduro. 

that somebody with such a tenuous grasp on reality was *tenured* certainly throws a light on how "*academics (...) from the left and the right are treated.*" one wonders how many admirers of e.g. pinochet teach at berkeley &amp; drexel. 

&gt;"[A]fter nearly a year of harassment by right-wing, white supremacist media outlets and internet mobs, **after death threats and threats of violence** directed against me and my family, my situation has become unsustainable," he wrote on Twitter."

these can be pursued under existing criminal code, but no appeals to law enforcement agencies have been made. am i wrong about this? is there additional reporting on the subject?

it's clear that he has been under duress due to efforts to either hold him accountable for reprehensible views--OR, as u/DanWebster puts it, made an example of by "*neoliberal technocrats and conservative monied interests.*" but i have major doubts about the veracity of these claims of material harm making "his situation unsustainable."

what are we talking about here, abuse on twitter &amp; shit-posts on tumblr? is this similar to the "transphobic violence" that is described as rampant on various canadian campuses? i'm having trouble reconciling this deliberate, potentially insightful post with the inane claims you've made on r/EnoughPetersonSpam, e.g.: 

&gt;"JBP's problem isn't that part, since mythic narratives are one way humans find meaning in their lives, **it's that he uses his audience's desire for meaning to put down and hurt women, gay people, black people, and trans people**"

what are you playing at?thank you for taking the time to reason your arguments through.  I must say it is difficult to argue with them on a logical basis.  They remain cynical, however.  


Certainly one should be cautious.  I'm only saying: leave the door open and never say never.  I once almost got a vasectomy but there was that 1% of me that wondered if my opinion and orientation might change years down the road, as I am a radically different person than I was 10 years ago.&gt; The path towards individuation isn't about pushing yourself insanely outward and working towards filling the social role.

fair enough. thank you for pointing out that i'm factually wrong with civility &amp; grace, and allowing me to learn. you can hopefully continue to do so, for me &amp; others here.Yes I've started reading up on Jungian psych and Joseph Campbell a few weeks ago, but I have to get into the habit of reading books from cover to cover again, too much clicking and browsing has fried my attention span.

I'm looking for a oecomenical church though, I'd prefer to stay away from evangelicals unless they're not fundamentalist, I'll sample some local communities and see which fit my needs. Thanks ;)

I can go out to a strange club on my own, dance on an empty dancefloor with the most attractive women there and make new 'friends' by the end of the evening, without alcohol or drugs.... how's that for getting out of my comfort zone ?;).

But yes I'm still an anxious person and much in my head but meditation and excercise make it managable, although with new situations ... You might have an argument that he's at least sympathetic to white nationalism or white nationalists (He has talked with Jared Taylor). But Molyneux is clearly not a white supremacist. 

I think it's becoming increasingly clear to many on the right, that Civic Nationalism and denying or at least ignoring racial differences is going to be very detrimental to whites and the Western World. It can't be ignored that rapid demographic changes are fundamentally changing the Western World and that the only people told to shun a racial consciousness are whites.

[i came to realize](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/6l389u/peter_thiel_what_is_multiculturalism_really_about/djs9gy3/) this has played a part in the rise of intersectionality &amp; ethno-statism a while ago, but the extent has not been apparent until more recent developments. the [recent interview with chamath p.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMotykw0SIk&amp;ytbChannel=null) is eye-opening.

some of this plays out on reddit as well--plenty pockets of pustulant pathologies, including the shambling that goes on @ r/enoughpetersonspam, for example--but to a lesser extent. hard to figure out how much of "**[THING]** just MIGHT be **[PROBLEMATIC]**" content is symptomatic of a secular trend in legacy media undergoing what Sarah Hoyt described as "[rolling hard left before dying](https://accordingtohoyt.com/2016/11/19/rolling-in-the-deep/)."

long time ago, my plans included a humanities doctoral program after breezing through an english ba @ berkeley.

i plans changed when i realized how ignominious those 5 years would have to be--some of my interactions with TAs played out like bad imitations of beckett plays. 

i'm sure stellar professors &amp; similarly wonderful students, maybe even healthy departments exist. but i didn't need JP, Haidt or Paglia to inform me of the rot taking over the humanities. Not a humble brag, but I have this. I work very closely with vulnerable people so it's something you kind of cultivate. You have to learn how to mask your emotions, but still remain open emotionally available. Our faces give away much more then we realise and people can pick up on the slightest thing. Then in my line of work, use it to justify provocatiion.  Most people will tell you everything, if you really listen to them though. 

It can be a pain ,as people will unburden themselves on you and tell you things which you'd rather not hear. I have to be very mindful to set up strong boundaries, otherwise people can just overwhelm me. &gt;to vividly envision one's "bottom" and viscerally feel the emotions you would have--or have had--when put in such a place. This is not just as a spatial place but as a temporal location--a **bottom** is not only sensorially repulsive and emotionally degrading, but it is a situation that will take years to reverse the consequences of.

there lies the shadow. well written, friend, &amp; godspeed on yourself continued self-sorting.6% isn't "a lot." read the study. 

i'll [get in line right behind you](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7n7ovv/jonathan_haidt_social_media_is_causing_a_social/ds047b0/) in decrying the latest social media platforms, but i'd caution against cavalier exaggerations.good to know.  I've been trying hard not to get hysterical about fearing this kind of thing.  the local school is heavily populated by freshly minted teachers from a radical university program.the definition above, religion qua surrogacy for genuine problem-solving for suffering in the world (**anesthetic** instead of **remedy**, to expand on the metaphor) ignores the numinous, aesthetic and distributed problem solving aspects of religion.

from frazier to jung, campbell &amp; now JP, mythologists, for lack of the better term, argue that religion &amp; myth fulfill key needs of a social being by articulating psychological insights or practical concepts (e.g., resentment tends to lead to self-immolation, sacrifice is a way of bartering with time for better outcomes, etc.) they're at least partly right.

i find your assessment of marx' quip to be, then, tremendously charitable. as he often did, there's a something like a gesture toward insight, followed by confused fumbling around. 

an observation, not an indictment--this doesn't rank very high on my list of dumb "marxisms." just offering a counter-point to a well-articulated defense.  Rather than asking "How is this acceptable," I'd be far more interested in learning "how is this possible?"  
Is he researching using Google, and Google's simply that far gone now?5 pints and I might.This rings pretty true for me. I grew up in a protestant family and have a pretty strong faith. It is has been a difficult walk because I am not a big fan of  modern evangelism. It has also been difficult because as a whole we seem to ignore a lot of fundamental principles. In fact the more "fundamental" you get the further away you get from the key points:

1) Love God first

2) Love everyone else. 

3) Before you get on anyone else about anything, make sure you have points 1 &amp; 2 squared away first. 

Even then, if you want to speak correction into someone else's life get permission first. If you dont, you are not living up to point 2.

Edit: Fixing formatting on mobile is slow.In-universe, they're called Stands and described as "Manifestations of One's Spirit." It's a really stupid and cheesy idea, but it's a series that lives in its own cheese. It's not an especially deep story either, but it's got some solid theming as the series becomes more protracted.

So, one kid likes to draw comics, and he can see into the future with what he draws. But because he uses it for evil Wacky Races type plots, his power usually bites him in the ass.  

One guy, a gambler, has a stand that takes people's souls. But *only* under the condition that they feel the utter defeat of losing a bet. Naturally, he's a cheating bastard, and will only ever raise the bet when he gets the opportunity.  

One rowdy teenage rebel has an almost tribal looking beastly Stand that is raw power but also very primal perceptive abilities.  

As a final example, there's a Vampire whose stand power is to stop time, appropriate when the guy *chose* to become a vampire to break from his human limitations, time being one of the most fundamental. Also I forgot to mention it in my post for the second experiment, don't go to bed immediatly after drinnking coffee, because the caffeine haven't even started to ruin in your metabolism

Wait for at least 2 hours, then see !Well, for the lemon juice experiment I agree that placebo effect could play a role but I don't know much about it

And for the coffee the experiment might be flawed if one took the habit to drink coffee for a long time and develop resistance to it so again factors must be tooken account of 

I don't exceed one coffee per week, since now 2 month, so I didn't develop a resistance that might influence the experience when  drinking some I guess 

Caffeine pill might is probably not digest in the same way or/and don't spill in the metabolism in the same way so you shouldn't worry about it :)It's like I put on those sunglasses from They Live.

I don't think this image is real anyway, I'd need some evidence. Looks a bit too framed.The lemon one as Aurelius said is tricky, and EVERYONE salivate when drinking juice lemon. How much is supposed to be the answer but because it's lemon lot of people will salivate just to think about it, so I agree saying that this one may be flawed 

If you really want to try on yourself you will have to sleep much early yup, if you currently work on daytime this shouldn't be a huge problem to fixWhat about the coffee one then ? This one is proved to be worthy if one not already have a good tolerance over coffeeThis is the most interesting idea for a comedy I've seen fall totally fucking flat in a *long* time. let's do it - pm or start threads?Methodical self-introspection, looking back honestly in yourself from the event that occured in the past that matters to you up until now, and describe and sort out each of your value and how they mature over time. Not easy to do, but it's still quite possibleMail the cash ? Is that even possible lmao ? Someone with a credit card.. I give him money and he buy the assessment right in front of me.. No I don't know anyone who could do that for me lmao, only acquaitances have credit card and I wouldn't bother them since we're not even friendI think you have never done anything you're scared of. Is that right? This mentality is that of a scared person who has never been outside their comfort zone. Have you ever voluntarily stepped outside your comfort zone?also: lack of fulfillment is bullshit.  I suppose if you remain a narcissist, then you are unfulfilled.  the ego cannot survive parenthood- you either expand to the anima and other archetypes, or remain a selfish dickhead.


and boredom is also optional.  get your face out of your fucking phone and do some goddamn parenting.  play make-believe with them.  read to them.  teach them how to read and write- yes, you *can* do this before kindergarten.


this is the most exhausting, frustrating, and difficult thing you will ever do.  And it is the aspect of life upon which, for better or worse, you will have the greatest impact.  take some goddamn responsibility.


(didn't read article, just soapboxing)You're being downvoted but your sentiment is on the money. This guy was crucified for writing down facts about sex differences that anyone could find in an intro psychology text or on Wikipedia. And now he's taking on Google. None of this should have ever happened.Wait. Are these people white supremacists? Because they seem to have a very whimsical notion of white people as all-powerful üòÇYou queue early to get to the front?&gt;So your saying: XYZ
&gt;
&gt;No, what I am saying is 123

Rinse and repeat for 30min is not an awesome back and forth. Being rude and talking over the person you are supposed to be interviewing is not a legitimate interviewing style.  Don't encourage that kind of behavior.Then she should not talk over him or try to dominate the conversation.Happy Cake day. 

You can be disagreeable and follow basic conversational etiquette. If you are interviewing someone the intent is to draw them out not push them down. I have never been a fan of domineering interviewers. It is an inter*view*, not an *interrogation*. Don't be so harsh on the interviewer. She's got her biases and she showed them, but they were somewhat constructive. Strawmanning gave him opportunities to clarify his perspective, I'm sure some leftie watching the interview (given Channel 4's pedigree) would've had the same strawman arguments, had they not come up. 

She didn't shut down the conversation, she threw incorrect accusations out, and whether or not it was intentional it helped refine his positions, as the conversation presented them.JBP did very well but in my mind a good back and forth implies both sides of the conversation are positively contributing. This was pretty one sided. I would like to thank you and u/theneoroot for this thread. It was quite refreshing to see a well articulated conversation on reddit. This is one of the few times where I feel smarter after spending time on reddit. I will have to lurk here more often.Thank you for the cultural context. Part of me thinks that is unfortunate. You should be able to be extremely adversarial and still observe basic manners (Ben Shapiro in most cases). On an intellectual level it reminded me of the last two rounds of the Mayweather v McGregor fight which wasn't pretty....pregnant and barefoot.

No, I am saying...I have a hard time believing she did any independent prep for this interview let alone read past the first chapter. Towards the end, JBP dug a pit trap and she fell right into it.&gt;... let alone read past the first chapter.

I do not believe she read any part of the book... Except maybe the title and someone else's notes on each chapter.Yeah its like when I think of a bell curve what you said immediately pops up in my head. The distances between the two ends of the respective curves are always far greater than the differences in the peaks of the different curves. 

One thing I realized even though I don't mean it in any disparaging way is that many of the humanities people are bad at statistics and math and that makes it really frustrating to talk about statistics based things because to me (someone who is studying engineering) things like this dont even need a second thought.I will put things out simply for you.

As you can see the purple lines and the green lines are much larger than the redline. Which goes to show that the difference within groups is far greater than the difference between the means of the two groups. You do not need scientific research to validate this claim, its basic 8th grade math.What does he think of the book the subtle art of not giving afuck by mark manson?It was a great talk but I was expecting something new because these are the same things he went over with Dave RubinIt is. Just ask Markus Meechan. Trial going on for about 2 years now. All over a nazi pug practical joke.&gt; No obligations to hang out and talk otherwise, we're pretty introverted. I just ask that you have yourself sufficiently sorted.

lol. That would be mad awkward just taking the ticket and walking away. Some times the fans don't really represent who they follow. 

I for example like Sam Harris a lot. Despite him dismissing religion I think he has many good things to say and has a lot of overlap in ideas with Peterson. But I cannot hanlde r/samharris they are partisan, annoying, snarky and elitist. All the things that Sam Harris is the opposite of. 

ITs also like how some of Peterson's fans are alt righters despite him being extremely against identity politics of any form.

Yeah should have known. 

I got the audio book now though so time to experience the real deal.Am I the only one who thinks this was said in bad faith? 

Like she purposely wanted to make his claims come off as ridiculous and absurd. I got great respect for the man keeping his cool when faced with such blatant disrespect. Yes if someone purposefully twists ones words to this extent it can be considered disrespectful. "Right to not get offended" 

1) No such thing exists. 

2) Even if it did Peterson schooled her on why it would be stupid.Thanks :P 

Many of the public figures get a bad rep because of a shitty fanbase.Well yeah, but I doubt he sees their comments. They are not that bad in any way but still don't represent Sam in any way, because its very hard to be someone like sam and not come off as an arrogant bastard

Not to mention the fact that many of the people in that sub are just angst filled atheists and not people who actually watch/read sam for his philosophyOnly someone as dense and entitled as her could have said all the things she said. I agree that its soo dense that it might as well be someone else saying these things on purpose with an agenda.This was just an example on how to analyze a bellcurve.I think we can all agree that the interviewer was for lack of a better word retarded. 

Its Peterson's composure and expert handling of the situation that needs to be talked about.Yes Peterson says that dominance hierarchies are a fundamental feature most animals including humans. 

I'm listening to the audio version of his book "12 rules of Life", chapter one of which talks about such dominance hierarchies in depth. 

From what I got out of it; Dominance hierarchies may not be the ideal way to structure society but we can't structure society in a way which is radically different to our biologies. It was tried in the 20th century and it failed. 

Also it is worth nothing that a free society structures itself, the dominance hierarchy is a bi-product of the pareto distribution, something that is a fundamental nature of reality. So personally don't think there is any other way. 

The things we evolutionarily acquire may sometimes not be optimal for example women tend to be attracted to wealthy men and not men who are the best potential partners, this is not optimal but its how evolution shaped us. Trying to change these things can have drastic consequences.I would also like to note that if Chomsky knew what the Pareto distribution was he wouldn't be saying the things he said. Read up on the pareto distribution and the whole dominance heirarchy thing will make much more sense to you, the pareto distribution is not a feature of biology, its a feature mathematical feature of complex systems Indeed, the quality of discourse has been going down since political correctness became a thing and has gone down even more dramatically in the last few years to the point where we have come to this. A woman with the logical capabilities of a 5 year old is considered a "journalist". 

I personally think only a massively corrupt system can let something like this happen.

Is she competent? = No

Then how did she become a frekkin journalist with such a huge reach, its either she is acting like this on purpose which shows the system is extremely corrupt or that she didnt get there through competence which also shows that the system is corrupt.I would agree with you there. Its worth keeping in mind that the characters end up in their pictures not because of the archetypes but because of their obsession with the lore. just my 0.02$I used the word retarded because she straw manned Jordan so hard that one would either have to have;

1) No concept of logic/rationality 

2)Do it on purpose

3) Language deficiencies 

4) be ignorant to the very core

To be able to pull off what she did."It's a figment of your imagination, sweetie"I definitely share his feelings but whats equally as sad is that the radicals are going to use this as leverage to pass of their crazy "ha! look at this old guy crying about men not having enough power already" narrative.I watched the interview twice and I can tell you that in some places she was strawmanning him on purpose. Trying to makeit look as if his positions are crazy and absurd. Especially that "so you think we should model our society like of that of lobsters?" statement she made. OBviously there is no way I can prove this but theres no other explanation. This level of strawmanning is indefensible &gt; 2)Do it on purposeStill struggling with it. I went from very very low to low now. 
have my downvote! Well yeah. I don't know where you live but when you call someone "retarded" it doesn't necessarily mean that person is actually retarded. Its a common derogatory term... Like I said i find her behavior so reprehensible and disrespectful that I called her retarded. 

Its like how calling someone an asshole doesn't mean you actually think that person is a literal anus.Look up matthew principle.True. I wouldn't have it any other way but I'm just pointing out that the same thing can be interpretted in radically different ways and some of those interpretations make me lose faith in humanity.It rebuts your point in the sense on how the outcomes are different for the rich and the poor.

Also I don't buy the SJW feminist victim rhetoric, so intersectionality is not a real thing to me anyways.Is the person who posted this being serious or making fun of the sjws because at this point I can't tell. 
I got 28 lol i guess its above averageIf an interviewer is going to be a devil's advocate, then they should at least extend their talking points and research beyond haggered propaganda from Tumbler. Thats why it is referred to as evolution by natural selection üëåHitchens was a great mind. It's sad that he's not around anymore. We need someone like him to keep the crazy ideologues at bay.üëèüíähe left us to soon We can all do something ... we also need to stop hiding behind some great man or woman and be individuals against the group mentality and ideology Generally speaking üëåWell yeah, but there's no doubt that people like Hitchens and jbp have the impact an average Joe just won't haveYou have a knack for being oblivious to the world around youThis is one of the best-written articles about the doc so far. Obviously written by a fan.I'm fine with "going for the jugular". I'm not fine with lazy retorts. If you're going to be a devil's advocate, at least get some talking points that aren't found exclusively on Tumblr.I think you've had enough internet drama for the day üòÇ

Go outside of somethingHey now, Damore might have a reputation for being less than stellar at articulating his thoughts verbally, but [he's not a pushover](https://youtu.be/iOsIz5aQY-M) and has proved he can hold his own against ideologues.Exactly. i thought the book was gonna be some bro shit but it was surprisingly deep, well written and well thought out. The conclusions he came to is quite nuanced in the philosophy of it even tho he has no formal education in any of those aspects, quite remarkable imo Seems like Jordan Peterson's faith in God helped him in his journey. 

Could an atheist who hates religion keep it up like a religious person could? Probably but I feel like it would be harder.

I don't believe in a religious god but I believe in and appreciate the idea of god...Does a literal God exist? I guess it's possible...I guess I'm agnostic.It's below #10 in CanadaPraise KEKThey seem to have changed their algorithm and made it much less ideological. I'm excited for them, they're about to go down a rabbit hole and have their lives transformed for the better. How do you know this is true? What are the chances she was literally being what she was being?Well I for one assume people mean what they say and theres no act going on. Even though it is extremely likely it is how things works on TV. 

I pointed out the fact in another post that she must be acting, no way anyone can be that dumb. But I think her reasons for acting were in bad faith I feel like she wanted JBP to come off as a crazy lunatic especially when she asks the "so you think we should structure our society like that of lobsterS" question.Except abortion isn't a human right in Canada.

According to this article: 

&gt;Hajdu explained: "Our ministry believes in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and these are fundamental expectations of Canadians, and we stand up for those rights ‚Äî and we [will] ensure that the money that we disperse on behalf of Canadians is not used in a way that violates those hard-won rights."
But here's the thing: there are no rights being violated here.

&gt;No right to abortion
Hajdu's nod to "hard-won rights" is a reference to the Supreme Court's landmark 1988 Morgentaler decision. But that decision didn't recognize a constitutional right to abortion under the Charter. While it did nullify Canada's existing abortion law, the Court left it to Parliament to come up with new legislation that would balance the rights of women with the state's interest in the protection of the fetus, within the bounds of the charter.

&gt;Indeed, commenting at the time of the decision, law professor Daphne Gilbert wrote, "The Morgentaler decision didn't say a woman has a constitutional right to abortion, it didn't go that far."

&gt;Canada is the only Western nation without any law regulating abortion.Dude have you read the book? Its really good and the stuff is quite similar to what peterson talks about. The author talks about adopting responsibility, embracing suffering and adopting good values. 

DONT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER.I think so too. 2018 started off great for him

1) His BBC talk.

2) Him reking Cathy Strawman in channel 4, going to get himself a lot of new fans from that 1 interview itself as people get to see that he is not this alt right boogeyman but rather a rational articulate and stoic individual. 

3) His book, being soo high up in amazon.
This is a well rehearsed play. She already tried to accuse Dr Petersons followers of harassment in the interview. 
Likely there has been some vitriol towards her, but it was a minority of tweets. More like don't judge a book by how the publishing committee pushes to title it lolIf he didn't have "Fuck You" money before, he'll have it now üòÇ

My guess is you don't know what "Alt-Right" means.I think your opinion is in the minority,considering how popular it is. I for one liked the books simple and straight to the point writing and more importantly it had a good message.

Thw writing is not "academic" or rigorous in any ways but the man didn't give fuck according to his own words.We can grandstand all we want about who is or isn't a fan or true fan until the cows come home. Call me a skeptic, though, but I haven't seen any harassment beyond a few memes a harsh words (calling her "a stupid SJW"). If that's the level of harassment needed to call in security, then this is a non-issue in my estimation. Of course, Peterson can't say that because it's politically incorrect lol

Wake me when people are tracking down where she lives, threatening her family or start posting propaganda around her neighbourhood.Because he has the intellectual high ground and now he's securing the moral high ground. Or this is the internet, a place where people say mean things to people who say stupid things. Tell me when people are going around her neighborhood posting propaganda or threatening her family.You just used the words "assault" and "harassment" interchangeably without a modicum of hesitation. Think about that for a second. I am of the opinion that if you're claiming to be harassed, and if others are pinning that on Peterson by proxy, then providing an example is better than not. Peterson even mentioned this briefly during the interview itself. This would not be the first time someone proclaimed harassment to change the conversation away from how stupid they acted.
so is the cassette version really a cassette? I would love an audio book but I don't have a cassette player, who the heck is making cassettes in 2018? Also is there a way to get like a value pack? if I want kindle, hardcover and cassette (or mp3/cd)That reddit without mods is a great idea. It's crazy how mods have so much influence over reddit yet most of them are over the top immature and close minded. I see sub reddits as countries and mods as their leaders, I feel like mods should be elected not just put there at random.

As someone who uses other forums like 4chan and bodybuilding.com/misc its well known that reddit is a liberal echochambre that is controlled by nazi mods. 

I absolutely cannot stand mainstream subs putting the over the top moderation(censorship) and liberal echo-chamber aside, something about the way people on mainstream subs act is weird. People make one word replies that get 500 upvotes and you can predict how every comment is gonna be, it feels all too formulated.This is mainstream reddit in a nutshell. HE says his videos are backed up on vimeo. By the standards used by the majority of society to judge people in real life. 

I have been banned by many sub and most of the time I try to talk to the mods about the ban but they swear at me and insult me if I manage to argue and prove them wrong.No I don't mean it in a mob mentality kind of way. 

For example protesting in a library is considered annoying and "immature" if you will, by most people in society. But for SJW's its fine because thats what they do. 

I'm saying by the average standards many of the reddit mods are immature and close minded because they were put there using sjw standards.Well yeah, Knowing JBP has editors and what not, I'm almost certain there are physical copies of his content, offline.I think being proud of and recognizing the good is something most people, including you fail to differenciate. 

You can appreciate and be grateful to your culture without being proud of it. taking pride in things you didn't create or contribute to seems to devalue the work of the individuals who actually accomplished it in my eyes. It also gives you a false sense of accomplishment.No its definitely being compared to the standards one would expect from others in real life. I realized the conversations online tend to be really weird if you pretend as if people were actually saying those things in real life. Yeah,that is something that should be done. I personally don't have the free time, internet download speed or storage space to pull this off.  Also it's JP's responsibility to make sure that he has backups. We can do things like this because we can do good things but I am not soo keen on taking on the responsibility myself due to logistical issues.This is proof for everyone that the leftish media did try to make peterson come oof as badpost edited check nowNope. You don't need to be on any side to call out strawman arguments.He clearly said that those who are abusing her (even though we have not seen any convincing evidence that she indeed is being abused) should stop.  He clearly said that those who are abusing her (even though we have not seen any convincing evidence that she indeed is being abused) should stop.  

Also there is literally no proof of her being abused. Being called stupid is not abuse. I think he knows what he is teaching better than you. 

Also are we going to ignore all the bad things they are doing? Its about time Peterson calls them out, I feel like you have no idea the number of articles the leftist media is churning out blaming Peterson's "mysogynistic and abusive" fans, without any evidence whatsoever. Why should we be painted in that light? without ANY FKIN EVICDENCE.So they can paint his following as abusive and mysogynistic and straight up lie about them when clearly she created the situation. Also they have no evidence for these claims.Stop straw manning what I said. And refute my actual argument.

 Are you talking about?

&gt;  "He clearly said that those who are abusing her (even though we have not seen any convincing evidence that she indeed is being abused) should stop."

If so, I absolutely have evidence. Go look at his twitter.Now I know you are trolling. These people have no concept of reality. Don't they realize that their fathers are "old white men" or the males there will one day be "old white males". 

I know they use the word "old white males" to refer to the people who are in top of the corporate ladder and have much power and wealth (they also happen to be old and white). But this kind of dishonesty sickens me. They also use the term 'alt right' to refer to anyone against PC SJW culture..I meant what I said. 

They are painting Peterson's fans as misogynistic abusers without showing any evidence at all. 

I am saying why should Peterson or anyone not stand up to this? &gt; Apparently 505 people used the term bitch; compared with the other 40k comments it‚Äôs something like 1.1%.

&gt; Additionally, there is a difference between ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre a bitch‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to hurt you, you bitch‚Äù

&gt; So I suspect the actual ‚Äúthreat‚Äù amount is much lower, however any threats should be treated as such.

&gt; Finally, they are being called ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù of JP, when they could have been new viewers of the video and JP and just happen to have those thoughts.

Exactly. This is dishonest to the very core. And show's that Cathy is not only a liar but is actively trying to make JBP look bad.

&gt; A real,interview may have needed more time, allowing each party to delve deeper into each other points ending on a mural conclusion.

&gt; The point of the interview is to have opposing ideas, it doesn‚Äôt make for much of an interview with both sides agree.

&gt; From what I have seen, large assumptions are being made from twitter and YT comments.

All this contradicts the second part of what you said. She wouldn't have pulled out the victim card if she argued in good faith.
Yes my man, but that doesn't devalue what I said. They have no right to call JP's fans misogynistic and abusive without putting forward any evidence. Also are you failing to see that this is an attempt to make JP look bad because he absolutely made them look bad at that interview. I already have a balanced view, I've been following the whole thing since the video came out. 

My conclusion is that JBP made a mockery of Cathy and her bullshit, so now she is trying to get back at JP by making it seem like he has a cult following of misogynists who are threatening her. Which is not true. Calling her a stupid bitch is anything but misogynistic abuse, it's true. She doesn't have the mental competence/wit to grill the lobster she thinks JBP wants to base society around.Yeah I know he is a troll. One of his replies to my argument was "clean your room" no one says that unironically around here xDI don't remember seeing any of those kinds of posts made seriously. This sub does get brigaded by trolls a lot, so if you see anything just let the mods know instead of attracting more trolls.Thanks for building on what I said, and for criticising and distinguishing a few points.

On the subject of individual's sovereignty over consciousness, there's places where you're simplifying the principals to an extent where they conflict with human morality, or the spiritual morality that they are using for example.

So, if you can do something if it's of no harm to another, perhaps it's arguable that you should be allowed to commit suicide, or sell your organs for profit. After all, that's full freedom.  
And I've known people who argue for that. It's a reasonable argument, because it ensures that nobody gets to tell you what you do with your body. *What right should they have to tell you not to do something like that?*

But even in the vague spirituality he cites, there's a disagreement with that Liberal principal in a bubble. In many religions, including Christianity, there's the deification of the individual, and their body. Not to ingest poisons, not to ingest certain substances. One's body is a temple, as they say. Even the use of such a drug as the one mentioned in the video is used within the confines of ritual, not to be used at the individual's whim.

Are we western Urbanians less free than an Inuit tribe, over our consciousness? The *ritual* use of mind altering chemicals could be compared to other contentious things such as ritual circumcision, not that I hold a particular opinion on either.  
And I emphasise that point. *I'm not providing an outright opinion on the use of mind altering substances (or circumcision),* I'm just showing there's harsh flaws in his argument that reach a conclusion by cherrypicking and contextualising ideas. He experienced them in non-traditional context, and those non-traditional contexts are uniquely performed by scholars, not genuine practitioners. From Human Moralities, religions tended to form. At least I believe anyway, there's many things in common among the major religions regarding some self control, especially with what comes to ingestion of particular animals. Famously Muslims disavow intoxication. The Catholic Church says recreational drug use is sin, the bible simply says to take care of your body and your mind in many poetic ways. Jews believe their bodies belong to god, and it's an offense to damage them, not that it discourages them from drinking.  

The reason I can correlate the body with consciousness, is because of how one must ingest intoxicants. There's great lengths made to detail those things, more specifically food, less specifically intoxicants. Because they believe that the things that you put into your body greatly effect who you become.  
For example, Muslims and Blood Transfusion. Jews and many varieties of animals, tragically Bacon. 

So I hope that clears up why I can so easily attempt to conflate the two.

Now let's look at the idea of Dogmatic Traps. Because Dogma is nothing more than code and conduct. Dogma in itself isn't necessarily unjustified. Assuming you've chosen the correct word to bring your point across. Dogma is only as irrational as a modernist or postmodernist perspective warrents it, so the word's become a blind criticism. It's a bit of a knitpick, but I don't believe dogma is necessarily negative. Monks are dogmatic, but they're not doing much bad. They can't be irrationally disregarded. 

To give some more opiniony opinions:
I think perhaps the punishment is too much given the lack of rehabilitation in the prison system. But it's a representative price that's an attempt to approximate the damage you're doing to yourself and your community. Fines would also be too much, however extended community service work wouldn't go amiss given that it's cheap and helps rehabilitate those lost to the worst of drugs. Though I'm no expert.

As for experimenting with drugs? I have. It was among the worst experiences of my life, among the the most intense sorrows, and I'd never do it again, but it was worth it.  
It was mostly bad because I couldn't stop myself from thinking most of the awful things I typically repress between past traumas and general cynicism. The US would be great. But anything smaller or larger in scope is fine as long as it gives me a better idea of what the trends or policies have been. Sweden, Norway, Iceland in the top 5. 3 of the most *progressive* left wing countries in the world.Question 1: I was in a pathetic enough state that being caught would have been a kind of justice in itself at the time. Of course I wouldn't want to be caught, but I would have deserved it.  
Speaking realistically where I live, they don't incarcerate users, especially when they aren't public nuisances; By the point I'd returned to functionality I was simply miserable.  
To make sure I don't dodge the question, assuming the unlikely scenario that they saw fit to incarcerate me, perhaps it would've been a bit much for something even I consider a mistake.

Question 2: I have been put to (involuntary) voluntary work before, I won't state the context, perhaps it's only an effective measure to someone like be but it proved to myself that I'm more capable of being a positive force than a neutral or negative one in the area around me.  
The reason I suggested it was for that reason; it plays on people with some latent conscientiousness to pursue activities.  
Assuming I was a rarity, perhaps with some decent instructors could punch toward that same favour. Or my own experience was a fluke.

Question 3: I don't think it's right. But I think it's the better of two bad options. The stigma surrounding them is justified because they're things that alter how your mind works. Thinking positively of that is something of a naivete in my eyes.  
These things are easily subject to abuse, they can ruin a person. It's like having a uniquely positive view on relationships and sex, when they're some of the nastiest and painful things one can go through, no matter how meaningful. You have to have the stomach for it, and the self control to understand.

Implied [OPTIONAL TO READ] Question 4 (Why do people think they can tell others not to have a certain experience):  
I don't know. I've had a bit to drink, which is why I don't feel confident addressing the rest of your post, but I'm using this to let me think out loud momentarily. I believe it's a matter of trusting someone with the responsibility.  
The ultimate liberal value imagines that every man is an island, that's the AnCap perspective, like I said I have some sympathy for it as much as I mostly disagree.  
Freedom for individuals somewhat depends on other individuals around them to adhere to their core rights in a society, which individuals are wont to disregard under certain influences. Alcoholic beverages bar people from driving, as an example. They diminish their rights as they intoxicate. Alcohol doesn't have as grand a transformational effect as these drugs going on into the future, so there's the thought that you're changing who you are fundamentally and on a grand scale society would become unpredictable.

To stretch that thought a bit too far, you might imagine that a lot of societal changes in the west to lean left and the musical leanings have been because of an increase in the use of more social drugs, or a prolonged use. I personally believe that it could have generally effected human evolution.  
Caffine products have been with us for centuries and was said to kickstart the Renaissance, which has some implications. My belief is that it resulted in those people who partook readily becoming more functional in the meritocratic frameworks. Those people with innate taste for caffine more likely bred and strengthened the trend in the genepool. The want for caffine, as benign as it is, became woven in somewhere -- this a belief I hold with no evidence but a bit of loose logic.  
One result of this also became the west's industrialisation. I see no reason hallucinogens wouldn't have the opposite effect, which may not necessarily be a positive one.

So it's not really a decent answer to an extremist liberal. The idea that society is knit, rather than islands in a shared sea of culture. I believe the sea is the people.  
I'm going to shut up before my intoxication makes my thoughts any less focused. I hope *most* of that was useful.

I'm listening to the audible version, this is just like a really long lecture for meThat the two are even in the same conversation is telling enough lolI don't know is this true but I remember reading some study about how assuming a dominant posture increase testosterone by 20% and reduces cortisol. Which kinda similar to what peterson say's that assuming a dominant changes the brains chemistry giving off the impression that you are "dominant".

Even if we ignore the psychological benefits, standing up straight with good posture makes you look taller, your belly look flatter and shoulders wider so its a good thing anyways, if one wants to look and feel a little bit better.Joe Rogan podcast episodes are like a 6 hour briefing of most of his philosophy Where can you get the physical copy in dxb?

http://archive.is/VvV5eAs a mod of /r/tucker_carlson I think fans of Tucker overlap pretty well with fan of Peterson. Both men seem to value free speech and rigorous, open, logical debate. Tucker is much more emotionally willing to jump into the muck and fight it out tit for tat when people fling mud than Peterson. /u/MrDoug98, link?In what way were the questions loaded?You have it confused. In the US liberalism was first redefined as progressive, by the progressives. This was back during the Progressive Era. After the group alienated the country and no one would vote for a self-identified Progressives. (This was mostly due to the proponents pushing eugenics and Prohibition.) The Progressives, desperate for power and relevancy, re-branded themselves erroneously as Liberals. Then they ruined that term by funneling their socialist thought through that brand name. 

It's why "liberal" means such different things to people in the US vs Europe. Fox's main agenda seems to be to make money by giving right-wing people, who make up a significant market share, media biased to their POV to counterbalance the overwhelmingly leftist bias inherent in every other network.

Why Can't People Hear What Jordan Peterson Is Saying?
A British broadcaster doggedly tried to put words into the academic‚Äôs mouth.



http://archive.is/eW3XbRecognizing this and reaching out are great first steps. Shrug off the feedback in the other sub, not a single person over there is even thinking of you now - they don‚Äôt count. This doesn‚Äôt sound like a self-help issue to me. I‚Äôd recommend getting some professional help. &gt;uncharitable reaction

Why is it uncharitable to call a spade a spade? I doubt David Brooks has ever spent much time in places or situations which would lead him to understand that for that vast majority of people the world is an overly brutalistic universe. Sure art, love, passion etc can exist in even the most dire circumstances, but who wants to be lectured about the quality of life from David Brooks? A "cultural commentator" who probably has little experience on which to drawn from to comment on the culture of the vast number of people in this country. 

&gt;Brooks was born in Toronto, Ontario‚Äîhis father was working on his PhD in Canada at the time‚Äîand spent his early years in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in Lower Manhattan. His father taught English literature at New York University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia University. Brooks is Jewish but he rarely attends synagogue.[4][5][6][7] As a young child, Brooks attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in Greenwich Village. When he was 12, his family moved to the Philadelphia Main Line, the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from Radnor High School in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in history.[1] His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey.[7]It's banality to Brooks because he was raised by a PhD in English and a PhD in British History while living in NYC before academic thought was completely infiltrated by SJW mentality. He has likely been exposed to thinking about life, culture, responsibility and myths like Peterson espouses his entire life. He also went to private religious schools and was likely well steeped in Western thought and culture there as well. It is banal to him. It's always amusing to observe and remember which articles and opinion pieces the NYT opens for comment. Maybe time for a new councilor. On top of everything else you‚Äôre dealing with a very fresh dose of grief. That is a tough place. I don‚Äôt have the health issues and loosing my dad laid me low for 6 months.

https://tammybruce.com/practical. thanksthanks for the insight 
u dont know that&gt; But it doesn‚Äôt counterbalance it. It deepens the chasm between different sects of the American public and makes democratic conversation impossible because we can‚Äôt even get our ideas of reality to converge even a little

I don't understand how you can demonize the one network who takes the right-wing bias and accuse it of creating a chasm between people by it's very existence. It's no more biased towards the right than PBS, NPR, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, NYT, ESPN, Washington Post, LA Times etc is towards the left-wing. 

It's hard not to read your criticism and conclude you're mostly upset that there is a place for right-wing biased media at all. The chasm was not invented by FOX News, they merely exploited the chasm that exists and found a market niche to serve people who are ignored by the large majority of media outlets. A second point is that having ideological media is inevitable and it's better to have some that serve the right-wing to outset all those who serve the left-wing. 

FOX News *is* a counterbalance to the overwhelming left-wing bias in media. Yet, NPR lives and breathes through the funding of the public. Their bias is much more offensive to me than MSNBC, because at least MSNBC isn't so coy about their bias and it profits through a relatively free market system. They give their funders what they want. NPR meanwhile takes in huge amounts of taxpayer dollars yet spews out leftist propaganda while trying to simultaneously claim the moral mantel of objectivity. That is much more offensive to me, it's the same with PBS in general these days. PBS in the old days was much more ideologically broad, look up the McLaughlin Group, Milton Friedman's Free to Choose series, William F Buckley's Firing Line etc.  (All available on Youtube if you're interested, because they were worth preserving.)

What media source, networks, publication (online or print) and journalist do you think are the most fair?

Since I asked the question, it's fair for me to answer. I would say Sharyl Attkisson is probably the most prominent example of a down the line, heart and guts reporter. Heather Mac Donald at City Journal is another, but no where near as prominent.If you are interested, Media Research https://www.mrc.org/ and News Busters https://www.newsbusters.org/ are good places to start your research. This is exciting.

I think a more accurate title would have been: The roots of the gender pay gap include the values modeled by mothers in childhood.&gt;wants to create more theists

I'm not even sure I know what this means.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theoryAnything he damn well pleases.Saying that JB's "theories on mythos &amp; religion rely too heavily on [...] Jung" as if it were a bad thing is like saying someone relies too heavily on Darwin or Einstein. Not only is Jung not as well known as most other revolutionary thinkers, but his works are notoriously dense. Simply summarising Jung in a coherent manner is an achievement few have managed to pull off.

WLC is a smart guy and he knows how to argue effectively. But his biases show when he debates someone who is equally good at debating. Like all those who engage in apologetics, he has a final destination in mind and he will actively attempt to bend the evidence and arguments towards that end. But WLC has a habit of weakening his grip on certain assertions and claims (almost sliding into a fuzzy, ill-defined deism), but then strengthens his stance when pontificating to a sympathetic crowd. In that manner, I tend to agree with those who accuse him of sophistry. He is very much like Deepak Chopra in that way.I don't think I've come across JB saying people should or must be theists (i.e., believe in an intervening Supreme Being).

And I doubt you meant he was producing ("create") a copious amount of children and raising them all at theists lolBecause the alt right is a made up thing made by the snowflakes to demonize people of common sense You cannot kill a meme, only transform it.Don't feed the trollHow else are social scientists supposed to keep relevant? üòÇWhat are his diet restrictions?You ever been sick trying to take a final exam?&gt; What is a qualitative difference between archetypal simplification of the world to explain the world different from an ideological "caricature" simplifications?

Religion functions as method of value transmission (Boyer &amp; Bergstrom 2008, Horne 2004). There are certain commonalities between religious stories (Jung and Campbell). These commonalities are also called archetypes, and they allude to certain psychological descriptions of the human condition that must be true in order to survive over successive generations and appear in isolated cultures. You can take mysticism out of the equation entirely and just look at archetypes as expressions of the human brain's evolution and responses to problems associated with cooperative behavior.

The counterexample you gave, historical materialism as an archetypal story, would be a myth without a foundation. It may appear as an archetypal story -- I think it certainly can -- but it lacks the thousands of years of evolution that religious stories have. 

&gt; Am I wrong to claim that there is cult-like mentality traits among Peterson's followers? Am I wrong to claim that this is undesirable generally (and even hypocritical, when the aims of the particular movement is considered)?

There is a cult-like mentality among every group of individuals. Humans have a natural inclination toward collectivist behavior. What makes the difference allowing us to judge them is what these collectives hold to be good and what they do/are willing to do to achieve that good. Peterson tells people to clean their room, be honest, and fix their own life before they try fixing anything in the world; I can't think of an interpretation of this message that is authoritarian, evil, or whatever. Now, that's not to say that *some* people may claim to enjoy Peterson's lecture and do some bad things, but people have agency. This hypothetical person is no more a reflection of Peterson's ideas than Eugene Simpson (the man who shot Rep. congressmen) is of Bernie Sanders's.

&gt; Where's the distinction between JP arguing for his political stance vs arguing for the truth? Things he says will always 'feel' and "be" more true to people closer to the personality traits of his own (for example, many of his followers are high in openness)

I want to abstract your first question away from JP specifically. I'm not entirely sure that you can or should separate politics from the truth. Doing so would be like living under a Caligula or a King George. 

You seem to only believe in a subjective truth. If that's the case, then I don't think there's a whole lot of space for us to meet and discuss these sorts of things. I would suggest that your read up on evolutionary psychology and evolutionary political science. Biology contains objective truths that can be used to examine human phenomena and arrive at certain conclusions. 

&gt; (speculative question) How successful are people with other personality traits and political stances (not radical ideologies) at accepting and integrating Peterson's proposed values?

If you gave a source or listed some more traits they score high in, I could answers this a bit better. 

I'd imagine that anyone could manage it since they aren't really Peterson's values so much as reiterations of human values found in religious stories that have been put through the meet grinder of selection since the beginning of our species.This guy readsCan't these media types ***just talk to the guy***. They clearly aren't interested in the contents of his book. It's so disingenuous.He doesn't ***need*** to do anything. Taking a fun picture with someone with a satirical flag of a frog meme once relegated to social outcasts is nothing to apologize for. WLC, while an obviously bright guy, is a disingenuous sophist. He debates to "win", not uncover or discuss the truth in any kind of Socratic way. He's the kind to argue for "Intellegent Design" but what he really is doing is trying to wedge in a specific kind of Creationism. There's two different things going on here though: the law itself and how it is attempted to be used by ideologues. Lindsay Sheppard didn't do anything wrong and those saying she did are objectively wrong about the law. So when you raise a stink about the law, people can point to the law and proclaim (correctly) and say you don't have anything to worry about. But the mere fact that ideologues ***try*** to use the law against people proves JP's point. When you write poorly-worded, ideologically-driven laws then this is the result.Postmodernism isn't necessarily the problem; it's simliar to skepticism in general. However, the void it leaves behind creates the potential for problems. People take simple premises (there is no foundation to truth or knowledge) and run with them to absurd conclusions.Most of the conflict between the left and right starts with the left claiming they have the absolute authority to decide someone else's intentions. Not just the ability ***to know*** someone's intentions, but to ***determine*** the intentions themselves, even if retroactively. It is authoritarianism it its core. It's thought policing; it's artificially controlling language; it's guilt by association; it's "deconstructing" historical texts; it's demonizing humour; it's deciding you are racist for drinking milk.Only if you choose to analyze that particular part of the philosophy he espousing. He talks about tyranny and the proper responses to it. It's not like his philosophy is fix yourself and stay quiet until someone says you've fixed yourself properly. I don't think he's ever made a statement to the affect that someone else has to tell you when you've gotten your life in order. Furthermore, he talks all the time about a successful life being one in which you provide something of value to your community. I think you may be strawmanning JP or you may not have researched his ideas to a good level. His Biblical series is **long** but it's necessary to listen to if you want to get a grasp of what he's saying instead of picking up bits and pieces from secondary sources. I mean, I read Marx and Marcuse as well as listen to AR speakers not because I agree with what they're saying but because I want to be able to understand what they're saying and rebut it effectively.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/

If you're talking about order v. chaos on an individual level, then I think that may be irrelevant. The natural state of things isn't order. Order is something we, as rational beings, impose on the universe in the same way that Yahweh, Odin, Marduk, Amun, and Phanes ordered the universe in the stories we've inherited.

Consider this, if you were to say yes to everything asked of you, would your life be more orderly? If you were to say no to everything, would it be more orderly? At least in my case, I don't think it would; in fact, I think it would become the epitome of chaos.

I think the danger in order comes when it is imposed upon others unjustly. The Alt-Right, Marxist-Left, Nazis, Stalinists, etc. are perfect examples. The leaders, or even the essential intellectual basis, of those movements have an ideal, and their greatest evils were a consequence of the imposition of that ideal upon others. 

I guess what I'm trying to hit at is that the ultimate safeguard against evil is a recognition and respect of the essential equality of individuals. The preservation of liberty should be the ultimate goal.Are people really that clueless to notice that he's clearly caught a cold? His voice sounds hoarse and he sips on the water he was provided.

Seeing as I am significantly younger and less traditonally conservative than Peterson, I usually end up disagreeing with him or raising my eyebrow whenever he talks about marriage or sex. From what I can piece together from conversations he has had, he seems rather like a puritan. But 90% of what Peterson says, it is framed around (or specifically predicated on) some kind of verifiable, empirically-provable matter-off-fact. So in most cases I dont disagree with him because he's either 100% correct or I can at least follow his line of reasoning.[The Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism](http://aras.org/)This destroyed me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T7pUEZfgdI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h29m20sI think /u/ChildofChaos is recommending Peterson organizes the information and opinions he has to share to make more sense to a person listening for the first time. Which is different from dumbing it down.  
  
Look at it like a ladder.   
  
If rung 1 is "compelling me to say 'ze and zer' pronouns is bad"   
  
And rung 5 is "it stems from the same ideology that resulted in the murder of millions"   
  
Explaining each rung in between is useful if you want to give the viewer the best opportunity possible to form their own opinion of the ladder, or overall idea.  
  
Otherwise they kind of get caught with their feet dangling in between rungs and since we all have our own ladders, or shit, to deal with a lot of people won't be interested in searching the rungs out for the ladder salesman and will instead declare the ladder invalid and unstable until proven otherwise.It's weird you say that because those movies are getting positive reviews from all possible ends.

A balanced question would be: 

**How is saying "all SJWs are postmodern neo Marxist" different than saying that "all modern day Christians are practical deists?"**

or:

**How is saying that "all SWJs want to take us back to 1950's communism" different than saying "all modern day Christians want to take us back to the Dark Ages?"**

You can't compare the two statements because they are not comparable. I had an English teacher who stressed the importance of not using any form of "thing". I think when practiced avoiding that alone has to help with vocabulary and precision. It's a joke. I intended to play me calling him "Dad" off of me saying that I want his attention, like a child demanding attention from his father. 

Dr. Peterson is something of an internet dad figure. In fact, I read [this article](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/jordan-peterson-preacher/) just a few minutes ago that makes a similar point. 

It obviously wasn't a good joke üòÖGreat, thank you!I haven't gotten around to reading any primary sources. *The Distributist* is a traditionalist, Catholic YouTuber whose ideas and critiques, black-pilled as they sometimes seem, I enjoy. He's mentioned *What's Wrong with the World* by G. K. Chesterton a few times. It's next on my list after I finish *1984*.It could also be to create more confusion between what a real refugee looks like in comparison to an economic migrant. I don't think any rational person would say Si-Jeong Ho was migrating merely for economic improvement. The fact he was tortured merely for the possibility he met with Christians creates a more definitive line between the people who need our refugee services because they are actually being systematically oppressed vs those opportunist who merely want economic benefits. I really enjoyed the first season of True Detective, but I think the writer, Nic Pizzolatto [plagiarized](https://lovecraftzine.com/2014/08/04/did-the-writer-of-true-detective-plagiarize-thomas-ligotti-and-others/) Thomas Ligotti and Alan Moore pretty heavily. I would say politics is unavoidable when highlighting an example of politically motivated censorship, revealing it. I have not brought politics into this at all aside from revealing a blatant case of gaslighting and censorship by one of the most prominent news sources in the US and the world. 

Politics and ideology is a driving factor behind many examples contemptible, condemnable censorious behavior by the media, academy and government. It's as if you are politely requesting the concept of *light* to be left out of a discussion of *color* so as not to offend the blind man. Why do you find that ironic? If I wanted to kill a religion or political movement or it's adherents I would certainly try to place loyalist spies into that institution to report on people. &gt;The Associated Press is one of the very few Western press agencies that have been allowed to set up permanent shop in North Korea.

After watching the recent Rogan interview, I tested out the keto diet today after having the flu for a few days and I am on cloud 9. Watching this is almost a religious experience.
Indeed he is. Every time I listen to him specially tonight makes me realize all the things that are wrong within me the chaos and order not finding a balance ...the meaning I long for in my life &gt; *because as smart and erudite as he is, it just can't be the case that he simply isn't aware that serious post-modernist philosophers aren't the same thing as hippy wingnuts*

I'll take a stab at this, given the precious little I know, and how not well read I am in this domain.  My read of Peterson's position is that he has arrived at it from a couple of directions that make sense to me, but also seem to easily account for him giving little credit to people like Foucault or Rorty (neither of whom I have read).  I'm just starting to read Gulag, and this is a central and formative work for Peterson.  One of his darkest journeys.  To attempt to comprehend the mind space that leaves a society willing to purge millions upon millions of people, by murdering them in cold blood, for trivial accusations that were not even personal.  Oh, you belonged to the wrong union two years ago, so out back you go and a bullet in the back of your head.  It's profoundly, utterly devastating.  It's literally hell on Earth, Peterson means that term very precisely and literally when he says it.  And when you've taken that to heart, it's hard to have the patience to wade through the wall of semi-gibberish deliberate jargon of some dickhead like  Foucault, and rather spend your time on someone truly profound like Jung.  Peterson is not anything like alone in this conclusion.  When you hear Dennet talk of his friend Rorty sharing the story of Foucault himself claiming that something like 25% of his work was deliberate bullshit, designed to exclude audience and baffle outsiders in order to elevate his own status, well...  I can understand how one could add "communist sympathizer" together with "bullshit artist", and walk the other way with little hesitation.

That's my half-assed interpretation.  I've little doubt I've botched a few facts, but the overall point should be about right:  Peterson has enough sound and not uncommon reasons to consider big hunks of Postmodernism both deplorable and profoundly reprehensible.  At that point, it would be as surprising if he invested much time there, as it would be if he suddenly devoted the next ten years to reviewing the literature of Gender Studies.

Ultimately, that means even though he may be mistaken in his position, I don't think it comes from any kind of intellectual dishonesty or laziness.

Thank you, this is a very important point.From the article:

&gt; "*a wholly unimposing specimen who insists on the moral necessity of physical strength*"

My my my, Mr. Semley has a lot of gall to write that about anyone else.  Or of course, a lot of resentment at someone who's actually in fair shape.

&gt; If the west is the best it's because of the culture we've embraced, which many non-"white" people embrace too.

not according to crime statistics!his opinions aren't retarded, yours are.&gt; What do all you WhiteSoup guys think should be done about this whole thing ? Why is it all about debate and statistics, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre right,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Paint a picture for me!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; When do the deportations start? What if the deported decide they won‚Äôt leave? How will we deal with international trade ? What to do about massively declined birth rate of our new ethnostate?

i don't think deportations would be necessary. we could achieve a majority white population with a mix of the following race neutral policies: ending affirmative action, reducing immigration, limiting/drug testing welfare recipients, offering prisoners birth control in exchange for parole, restoring freedom of association in business and housing, etc.  

the white population is suffering because of explicitly anti-white policies and challenging the underlying assumption of racial egalitarianism is the first step to fixing the problem.reduce welfare obviously. the worthless idiots breed less, and productive money making whites have more money to spend on their family. peterson may have to face some member of the alt right once everyone gets bored of even hearing SJWs get owned. many of the youtube community has already had to shift focus because of low viewership. last night, taylor was on warski's stream and they couldn't get any member of the "skeptic" youtube community to face him. since sargon is done, peterson is just the next logical step for taylor.have you seen spencer advocate for a violent overthrow? i can't recall seeing anything like that, but taylor has been saying that now is the time for openly pro-white candidates to run for office. taylor is not just some philosophical pussy.&gt; But none of these things would raise the white birth rate?

reducing welfare, and by extension taxes, would definitely help the white birth rate.  

&gt;Ok sure you have a white majority, but this is now declining, completely hamstringing the economy.  

that's not actually true, but the solution clearly isn't to import people who are likely to go on welfare, not work, and commit crime.  &gt; Reduce welfare to everyone? or just black people? 

everyone, which would affect blacks more because they take more welfare. go ahead and consider that racist if you want.  

&gt;I'm sure the crime rate wont skyrocket when you squeeze an already economically fucked demographic even harder. They'll just meekly accept the decision and not riot..right?  

they're not "fucked" they've been getting free money for a long time. if they turn to terrorism then our law enforcement system can handle them.  

&gt;How are we going to enforce this welfare cut...that I imagine would be severe enough to reduce their birthrates, and fund a massive subsidy to the whites.  

letting people who actually work keep their money is a subsidy to whites? get a grip. &gt; So you can draw a direct link between birth rates and tax rates? by all means, show us! Or do these "reforms" need to be implemented as a totality, or they wont work. (Seem familiar yet?)

these reforms do not need to be implemented in totality, they can all help incrementally.  

&gt;And in a consumer economy, with an impending inverted population pyramid(as we have in north america), replenishment of working age people is critical, Its hard to imagine anyone making the case against this...do you disagree?  

obviously. as i said, what use is a "working age" person if they don't work, sponge welfare, and commit crime?&gt; 1)With the money you would save by reducing welfare, you would inject this into the economy to be utilized by whites. correct?

&gt;2)I'm sure the angry, and nothing to lose urban population would prove easy prey for our fine police! Just like in Iraq, and Afghanistan, and Syria, and Vietnam. All so easy...Certainly not an apocalyptic slog which destroys valuable capital.  

it's unfortunate that blacks seek destruction.  

&gt;3)So its not race based? Why would the poor whites join you, and kill their only source of income (gov handouts). I mean the rich certainly wouldnt want to upset the apple cart as they are currently doing well...why would you alienate your only potential demographic ally?  

most white people work, and i'm rich and support the culling of unproductive whites. &gt; working age people are consumers. This alone is the lifeblood of our economy. Do you want to go tinkering with that also? , I mean why not right.

our economy will be based on blacks using their ebt to buy junk food? that won't work.because culture is biological. &gt; aw so you're tapping out. Well that took less time than I thought!

haha no idea what you're talking about. we can continue the convo as long as you like.  

&gt;side note : Isn't it terrifying that you're apparently "rich" and still so resentful? I wonder what hole in your soul you need to patch to be happy lol.  

when i hear peterson talk about his fear of saying the wrong thing, i feel like he would benefit from hearing jared taylor in the way many have benefited from hearing peterson. you're just proposing an economic theory that you don't understand yourself (because it's horseshit).I read "Jung: A Very Short Introduction" which was quite good.

"You can live your life two ways: you can use your language to manipulate. You can use it as a tool to get what you want.

&gt; *If it's not necessary to prove that post-modernism leads inexorably to gulags,*

That was  never the contention, although it seems like an obvious hazard if you study the territory, because what we're actually talking about is either openly professed or thinly veiled totalitarian communism, whether they call themselves "postmodernists" or any other jargon.  The proof we seek lies in the form of a hundred million murdered people, it is not speculation, it is history and we must fight to not risk any repeats.  Anyone who pledges any kind of allegiance to that atrocity, who espouses its founding principles, indeed anyone who openly calls themselves communists, deserves our utmost opposition.  Let us also be clear that "communism" is an incredibly complex beast, and we can't just go by stock definitions here, we need to try to recognize larger patterns of human behavior that already just killed a hundred million people, and fight them where we find them hiding under any name.

No, if this was just political speculation, then we wouldn't be talking about [Gulag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gulag_Archipelago) and others.  We would think the postmodernists were just delusional idiots and ignore them, if they weren't angling quite directly at tyranny, generally of a form with the most dire proven consequences in human history.

&gt; *In that context, it is his opponents who make the argument you are making: the severity of the charges, we are told, means we should automatically believe the accuser.*

How would you react if someone started advocating that adults teach all young children about sex by having sex with them?  Oh no, we're not pedo's advocating child rape, it's only for their own good, just trust us and we'll build a healthier society.

You might pause here to notice that communists didn't just rape children, they enslaved and murdered them by the millions.  It's hard to find a more inspiring example to aspire to... if only they had listened to you instead. /s

JP might argue that the author subconsciously wrote them that way because those are universally human archetypes.No your advice makes sense thanks ;). Yes I've been trying to go back to school twice in past years but each time I get stuck on the issue of finances, not having/earning enough money to pay for tuition. I even tried having a roommate to help ease the burden and that worked for a few months untill he moved out and I had to quit college again. Another roommate is not an option anymore, it's difficult to find someone I can stand for long periods. The only option is educating myself through (free) online webdev courses which I'm currently doing, it's hard keeping motivated but I don't have any other options atm. And I love programming so it's not a chore, but I get distracted easily. In the meantime I still have to deal with a unwelcoming work environment, it's not their fault I don't live up to their expectations. I think it's due to my low conscientiousness, I can't process new impulses fast enough i.e they calling me a slow worker. I could do that when I was younger AND if I was interested in the material, but now if it doesn't interest me I just can't put my mind to it.I've been in therapy for depression a while ago, but I didn't get much out of it, I got more out of meditation and loosing weight than the entire year in therapy.

My experience with precise daily schedules is that it doesn't work for me, I have to have some flexibility to change things when other things come up I have to attend to. My current schedule is a piece of paper on the wall with 4 area's I need to attend to (webdev study, spiritual practice, excercise, artistic practice) of which I choose 2 every day, this works for now although not ideal. All white people are discriminated against under affirmative action. All white people are attacked as a group, not as individual cultures, all all white countries are expected to take in immigrants and become minorities in their own countries. This is a stupid argument lefties makeIdiots like you will say we are to diverse to advocate for ourselves, but if an office has a German, Italian, British, Australian, Estonian and a Russian, you would say it's too white and needs more diversity. It's pretty fucking funnyDo you think it's a coincidence that diversity really means anti-white? It doesn't care if a company is 100% Mexican, and it doesn't care if every white person is a decendants from a different country. It only cares about forcing as many non whites as possible into white territories. And this happening to countries will likely cause us to go extinct.im totally fine with having minorities, but not being replaced.- sent from my motorola flip phoneAt least they're doing something semi-positive as a protest and not trying to shut down the talk or some such nonsense.Yet you're on a website, on the internet, on a computer or phone, typing with a keyboard.

Was he literally Hitler then, but they were too selfish to care because he didn't challenge their agendas?  Or had he not yet become the villain they claim, until just that very same recent moment that he happened to challenge their agenda on Bill C-16?  What a coincidence?  I suppose we'll never know (if SJW's can ever make any sense at all), but they can't have it both ways.A few hasty thoughts:

- Status won purely by self promotion that is done purely to gain status, is hollow, fraudulent status, and the process of doing that kind of status seeking in life will undermine and consume the energy you should have spent earning that status in ways by building substance with genuine merit.

- Example: someone who spends all their time bragging about how amazing they are, and fools a lot of people into believing them, versus a person who spends all their time becoming a master, and earns fame for actually doing something amazing.  The braggart is a fake, the master may not even want to be famous, but can't avoid it because they genuinely deserve it and everyone around can tell.

- Utopian speculation: In a perfect world, perhaps we might hope that one's status would be earned purely by merit for tangible accomplishments, while status seeking and dominance competitions would have no success at all.

- Reality: We are primates who seek positions in a social hierarchy, it is part of our animal instincts, ultimately a part of our body that is as real as our skin, blood and bones.  There will always be symbolic status competitions, and pure merit will never be the complete picture, meaning that people who rely solely upon honest merit will come out behind what they deserve on real merit.

- This leaves us a choice of whether and/or how much we are willing to advertise ourselves in pursuit of status.  I think it's fair and moral to simply make sure that people notice your real merits, so that they are not drowned out by people who boast without substance.  This carries the responsibility that if you want more status, you have to earn it before you can honestly promote it, but you at least stand a chance to compete against people who spend 90% on bragging and only 10% on honest accomplishment.  This is good for you and everyone else, because you give them honest value, and help them not get suckered in by people who are only faking.  Example: do you want as your life guard some very social person who once won a swimming race, and then spent the last 5 years bragging about it?  Or do you want the person who never won a race, but has been practicing hard for a decade, and studying life saving in earnest?  We can hope that the person putting in the real effort manages to help us tell the difference, since we may very well not know enough about real strength in swimming and first aid to choose the honest talent over the braggart (this knowledge being their specialty), and in that case it could cost lives.  So ask yourself honestly which swimmer you aspire to be, and what duty of self promotion do you have?

- Dr. Peterson wisely reminds us not to lie, or at least avoid saying things we know are not true.  He advises us to get ourselves together, and become heroes, because our families and communities need heroes.  I think your intuition understands that real heroes are not fakers, and they don't brag excessively about their talent, especially not to just beat someone else down in a petty status competition.  I think that intuition is a very sensible starting point for how to think about all this.I just wish they would get more specific with what their ideas are for their master plan to fix society. You know they have something in mind but they beat around the bush when talking about it, and in such an abstracted way, that it comes off as friends circlejerking over an inside joke or something.He stays neutral about it because everyone and their mothers have a preconceived notion of what God is and isnt. I'm still not convinced he believes in an intervening deity that characterizes the Judeo-Christian tradition. And he clearly doesn't take the biblical stories as literal historical texts. But anyone who has studied religion and philosophy in general knows that there's something fundamental about necessity, potential, and morality, which leads one to an [Idea of God](http://www.friesian.com/virtual.htm) in the [Kantian tradition](http://www.friesian.com/numinos.htm).
&gt;Kant believed, indeed, that morality was what religion was all about and that it provided a basis for rational belief in concepts like God, freedom, and immortality; but this provided no ground for any other aspects of traditional religious practice, belief, or experience. Fries was able to add an important component, that the central aspect of religion was not so much reason as¬†feeling. But Fries still provided little room for most of the traditional contents of religion. Even though both Kant and Fries were, in some general and cultural sense, Christians, there was nevertheless no reason in their systems of philosophy to believe anything more than that Jesus Christ was a particularly good moral teacher.Is this Peterson's evil twin, his literal shadow incarnate? üòÇüòÇüòÇyour diet is completely adequate, don't try any of this "low carb" dogshit people are pushing, it's only useful for a certain phase of advanced bodybuilding. i usually drink about 6 cups of milk and coffee in the morning. you may be right.  and JBP certainly describes how dangerous things are.

That is well evidenced by how trivially SJW's throw the name around; if they had enough substance of mind to recognize the real evil against their values that Hitler actually was, there is no way they would equate people to him, because doing so diminishes and trivializes a far more profound threat than they are aware of.  An analogy: you would obviously look foolishly bad if you called some serial child rapist and murderer something so mild as merely "a bad person".  But when you equate with Hitler someone who your worst claim could possibly be "a bad person", you are essentially doing exactly that.

And we haven't even brought up Lenin, Stalin and Mao.We got people over at the Sam Harris subreddit concerned that Peterson is an alt-right enthusiast backed by Neo Nazis while simultaneously a good candidate for actual Neo Nazis are plotting against Peterson because he doesn't hate Jews.

would you say that you have been able to overcome this initial (and certainly non-trivial) handicap?


I ask because at other times Peterson gives very dire warnings about the hazard of this situation to the point of almost making it sound like those of us who were poorly socialized are almost damned by this.  in the quote above he uses the word "forever."  jeezis.  this can be crushing and demoralizing to hear, but powerfully motivating for me to get it right with my own kids.&gt; I've had no strong role model in my life whatsoever.


incorrect, sir.  you are on this sub, which means you've got JBP.


So far, so good.  keep it up.  keep sorting.


never say never about kids.  you are not the person you were a few years ago, so in a few years your view may change.it's not about socialization per se, but proper behavior vis a vis the real world.  yeah please read the book it's super good.This is from a faculty member? They need serious help with their hiring practices.He must be very scared of remixes and contemporary movies that adapt classic literature as well.Why? Because post-modernism isn't even relevant.  Many serious academic theorists agree post-modernism ended with 9/11.. which then put us into contemporary, which now seems to be encapsulated by "post-truth".  Post-modernism is just a term to describe a plethora of culture tendencies that went against modernist thinking.  Yet somehow he has made a boogie man out of something he is not that nuanced in.  He is mostly using rhetoric of cultural marxism. &gt; If I read this 25 years ago when I first had kids my anxiety would have went through the roof.

you keep saying mariendorf will revert things back to the old ways, but rudolf had already brought back a nobility 400 years prior. and i think one of the main points of the show is that we shouldn't completely abandon our traditions.  

think about how the goldenbaum dynasty itself was treated: lang was executed, the little kid died, and his caretakers went insane/became a pirate and died. 

add to that reinhard himself came from a noble family and was well liked, there's no reason for the other nobles not to accept him.

[THE POLITICAL IDENTITY TRAP (and how to escape it)](https://youtu.be/bJWUETbN4js)

Some stuff I wrote in another chat just recently:

----

Dr. JP points out that people's politics are mostly determined by their in-born personality disposition. Think about that. Dividing our nation's politics along "liberal" versus "conservative" lines is literally as absurd as dividing it as blue eyes vs. brown eyes, because it's just fucking biology. It should be painfully obvious that diversity of personality is a useful tool in team efforts, because you're effectively expanding the tool set available to solve the problems at hand. Since we're actually talking about biological personality, we need to stop dealing in utterly corrupted terms like "left", "right", "liberal", "conservative" and so forth, all they do is confuse us with erroneous historical associations that have become baggage, most of which are really primarily concerned with group identity rather than any coherent philosophical or practical meaning. Therefore, I am doing my best to refuse to call myself anything other than primary terms that actually describe me: I call myself open minded, curious, willing to experiment, strongly empathetic, diligent, a pragmatist, deeply committed to truth, vigilant against falling to our species' dangerous group instincts, and absolutely dedicated to maximizing individual freedom. Those are my strengths, and I seek to master them the best I can, in order to build something better in this world, instead of contributing to hell on Earth. I am glad to work with anyone capable of mastering their own strengths when we share common goals. Trying to apply labels to this stuff only leads us to become divided and conquered.

----

All the terms like "left", "right", "liberal" and "conservative" have become hopelessly confused with decades of baggage, most of it corrupt and incoherent, all perverted by cycle after cycle of mis-association with causes incoherently adopted as team loyalty symbols, until nobody knows who what or why any more. Using these words accomplishes practically nothing, and is guaranteed to confuse both you and everyone listening, probably creating division and enmity where people would have probably liked each other if they had simply appreciated each other's personalities, instead of being pulled by feelings of team loyalty.

I encourage you to try abandoning any identity you have under any of those teams, and simply name the traits of your personality, and the primary issues you care about, and the fundamental principles that are the honest foundations of those concerns. I think you will find there is no conflict in being both a liberal and a conservative at the same time, if you happen to be able to strongly utilize both of those personality styles at the same time. To the extent I learn how to be more conscientious as the years go by, I become more able to appreciate the strengths of people who are more innately disposed that way. At the same time, I am glad to see many of them learn to value and be good at opening their minds as needed, and learning from their examples how to be more prudent about open minded thinking, including having better respect for lessons from the past, and respectfully integrating them instead of assuming they should be automatically rejected. Jordan Peterson is a great example of this balance in action.

If there are any labels I actually want to fly as my team banners, they are words like freedom, anti-corruption, individual liberty, anti-collectivism, anti-authoritarianism, anti-bigotry, anti-tyranny, and immune from ideological possession. I could say I support the Enlightenment in general principle. I wish I had someone to vote for that would lead with those values in government, and I wish voting meant much of anything at all. And if there are any teams I'm against, I would say they are ideologues willing to harm the individual for "the good of the people". SJW's, Islam, communists, and every political party that exists in the West.

(Good read by the way. Thanks for sharing your work.)Why women of white skin are trying to get out of the USA to escape black people.I remember when I first listened to Jordan Peterson. I watched like 20 hours in 1 week. I started remembering and having vivid dreams again. Like I did fucking drugs or stopped doing drugs. Literally thats what triggers me remembering dreams, doing drugs or stopping them.

Watching Jordan Peterson is like drugs. Shit changes your brain.gary vee is a great dudeLucky for us, it‚Äôs not illegal yet!So the child's agency, comes second to the pathological need to rid the world of discrimination.I did a lot of shrooms in a very uncomfortable environment and was forced to face myself and myself was a shit person.

I went through like 2 years of intense social anxiety and mental agony but am very happy I made it through that because I'm so much better than I was before.

I actually consider my life as before shrooms and after shrooms. Before shrooms i was an unconscious piece of shit. After shrooms I became self aware. It's like I was asleep and now I am awake.

Totally recommend psychedelics if your life isn't going like you want it to.JP's words touches the deepest parts of your soul and nature. Western culture tries to teach you shit you question the second it leaves their mouth. So you can tell who you would rather listen to.Y'all. We need some ctrl+alt esc. Mirite?
I have no words. I need brain bleach. I have never wanted a cheesy bumper sticker more than I do now.Yeah, this was the final stroke of "genius" for me:

&gt; *has nothing to do with* ***the authentic left.***

Zizek wants to be Stalin, because he's sure, right to his bones, that he could bring the Utopia.  Because he knows better.  He knows the "authentic" good intentions of the Real True Left‚Ñ¢, and just how to best implement them.

And if I'm overstating it, if Zizek doesn't actually want to be the left-literally-Hitler, then it's still hard to tell given the smothering arrogance of the authority he projects.  It's an interesting difference to Dr. Peterson, who is never more than about twenty words away from being able to drop a very incisive and honest "But what the hell do I know anyways?"  And that bedrock of humility, born by an impeccably honest man, is why when Peterson shares the best insights he's so far managed to articulate ***for himself***, they come as genuine gifts for the listener to use as they see fit, rather than feeling like a big greasy cock being sneakily but very forcefully rammed into your head with the intention that you should have no choice in the the intended mind-fuckery to come.  But what else should we expect from a Stalinist, he's lying and distorting for our own good don't you know?

I've enjoyed some Zizek performances for the spectacle, because it is kind of funny to watch him spaz his way (looking all [ganked out on coke](https://youtu.be/yIL9wLxG01M)) through the process of thoroughly milking his left-academic audiences by being a deliberate edge lord, the fucking Milo of European left academic philosophy, playing masterfully upon the crowd's inevitable lusts and simmering frustrations with PC purity.  Unlike Peterson, fame was Zizek's deliberate goal, not a psychedelic accident, the cost of which can only be justified by its necessary utility.

----

This article is one of a long series of "go back to sleep you peons" articles we can expect to see, written by people who can't even articulate the fact that their philosophies have failed so spectacularly, that there is now become a vast lake of hot gasoline waiting for a spark.  The bulk fuel in that lake is the genuine need of several generations of people for some honest and useful philosophy to guide our lives, in a way that properly respects and fosters the individual.  Dr. Peterson's thoughts are a spark, an explosion is building, and all the establishment onlookers can imagine is to shoo away the spark.  They are afraid of the spark, because they are soft, and sparks are sharp, and so they try to banish them.  They fail to recognize and fear the actual source of danger, the hot lake of gasoline, because they are combinations of vacuous, collectivist, narcissistic, nihilistic and hedonistic; and yet still they sense that a danger lurks, so they shoo at sparks all the harder.  They don't recognize that sparks are as inevitable as the bulk of the fuel, but what did not need to happen was creating the volatility.  They taught for several decades that there is no real meaning in life, while fostering a movement of authoritarian identity politics that nullifies the individual, and cemented the effect by finally making disagreement a crime.  This has ultimately driven frantic tribalism, justified by the acute need to defend personal dignity, and this gives the fuel its true volatility.  The public will remain a volatile explosive until we rebuild enough real meaning in our lives to be secure enough to reject frantic tribalism.

And so, if there is a hope to defuse this bomb, it will be people on all sides pausing to get their own shit together, before they go stampeding off to starting fucking wars.  If we can credit Zizek for anything here, at least he's granted Dr. Peterson's core point when he says "Because the left doesn't have its own house in order", and is delivering this to the left where it needs to be heard the most.  We can hope the message is heard, and cleaning up their rooms makes them into stronger people, so they can stop teaching nonsense and blaming everyone else for their victimhood.&gt; *Namely, Peterson does use 'false truths' or 'truthful lies', especially in his characterization of the left as this scary postmodern boogieman.*

I call BS.  Peterson may well be wrong on many points, but he is articulating his honest best, ready and eager for any rebuttals.  If you want to criticize his analysis, then make an actual argument, and hear his response before you say he's lying.  And don't blame him if your voice isn't loud enough to reach his ears, because your lack of voice is not his fault, and the answer is to promote your arguments until they have effect, just like he has done.

&gt; *But the academic world doesn't take Peterson seriously and Peterson doesn't try to take the academic world seriously, so they seem like they're on two separate poles. Like just looking at "12 Rules for Life"[1], and it's not really an philosophical epic--it's a self-help book for the general populous.*

I have come to regard academic philosophy as a body of largely fictional work, that has become dangerously disconnected from the reality that pays its salaries.  I feel it deserves to be accused of gross negligence and failure of due diligence, for so long occupying the titular offices of human intellect and meaning, and yet producing for decades almost nothing but books of jargon that only they can read, leaving the rest of humanity largely lacking their guidance and floundering through difficult and total transitions like the fading of religion in the dawn of technology.  A fellow like Dr. Peterson at least gets right the fact that he's working for other human beings, which he's dedicated his professional career to understanding and helping.  In teaching he thus has the common decency to speak plainly and respectfully to his audience, and share in comprehensible terms the best of what he has brought back from the more esoteric realms of deep thinking he has long explored.  Moreover, he doesn't discourage others from exploring for themselves, indeed he implores thinking so powerfully and credibly that his doing so is itself a significant piece of that guidance, that wisdom, that humanity so desperately needs.  Not an arrogant "you're not qualified to think, or even read my books, that's my elite job", but instead "think hard and think deep, our your life will be hell."

In contrast, I describe Zizek like this:  I've enjoyed some Zizek performances for the spectacle, because it is kind of funny to watch him spaz his way (looking all ganked out on coke) through the process of thoroughly milking his left-academic audiences by being a deliberate edge lord, the fucking Milo of European left academic philosophy, playing masterfully upon the crowd's inevitable lusts and simmering frustrations with PC purity.&gt; *SZ will, occasionally, give the left the business*

I figure that's Zizek's actual business (as in racket); being an edge-lord entertainer, a comedian, for the audience of left academic European philosophy.  He milks it hard.  A Milo, but not nearly as likable.

He has to argue against PC culture a lot, because he makes his living by pandering to left academics, playing masterfully on the crowd's repressed inevitable lusts and simmering frustrations with PC purity.  You entertain tyrants by carefully joking and teasing them about the secret sadism they can never admit to in public.&gt; *solutions of personal responsibility, which serve the individual but do little to change the degenerating dynamic that is causing people to become primitive and tribal in the first place.*

I think you've actually got that exactly backwards.  The degenerating dynamic is precisely because people lack personal responsibility, and so they conduct themselves without integrity, without virtue, each contributing a little bit of hell to the bigger picture of society.  That collective lack of integrity builds a hell that victimizes the individual, who then becomes desperate, and seeks a virtuous tribe to solve their problem.  If they find a tribe, then they fail to take personal responsibility for implementing the solution, and so they deepen the cycle, at worst becoming a part of a frenzied and vicious pack (literally rampaging primates) that does terrible damage.  The cycle can only be broken because the victimized individual adopts the responsibility to fix themselves, of becoming stronger than the arrows that will always be raining down upon them, and in so doing comes to play a better part in society, one more person with enough integrity to not fire even more arrows into the crowd.It's also important to remember that people often use real problems, concerns and virtues as excuses, when their real business is often just selfishly being conformist status seeking parts of the very system they claim to be fighting, because it's the only game in town that pays well without getting your hands dirty.  How much easier to hold a position developing diversity policy, than to get a job cleaning hotel rooms?  I'm not even blaming them for it, it's just normal sloppy humaning, and getting one's shit together is the most universal solution.

This is an important point, one that JBP makes but is often not understood sufficiently.  So when you say "he doesn't engage thoroughly enough with their real problems and concerns", I say that's not necessarily his job, but it is necessarily theirs, and nobody is beholden to give them credit for claimed good intentions, when they are actually being authoritarian shits.  Indeed, you are insufficiently diligent if you take them at their word instead of carefully vetting them for malicious intent they may well have but neither realize nor ever admit to.First, understand I have complete respect for your thoughts here, and would rather follow the meaning that chasing a squabble.  So to the extent I pursue the squabble, understand it is only to clarify and avoid errors in meaning.

So, we were talking about responsibility vs. tribalism, and now you've brought in an external and new topic, namely the overarching problems with economy and industry.  That's called shifting the goal post, but I agree that economic issues are a primary driving force here, and I agree with some of your thoughts about it, so I don't mind expanding the discussion.  But, there is still the original point, and you still have it backwards, even with influence of economics.

&gt; *Personal responsibility would be adopted universally if life was easy.*

Yeah, and it wouldn't matter a good god damn then.  It matters because life is hard, and the harder life is, the more adopting personal responsibility is desperately necessary.  Because the hardness of life also drives people to find solutions in tribes and tribalism and ideology, and that combines into people becoming roving packs of vicious primates on the hunt, and feeling absolutely morally justified no matter how depraved they become in the process.

&gt; *Its because the system is degenerating through a singular belief in...* {anything}

You have a thinking error here.  The system degenerates because ***the individuals*** who compose the system ***individually*** fail to uphold their responsibility to think about anything other than making money.  The average collected results of such individual behavior include systemic level changes, but it is not "the system" acting.  There is no "thinking system" that is capable of having beliefs, "singular" or otherwise, and acting upon them.  The unit of society is the individual, and the solution to systemic failure must begin with individuals owning their responsibility to think and act in better ways, thus forming better components of the larger systems.

At the system level, all we can aim at is the structure.  The individuals who run corporations and other large institutions at this point in history refuse to have those structures substantially modified, perhaps most importantly would never accept having them strictly limited in size.  If we don't like it, we only have two choices.  One is to beat them, by taking full responsibility for our independence, instead of expecting them to feed us while we object to them.  But of course, they already own everything in this increasingly zero sum game, so it's practically impossible to create whole new systems and sidestep them.  Two is to convince them to do something different, which includes overcoming the objection that if our argument was any good, why don't we use it to beat them, why come begging?  And the answer to that is simple enough: they need to be better trained in philosophical virtue, and we need to shame them into following it against their greed, instead of idolizing them for being rich, examples of our dream lives.  That means we need to stop idolizing them, which includes rejecting the many forms of celebrity signaling on sale.

&gt; *You're completely ignoring (or maybe denying because its an emotionally painful realisation) the impact of exponentially increasing inequality through automation &amp; AI.*

No, you've only just brought it into the discussion, so it's kind of premature to speculate on my feelings about it.  I'll call automation plus AI simply "A".  We can't avoid A, it's inevitable, and obviously wildly fruitful.  But we don't have any societal structure worked out that can cope with A taking over.  Communism is out, and markets snowball out of all control, until they tear apart society.  The structure I see is markets, but with incredibly strict limits set for the maximum size of all formal groups, including companies and government departments.  The point is simple enough: we can't let too few people make decisions that impact too many people.  When A happens but the companies are small, then there are more people closer to the consequences, who can use what control they have to steer things better.  It would also restore real competition in markets, because there would never be anybody big enough to rig the game, and that brings even more people power to bear on bad behavior.

OK, I actually have to work now.  Cheers.Try not to read it in his voice.I‚Äôm pretty sure that solo motorcycle touring and solo backpacking is what keeps me sane. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúbushcrafter,‚Äù but I can see the appeal and knowing you have the skills is it‚Äôs own confidence booster. This is our competition? I‚Äôm clearly worrying too much. Nope, not copy pasta, I wrote it from scratch to get it off my head.  I assume by "the metaphor in the middle" you mean the lake of hot gasoline?Well thanks.  I hope I've been at least a little successful over the last 15 years, trying to teach myself to write somewhat passably and coherently, and maybe even make the product not too painful to read.  But it's a strange thing, as I have begun to find my voice through the keyboard, only to realize I'm a frightfully long-winded nerd ;)This means nothing to people who think enlightenment values are racist.This is so coolYou might say "you reap what you sew" to someone who you know already has the same conclusion, at which point it's likely just moral smugness.  The problem with YRWYS is that it's effectively little more than a truism, that fails to actually explain the causal chain, the ***why***, to people didn't get the point, or reject the point.  An actual complete explanation is required to lay the groundwork, and YRWYS is then only really useful to underscore ***that*** the actions you spelled out in detail actually did have the consequences you claim were the result.  It's called making an argument with substance, instead of just finger wagging.

I go for depth.  I find it most useful when other people make the effort to clarify things in depth, and so I try to give in kind.  I also find that there's a dangerous tendency for people to treat subjects superficially, taking important details for granted, and as a consequence making errors, accepting shallow common bad answers to important questions, and generally failing to achieve solid rigor and due diligence in their thinking.  And aside from errors, they also miss fruitful connections with other subjects that they would have benefited from, if only they spent the time to really articulate things in depth.  This is one of the central reasons I love JBP's work, he brings together a very wide array of knowledge and subject matter that most people would be either unequipped to synthesize, and/or even terrified to attempt, and this paints a far bigger picture for listeners, with enough detail to truly expose important connections and implications that are frequently overlooked or even forgotten about in less thorough discussion.

As for the 15 years, it's actually more like 12 or 13: about then, video sharing sites started happening, and I started participating in discussions on one of them (one that is now relatively faded away).  I was reasonably well read and articulate, so I found that writing came naturally to me in spite of lack of practice and experience.  But I knew I wanted to get better, and so I decided to set high standards for online discussion, and to tried to engage in substantial in-depth discussions as much as possible, instead of brief ones.  To that end, I have probably averaged hundreds of words a day, at least when I'm active on line, which is at least 2/3 of the time.  Sometimes I've hit a few thousand words a day.  The practice adds up, especially because I take it seriously enough to proof read and re-write, in order to clarify and improve my style.  The result is that I feel like I have no problem joining any discussion, at almost any level of discourse, and I can automatically organize and structure my thoughts into something that can be communicated effectively and accurately to others.  That ultimately helps in every day life quite a lot, because when speaking, and even when thinking about things for myself, I automatically structure my thoughts more coherently than I used to.  Every single individual of the species homo sapiens sapiens is a primate, with every single piece of a primate body in tact and working.  And that includes inside our brains.  The bit our species recently added on is the part that babbles on and fucking on about everything, endlessly, instead of just doing stuff.  We are the planet's babbling monkeys.  Now of course we use that babbling part to add many layers of elaborate sophistication on top of ***still being monkeys doing what monkeys do***, but that in no way means we stopped doing what monkeys do: we have only obfuscated it, buried it deep under layers of complexity, and set those monkey actions upon a more elaborate stage, one that we sculpted in ways non-babbling monkeys don't know how.

And here's the most interesting thing: The old monkey-mind still working in our brains has no words, because it evolved long before that ability.  But our "conscious" mind is deeply connected with all the babbling, full of words, constantly explaining itself.  This means that we can't hear what the monkey mind is thinking, because it has no words or explanations, and so we are unaware of it's activity permeating our thinking and actions.  What most people fail to recognize is that we are actually aware, because our emotions are mostly generated by the monkey-mind part of us.  Emotions are why monkeys did what they did, before they had words to explain why: they felt like doing it, so they did.

Now, all this applies directly to hierarchy in society.  Sure, we layer every kind of elaboration upon it, and we abstract it into many apparently different forms.  But what we do not do, ***what we cannot do because of our biological nature, is live without any social hierarchy at all.***  With no words coming from our monkey minds, we can't even explain why, but the fact is that people ***feel like*** following leaders, and also ***feel like*** striving to become leaders.

So take every group of people in existence, and there will always be some difference between the individuals, some ways in which some are stronger than others.  People within the group will always end up intuitively following the stronger people, while the stronger people in the group will feel competitive about who is the strongest.  This almost always ends up with one, or at most a few of the strongest people in the group becoming the leaders.  Even in groups where everyone consciously explicitly discusses and vows a policy of having no leaders, based on a philosophy/ideology that rejects having leaders, even then you will see people subtly being leaders while others subtly follow, while all of them would never admit that is what they are actually doing.  Of course you have to be a careful observer sometimes to see this, but there are almost no exceptions ever, unless you have an extremely small group of people who are all very equal in skill and extremely consciously aware of their own rejection of hierarchy at all times.

To the extent that it is possible for humans to consciously reject social hierarchy, it is almost totally impossible in practice.  Even a group of stamp collectors will single out and follow one of them, because he/she has the most stamps, or experience, is the most sociable, is the most dominant, or something; any excuse will do, because that is our monkey nature, still completely with us since the time we branched off from lobsters.We are monkeys, complete, and that includes having every single part of a monkey brain, just like we have every other part of a monkey body.  People get silly and think they can separate the brain from the body, such that humans could be fundamentally brain-different in nature from all the other primates, but it's an absurd assumption that falls apart the moment you really contemplate it.  It would take extraordinary evidence to suggest that our brains are anything much more than extensions on already existing biological components, and the only difference between us and the other primates is proportion.  IE, we don't have any new bits that didn't exist before, we don't do anything particularly unique, we just build what already existed into a new extremely exaggerated form.

I think to the extent we can grant ourselves exceptional status is that by evolving our ability for communication using language and symbols far beyond the extremely primitive ability of other primates, we see a new set of emergent uses happen.  So, even without unique new parts, you get to use the same parts other monkeys have, but their more strongly developed forms allow us make them work together in ways that other monkeys cannot do with their weaker versions, and this allows us to do unique new things the monkeys can't achieve, even though they have all the same parts.&gt; Opposing c-17 and starting an reinvigorated anti-trans movement is hardly benign.

I think you're insane if that's what you think.  You obviously haven't figured out that there are fanatic trans-activists on one side, and fanatic anti-trans people on the other, and they are at war, and that was the case long before and long after Dr. Peterson took a public stance on C-17.  Of course, the pro-trans fanatics are the kind of freaks who absolutely cannot handle even the slightest whiff of disagreement, so they instantly decided that Peterson was literally Hitler and doing everything he could to literally exterminate them.  Which was pure and utter insanity.  But having been so declared, he became an instant icon for the anti-trans fanatics to champion, even though Dr. Peterson is as staunchly against them as he is the pro-trans fanatics.  But of course the fact that the already existing enemies of the pro-trans fanatics liked Dr. Peterson, is held against him.

Analogy: it's basically that Dr. Peterson stepped into a war that was already hot.  He stuck his head up, and when the pro-trans side started spastically shooting at him, the anti-trans side decided he must be on their side, and started shooting back.  Now what you've done is blamed Dr. Peterson for all the fire.  The fact is none of it was his fault.  There are a bunch of fanatics on both sides, and they started shooting, not him.So what I'm struggling with is this 

Do I save my dad from the belly of the whale?

or distance myself until he is less self destructive and socially toxicMove boldly towards what you find meaningful. It will bring harmonious people slowly into your life. I am generally extroverted but honestly hardly keep in touch with any of my numerous friends because I already discovered as this chapter shows, friends who don't look out for themselves can be a drain on you. It's good to learn to be alone, to enjoy being alone but to be bold enough that people who align with your vision will be able to easily find you.
This doesn't require extroversion
I'm trained as a behavioural analyst and one of the tools we use is a DISC assessement, the company I get my assessment through gives you too pictures of your behavioural style. one for natural style and one for adapted style. 

If you have any questions about that I can answer maybe. You could also google a DISC assessment for understanding other metrics of behaviour.

We certainly can adapt our behaviour to suit work and social situations. So you're both insane and an idiot.  Good to know.  I suppose it's no surprise that you would be the one person in this forum who doesn't discuss things in good faith.  You should go do something worthwhile with your life, instead of shitting in places where other people are trying to get things figured out.So are you saying it's not true, or you just don't like how it feels?Please, I beg of you, do not accept any amount of money to fake Dr. Peterson if some malevolent journalists ever ask you to.  I'm sure that with only a tiny bit of practice your voice could pass for him talking to the entire world, and you could be offered money to say things intended to destroy his reputation.  Please, don't abuse that, please only use it in good fun and humor, something that brings the world always farther away from hell, something that never says things you know to be anti-true.This is an unpronounceable acronym.

"Muhblegtack" maybe?True, I didn‚Äôt hear anything new other than a book recommendation I had not heard him make and the simulation conversation, but I didn‚Äôt expect to. He is, after all, on a book tour promoting the ideas in the book. I did enjoy the conversation, but I wasn‚Äôt attending to hear new info, so I suppose my expectations were low in that regard.

That said, I‚Äôve pretty much quit listening to the various clips that are posted due to repetition and am focusing on completing the biblical and MOM series. Those are dense enough to relisten multiple times. As they say in the Motorsports world: ‚ÄúYMMV.‚ÄùLOL, so what did they pay you to say?  Upload the tape to YouTube and you can make even more money exposing the corrupt journalists.  Scandal always sells hot.Mmmmm juicy...

You weren't working for ~~Hillary~~ Kathleen Wynne by any chance?&gt; *A weaker mind might develop a Christ-complex under the same circumstances.*

And that is probably the single most potent point I can see in favor of Dr. Peterson: he is absolutely not developing a Christ complex, or becoming a cult leader, and this is a good demonstration of the solidity of the ideas he is doing his honest best to develop with us and share with us.  He fights against ideological possession, doing his best to help us build as much immunity as we can create in our own lives.  He teaches his us his own personal reasons for why he cares, and then shows us by example how he has done it for himself, and how we might discover how to do it for ourselves.  And he takes no personal credit for the insights he shares, he says it's the subject matter itself, including archetypal stories expressing profound patterns of truth, that are amazing and light up people's brains.  He is clear that he can only do his best to help people find that stuff, in a world where so many people otherwise never hear about it, or have anyone show them where to look, but that the meaning does not come from him.  And as always, the emphasis is on what people manage to make of themselves, for themselves, and on their own terms, and never about the fact that JP was the messenger.  And to the extent he defends himself, it is ONLY in service of continuing to be a messenger, and not of being the message.

Unfortunately, clarity about his intent, motives and integrity gets obscured by too much drama (Cathy), and all the inevitable time spent discussing that drama instead of actually discussing the deeper subject matter.  To some extent this is justified, because at numerous points the drama does clearly illustrate many of the ideas he is trying to share, so it often makes sense to use his own situation as examples instead of only discussing other current cases (eg Lindsay Shepherd) or historical cases.  But it is hard for casual and unfamiliar observers to understand that the high proportion of drama coverage at this point is not indicative of self-aggrandizing fame seeking on behalf of Dr. Peterson; he isn't a wanton media whore and doesn't want drama at all, he actually just wants truly meaningful discussion, and will take his opportunity to do what he can to help people find these ideas.  When you understand his motivations, you can see them clearly in action, even in casual discussions, because he is always trying to steer the discussion away from himself and onto the subjects of real interest, where he is at most using personal examples to help make other points.

I'm very glad to see that Dr. Peterson seems to be managing to keep his head clear through this multi-year psychedelic trip, it's no small feat.  I'm glad he doesn't need to hallucinate being Christ to bear his cross, and he doesn't seem to want any reward beyond knowing that he did everything he could to do the best he could, because that is the real source of worth in life.  He sets an example of high integrity, and I would be surprised if he doesn't eventually go a step farther, and spend a considerable amount of his well earned money on doing important projects.  The times, they are a-changing, and Dr. Peterson, along with a growing number of other great thinkers, are well situated to do extremely important work, I would say teaching several generations of people worldwide some of the core ideas we will need to not end modern civilization in a suicide of stupidity aimed at extinction.

Ultimately, the responsibility lies with us, to step up and carry whatever burdens we can.  Thanks for writing an insightful comment on Dr. Peterson's situation.  I think it's important that we think through and speak these ideas out, because that is what helps people avoid falling into bad patterns like idolizing him, or just "believing" his words as though they are proclamations from a god.  He's a human being, with ideas that can be useful, and understanding his situation accurately only helps keep those ideas clear.Well, I'm in no position to make an offer, let alone one big enough to cover your legal bills, so I guess there endeth the lesson.I've been thinking about this kind of thing a fair bit, coming from the perspective as a committed metaphysical naturalist, and lifelong atheist / antitheist / theological noncognitivist (words like "god" are gibberish / fiction to my ears).

What I have come up with is this: what you have happening in religion is literally a bunch of primates gathering together in a group on a regular basis, submitting together to an imaginary alpha, and -roughly speaking- discussing about what's good/bad/right/wrong/meaningful.  Of course, they inevitably play their social pecking order games as well, but at least it usually stops short of fighting for top dog, because that seat is permanently reserved for a permanent no show.  You can add more to this description if you want, but it is still the basic fundamental fact of what's happening, and everything else is elaborations upon that basic pattern, decorations, window dressing, and recreation.  And this basic minimum effort is extremely beneficial to groups that practice it, because it facilitates community building in ways that, for example, weekly drunken parties do not.

So, when you say "No magic, admit it is written by people 1000s of years ago", I say YES YES YES.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of religion is not believed, taught or practiced that way.  So those primates gather together, and get their brains scrambled by fairy tales told poorly by people who believe them as literal, instead of understanding the actual truth in them.  And of course they are taught in isolation, because the purveyors don't have the intellect to broaden the subject matter like Dr. Peterson does, and that cripples the ability for people to recognize the philosophical principles accurately and usefully.  They consequently miss the target, at least as often as not.  I would participate in a "church" community, if it wasn't for that profound abyss of nonsense, which all too often flows into bigotry.  I'm unwilling to waste my time in that space.  If there was a church where the pastor was someone as broad as Dr. Peterson, teaching a wide array of philosophy instead of just one particular and limited book, and in a way that rejected proselytizing magic, I would be there and pay my tithe with a smile.  But I'm not expecting miracles to fall into my lap.  So I had an idea...

So far I call it "the herd of cats", for lack of a better term.  The idea is simple: recognize that we non-churchgoers are failing to perform the minimum basic activity pattern of religion, recognize why, and work out an acceptable way to gather together in a group on a regular basis, and -roughly speaking- discuss what's good/bad/right/wrong/meaningful.  As for the imaginary alpha, we need to recognize that one of the reasons we DON'T do religion is refusal to swallow the whole magic man formula, or his all-too-convenient Earthly representatives, and we're not willing to have a leader.   That is something that needs to be specifically articulated: no leaders, no artificial loyalty, no dogma,   no purity testing, and no right ever for the group to impose upon the individual, because otherwise we'll just fuck back off into the isolation we came from.  I think the point has to be simple and made very clear: we're just here to try to get serious together with enough regularity to matter, so we can figure out the important shit, and make the important connections, that bind a real community into something powerful.  I think if there is one specific point that could screw it up, it would be that without an imposed narrative, people would be more prone to discuss diverse things that expose disagreement.  This has to be foreseen, and I suggest a simple policy to help mitigate it: No guilt or blame for people having "bad" opinions, and no banishment option other than for people actively and persistently breaking the simple minimum rules:

No leaders.  No artificial loyalty.  No dogma.  No purity testing.  No right ever for the group to impose upon the individual.  No punishment for wrongthink beyond people being free to disagree and make counter arguments.  Banishment only for persistent refusal to abide these simple rules (ie we must work out our differences voluntarily and without any pretense of force).  That, and try to show up, because it's good for everyone involved.

Maybe it's not enough structure for a bunch of the people out there.  Maybe that shouldn't stop those of us who don't want structure imposed from creating some good structure.

  Or something like that. /sOne of the better interview transcripts I‚Äôve read, thanks for posting.This is great advice, specifically identifying as yourself outside of a political framework. The political questions aren‚Äôt the important ones.**The Jordan B Peterson Center for Wisdom**
----

By freely sharing his masterful lectures, Dr. Peterson is introducing millions of people across generations to a diverse constellation of humanity's best collected wisdom, spanning from ancient mythology, to great thinkers like Jung, all the way to current scientific insights.  He does his humble best to bring together science, philosophy, history, political insight, sociology, psychology, mythology, religion and more.  By exposing and connecting the profound wealth and immediate relevance of great ideas from across subjects and time, he inspires people to embrace learning, to think more critically and independently; to become stronger and more integrous people, ready and able to dedicate themselves to doing effective good in the world; to stand strong and proud against the many kinds of bigotry and ideological possession that increasingly divide our world.  Beyond any petty momentary controversy, his outreach has far transcended the academy, engaging a humanity that hungers for meaningful enlightenment through the fruits of higher learning, and invigorating an emerging commitment to impeccably honest dialogue in all domains of society, as a more honest basic purpose for human affairs, that brings genuine meaning and worth to life in times when corruption, inequality, despair and destruction seem to increasingly become the norms of life.

Dr. Jordan B Peterson is a Canadian hero for the best reason: he guides people to find the resources to lift themselves up, not by commanding, but by strong and humble example.  He should be recognized as an inspiration to strength in knowledge, someone who's passion students and faculty alike can be inspired by.  I can't think of a more appropriate person after whom to name a new a new place for learning.

----

ps. Wisdom is a good purpose to keep in mind for why we struggle to learn, why it is worth doing.Everytime I heard Jordan say something along the lines of "Is there something stupid you're doing that you could just stop doing to make your life better" 
My mind immediately went to smoking weed.
I haven't quit, but I've really started to consider my priorities and now do it about once a week rather than once per day.It would be interesting to hear Dr. Peterson explore the relationship between the concepts of ownership and responsibility. Anyone know if he has addressed this anywhere?Ahhh, this article was by Sam Harris**on**, not Sam Harris(this space intentionally let blank).Cool, thanks for bringing that up, I didn't know about it before.  He actually has a BA in political science.  There goes so much more bogus criticism trying to dismiss him as an uninformed amateur on that subject.
I don't think it's a good critique at all.  I see Sam Harrison as talking past Dr. Peterson, missing the point entirely, and being unable to grasp the more fundamental assumptions and disagreements at play, that reasonably call to question practically everything Sam uses as fundamental to base his arguments upon.&gt; *but Harrison knows his stuff.*

Bullshit.  He has read just enough to take it as gospel and consider himself an expert for being able to parrot it.  But he doesn't know it, or anything other than it, well enough to know ***beyond*** it.  In contrast, I would say Dr. Peterson truly knows enough in enough other subjects, to see through things like postmodernist bullshit without having to waste decades of his life wallowing in it.

To exaggerate the idea here, imagine someone promoting young Earth creationism.  I assume there are a number of "serious" intellectuals publishing "serious" material on it, in "serious" journals from "serious" religious schools.  And if not young Earth creationism, then definitely many other forms of religious apologetics from many different religions.  I am sure you could find serious peer reviewed papers and well praised books, written by Catholics, Protestants, Buddhists, Muslims and Jews, any and/or all of which conflict with each other, in spite of each building coherently on vast bodies of established work within their own academic circles.

And for all that, nobody but the believers perceives any duty to have anything beyond a "shallow" grasp of all that material, in order to safely call it bullshit that is not worth wasting time on.

Now, postmodernism is certainly a serious school of philosophy, where young Earth creationism is widely laughed at and derided for making any pretensions to having anything to do with science.  But that doesn't mean there are not substantially well founded schools of thought that respectfully disagree with some large number of the foundational premises, and therefore reasonably decline to spend vast amounts of time wading through it's dubious body of literature, before they proceed to pursue other philosophical frameworks they find more coherent and realistic for reasons too numerous to list.

And so I conclude: Harrison is an amateur, unable to recognize a more profound level of disagreement than he is capable of holding himself.  As is often the case, Dr. Peterson reminds us of a good piece of advice: it's good to listen to others as if they might know something you don't.  Harrison needs that advice, on a meta level.&gt; *JP has amazing knowledge of human psychology but doesn‚Äôt have any expertise in politics or history so he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about and has no substance.*

Which is a pretty bold claim to make about a professor who actually began his academic career with a BA in political science.

u r so awsum, ever time u say that i can feel my iq gettin more an more biggered and biggered... Showing just how unconcerned with the truth they actually are.  JP isn't a messiah, he's just a bright man with the talent, dedication and humility to help others find out about the same great ideas that helped him make sense of the world.  The shit that gets flung at him because he dares to not swear utter fealty to the "correct" team is telling.  With any luck, this time I hope those of us who do care about the truth will not fall prey to becoming nothing more but an opposite tribe of idiots, and will simply follow the truth wherever we can lead with it, and be grateful.  And remember our manners: You're welcome :)Peterson is also likely weak on Young Earth Creation Theory, and it's too bad people can't spot the similarity with someone avoiding Postmodernism.&gt; *Peterson's reading of the postmodernists is shallow.*

And I ask, so what?  [When core authors of a school of thought admit they add in about 25% bullshit for nefarious reasons](https://youtu.be/jcTUihJS3KI), it becomes hard to fault anyone for avoiding their work, and indeed becomes tempting to fault them for buying into it.  I can tell you that body of literature has fallen pretty far down my reading list too.  But, I guess any angle of attack will do when you're desperate and out of arguments (not you of course, Harrison).

Well, more power to you if you can read that garbage and come back with reports, it's always good to know what our enemies are up to.  I just can't blame those without the stomach, not everyone is cut out for scouting every territory.  I'm finding it hard enough to read Gulag, but hey, at least the pain is that of enduring the truth, which in that case feels like it will crush your soul to ash before it sets you free.  Oh well, the phoenix rises from ashes, not mounds of deliberate bullshit, so I'll endure.&gt; *Derrida basically argues for transforming Marxism so it is unrecognizable - because if you can't recognize it, you can't fight it*

Ughhh, it's so gross, and not much disgusts me.  I struggle to imagine JP not knowing quite enough about that, and wonder if it's just not apparent because no strong postmodernists will debate him.

In any case, and in spite of generally not wanting to pick political sides, I can personally thank JP for prompting me to open my eyes about the evil that is communism / Marxism and its roots, collectivism.  Like so many, I too had never stumbled into that corner of history, and was open to the idea that communism / socialism tended to fail because capitalist powers fought aggressively and happened to win.  I wondered if we were just being greedy to not give them space, naively thinking that our markets simply resented the notion of not having free access to even the tiniest part of the globe.  I wondered if a government led economy might be less brutal that capitalism so often is, and if a democratic communism / socialism could be less corrupt.  I now understand how naive and uninformed all that was, and I'm left astonished that my public school never explained anything about the world's worst genocides in all history, and the plain evil behind them.  And now I know and respect why the West has fought so relentlessly against communism, even if our execution is often corrupt and unjust in its own ways, still it must be done.

What scares me most about all those groups you mention, is that they are inevitable and seemingly justified responses to our current state of near total corruption having lead to near total inequality.  We are going to see people react because they need to, because the economy is falling apart around them, leaving their lives not functionable.  Of course it's the wrong response to go to collectivism / communism, but people don't recognize the harder path of responsibility, and that is only made all the worse when there actually are external actors to blame, making it that much harder to not let ourselves off the hook for our own part in the failures.  People don't want to know that everything matters, and everything they already didn't do well enough mattered and has accumulated into the monster we face today.

JP points out that the left doesn't take inequality seriously enough, because they don't realize it transcends all politics and social mechanisms tried so far.  He points out the right don't care enough, and tent to assume that the spoils went to the right places, which while partially true, is also more fatally wrong in the end.  And if it is excessive inequality that calls forth the mayhem hysterical frenzy of collectivism, then both sides are utterly failing to recognize the most profound danger.

I still think the answer is simple, though practically nobody is willing to name it: we need strictly enforced maximum wealth and income laws.  You can't get pathological inequality if the winners lose the spoils and go to jail for violating their sacred responsibility as our most powerful leaders, to manage the world's business not ***too*** selfishly that it tears the world apart.  If we set nice high limits, allowing people to get millionaire rich, but not allowing them to snowball that into billionaire rich, we might be able to have freer markets than ever, because the people leading them would not have unlimited incentive to get rich quick, and that would make redundant a very large portion of the regulations we currently need in our futile attempts to keep the markets fair.  Finally, I suggest that violators face forfeiture which goes 100% to charity, not taxes, or else the government will have too much incentive to be corrupt chasing those confiscations.  The point is not to take wealth back for redistribution like taxation systems do, it is to force people to make less selfish decisions in the first place, so they don't take too much in the first place.Thanks, and please know it's mutual :)  I have to say the quality of discourse in this forum is well above par, which is a pleasure to participate in, worth the effort to foster, unlike many other forums I've spent time in.  I think being gathered under the ethic of JP is a pretty good organizing principle, a good call to higher integrity.  And it's really good to feel an honest excitement in the air for deeper thinking, where people finally recognize it's necessary AND rewarding.&gt; *But he wants the State to regulate the most intimate decisions made between 2 consenting adults?*

I think you've completely misunderstood the point here.  The point isn't for the state to impose rules on sex, it is that when individuals are reckless with sex, the consequences are subsequently used to justify tyrannical state intervention.  The solution is for individuals to not be so reckless with sex, eg women need to stop having single-parent kids.

At least that's how I read it.  Curious to hear the chain of thought explained in detail instead of a tweet.

I get it that casual and reckless are not quite the same thing, but casually flying a large airliner would be reckless, because it's serious business, too serious to take casually.  That's the connection I intended, given that JP thinks sex is far more serious than people often treat it, and so doing it casually is reckless and leads to bad consequences.  Otherwise it wouldn't matter, people could be as casual with sex as they can be with talking about the weather.

And yeah, twitter.... I kind of loath its ADD influence on our world.  People shouldn't take communicating so casually as to cramp themselves into 120 characters ;)Go to any other English speaking country.  Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK.  Or if not them, try other countries in Europe.  Your English is obviously good, and that's not a small factor when it comes to having access to high level literature from all over the world.To be clear, I'm sorry that English ended up being the world's most popular language, and your native Hindi gets ignored.  But don't let that distract from the advantage it gives you to be so natively fluent in English, and the opportunity that gives you in majority English speaking parts of the world.

And while I have your attention, please let me share a sincere piece of my bleeding heart for you.  Thank you for existing.  Thank you for asking.  Thank you for thinking.  Thank you for trying.  Please don't leave us, you are one of the smaller number of people capable of seeing, actually imagining bigger pictures of how things could be, and maybe could be better.  We need you.  We love you.  You are part of what makes or breaks the survival of our species on this planet.  It doesn't matter how little you manage to help, anything is a step, no matter how small, away from the real thing that is hell on this planet here and now.  I know you can carry a load, and anything you can bear matters.

Again, love from across the oceans.  Be strong if you possibly can.Missed the vice episode at first. Watching the unedited version on FB. The guy is almost as bad as Kathy Newman when it comes to putting words in his mouth. The bit at the end where JP talks about the outrage mob activism is interesting. I think if the meToo movement starts a conversation that leads to a thoughtful discussion about policy it is a plus but if , as most cooperate policies  are, reactionary band-aids then it may result in negative outcomes. I am not as in touch with the culture as BW and JP but it sounds like this may be the case.

I also watched his follow up at the UBC free speech talk. They used 8 minutes of a two hour interview and then later release a 15min clip. I wish I had that kind of access. Could you imagine sitting down for a 1 on 1 with JP and not having anything worth while to report? What a wasted opportunity. 

As others have said, Bret and his wife are on point and I appreciate attention this is getting.

The issue may perhaps be how your framing it: ‚Äúpicking up steam,‚Äù‚Äù crash and burn,‚Äù‚Äù spinning plates.‚Äù

The future for you seems to be about speed, kind of a ‚Äúbigger, better, faster, more‚Äù mentality. 

Better for me means that I‚Äôm accumulating wealth in the form of relationships, knowledge, skills, health and yes, resources. I‚Äôm looking to become more effective so I can produce better results with less effort. The better it gets for me, the less I‚Äôm worried about the future. 

That doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt experience setbacks, but that I‚Äôm more capable if dealing with the inevitable setbacks that do come. My gut response is that the deeper part of our brains have no machinery in place to understand -to fundamentally conceive of- the concept of infertile, perhaps other than something truly ancient like people being very old and therefore not desirable.  So I don't think the reproductive drive is ever not part of our deeper behavior with regards to sexual partners.&gt; *It's a bombardment of stimulus that we are not evolved to handle.*

God, you'd think it just sneaks out of the internet wire/fiber, and suddenly springs upon you with a knife.

You might want to take some responsibility for clicking there mate, it's not a bombardment, it's a person bombarding themselves.

I think it's important to remember that a lot of the porn negativity seen in places like this is a consequence of people (especially younger people without enough experience) letting themselves get trapped into impulsive behavior, so badly that they blame the external stimulus instead of themselves for what they are doing.  To be fair, porn is a potent distillate, and I can see how many people are not well equipped to not lose their heads, but we need to keep clear about the fact that it's still them fucking up, not porn "making them".&gt; *What do you think that price is exactly?*

There is no "exactly", it varies for every person, because porn itself is not the issue.  The "price" for some people is the insane behavior they exhibit, and that is obviously a function of the person, not the porn.  While it's easy to blame the porn, I have to point out that it's the person behind the screen that's doing the clicking, and I think we need to consider a little more deeply why they would go so insane over some pixels on a screen in the first place.

An easily overlooked example that illustrates my point is written fiction porn.  No pictures at all, just pure imagination in the mind of the reader.  It actually takes effort to find and read and imagine.  Why would a person be inclined to invest that effort in the first place?  I think we need to ask why they made the time for that activity in particular, why were they interested in that instead of anything else?  There are a lot of things to read on the internet, in case you hadn't noticed.

The answer is rather darker than "porn=dopamine addiction", which is the common cop out you'll hear sung all too often.  Coke doesn't jump out of some dealers pocket, onto a table, roll up a $20 bill and then shove itself into your nose either.  Sorry, but people do porn, not porn do people.

We have an epidemic alright, ***an epidemic of people being willing to do porn to excess.***

***Why*** they are willing is a complex question, and I would say we need to look to far more complex and larger pictures than merely "porn is addictive".  How about, in times of plenty, when there ***seem to be*** no dragons to slay, all people can think about is fucking, at which point they are willing to spend time on porn.  I would hazard to guess that if they had anything actually vividly important in their coddled little modern lives, they would be off doing that instead.  And if you say "but they do have important things", then I ask why the hell they obviously can't see that for themselves?  What empty mush have their heads been filled with, that they are wandering like zombies, able to be caught by pictures flashing on a screen?  Get a grip.

We need to question our assumptions, when the most spoiled people in all of human history can sit here and claim that it wasn't their own fucking fault that they sat there looking at a screen for 8 hours and wanking, apparently day after day.  Sorry, but what went wrong wasn't the stuff on the screen.

I think the reason we're chatting in a forum named after a grumpy middle aged professor of psychology, is because we all know much bigger things are wrong, and appreciate him for helping articulate something about that ***crisis.***  Porn is a symptom, just like cocaine.  The real diseases are much harder to name.I think we just keep exercising our ability to see it from different perspectives. Like looking at one of those geometric pictures that has multiple interpretations. Magic eyes or something. If you look at it long enough, you can begin to instantly change perspectives when you see a new one.

Because you aren‚Äôt entirely wrong either: ‚Äúto whom much is given, much will be required.‚Äù As you climb your chosen competence hierarchy by taking on more responsibility, well, that means you have more responsibility. 

Dr. Peterson has mentioned what it‚Äôs like for him right now. He said some where that it‚Äôs like surfing a 100ft wave. At the same time however he‚Äôs having the greatest public impact of his life. Living on that edge has got to be exhilarating as well as exhausting. I like the analogy. Keep your oil changed, your breaks checked, gas in the tank, and properly inflate your tires. Pay your license and insurance, and drive safely. This is pretty sad. Her salient points are smothered by her gender identity framework. The video (which I've seen before) begins with a guy who describes compulsively clicking his phone ten times "because it feels good when you get a response".  He might want to take some fucking responsibility for himself, instead of blaming his compulsive behavior on getting responses.  Maybe he needs to ask himself why he's so lonely, and why his life is so empty of meaning so compelling that sitting there compulsively clicking a blinking lightbox is the best he can muster.

I note, when he says "we've all done it before", that I have not.  He doesn't get off his own hook that easy.I never said a dopamine response is nothing to joke about, and I never said I was perfect.  Fuck, I'm a smoker.

My point is that just like cocaine doesn't jump off the bloody table, neither does porn force you to click and wank.

I'm tired of people acting like helpless babies, as though something else controls them.  It's a cop out.  Maybe if we're talking about kids, then I don't expect them to know any better.  But by the time you're hanging around in this forum, the answer becomes NOT SO FAST BUCKO.I've been thinking really hard about the last few sections of the chapter, from "What You Want and What You See" onward.  For years now, there have been a few pipe-dream-y domains I have aspired in, but just haven't worked out.  I have tortured myself for a) not trying hard enough, or b) just not letting go when it would probably make my and my family's lives better to do so.  The problem is, this conflicts directly against the dictum to follow Meaning, because those domains were incredibly meaningful to me at certain times, but I had to be all-in on the game just to get anywhere near the intensely meaningful experiences (flow state, etc).


So I continue to hem and haw about them, years later.  I even find myself resenting my family for limiting me when I chose to have them.  I have read and re-read this chapter several times and seriously pondered the idea of sacrificing what you most love if you truly ask yourself, *deep down*, what would make your life *better* instead of what you desire *today*.  This has been a maddening exercise and I still don't really know what is the right answer.


Jim Carrey talks about how his dad gave up his artistic dream for an accounting job to provide for his family.  Later, when his dad lost that job, he was broken and bitter for failing at something he gave up his dream for.  Carrey says that the lesson is clear: follow your dream, no matter what, because it is far better to nobly fail at the thing you love than to bitterly fail at the thing you hate.


There is also something Jung said: "Nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment and especially on their children than the unlived life of the parent."  Many people use this to support the "follow your dreams" view, but I suspect it is often taken out of context.  It may partially mean that, but it may have more to do with your complexes and shadow that you have failed to examine.


I have ruminated on these ideas for years.  Was Carrey's dad just immature and resentful?  Did he have a very narrow view of what was truly meaningful and good?  Is Carrey's philosophy of life too good to be true, Joseph Campbell "follow-your-bliss" and Oprah naivete?  Sure, it worked out for *Jim*, but not all of us can follow that path.


Gregg Hurwitz said in his interview with JBP that Hollywood is full of people who came out with big dreams and grow old while refusing to give up and move on to something more gratifying.



Anyway, thoughts?  Have any of you gone through this meditation and really figured out what to do with your pipe dream?Must be selling well, if they're sinking this kinda money into ads on the tube.You are welcome. Here‚Äôs another little exercise that may help. Seeing it as two sides of the same coin is helpful, but you are still looking at only one side at a time. However, if you can look at it as a continuum, you can begin judging the catastrophic thoughts. As in, ‚Äúwas that more or less negative than how I was thinking yesterday?‚Äù 

There is a book by Dr. Martin Seilgman, Learned Optimism, that I‚Äôd recommend you read. It‚Äôs the science, tools and techniques to help you shift your thinking to a more optimistic mode. As a consultant also, I‚Äôd love to hear an example or two of where you‚Äôd feel you‚Äôd shoot yourself in the foot by telling the truth before I respond specifically.

In general I‚Äôm committed to always act in the client‚Äôs best interests. Especially when it diverges from mine. Trust is the foundation of any long term relationship, and I‚Äôm in this for the long run. There are quite a few personal anecdotes that I had never heard before.This talk is excellent!  I really want to read Cal Newport's books now.


I can say that I actually have followed the path he prescribes and found my way to some truly amazing Deep Work experiences.  However, the sheer brutality of the political knife fights required to get there did not justify the goodness of the meaning experienced once there.  I quit when I experienced what I would call the spirit of Cain beginning to seize me.  My then-girlfriend pointed out that I was often "staring through my eyebrows" like Pyle in *Full Metal Jacket.*


This has cast me into serious doubt and confusion.  I really don't know what to value or what to aim at.  It's not just that I got knocked down and I just need to dust myself off and get back in the ring.  It's that I came face to face with Satan, and got nearly incinerated.  I have kids now and I can't risk that kind of madness and resentment.


So what now?  Does Cal Newport adequately address the not-so-nice fact that going after Deep Work isn't only up to your persistence, focus, and dedication?  What about the realities of child rearing?  It is a life of *constant* distraction and exhaustion.  Is Deep Work only for the chosen few?


As for the shy canadian young man who decided to humbly take a job at a restaurant and work his way up from there- does he have a shot at deep work?  If not, is he seeking some different kind of meaning?  Are our efforts arguably misplaced by placing them toward humbler jobs like that, when we could be working toward a deep work situation?Is that Riker? Interesting, I read that ‚Äúno book‚Äù comment as a comment on agency. As in, ‚Äúno book is going to change your life, that responsibility is up to you.‚ÄùI‚Äôll give you that. A great example of why it‚Äôs important to be precise with our speech.the audiobook version up on audible is very good quality.  a very sardonic and expressive british narrator recording from circa 1990.  tons of sarcasm and irony, read in a very charming british style.  oh, and horrifying beyond all reason.Mixing it up with lefties is much more dramatic. Drama selling more than calm debate is what ruined news in the first place. Here is the other interview he did with Peterson. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFgVVMqto

Tucker asks people a question and then they spin it and avoid answering. He doesn't allow them to push their spin and filibuster the time away to spread their bullshit. He's respectful when people actually answer his questions rather than ignoring them to push their agenda. [The best example of that is the Kurt Eichenwald interview....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ophbx1iaF8)He doesn't seem the least bit nervous here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMrFgVVMqtoYou obviously didn't watch the Bill Nye interview. 

‚ÄúWe in the science community are looking for information why climate change deniers, or extreme skeptics, do not accept the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change.‚Äù He then said that question of whether humans are causing climate change is ‚Äúnot an open question, it‚Äôs a settled question.‚Äù

So Tucker asked him ‚ÄúTo what degree is climate change caused by human activity? . . . Is it 100 percent, is it 74.3 percent? If it‚Äôs settled science, please tell us to what degree human activity is responsible.‚Äù

Rather than answer that question or even admit he didn't know the answer Nye went off the rails. He then  tells Carlson another Ice Age ‚Äúain‚Äôt gonna happen because of you and me.‚Äù 

Um, yay!

He then switched over to personal attacks of Carlson. So yea, he was acting like a bullshit artist. I managed to get around to Chapter 3 in his book, I've never read such a succinct description of the cold Peace River country. Thank you for the tip off! Lost me at the second sentence: ‚Äú... a quick Google search will reveal that he even spoke at Harvard once.‚Äù 

If the author was a legitimate journalist, he/she would have learned that Dr. Peterson taught at Harvard for five years. That is good. Can you provide a link to the original?what is Chapo Traphauser?I agree. Daddy's ideas need to be discussed in proper form. For he is Daddy.Feel I made a valid point.  Daddy Peterson no likey?You are in bonkersville my dudeWell I remember the great Sargon of Akkad followers teaching me that so... CHivalryVery interesting findings, perhaps not surprising to me.

I think LSD is generally an enhancer rather than an "intoxicant" or "impairment".  Depending on not taking too large a dose, which I suspect moves past "harmony" and "turning up the dial", into just being overwhelmed / scrambled.  In the analogy of the article, too many notes to possibly juggle into anything but a cacophony.  In practical terms, you probably want to start with about 50 micrograms (1/2 square), and bump up carefully from there.&gt; *his preoccupation on this shadowy cabal*

I think this is a misinterpretation, and getting stuck on this point is a bad distraction from the real message about psychology.

[This video is exactly on point.](https://youtu.be/a4gMAFtKCg8)

We have to throw off the particular groups and labels here (they are only proxies), and recognize he's trying to expose psychological mechanisms, regardless of what particular people and/or ideologies trigger them.  Germany, Russia, Japan and China all ended in genocide, because there's a huge overlap in the underlying psychological mechanisms that made people act, even though the "politics" was ostensibly the "opposite", ie "fascism" vs. "communism".

And it bears our attention that he ultimately doesn't care about the people spreading these ideas, it's the ideas he's fighting, because they lead individuals of our species to behavior that is toxic and eventually even murderous.  Aside from attacking their behavior and statements, I'm sure about the only negative thing we're likely to hear about these "postmodernist / cultural Marxist / feminist" types is a bewildered hint that even though we know many of them are highly intelligent people, it still makes one wonder in disbelief at how stupid some of them must be in order to support those positions. (ie baffled facepalm)

Recognizing that Peterson's core point is psychology, is central to seeing through and hopefully mitigating the us vs. them dynamic, because it clarifies that his underlying purpose isn't to attack various groups he doesn't like.  It is also important because he gets a lot of flack for speaking on politics and philosophy, on the basis he's not an expert in those fields, and is therefore unqualified to talk.  The point is, he's trying to make a psychological point, and draw from philosophy and politics to the best of his ability in order to show real-world examples.  If he didn't do this, he would be ridiculed for unfounded speculation.  When he does it, he gets attacked as thought any lack of political / philosophical accuracy somehow invalidates his ***psychological*** argument.  Meanwhile, nobody seems to have the either the presence of mind or the balls to actually show why the ***approximate*** political and philosophical connections he makes lead anywhere other than the terrible psychology he's pointing at, and which is his field of expertise.

Finally, on the point of radical left vs. right, and supporting either side, I think we need to remember that war has very little to do with him.  It existed long before he entered the stage, and he did exactly nothing to deserve being "literally Hitler"ed, that was pure extreme left insanity from start to finish.  And once the extreme left declared him literally Hitler, firing the first shot, their long established enemies opened fire from the other side of the battle field, continuing the war, and deciding they must like Peterson since he's obviously doesn't like their long sworn enemies.  Exactly NONE of this is Peterson's fault, and blaming him because one horrible side or another might latch onto and abuse his ideas, promotes a kind of Heckler's Veto, where he's not supposed to talk any more, because some bunch of horrible people are making stupid noises.  By calling Dr. Peterson "a gateway to the radical right", all you're doing is perpetuating a "shut the hell up or we'll blame you for someone else's crimes."  This entire process must be exposed, explained and very explicitly rejected on principle, because the alternative is anathema to our core principles of justice.&gt; *‚Äúnot calling for the slaughter of white people‚Äö* ***at least for now*** *‚Äù*
----

That's what.



&gt; *brutality and theft breeds brutality and theft.*

Name the crimes of the white farmers alive today.

People who hold people responsible for the crimes of their ancestors are barbaric.

If there is an argument to be made about undoing injustice of the past, that still should not entail complete confiscation, because the people alive today are innocent.  Even if confiscation without compensation is justified, then the people alive today should still be left with enough land to make livings for themselves, equal to anyone else.

circling back- dude, this is some of the best stuff (aside from Peterson) that I have ever read, ever.  Thank you thank you thank you for the recommend.  Just hearing this stuff read out loud (audiobook) is giving peace to my soul.


I'm currently reading Deep Work first, because I really want to understand the phenomenon of those experiences and their significance in life (Newport does a similar thing to Peterson, demonstrating this at many levels: Neurologically, Philosophically, and finally Psychologically).  I do this because I have experienced this in my artistic passion as well as in my work, and I have not let go of the idea that I must have this in my life.


Next, on to So Good They Can't Ignore you.I suggest we could have it both ways.  The problem isn't about some people being rich, it is about an extreme few people having so much money that they control and break the markets, they are dangerously rich.  The consequence is that everyone else stands a greatly reduced chance to compete and get even moderately rich, because the dangerously rich control the entire market already.  It's like having a million unarmed people on bicycles compete against a large tank; no matter how many of them try, they all die, and the tank can effectively drive on the pile of corpses and never be stopped.  Worse, what actually happens is more like having a bunch of tanks doing battle over top of all the people on bicycles, rampaging around against each other, crushing any people who happen to be in their path.

My suggestion is a maximum income and wealth law.  Max wealth = $2M per year old.  Max income = $2M a year.  If you allow yourself to make any more than that, you go to jail, and the whole year's income goes to charity.  This lets people get quite rich, but prevents their money=power from snowballing out of control until they become billionaires who nobody can stop, even able to buy out governments.  It would mean if you want to get rich, you have to keep making money, there is no way to quickly skim off a fortune and keep it.  It means you would be legally obligated to figure out how to make slightly less greedy decisions; pay your workers and suppliers more, charge less, or even take time off to make room for other people in the market.  Whatever it takes, if you're in danger of going over $2M a year, then you have the power NOT TO, and we demand you use that power to curb yourself because nobody else can.

The great upside to this would be freeing up the market.  Right now we have a huge number of laws / regulations that exist primarily to prevent people from doing horrible things, and they want to do those horrible things because when they get away with it (and they most often do), they get to keep all the profits.  Get rich quick by any means.  If making too much loses your profits and sends you to jail, then you won't have any incentive to bend the rules, find loop holes, or cheat.  And that means we don't need as many regulations.oh golly gee willikers.&gt; It could be worked if they choose competent Farmers. 

yeah, competent white farmers. &gt; but we should also recognise that we may need to unite along some common boundary (it may not be purely racial) to survive among groups that are united against us. 

it must be racial. trying to make fake excuses and justifications is what conservatives do, and they already lost.&gt; *Why strive if there's a limit?*

Get a fucking grip bucko, your own IQ is the first limit, then physics is a real bitch, and there's an infinite number of other limitations beyond that.  Are you going to quit, not bother striving because there are limits?  Don't be an idiot.

&gt; *You really have no idea what the unintended consequences of artificially shackling human potential can do.*

OK then, what are the unintended consequences of allowing about 0.01% of the population to utterly prevent about 99% of the rest from ever entering the market, because there's not a hope in fucking hell of competing against one of the three multinational corporations that already control that market, ***because they already bought out our entire fucking government 30 years ago and wrote themselves a monopoly into law?***

Or do you think that's natural, but putting a limit on wealth and income that cannot affect more than about 0.1% of the population isn't?

I'll tell you what: if making $2M a year isn't enough for you, if you really think you're so fucking special you deserve more, then fuck off you greedy cunt, and leave this market to everyone else.  I'm willing to risk the chance that by preventing the other 90% of the ultra rich from scamming us some way we can't even understand, and by allowing millions of other people to enter the market and do great things, because there is space in the market for them, that we will more than compensate for the loss of your narcissistic ass.





Even though you'll never get anywhere near it, just knowing a limit exists makes you so depressed you quit.

And you're so utterly blind you have no clue whatsoever why we need to prevent billionaires from existing.

And then, even though the entire point of my posts was to support a FREE market, instead of one totally controlled by about 0.01% of the population, you have the gall to call me a Marxist.

You are one seriously fucked up piece of shit idiot.there is no possible way seizing land from whites and giving it to blacks "could be worked". the average zimbabwe resident is mentally retarded and there are so few capable ones that they cannot possibly sustain the rest. this is why there isn't a single successful black country.the boers are white.I totally read this in Ben Shapiro‚Äôs voice.Sorry, I don't know who you're quoting here, and I don't follow why.  Clarification?they're competent because they're white because race is real, iq is real, and iq is tied to race.&gt; Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group have an average IQ of 115-120

google's first answer is "The average IQ of Ashkenazi Jews is 107 to 115" and that number is probably inflated. ashkenazi jews are hardly smarter than the average white that they share genes with. it's also so cute that when you ask jews why they're so intelligent, their answer is "because whites persecuted us!"you don't have to understand the science, just know that affirmative action laws in the united states prioritize blacks over white students in a racially discriminatory way, and white people are probably going to keep bringing up these uncomfortable truths until the government stops racially discriminating against white people.  

if all you want to do is say "everyone is equal" go ahead and say it but it's not okay to mistreat white people because of anti-science views.the alternative is to just accept the wage gap and the biological reasons for it.lmao this fool deleted his account.google doc or microsoft word. or a paper and pen. just dedicate time to writing what you can either about your past, your present or your future. 
write about the future you want and the future you want to avoid
write about your present faults and virtues
write about your past traumas and successes.you know what's even better? driving a nice car.&gt; difference in drug response&gt;&gt;genetic difference between races are real&gt;&gt;my racism is actually "inconvenient" science.

here's the medical school context: http://www.aboutthemcat.org/images/medical-school/medical-school-acceptance-rates-2013.png  

maybe stop being so hostile and aggressive towards white people if you don't want them to complain?really? you think affirmative action has nothing to do with the discussion of genetics and intelligence? are you even serious? what race are you?&gt; (i.e. It's just as Peterson says. Lefties would prefer it if everyone has an equal genetic playing field -they don't-, conservatives will want to play it off as either not mattering as long as you work hard -there are barriers in place which means that working hard isn't enough- and the alt-right will try to use it justify racism and promoting an enthno-state.)

it's more like leftists want racial discrimination (affirmative action), conservatives are too afraid of being called racist to do anything, and the alt right are the only ones fixing the problem (getting trump elected and challenging AA in the courts). &gt; "stupid blacks are stealing my spot"

just try to debunk this statement.wow, this was some seriously bad police work.yes, he was the right wing alternative to the republican establishment that was betraying white people. excuse me bucko? what kind of car do you drive?what the buck do you mean "probably"? it either is or it isn't.&gt; It is true. What force do you think leveled the planefield to the level it is today? It was not a long time ago that racist laws where commonplace. 

what is the level today? because blacks are still failing academically (highest first year college dropout rate after all the help!), still are a burden economically because of their welfare use, and commit a high level of violent crime.  

after 40 years, blacks have failed to make anything of the advantages they've been given because it's just not in them. it's a waste of resources to keep giving them preferential treatment because they will literally never get their shit together. &gt; If you go into detail in that material, you will find major flaws. Mostly correlational statistics that are definitely not enough to base an argument on. Statistics on race has has so many issues I don't even know where to start. Wow blacks in the US commit more crime? What a surprise, no one knew that. Maybe they should try to figure out why rather than attribute it to something as stupid as skin color. 

it's not skin color, it's IQ. american blacks have an average IQ of 85, have trouble thinking about the consequences of their actions, and thus commit more crime.  

now, why don't you tell me "why" blacks commit more crime. i'm going to predict you blame white people.&gt;Classic rasism is a very probably culprit there, it takes many many generations to recover from such a blow.   

there it is.

Save your concern for people who aren't deliberately hurting themselves while hurting others.

&gt; *I actually heard that this person was arrested soon afterward too.*

Thank goodness.  I'm sick of these shits getting away with breaking the law with impunity most of the time, as thought it's perfectly OK for them to dictate their whims on everyone else by force.  The next step is for university policy to fine and/or expel them for it, as well including an agreement to be responsible for reimbursing the cost of any security, damages and the cost of the venue, should they be convicted of illegal activity in the course of disrupting scheduled events.  And if you don't like it, go to school somewhere else.  Sadly, the admins are  mostly all fucking SJW happy themselves (totalitarian systems are a bureaucrat's gravy train after all), and the cops usually aren't going to show up unless called in by university admin.

It does not. The two programs are not the same.You are welcome - and good luck!Suicide rates, prison rates, and opiate addiction rates suggest differently. In that case then I am assuming the interview will be either pre-recorded or via satellite. Not a one in San Francisco.Glass half empty.

This world was built on countless generations of the most profound love, commitment and cooperation between men and women, people who joined their lives together and faced down and conquered unfathomable adversity, raising families and creating the future of humanity.  When you describe history as "oppression", you ignore what is and was always the only worth in life, the things that people spent their lives to create, and focus on the filth they overcame ***at the most terrible costs.***

How dare you spit on their honor, their value, their life's works in this way.

Jordan Peterson is exactly correct to call the oppression focus a reprehensible rewrite of history.

Yes, there IS oppression, indeed of everyone by everyone, including mothers repressing their children.  My own mother was forced to wear mittens to bed at night, to prevent her from masturbating.  ***BY HER MOTHER.  HER FATHER WOULD NEVER SUPPORT SUCH OPPRESSION, BUT NEITHER WOULD HE OPPRESS HIS WIFE'S DECISIONS.***

If you trace back through history and the notion that people could own each other, you're looking back at a gruesome picture where very extremely few people were anything like free, and everyone in society was essentially owned and/or controlled by someone else.  Peasants of both sexes lived on the land of rich people, and grew their crops.  Factory workers of both sexes were abused, beaten, intimidated and stolen from.  Governments have terribly abused people of both genders through the ages, but saved the most deadly and brutal torture for men: war.

Thinking you can draw a line through history and call one half victims and the other half oppressors, ***IS SHEER MADNESS.***

And by what sex they were, no less!  This is insanity compounded.  The ultimate sexism, laid atop the ultimate myopia.

Clear your mind of this filth, and learn to recognize the greater love that is humanity's greatest strength and only hope. A great bunch of thoughts, glad you shared them.  I have reasons why I think your points are off, but I'll start with the most important question you asked, with an answer that should be understood from the start here:

&gt; *Why should he be held in such high regard compared to your average psychology professor?*

His absolute, impeccable honesty.

Beyond that, his words are exactly "because what the hell do I know anyways?"

Which cuts to the very heart of the matter here, in ways I don't think you've noticed.

So, Jung.  Not science you say.  Sure, and neither is most of philosophy.  Nor Shakespeare.  And not being science doesn't make any of them less insightful, useful and often true.

More importantly, recognize that we do not understand how the brain works, FULL STOP.  Sure, we're tinkering with the components, noticing how they connect, and even scanning out kinds of "heat maps" of where things are more and less active.  But that still says exactly and completely NOTHING about how the brain actually handles information, or what any of it means.  It's roughly like studying basic electronics, so you know what transistors are, and you use an IR camera to watch what parts of a computer get hot while different programs are running.  But you still know exactly ZERO about information encoding, math and programming.  Which means you know practically nothing about what's actually happening in the computer, and likewise the brain.

Now, faced with such intractably complex systems as the brain, where science is barely able to scratch the surface, why wouldn't Jung's careful analogies be as valuable as any other source of insight?  As it stands, Dr. Peterson actively does whatever he can to test the ideas against any available science he can, because if there are detectable factual errors, they need to be exposed.

And remember, what the hell do we know anyways?  These problems are arguably so complex they will likely remain far outside the capacity of any human to properly understand.  We must try, and we must use science to the best of our ability, but recognizing the immensity of the problems at hand, we also ***ought to*** accept insight in whatever poetic forms we can create it.  Which leads me to...

... the is-ought problem, a conjecture of philosophy that cannot possibly have a definitive answer, surely at least while our species is in its infancy of understanding the natural facts of the world.  So ***some people*** suggest that knowing what ***is*** cannot inform us what we ***ought*** to do.  Other people vehemently and credibly disagree.  So let's not go calling it the sister of the theory of evolution, and shouting "fallacy!" at everyone who thinks differently.  There are lots of people who think, including myself, that science frequently informs our morality, and I celebrate that fact.  Understanding the animal nature of our own species, especially scientifically, is central to advancing our morality / ethics, because it allows us to not abuse the animal and to refine what ability to choose we actually have.  This is no different than how scientifically understanding other animals has advanced animal ethics, as we better understand their value, and their suffering at our ignorant abuse.  This applies to ourselves, and so better understanding nature is wholly central to what we ought to do.

Lobsters.  Hierarchy.  Nature.  ***"humans ought to accept their own hierarchies."***  The entire point is not that we should accept any particular hierarchy, but that our species cannot NOT create hierarchies, whether we like them, hate them, join them of fight them, we still ***DO*** them because that is a biological fact of our animal behavior, and the word "accept" is utterly irrelevant to the point.  We don't "accept" having bones, and we don't "accept" doing hierarchies.  And that is Dr. Peterson's point.

And so finally, Peterson, having spent every ounce of effort a man could possibly afford, and a heroic amount by any standards, has come to his own best estimate of what's going on, and where it leads, and why.  Again this is an incredibly complex system.  What actually happened: we saw millions of babbling monkeys; digesting and misunderstanding a particular set of (dated) speculations from another monkey called Marx; running those garbled ideas through their intractably complex psychology, a mix of instincts and whatever else that we do not yet understand; and then repeatedly shitting out vast systems of mass murder and totalitarian control of staggeringly evil dimensions.  Peterson has looked at that entire whirlwind of chaos for decades, doing everything he could to understand, scientifically and factually found, and intuit what he could about it.  In the end, he thinks the "murderous left" is headed down the same road, ultimately for more reasons that he could likely ever explain.  How exactly do we come to know things, or hold conclusions about infinitely complex subjects?

If you have different opinions about why the "murderous left" is or isn't hidebound for hell on earth all over again, then by all means share them.  I suggest Dr. Peterson sets a high bar for how well founded a person's opinions can be, and I hope you take your own position seriously too.

And what the hell do we know anyways?

I don't hold Dr. Peterson as an authority, because I don't grant anyone that fallaciously-claimed status.  He's got a lot of big ideas, he shares them with amazing articulation and impeccable honesty, and he knows better than most that he's a fool in a sea of fools, staring into depths of complexity so deep that we're lucky to look into that fire and survive.  I dig that, because that's how I roll too, and I learn from what he's worked so hard to share.  That's all.Tucker Carlson.  I think we need to grant people credit for successfully redeeming themselves from being awful (thinking back to John Stewart ending Cross Fire).

I think Tucker is doing great work here, no reservations.

I wouldn't care if was on Fox, MSN, CNN, RT or Al Jazeera.

This is incredibly important work, that deserves the respect of every person capable of understanding it.Which book?First, let me say thank you for engaging a civil discussion here, in spite of the disagreements we have.

&gt; *If that‚Äôs not oppression what is it???*

Let me be extremely clear: I never once said or implied that it wasn't oppression.  It most absolutely was and is.  And so what of it?  Everyone was oppressed by someone else, in ugly ways, both in public and private life (to the extent they enjoyed a private life at all, that being hard under severe oppression).

When everyone has been severely oppressed, it's insane to draw a line down the middle based on sex differences, as though that was a causative factor, and therefore the men were evil while the women were all innocent victims.

Which brings us right back to your original question:

&gt; *please explain how he can completely deny the historical oppression of women?*

He doesn't, never has done, never would and I'm sure never will deny the oppression of women.  What he denies is that the oppression of women matters any more than the oppression of everyone else, and divides the world into the evil patriarchy versus the victims.

You're making a mistake here.  Dr. Peterson sees this a different way than you do.  That doesn't mean he's denying the problems, or that they are horrible.  It just means he refuses to pretend that a world full of intractably complex problems can be broken along one line, one dimension, that divides the world neatly in half.

two films, both banned in China:
"To Live", made in 1994

But as JBP very appropriately points out- if a subject simply does not interest you at all, you just can't do that and expect to succeed in that domain.  So it gets complicated and nuanced, when that on which you focus must also intersect with that which has your interest.


Am I wrong?Preface: I'm going to be sloppy here, because I don't have a hundred hours needed to answer the difference in our impressions about what happened with Stuart vs. CrossFire with deep precision.

My impression at the time: Stuart was criticizing Crossfire because ***at that time*** it was being very divisive, a real early precursor to the divisiveness we see today in politics.  Stuart was being honest, and for that, he did actually destroy CrossFire, they were shut down immediately after, I ***think*** because everyone else recognized the truth in what he said at the time.

My instinct is that your accusation of Stuart being a demagogue is actually a revision of the history of what existed that actual moment in time.  If anyone did the same thing today, I would wholly agree, they would be the demagogue, some kind of SJW and negligent for their lack of actually making an argument.  But at the time, Stuart was calling out a trend in the MSM's pernicious agenda, of dividing us (to conquer).  He wasn't just bullshitting when his most profound appeal was "you're ***hurting*** us."  It was a difficult recognition that that was true at that moment in time, that Crossfire was actually ***hurting us*** by turning profound debates into shallow enmity suitable for sound bites on prime time TV, as though  there were two and only two sides to any subject (this "binary" thinking being the foundational enabler of extremism).

I praised Stuart because at that time, as someone not ideologically possessed, I saw his heartfelt plea for honesty as an uncommon and even profound piercing of the veil of the divisive fantasy created by the MSM.  He was trying to get real in ways few others could articulate.  I thought he did an uncommonly profound job of it, and was recognized accordingly.  And let's not think the people who had invested in creating and floating that show, would flush it down the toilette the very first time anybody at all said something mean about it.  No, the people behind Crossfire recognized that Stuart had spoken a devastating truth, and for all we know it is to their credit that they decided to stop doing what they consequently recognized to be a small but definite step towards hell.

Which is all my charitable interpretation.  Maybe I'm a bleeding heart, but I think I watched Stuart set a devastating precedent for keeping it real.  And when that meant he couldn't ask a single substantial question of some guest without getting a propaganda reply, he would refrain from asking the question, and thus expose the sorry fact that his guest was unable to answer any real questions without slipping into bullshit.  I always thought it made Stuart a true genius, by integrous example.Copypasta?  What the fuck are you on about mate?  I wrote that shit off the top of my head, and if you think it's retarded then fine, but please do the courtesy of actually saying why.

Meanwhile, your points about Zizek.

&gt; *He's a vehement critic of Stalin;*

Right.  He's too retarded to realize that only a brutal vicious psychopath like Stalin can actually command the power over a communist state, and instead has some kind of mush headed idea that he knows what it takes to actually make such a system work properly and ethically, because he's so fucking smart.  Well good for him.  Too bad the animal nature of our species includes instincts for hierarchy that guarantee such piffle cannot happen, and ONLY the most brutal tyrant can keep the next psychopath's knife out of his back to maintain control, while the rest of the sheeple suck it up like nectar.  We are a species that can ONLY put a Stalin in control, and therefore they only viable answer is to NEVER allow ANYONE to be in control in the first place.

&gt; *His talks have very little to do with anything in any of his books, they're basically distilled versions to entertain idiots and hold an audience*

Great, he's a bullshitter.  Nice.  Why then, exactly, should we trust anything he says?  You claim he's happy to bullshit right to our faces.  Why then would he suffer any pain from bullshitting to us from behind the keyboard while he's writing his books?  Sounds all too convenient if you ask me.  Which I already knew (see my post above).

As another long term subscriber, who is staunchly against any and all authoritarianism, identity politics and bigotry, I am still forced to conclude that I don't really give a shit about so-called "Nazis" at this point in history.  Mostly all I see are a bunch of people concerned about a very real cultural clash between Islam and the West, and they are sucked in and making stupid conclusions, for which they face widespread ridicule and near total censure.  They are anything but a real threat right now from everything I can see, and even though their suggested solutions are reprehensible and delusional, the concerns driving them are extremely important, and are being systematically censored out of public recognition by the extreme left.  This is driving a critical divide, because on the ground, real people in the West are getting increasingly unwilling to ignore the real problems they see, and the only side they see consistently trying to address the problems are the far right.

[comment 2:](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/83xrez/runcensorednews_has_just_been_banned_an_the/dvlvr02/)

{snipped for irrelevance}  But what I'm rapidly coming to is the conclusion that most of the racism, in all it's flavors from mild to extreme, are reactions to real problems that need to be addressed for real.  It doesn't matter whether those reactions are stupid, delusional or even evil, the problems that led to the reactions are real.  Every time we decide it's OK to just shut people down because we reject their reaction, because we say they are not allowed to be racist, all we do is make them dig in their heels, because they can see we're denying the problems that got them angry in the first place.  The only way through this nightmare is to actually engage them, even if they want to fantasize about being Nazis.  Given that they are not thinking coherently when they blame race and think violent and authoritarian solutions are the answer, we need to tolerate the ugliness of their positions long enough to work back to analyzing the root problems with them, and work forwards from their in good faith dialog until we can develop better solutions that are mutually agreeable.  Unless of course we think we can just kill them all for wrongthink, which is where the extreme left is actually heading right now, but with a far more credible danger.

[comment 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/83xrez/runcensorednews_has_just_been_banned_an_the/dvlu720/)

How much does the left have to embrace Russian and Chinese communism before we have to call them out on it?  Do we have to wait until they're literally mass murdering people in political purges for wrongthink, and/or enslaving them in gulags?

How many times are we supposed to ignore groups like ANTIFA literally flying the hammer and sickle?

The Nazis might have killed 20M people.  The communists killed easily 100M.

My point here is not to ignore Nazis, but to gain some bloody perspective.  The confused, lost, spoiled brats calling themselves Nazis have substantially less power, and are substantially less dangerous than the extreme left at this point in history.  Call yourself a Nazi, and you get ridiculed and banned.  Call yourself ANTIFA, openly promote gulags, and even endorse openly anti-Semitic mouthpieces, and you'll be endorsed by all kinds of institutions and groups.  It's sheer madness.  Given the obvious fact that the current crop of so-called Nazis are just idiots motivated into stupid conclusions by mostly legitimate concerns about the clash of cultures between Islam and the West, while the far left are actually covering over significant atrocities with the force of law and mass censorship, I think the direction of real danger is clear enough.

Take the UK right now: you are more likely to face jail for saying you want all the Muslims deported out of your town, than you are for being one of those Muslims and participating in the systematic rape of children.  Of course thinking the Nazi's had a solution is purely fucking retarded, but lets not pretend the idiots falling into that delusion are the actual problem here.Excellent point.  And presuming the sane people let them succeed in their destruction, what, if anything, are they even equipped to build in the ashes?  Another hell on Earth formed out of insane and counterfactual ideology, seems the only likely answer.&gt; *Electing a "meme president" is the action of someone who sees no meaning in the democratic process in it's current form.*

I disagree.  I think it's a protest of what is perceived as obvious and profound corruption.  That protest is not motivated by feeling that nothing means anything.  I suspect nihilism leads people to not voting or engaging politically at all, instead of protesting in any form.

My honest best intuition about Trump says he was elected as the Fuck You candidate, and you have to admit he fits that bill in all kinds of ugly ways against numerous established interests on both sides of the American political binary, and also importantly he posed as being against established big money, so he was even a Fuck You to the hard-pressing wider economic corruption that far transcends the political binary.  Shillary very most certainly did not qualify in any of those metrics, and between rigging / stealing the primaries within her own party, her obvious Wall Street fealty, her robotic lack of humor, and her "basket of deplorables" remarks, she surely handed untold millions of votes to the only Fuck You candidate left standing (the other one, Bernie, would have likely beat Trump).

So no, I don't see nihilism here, I see concern that needs to be articulated in real ways, instead of wasted on an assclown of the most historic proportions.For many people, two steps:

First, do a simple physical relaxation routine to let go of muscle tension in your body.  Laying there, lights out, fully ready to sleep, start at your toes and work to your head, deliberately tensing and then relaxing every muscle you can.  Maybe do it twice over.  This is an extremely simple, but often extremely effective trick to relaxing more fully.  The longer you practice, the more automatic it becomes to just immediately feel and relax any tense muscles you have, within moments of lying down.  This is how you get your body to let go.

Second, take a melatonin pill about 20-30 minutes before you want to actually drop off.  Then make sure you are actually completely ready and set to do it when that time comes.  I heard it described like this: if you are laying there, everything set to actually fall asleep, it will help allow you to slip across from fully set but still awake, to sliding into the dreams.

Again, you need to be fully set, it doesn't knock you out when you're still sitting there playing on your stupid phone.  You want to be laying down, have already become fully relaxed, be breathing slowly, etc.. ACTUALLY fully ready to slip into sleep.  The melatonin apparently helps take that very last step, for those of us who's brains otherwise are not so inclined.

You might find it can make you fall asleep while reading, but you're better to time it so you get to finish your bedtime read, and relax at least another 5 minutes, before the melatonin does its job.Wow, I feel for you, that's a real challenge.  The person above who sets the alarm to require a QR code that he keeps in the fridge by his OJ has a good trick going.  Maybe you could tape it to the bottom of a clear glass, that if full of liquid, so you even have to drink the liquid to scan the code.  A glass of cold juice.For anyone who doesn't have $100 dollars to spend, you can plug together a much cheaper DIY solution with normal stuff.

- use a cheap electrical timer.  $10 to $15, including some digital models.

- use a cheap utility clamp-lamp style lamp.  $10 to $20 depending on choice.

- use a high brightness LED flood light bulb.  $10 to $20 depending on choice.

The cone shaped floodlight bulb I use at my desk is 18W (90W equiv), 1300 lumens, and is very very bright.

You thoroughly nailed that.  My bottom line is that the way things are going, if my entire family are to be persecuted for the color of our skin, over which we have exactly zero control, then I will fight for the right of survival of my ***culture*** against those who would oppress us.  And I will note this is neither a fight I picked nor created, because as an anti-racist, I would have NEVER instigated a fucking race war, and neither did my family or ancestors within living memory.

Finally, I think one thing that is crucial in this moment is to reclaim from the extreme left a piece of territory they have currently captured, which is pivotal in calming the conflict: people have the inalienable right to be nationalistic, racist, white nationalist, and even white supremacist.  Not that this makes them good or right, but it does not give anyone else the right to censor them or punish them outside of simple social disagreement (that could include a private employer firing you, but not a public one unless you abuse people in the line of work).  This is a critical line that we must pull back behind, because we have FAR overstepped it.

This is critical on multiple fronts, but perhaps the most absolutely desperate point is psychological: we cannot allow people to excuse assaulting the rights of the individual for thoughts, no matter what they are.  The moment we allow this step, we get lazy and think we can use shortcuts to solve what we have deemed to be the problem of other people's bad ideas.  But it is impossible to force people to believe anything.  All that happens is we allow ourselves to fail at our ultimate responsibility to respect them as individuals with the absolute right to freedom of thought, and assume it is good enough to silence them, as if that will make the ideas we have declared to be a problem somehow disappear.  It doesn't.  In fact, as any fool should immediately see, they would deserve our disrespect as wimps if they did NOT dig in their heels all the harder in defense of what they believe.  Consequently, by not granting absolute freedom of thought, we sabotage our commitment to the true and ultimate responsibility of civilized people: to discuss, debate, persuade and negotiate in good faith as equals.

So, you're afraid of youth being suckered into Nazi ideology?  Well then, get off your lazy cunt and reach them with better ideas before they fall.  You hate the Nazis that already exist?  Then blame yourself and your "side" for letting it happen in the first place.  Every single one of them is OUR FAULT, because WE failed to win the argument honestly, and that is almost always because we thought we could just cop out and shut them up instead.  It doesn't make ideas go away, it puts water on them and digs their roots all the deeper.  It demonstrates to our enemies that they are right to consider us their enemies.

I will finish this thought by saying that this also critically depends upon absolute freedom of expression, no hate crime laws, no censorship, and a strong public ethic of attempting the maximum degree of permissiveness with regards to speech.  I say we should only recognize crimes like libel/slander, fraud and publicly inciting a crowd (mob) to direct frenzied violence (an immediate present-tense act, eg inciting riots) to be justifiable restrictions.  Anything else goes.  You want to promote raping children?  Prepare to be hated, and have people explain why that is so very wrong.  You want to advocate genocide, gulags, or any kind of totalitarianism?  Prepare to be hated, and have people explain why those are all so very, very wrong.

Finally, this freedom is about beliefs, ideas, and words, not physical actions against others.  I'm fine with having laws to protect people from ***physical*** harm.  I think it's evil if some Muslim thinks it's perfectly fine to rape the "white whores", but I demand that we let him say it all he likes.  But if he does it, then it's prison/deportation time.  Hell, if we have DNA evidence across multiple separate convictions (to prevent false convictions), I think graphic public executions would send a useful message.Interesting, I‚Äôd like to know this as well.Interesting point about the spectrum, but I have to admit I wasn't horribly worried about it being perfect, just substantially too bright for sleeping comfort.  Modern LED bulbs also tend to have pretty good and complex spectrums, as long as you don't buy a $3 cold white equivalent that uses bottom bin LED's.  You also tend to have a pretty good range of color temperatures that way, from a warm white to very bright sunlight equivalents.  I suspect a lot of the hassle people used to go through for color temperature was to do with attempting to get anything worthwhile at all out of incandescent bulbs, where the filament temperature needs to thermally excite the colors, which is challenging.  White LED's are actually UV that stimulates a complex phosphor mix, which makes it very easy to down-convert from UV to lower frequency colors across the spectrum, so it's a very different game than doing it with heat.I got banned for posting something not as offensive as other posts.

I also got further in the book, where he advises you ask your boss for a "shallow work budget," and that if your organization does not value deep work, then you should start planning your transition to a job which does.  This is small, but a useful exception, which shows that this paradigm does not apply to everything.  One thing that creeped me out about "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" was the implication that all salarymen should be like Jiro.  Man, that craftsman ethic just doesn't apply to the treadmill of powerpoints and meetings.  Important to separate things which differ.lol its crazy what jordan peterson is making people do. Wake up early and floss rofl what a bad human being! Jordan Peterson is the devil himself! He should be encouraging people to protest inequalities of the social justice system!Tell the truth, or at least don‚Äôt lie.Jonathan Pageau!I'm very surprised you have an issue with "strobe" effect from modern LED bulbs.  The thing is, the vast majority of them ***absolutely cannot and do not strobe.***  The reason is their power supplies are no longer using AC power directly to the LED.  They take in the AC power, convert it to DC, then regulate that DC at extremely high frequencies like 40KHz or higher, which means the LED is running purely continuous, not strobing.

The only common exception to this is with LED Christmas and other decorative light strings, which are usually powered directly from the 50 / 60 Hz power, and so do strobe noticeably.  Aside from them, almost all of the modern screw-in bulbs actually contain a sophisticated power supply that prevents the strobing.Yeah, a few years ago when the warm white LED Christmas light strings started coming out for fairly cheap, I bought a few to use for pleasant diffuse lighting.  The problem was, a diode is an electrical one-way valve, and AC goes both ways.  So it seemed like the cheap strings would be fully off for half of every cycle, when the voltage was the wrong way, and that made them have a very strong strobe effect.  If you moved in a room with them, you would almost get dizzy.  It was fun to play with briefly, but not to live with.  The strings that worked better were the extra bright strings, which had an extra wire in them, a rectifier to turn the AC into DC, and therefore used both halves of the AC cycle.  They still had a mild flicker, because AC also turns fully off every time it reverses, which is twice each cycle, or 120 Hz.  That wasn't nearly as bad as the other strings, I mostly didn't notice it in practice, but still not perfect.1,2,5,10,20,50 years will pass. Doesn't matter if you kill yourself, if you grind 80 hours a week, if you work a 40 hour week for $12 an hour, if you go to school, if you join the army, if you shoot up a school, if you rob a bank.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltpog8Aglos

Listen to this with "Time" in the background, or even "To the Line" from another Hans Zimmer film, *The Thin Red Line.*First, thank you very much for standing up when you might well expect to be shat on substantially by an angry mob.  Bravo and an upvote for you, we need these hard discussions.  I have a perspective that I think is an important alternate interpretation here, that is of direct relevance to your argument, and cuts in two directions at once:

***Neither communism nor capitalism can be credited for the material gains over the last couple of centuries...***

***The gold medal goes to INDUSTRIALISM and THE*** **INDUSTRIAL** ***REVOLUTION.***

The simple fact is that real industrial capability came into existence and was adopted around the world at various times, give or take maybe a hundred years, by every society around the world, ***to extreme benefit.***  Now, in places where it was adopted late, that was likely due to incumbent (social) power systems that were not economically advanced enough to have been participating at the leading edge of industrialization, and which were probably encumbered in resistance by whoever held power at that time, eg like the Tzars who were in no big rush to drop their feudal authority to let industrialism explode across their dominion.

But the basic point is that regardless of what political or economic structures were brought in, the profit revolution was the industrial revolution, which was so absurdly profitable for everyone involved that no kind of system that embraced it could fail.  At least while the continents were virgin territory for large scale mining, farming, fossil fuels, virgin forests, virgin fisheries, etc..

It was an era where the Earth was a planet of pure golden cream, ready to be drunk on the spoils of modern industrial technology, and thrust every participating society into unfathomable prosperity, no matter what politics or economics they played at along the way.

Of course, it is no surprise that various ideologies attempt to take the credit, but since when were politicians anything but parasites taking credit for everyone else's actual work?  If I can give any credit to one system over another, I would say something like this: a committee is a group of people with more than 10 legs and no brains, and free markets are more nimble than communist/socialist systems, to the extent that they may have less committee meddling in every given business deal than a system that officially considers all business to be of government / public concern.  I would argue that individuals doing deals with each other is a fundamental, ancient human activity, and any system that would seek to impose the systematic and mandatory meddling of everyone else in that basic business is problematic.  Of course, basic ethical rules must be followed, the deal-makers cannot freely decide to burn everyone else around them in the process, but there must be autonomy to the extent they are not actually found to be burning everyone else.  Meddling in their private business before they actually commit any crime, is an unjustified invasion of their privacy.  This is the stuff of basic freedom, and it leads to more nimble development, and when writ large and called "capitalism", and supported by the powerful elite, it surely ran a little faster and earlier than other "systems" in the era when the industrial revolution was forcefully exploding across the world, toppling anyone who would stand in the way, and replacing them with one system or another of willing power, be that capitalist or communist or anything else.

&gt; *just as* ***the most*** *appalling things happened under right-wing nationalism.*

Sorry, but I think the medals go to Russia, China and Cambodia.  Look, the German and Italian publics can almost be forgiven for following Hitler down that evil path to genocide, because the Jews were easily portrayed as "others", invaders, and had been considered as such since antiquity.  Antisemitism was an ancient tradition they were already deeply steeped in, and the Jews had always been foreigners in their midst.  But the communist process pitted neighbor against neighbor for quite literally for perceived group identity and/or thought crime, in a brand new formulation of excuse for genocide that needed no historical precedents or traditions to be palatable to the populations that became so viciously murderously infected.  And the death toll over a hundred million, done across half a century and multiple countries, to prove just how utterly depraved and profoundly insidious that mentality is.  Only a few modern idiots, ***and everyone knows they are abject fucking idiots***, support the Nazis.  The hammer and sickle is easy to find on posters hung on the walls of our modern universities.  Be very wary, the darkest insanity our species has ever known is lurking close.  

Yes, scientific revolution absolutely.  I kind of blur them together in my mind, because a lot of the discoveries were done in practical settings too, industry and science working hand in hand, largely inseparable.  Although there were lots of places with little scientific work being done, but where basic industrialism still allowed much progress.  Lots of developing countries, for example, eg including places like central / south America.idk something about white men being order and black females being chaosI agree that "Good intentions led astray" covers some portion of the problem, but perhaps, given that people's beliefs evolve over time, it would be more accurate to see the good intentions as being only small steps amongst many steps taken on long paths, scattered amongst many steps which may not be good, and which paths frequently devolve into very bad things.  "The road to hell is paved with good intentions", captures the fact that if anything, the good intentions are too often no more than convenient excuses when the paths and most of the steps taken have little or nothing to do with good.

There are substantial portions of the total package of extreme "left", "social justice" ideology, that seem to be so powerfully driven by resentment and hate that it's hard to consider them anything but pathological and NOT-good intentions, even if there are some brief "good intention" excuses mentioned along the way.  The desire for revolution could sometimes be like that.  The person is bored, angry and nihilistic in life, looking for meaning and excitement.  They find a path to a source of excitement demonstrated by others: identify external systems as "bad", and revolt against them.  Along the way you find community, grand visions of Utopia, excitement, and military-grade feelings of moral superiority: you might even feel like a hero.

But note that the true instigating factors were personal failings, the boredom, anger and nihilism.  Following others who seem to be finding excitement and meaning may be neutral, especially if they are too ignorant to recognize they are doing bad things themselves, and the people they're acting against are NOT actually doing bad things.  Then justifying their actions along the way as "good causes" is really just a delusional excuse after the fact, for solving their own problems (boredom anger nihilism) by acting outwards against others.

So in this case, it's not just "good intentions" being led astray, it's a common set of problems faced personally by many people, especially young people.  And I would hazard the guess that this is what makes Marxism mixed with postmodernism and feminism into an incredibly toxic ideology.  You get an incredibly set of "good intention" excuses to pursue horrible and incoherent "solutions" to a wide variety of problems, many of which are personal, but are re-framed and blamed as external.

And when that path is littered with higher education that very certainly ought to know better, has every means available to know better, and must be highly negligent with their due diligence to avoid recognizing the problems, it becomes increasingly hard to hear the phrase "good intentions" and accept any of it.he's a nasty hoThe proliferation of cry-bully SJW's loudly demanding a totalitarian nanny state to protect them from themselves is good evidence.

It is for me to hope that if enough people recognized the distinction I raise, they would be much more likely to stop allowing petty tyrants to shit on their freedom based on lame excuses.

As for you critique of my writing style, thanks, it is duly noted for consideration.

Oh right, re corporate censorship.  My answer is simple: nobody who censors me will get a penny from my pocket, not if I can help it.  Businesses can choose their activities accordingly.  If you and many others also choose to protect your own freedom by not funding your enemies, I will be in a better position, because more businesses will recognize that shitting on people's freedom in the course of doing business can be unprofitable, and will therefore offer alternatives which do not censor their customers.Where do you get the idea that we should totally reject them? Do you know how privileged you are? You are typing on the internet which means you have access to all the education you can possibly imagine. You are warm and healthy which means you aren't hungry or outside for most of your life.

This is not normal, life is usually gangs, kidnappings, murder, theft, sickness, and everything inbetween. 

But because you aren't a hollywood superstar or a billionaire like the people you spend all your time watching on tv and instagram you want to tear the whole system down.

Because you don't have it better than your neighbour, or the pretty girl at school, or your boss, you think you can just change everything.

Do you know how lucky we are? To even be debating this and not facing a death penalty for having an opinion? 

Today's life is a consequence of the hierarchies you want to tear down. Go back to war and famine and gangs and rape and murder and anarchy and then you'll be begging to be a victim of a micro aggression because someone called you out on your bullshit.Your reply is very telling of a lack of perspective from a lack of experience either from lack of age or knowledge.

One mistake leads to homelessness for more people than your can imagine. One mistake could have led to nuclear war in the cold war.

One mistake is the difference between life and death. To believe otherwise shows a lack of years. 

When you grow up, things aren't going to happen for you. Unless you have people in your life that make it happen. You aren't going to be rich and famous within a few years because you think you'll be. I know I did but I should have known better.

Anyways I can tell you are young and confident with your beliefs. I was and there was no telling me otherwise. My only suggestion is to experience more of the world and read more from a wide range of topics before you claim any knowledge of history, society, or how things should work. &gt; To be clear, I have already made up my mind on Peterson

Do you claim to be intellectually superior than the average Peterson supporter, yet make a statement like that? You probably believe you're open minded, but your words speak louder than beliefs.OP never mentioned Derrida in his post. Strawman much?&gt; Also, I assume you haven't read the entirety of Derrida's bibliography and yet you seem comfortable pointing to his ideas negatively

You were talking about OP not Peterson.Why can't we all hold hands and sing la de da and make everything wonderful and fun all the time?

I don't know, why can't you wake up?&gt; Oh, I agree, one mistake can lead to homelessness, for other people. Not you or me.

Unlike you, I don't believe I'm different from homeless people or other people in unfortunate situations. I've been through bad shit so I know bad shit can happen to me. 

You have no idea how strong the force of life and nature is. It will rip you up and spit you out in pieces without even noticing your presence. The difference between you and Elon Musk is he has something to show the world. You only have ideas.Can you stop being mean? Thanks."12 rules of chaos" hahahaOh this is a huge win for repressed men everywhereI hate to say this, but it might just be time to start pulling fire alarms on their SJW speakers, on the simple principle that they should not enjoy the advantage of getting to hear who they want if they are going to deny others that right, and that suffering from being censored like that is probably the only way they will learn any fucking respect for other people's rights.  Of course, it's also fair to say we may as well not let their ideology spread any more than we can help, and if they have signaled that pulling fire alarms is fair game, then it may not be the best thing to let them win that game on the pretense of having better principles.  Might as well dress up like ANTIFA while doing it, to sow maximum confusion.thanks for the response man, I'm gonna look into talking with a psychiatrist. Thank you for the response, I just now saw this a month later! I'll be trying to talk to a psychiatrist soon. [TEDxToronto - Dr. Jordan B.

Here's a good one.  Short, no politics, profound as can be.And why is it important that he fit, or not fit, in this specific box? ‚Äú... conspiracy theories are the lowest form of intellectual enterprise.‚Äù  I‚Äôm pretty sure this article is directed not to the creators of the conspiracy theories , but to reasonable people hearing their conclusions and asking ‚ÄúHum, what about that?‚Äù Thus a simple and direct response. Yeah, I subbed over there just this morning (in spite of being a man), after spotting someone on YT saying the posted this vid over there a little while ago.Indeed, and is the basis of the legal principle of the presumption of innocence.Hi, just to be 100% clear, no credit to me :) I posted the video to this sub, but I'm not Marni, I'm just a random (male) bloke who followed a very lucky random "recommended" link in YouTube, and was extremely impressed with the unique and substantial insight and analysis given by Marni in her video here, which obviously needed to be shared with the wider community.  She's exactly the kind of solid, upstanding and independent individual voice we need more of in this sub, people who have walked their own miles uphill, and have something far deeper than introductory memes to share.

FWIW, I'm happy to see more women around here too.  I hope the community manages to avoid stupid sexism, and be a friendly place for women to be accepted without hesitation as intellectual equals, who are appreciated for their strength without any fuss.  I've been astonishingly privileged to have lived a life full of good women who have been both my peers and many of my best friends, regardless of any sexual / romantic connections we did and/or didn't share.  It's always sad to me when the other half of the great people in the world feel hesitant to participate because a forum ends up with a sausage-fest ambiance and/or outright hostility.

Cheers :)I'm not so sure I agree Sam ripped Jordan a new one.  Maybe in "debate" terms (I didn't listen to the source, and didn't dig deep into the drama coverage after).  But we don't know the metaphysical truth here, and I rather think both of them are chipping away at different facets of a more complex reality than anyone yet knows.  FWIW, I'm a huge fan of both Harris and Peterson, but sadly neither seems to appropriately consider the intersection of complexity and strong emergence, and the potential ramifications for our entire concept of causality, reality and reductionism.  Sam is actually a little worse than Jordan on this count, because he seems to think he knows more than Jordan thinks he knows.  It's probably my favorite thing that Jordan does, and very rare, is refuse to make unnecessary metaphysical arguments about stuff we clearly shouldn't be claiming to know.  While I'm closer to Harris than Jordan in terms of simple naturalism, Jordan is actually more humble in his claims, and I think his claims actually cut closer to the truth of reality, albeit completely without any actual religious or "supernatural" component, which I'm glad he recognizes may not be necessary anyways, he just suspects is more likely.Imagine being a fucking centrist.PEW polls have shown that over the past 17 years there has been a dramatic reduction in the public's trust in institutions. Science is one of the very few fields that still has public trust and therefore authority. That's why socialist are trying to move in to take it over, they crave the authority for themselves. I've been noticing this for a few years now. 

The opening scene from MIB is a great representation of what the left does to institutions. In the scene an alien kills a farmer and wears his skin, then walks around, awkwardly, pretending to be the farmer. The left infiltrates institutions, changes them fundamentally while pretending nothing has changed and demanding the public give the same respect as before. This will lead, more and more to topics of research being off limits. You can see the pattern in the treatment of J Michael Bailey.

&gt;Bailey's book The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender Bending and Transsexualism was published in 2003.[31] In it, Bailey reviewed evidence that male homosexuality is innate, a result of heredity and prenatal environment. He also reviewed the theory of Ray Blanchard that there are two unrelated forms of transsexualism, one that is an extreme type of homosexuality and one that is an expression of a paraphilia known as autogynephilia. Written in a popular science style, the book summarized research supporting Bailey's opinions.

&gt;The book generated considerable controversy. The most detailed investigation into that controversy was reported by Alice Dreger,[32] a bioethicist and historian, known for her activism in support of intersex rights. Dreger included additional details in Galileo‚Äôs Middle Finger, an analysis of modern clashes between scientists and activists whose beliefs are challenged by them.[33] In her documented account of the Bailey case, she concluded that a small group of self-styled activists tried to bury a politically challenging scientific theory by attacking Bailey. "These critics, rather than restrict themselves to the argument over the ideas, had charged Bailey with a whole host of serious crimes," but that "what they claimed about Bailey simply wasn't true."[34]

&gt;Outside of the transsexual community and sexology researchers, this controversy is largely notable because of its implications for academic freedom and freedom of speech. In an interview with The New York Times, Dreger said, "If we're going to have research at all, then we're going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this is what happens to them, then we've got problems not only for science but free expression itself."[37] While Conway compared his work to Nazi propaganda, and Andrea James posted pictures of his children on her website with sexually explicit captions, other critics believe that their actions against Bailey and his book represent legitimate comment on a topic of public interest.[44]

I consider myself pretty liberal. I'm extreme in trait openness. I have been to burning man and frequently attend similar festivals, I often wear radical looking things and engage in culturally subversive behaviour.
I also think JBP is the best brainfood I've had in my life. JBP hasn't turned me conservative but he's shown me the value of conservative people, and shown me the pathology of liberal extremists (actually, they've shown me that through their naive whining and ill-conceived critique of him)so I don't know if you're rare, but you're certainly not alone.&gt; *I really don't see how its less applicable to women though, to be honest.*

While I agree wholeheartedly with that, Peterson actually does explain why he's more relevant to more young men than women: growing up is more "optional" for young men than women, because women are on a much more strict biological clock (egg timer) ;)  That means that many young women get the point of responsibility on their own quite a bit better than men, and already getting the point, they don't need JP to spell it out for them as much as so many young men who might otherwise have no particular reason not to just be furries or stay in the basement playing video games.  Which is not a particularly complimentary point to men, but I think it's quite realistic.

And all that being said, I think it's often extremely valuable for EVERYONE to have someone as profoundly ***wise*** as JP actually spell this stuff out systematically.  Even if you had already done a good job of articulating 95% of it (which most people have not), there is still that remaining 5% that you missed, which his articulation will fill in, and this will be extremely worthwhile.  Maybe most men average only being 50% clued in / articulated, while most women are more like 75% clued in, and that difference is what drives both the imbalance in JP's audience in person, and ***also*** the demographics online: the men are not doing well on 50%, they are left fucked up and searching more than women, and YouTube is easy to explore and can be fruitful territory.

As Peterson puts it, a very large number of people thank him for putting words to things they already knew.  I've always been a kind of a philosophy geek in a way, and always had a stick up my ass about actually articulating everything that has any importance for me and between me and other people.  I want shit to be clear, because that lets us all make something more out of it; we actually know where we stand and what the fuck we're doing and where we want to get to.  It makes me a natural fan of JP, because he's a brilliant articulator, perhaps the most brilliant I've ever seen, and I don't say that lightly.  The extent listening to him has clarified things for me, and the way he specifically invokes speaking truth, makes it all the more clear to me that articulating things is something we should all be cooperating in all the time, because no matter what each of us thinks we get right on our own, we're always missing some critical insight that some other person has managed to stumble upon, and could be sharing with us, and vice versa.  And I would add that's especially true between men and women, because we do have dispositions that lean in different directions, and therefore complement each other's perspectives when we cooperate in shared articulation.

&gt; *I understand I might be lucky in that regard.*

While that may well be true, I would be surprised if your "luck" doesn't also have very much to do with your own composure and presence.  This is in no way meant as an excuse, but the fact is that we humans are not 100% in control of our animal behavior, and I can easily imagine some women presenting as particularly juicy and vulnerable targets, easy prey for some sickly predatory men.  (I have to imagine this because I've never felt the predatory urge).  OTOH, I know from much experience the joy of women who present as whole people, and that is not "easy prey", it's just awesome.

Finally, I bet you it has everything to do with your intelligence, which is likely quite considerable.  You are not easy prey, you are good company, including for the many men who are not nearly as smart as you.  I think it's hard for smart people to understand (because we've never lived it) all the ugly things that not-so-smart people do to each other, often while simply flailing around, and sometimes in un-checked greed and/or malice.

First, you're very welcome for the compliment, and I'd say, especially given your reply, I was on-point assuming your high intelligence.  And it's a pleasure, always :)

You and I have had a funny semi-opposite paths.  I grew up in the 1970's, parents semi-hippie, philosophically hippie, 100% staunch atheist for generations, and then took on a bizarre combination of existentialism, Chomsky anti-establishment, and [The Naked Ape](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/24/the-naked-ape-at-50-desmond-morris-four-experts-assess-impact) cuing my naturalism to fully expect some large fraction of human psychology and behavior to be animal instincts rather than just anything-we-choose-to-make-up.  And this last point was probably the most pragmatic thing I learned, because no matter what kind of nonsense people spout, there is a good practical test: does this comport with the ***absolute hard fact*** that we are animals?  If not, then bullshit.

So, Peterson is a miracle for me, because he actually does religion with integrity.  He finds sound archetypal interpretations, that comport fully with scientific interpretations, ***and*** don't make metaphysical claims that are philosophically unsupportable (in fact he usually concludes we don't know such answers, which I think is both refreshingly true and refreshingly humble).  Although I've considered myself expressly philosophical since childhood, I became increasingly interested in more recent years, and then increasingly disgusted.  I am wont to describe academic philosophy as a combination of the most important and profound insights, with a body of semi-autistic extreme wankery that bears no discernible connection to natural reality, and which represents an extreme and damning, perhaps unforgivable dereliction of moral duty to the people of the modern world, who needed philosophers to bring home the bacon in an era where church is fading away, and TV went from merely bankrupt to being a force of absolute malice.  The exact antidote we need was well exemplified when Dr. Peterson translated "The meek shall inherit the Earth." into "People who have swords, but choose to keep them sheathed, shall inherit the Earth".  You might say that's the first time I've been able to stand in awe of the Bible, for reasons that utterly transcend religion and philosophy, and cut to the very deepest core of what it means to be a dangerous animal in a dangerous world full of dangerous animals, trying to make love out of chaos.

Given that description, I think it should be obvious why I see Dr. Peterson as a rare and precious master, at a time when the world obviously needs exactly that kind of masterful wisdom.

&gt; *Also many women my age self attest to never wanting children which kind of throws away the real need for a timeline, at least practically.*

The problem is, the egg timer is almost always present, and almost always starts ticking early.  This drives maturation rates, no matter what modern society is doing, such that women usually mature much earlier in important ways, utterly regardless of any reproductive goals or lack thereof.  But that actually plays to your point that women have more reasons to figure themselves out sooner.  I would say from experience that I've seen lots of women "grow up" too fast, and get stuck with some deep / foundational ideas that are half-baked, instead of taking time to deepen their core perspectives.  The ideas Dr. Peterson teaches would thus benefit women every bit as much, but earlier than men.  This could be a problem, if the particular tone of his articulation is more geared for people at college age than for younger women in early high school.  Of course, I would have been game at that time, but I know I was always that kind of freak/geek, and many weren't quite so deep or heavy.  It indicates a market, in the form of a segment of society in real need of a quality product, instead of the sheer insanity they'll be getting from modern SJW-trained teachers.

I would also say that for the vast majority of women, there is a very strong instinctual imperative to have babies, and even for women taking completely different paths, they should be prepared to face the consequent feelings that are very likely to pop up at some point, no matter how unbidden.  I'm saying this with full respect, merely as a realistic and sympathetic take on making sure women can feel OK.  For example, there is zero shame in deciding it's time for a fur baby at some point, as a way to drain off the impulse.  Or seeking some kind of extra engagement with kids, taking on some kind of roll to sate the urges.  Whatever it takes.  I just reckon people fare better when they can recognize when emotions happen to them as a consequence of being animals who can't always choose to ignore it.  No judgments from me, I just try to help everyone "Know Thyself".

And on that point, I reiterate, it's a pleasure chatting, because you plainly do know yourself well :)There‚Äôs a women‚Äôs party in the UK. &gt; *Am I correct in assuming that you mean women start sorting out their important affairs earlier in part due to earlier maturation (ie cognitive development)?*

To some degree I think that is true, although it gets artificially leveled out by the age-gated timing of the school system.  I wouldn't be surprised if schooling was based on performance instead of age, that women would slip ahead of men by a couple of years on average.  But I'm assuming in general that women tend to get get more serious than men on average at earlier ages, say through their 20's and 30's, because the timer is ticking.  Again, on average.  Guessing at the underlying truths exposed by stereotypes, I'm betting there's substance behind the image of parent's basement dwelling guys but not women, for example.  And when women are staying home, I bet it's in the capacity of caregivers more often than not.  And the bigger point is that pattern likely applies regardless of any individual woman's intentions of having children.

FWIW, I'm plenty familiar with women who choose not to have children, my partner is one of them, and some of our best friends too.  And while you're certainly spot on in recognizing they have different problems and time lines, I'm just trying to be aware that there are likely to be instinct driven emotional patterns regardless, and those need to be recognized and dealt with even when they are effectively irrelevant to a woman's chosen life.  I also think there's a significant issue in relationships, because the emotions involved are also a big set of deep and long term instinct patterns at play, and those instinctual programs are based around breeding.  I've seen it over and over, where couples get together in their early twenties, mature intelligent people, with no intention on reproducing.  But a few years pass by, and there is a crisis in the relationship, because instincts are saying "where's the fucking baby already!?!?!?" and "no baby = I'm outta' here!".  If you don't know those emotions might happen because of instinct programs, regardless of any conscious intentions, then you might not know how to deal with them, or even recognize that's what's happening, and are likely to find other "reasons" for not being happy about the relationship.  Iv'e seen breakups, panic marriages, and sudden pregnancies when breakups were obviously in the works.  It's shit to know about the raw fact that no matter how fancy our modern babbling monkey minds may be, no matter how elaborate and flexible our lives, we are still very much whole monkeys, complete with the emotions of whole monkeys.  It's good to understand this, so unexpected emotions don't derail otherwise perfectly sensible life plans, perhaps one that have huge investments already made to accomplish.

Finally, I'll have you know I identify as an asshole, with pronouns of leaky, pucker and gape, and I come close to taking offense at people who denigrate pieces of shit.  Know thyself never smelled worse ;)  I stand in particular awe of the fact that we, good strangers, can nonetheless scratch our heads together, and hopefully work a little closer to not being ignorant twats.  It's a much better miracle than TV ever was, ***IF AND ONLY IF we make something better of it.***  It's always a great pleasure to share with good people who are willing to play like this.  We learn, and carry this into the world with us.  For all the shit-show reputation the internet gets, I see a profound kind of progress that I think is a world first, and it's a damned good thing, because without it we're probably screwed.  Cheers :)

There is a difference between privilege and racism, an important difference that you're conflating here, and which makes your argument nonsensical.  Of course you're not alone in this, but don't think that gives you shelter, entire societies are frequently factually wrong.

To be specific, it is nonsense to suggest that not suffering from racism equates to a privilege.  The nonsense is worse than doubled when a non-racist person is judged guilty for his/her skin color, for this supposed "privilege" of not suffering racism.  Racism is real.  It is often caused by real social problems.  People who manage to escape racism are not privileged for this fact, they are simply not harmed while others are.  Assuming that racism is a scourge that should befall nobody, we should by sympathetic when any person suffers it, and not angry at the person who does not suffer it.  By the logic employed, every black who escapes racism is likewise guilty of privilege for that fact, along with every other "colored" person who does not suffer racism.

The neo-Marxist narrative behind "white privilege" is a toxic mis-framing of racism, that only embitters people who have enjoyed little or no real privilege in their lives, no matter the color of their skin, and who are not themselves racist, indeed may even actively combat it in their daily lives.What about a different degree? I think you've pretty much nailed the recent history, but if you wind it back even farther, you'll find this whole shit show extends as far back as you can see.  For example, go read Chomsky, Necessary Illusions.  Just don't read it before bed, or you won't be able to sleep for the absolute rage at the frequently murderous corruption he exposes as the basic fabric of our society and pretty much all of its modern history.

And yet what to do?  Go full murderous retard by embracing communism-&gt;totalitarianism?  How about taking responsibility for making something even better, if we think we're so fucking smart that we know any better?  Prove it.  I consider myself an extreme liberal, if any label even fits.  But it is most critically to the left that I say: if you think you know any better, then all the bad shit is your own fucking fault for not preventing it in the first place, because nobody else obviously knew any better.  And that's no easy burden for anyone to take on, especially young people, and I can't even blame them when all they've heard is reckless nonsense their whole lives.  There are a lot of extremely important reasons why Dr. Peterson is a match in a lake of hot gasoline.Peterson has more outreach than most, but what matters is the ideas he's reminding young people of, the values and insights that have been blurred and/or lost over a few decades of lassitude.  Those ideas are really what's on fire, because they answer the failings that so many people sense but have a hard time articulating.

&gt; *We are seeing a power grab, public policy or the good of a country has nothing to do with what we see on the left.*

I agree.  But for what actual reason?

Look at Saudi Arabia, built mostly out of American money and technology.  That particularly barbaric little fiefdom is a perfect example of American money getting exactly what it wanted and therefore paid for.  No pesky human rights or due process to interrupt the flow of sweet crude from those wells, no sir, just peons who are either perfectly obedient or else dead, kept brainwashed and obedient by an extremist theocracy running under an absolute dictatorship.  And then spreading the exact extremism that justifies so much expensive (read profitable) war.  Is any of this a coincidence?

Look who has all the real power now: big money corporate, and big government.  They don't work for the people, we are a pain in their ass, and our rights are an inconvenience to profit.  China has that one under control, maybe there's no wonder Justin Trudeau admires their system.  What I'm suggesting is that the most useful and fanatical idiots are the extreme left, who push like maniacs for authoritarian control in the name of "social justice".  What more convenient excuse could any oligarchs find here in the West?  Not even the religious fundamentalists are that convenient, they just vote in trade for the most trivial bits of pandering on abortion, but are not actually promoting totalitarianism.  So you say it's a power grab, and I say sure, as long as we can recognize it's the usual culprits consolidating power as usual, by whatever means presents itself as convenient at any given moment.  Example: Want total corporate control over the internet?  Well, piracy is a good excuse, but mean tweets are even better when millions of idiot SJW's will gormlessly burn their absolutely most fundamental human rights in exchange for a safe space free from "white supremacists" and "racism".  

Make no mistake: big money will burn the west to the ground, and destroy everything in the process, including itself.  The profound irony is that people preaching communism will be its most useful idiots, because they don't understand that their Utopian fantasies lead to totalitarian control, which is exactly what big money wants for itself.  The most interesting thing is that there are likely few grand conspiracies in all this, just an evolution made out of convenience and opportunity at so many small steps.  And stupidity.Think it may be his diet of chicken and vegetablesYes he said he fixed his health issues by changing his diet. His daughter fixed her depression which is why he tried it. They did a news special together about it on that Canadian news channel.

 I'm pretty sure anyway I can't remember the exact vids where he talked about it recently, one of his q&amp;a vids I think. Not exactly sure how long he's been on the diet tho. And I think him being a lot less stressed now probably has something to do with it.Yep this too I remember nowDo you use a lot of oils? Because steak and veggies still seem very low in calories (when put in context of a whole days caloroes). Jacked Peterson on TRT would probably become the God Emperor of mankind. I'm already basically on paleo except weekends. I've been looking into fasting and keto and it looks really  promising.Yes motivation is much easier with exercise which is why I go gym twice a week tooif they blame the audience and not thier delivery for a baddly received message (joke/opinion/stance/etc.)

they probably are just assesSame I only really do it because I can't afford to eat so much meat all the time. Plus I do like pizza hahaDon't worry, at this rate you'll both get fired soon enough.I agree.  I wrote a [comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/86t5bj/comedian_norm_macdonald_is_tweeting_about_how/dw90s7b/) specifically about this idea just the other day, which I'll paste below:

The doc always says he is VERY careful with his words, so I'm not just gonna ignore part of the rule.Then why not just drop the perfect? "Set your house in order before you criticize the world" seems like a much more reasonable standard.What about the word "perfect" is a metaphor? It has a very specific meaning and one thing I like about the doc is his insistence on being very specific with language. And yes, if you actually read my post you'd notice that I both mention and appreciate the importance of a little chaos.Rule 12 is is about finding small joys amidst the tragedy and suffering of life. Yes, I personally take the rule literally and pet animals (not just cats) when they cross my path.That's very interesting. However, it just makes the "perfect" standard that much more impossible. I could maaaybe set my house in something approaching perfect order, but definitely not my soul!Rule 10 advises the reader to "be precise in your speech." All I'm asking is that the doc follow his own advice. There's a big difference between "set your house in order" and "set your house in PERFECT order. " 

Can we agree that:

1. Jordan Peterson is very careful with language.

2. The word "perfect" has a very specific meaning

3. It was included in the rule for a reason.

When he says stand up straight, he means it. When he says don't bother skateboarders, he means it. When he says be precise, he means it. Why is it so crazy to assume that when he says the word "perfect," he means it?Sure, the advice applies to your actual house. But I think the idea is broader than simply your physical space. Basically, the doc is suggesting to set your life in perfect order before you criticize the world.  Your "house" in this sense is your family, your career, your education, your health, etc.I posted this as a reply to another comment, but I think it applies here as well. Sorry for the repost:

provided my life with endless lulzI said out loud that communism was a complete catastrophe.  My neighbor replied that that was "the most right-wing thing" to say.I guess he means that by opposing the far-left, the right benefits, so therefore it is right-wing.  Identity politics for you: you are either with us, or you are with *them.*  No room for nuance or centrism.  I hope odel555q can break out of this mindset and see that there is a center.higher resolution photo, please?thanks, i didn't know he had an extensive talk about the contents of his book, ill do this one first and see about the othersYou and everyone you love is going to die. Seems pretty obvious to me.That's why I found it so funny. They're disproving a rigorous experiment, with utter nonsense and poor experimentation.

The original experiment proved the children had an instinct against drop-off points, and would use their mothers' faces as reference (the mother was told to make a happy or scared face, the children would more likely brave the seeming cliff if they saw the happy face).

The experiment never proved a proper cognitive fear but, an instinct that could be surpassed.  
But the fear is what these new tests were trying to disprove. And the only thing they're proving is that babies trust their mothers.

Maybe I'm crackers, but I found this really amusing. Devouring mother archetype indeed. The first half of this essay was spent tearing apart Maps of Meaning, a book written 20 years ago for an niche academic audience. Peterson was obviously still figuring out his ideas in that book. How would you like it if you were held to every view you had 20 years ago? If you want to critique Peterson, it's only fair to focus on his more recent work, which is 10x as lucid. 

Also, it's particularly dirty to transcribe 17 minutes of a single lecture, and complain that it's meandering and tangential. As I'm sure the author is aware, an extemporaneous speech doesn't always directly translate well to the written word. Peterson has literally hundreds of hours of lecture material on YouTube. Many (or most) of this material would be quite readable had Current Affairs decided to be a more charitable interlocutor and transcribe something else.The first half of this essay was spent tearing apart Maps of Meaning, a book written 20 years ago for an niche academic audience.

They teach you about these "5 British Values" (which are quite inaccurate and have been divorced from British Culture, given Newspeak meaning.)

 This is based on something they teach when you're out-of-work at the Job Center. For sitting through it you get volunteer work, which is far harder to find than you think. The particular person who stood in front of me to talk about British Values was a devout, but modern, Muslim. Heavy smoker, but could talk your ear off about Islam.

When he asked what Democracy meant, I said Demo- came from the Greek or Latin for People, and Cracy meant rule, so it meant the society was ruled by the people. He countered that by saying Democracy meant "Mob Rule," and I should 'look it up.' The man admitted that he didn't vote.  
He wasn't a bad guy at all, I got along with him quite well. Point is, he didn't actually believe in western society. "Tall buildings are mentioned in the Quran as a sign of the end of the world," he said in the middle of the second largest city in the UK. Another interesting facet is that he thought the Renaissance and Enlightenment were  bad things that made us godless. 

Part of the program was to get a bunch of "multicultural" people in the same room. On one of the first days, a british-accented brown-skinned young man had to be taken aside because he said that Tolerance was fine as long as it wasn't towards the Jews.  
I'm a smart-aleck, so I probed how far tolerance should go. Should we be tolerant of intolerance, for example? What if another culture believes marrying children is fine? For this, I was called intolerant.  
This particularly pisses me off to this day, because tolerance doesn't mean acceptance, it means toleration. Intolerant is another word for Racist among government and school structures in England.  
In my High School, we had posters up around that read, "This school has a Zero Tolerance policy on Intolerance." How do they live with themselves?

On the subject of equality, they at least emphasised equality in the eyes of the law. I objected that there were some areas where women had it better, such as in divorces, and they were met without criticism.

Individual liberty was also portrayed in a way I think good. That one should have the maximum freedom possible that doesn't infringe on others'. The materials provided didn't have such pretty wording, but it was the sentiment.

I've been following since his first Rubin in oct 2016 and I did skip over this one.  I'll give 'er a listen now.  the interviews from that period were so goddamn compelling because he was in a really rough place.  And especially knowing now that he was putting up that kind of a fight when his health and energy had been cratering (jan 2017)... just wow, that bucko ain't nothing to fuck with.This is a real example of cultural appropriation. Why don't we just call it mindful stretching?That's where my first thought drifted, but he said that it was something mentioned later on specifically in the... I guess you'd call it, the New-New Testament? I guess? I don't know that much. 



Another interesting difference between the Quran and Bible he mentioned was that Jesus didn't die on the Cross. Judas bared The Cross in his place, and died there for Jesus in order to repent. Or something along those lines. It was a moment when I realised that Islam and Christianity were truly distinct enough to not have similar themes. It's not just additional content, but revisions to the existing stories, too. 

I guess you could look at that as evidence that what Peterson says is right. As The Bible was written onward, it's more than likely older sections were continuously revised or refined.Hell, I didn‚Äôt know what to orient myself towards until I was in my 40‚Äôs. Relax mentally, learn everything you can, invest in relationships and work hard. Enjoy the journey- the doors will open. Best of luck! 

People calling a fitness program yoga feels just a blasphemous as Christians opening a theme park about Noahs ark. It's not wrong but you are missing the point. Words and intention are important, preserving tradition is important.I'd say the quickest way to know more about yourself is to travel the world. Anywhere. 2 weeks minimum. 

I did 1 month in Thailand 1 year, 1 month Vietnam / 1 month Thailand the next year.

I know a lot more about myself and what I want out of life. Before that I had a lot of wondering, now I'm so sure of myself.

I went as a 'digital nomad' not as a tourist though. Though basically I was a tourist for the entire time.Well living in a war zone and a boat seems like an awful travel experience, and one that is not at all representative of what travel could be which is: a revelationary life experience.While this may be percieved as bad I understand where it's coming from.

How many Canadians (or non Canadians) have died yesterday? How many died since that crash?

Why isn't Justin Trudeau attending funerals of all those people who died on the same day as the hockey players? Is it because it's a car crash? Then why isn't Justin Trudeau attending the funerals of the victims of car crashes?

Why are these hockey players being mourned while other people who died aren't? Is it the tragic nature of the accident? Who decides what's the most tragic? So, I see JBP promotes this dominance hierarchy idea and yet this seems odd to me that he holds Jesus in esteem as Jesus was crucified so wouldn't he consider Jesus to be a "failure" by that logic? Or, alternatively, does he somehow hold Jesus is at the top of the "dominance hierarchy"? How about monks that quit the "dominance hierarchy" to become manual laborers and pray, is this considered some kind of way to get up on the "dominance hierarchy"? 

I have mixed feelings on the dominance hierarchy idea and how it relates to religion, anyone had a similar thought? I neither reject it entirely, nor would I over-emphasize it as being accurate and useful. (This could be made in to a thread if desired)I like seeing more and more targeted subs, so long as people also maintain a presence in bigger "core" subs. 

I've been away from this sub for a while, what are some other JBP-related subs that have popped up if any?

I'm going to post a comment from this sub that I had, into that sub as a postI could see how people could cringe at this but also how if I saw you IRL I'd like to give you a high five or at least snigger and be grateful for a reminder to go clean my roomhttps://np.reddit.com/r/DeepJordanPeterson/comments/8cenzr/critique_of_dominance_hierarchy_idea/The audiobook on audible.com is a pleasure to listen to.  Each volume is almost 30 hours long.  So I just throw on the earphones when I'm out marching.  The narrator is english and really good, expressive, theatrical.This is why defending the U.S. First Amendment is so critical. You guys need to watch the longer 16 minute video where the woman gets kind of offended when JBP goes into his ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll end up hating your kid, mode‚Äù.
It‚Äôs so interesting to see him in front of the wider public though....he hasn‚Äôt changed his tone one bit.https://youtu.be/O09_0gOBl0II‚Äôd love to hear your opinion once you guys have seen it.Dr. Peterson‚Äôs recent reframing of the ‚Äúdominance hierarchy‚Äù as the ‚Äúcompetence hierarchy‚Äù would be a good start. When you reframe the question as ‚ÄúHow do I become more competent at (fill in the blank)?,‚Äù the question becomes much easier to answer. No one will care in 5 yrs what your GPA was, they will care if you have the ability to think and say so. Hell yeh.

Being a talented real estate and publicity mogul doesn't automatically translate into competent leader of a large powerful democratic country in my opinion. Here's a quote from Teddy Roosevelt who could be the most comprable president in terms of size of personality.

Christ I thought it was only my high school teacher who was a nutjob.I doubt it means Sunday School.Insecure about what? Offended by what? I'm confused.  
I thought that religious studies of all things would be something for righties. Lefties aren't very fond of religion in general nowadays. I'm confused as to what drew them toward Religious Studies if the typical left winged person will demean religion at any chance. (note the use of the word typical).I'm not saying they would be religious, but they could at least have some genuine passion for the field if they're going to educate on it.

I suppose the same could be said of many teachers, really.I don‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt get bored of Sam Harris‚Äô monotone voice.From what I heard he straight up came out in support of Donald Trump, probably more about that.‚ÄúHere, let me redefine that for you.‚ÄùRespectful, accurate and well written.

I was expecting it to be closer to 50/50. ‚ÄúSome say the I.D.W. is dangerous,‚Äù Ms. Heying said. ‚ÄúBut the only way you can construe a group of intellectuals talking to each other as dangerous is if you are scared of what they might discover.‚Äù

Most evenhanded treatment I‚Äôve read from the NYT in years. Wow. And on MSNBC too. I don‚Äôt. We cut the cable about 4 yrs ago. Glad to hear that they are working at being more balanced. Yeh... Facts. Logic. Reason. The trifecta for galaxy brain.He looks deadThis really goes against my hope that they only chat this utter shit for the traffic.  
Jesus, that was the *hopeful* scenario. The author claims that intellectuals like the doc "have experienced a sharp decline in their relative status over time." LOL. Dude was relatively unknown two years ago and now he's a worldwide phenom. Not exactly sure how that's a "sharp decline." It's like, if they put it in print, they hope it'll magically become true. New low for Vox IMO. Jordan Peterson is in the headline. He's the one pictured. He's a central figure in Bari Weiss' original NYT piece. I'm sorry, I don't care if the author didn't write the headline. Vox specifically targeted the doc, yet nothing in the the article really applies to Peterson. He's never claimed to be silenced, marginalized, sidelined or anything of the sort, so the thesis of the piece is completely wrong in regards to Peterson. Thus, it's a terrible article. I don't think a couple of tweets amounts to a claim of sustained academic persecution.

Yes, Peterson has objected to certain elements of the radical left. But here's the thing -- not everyone who opposes the radical left is alt-right. A lot of people oppose the radical left. Yes, some of them are Nazis. But most of them aren't. Lumping all opponents of the radical left together in the alt-right bucket is an example of terrible journalism and scholarship. 

People like you and the author of the piece hate the fact that Peterson, Harris, Weinstein, etc. are actually reasonable people. Thus, listening to what they have to say will convince other reasonable people that they are correct. That's why radical leftists HAVE to discredit them any way they can. Good thing it's not working.

When I see one of those that has been cut from another video, I search out the origional video and view it. Keeps my blood pressure down. Stephen Fry smiling smugly all through out the presentation, especially when he just exists in the backgroundI agree on your Dyson comment. Fry‚Äôs closing statement impressed. Goldberg came across as having a vendetta against Peterson. I‚Äôm not sure about funnier, but they certainly appear to be getting nastier. The strategy seems to be ‚Äúif we tell a big enough lie often enough, it will become the dominant maritime.‚Äù 

Or something like that.I quit reading at that point. I‚Äôm happy to read opposing views if they are intellectually honest. This is not that. This boils my blood. Having that much access to JBP and then just pissing all over it. I feel sorry for his former clients who paid for the privilege of sitting down with him for what little time he could spare. Especially now that his practice is on hold while he goes on tour. She admits she hasn't even read the book and calls it "hate-reading" to do so. 

https://twitter.com/baileys/status/998659530170032128His grunting into the mic when Dr. Peterson was talking just obliterated any shred of respect I might have for his argument. His doubling down on the ‚Äúangry white man‚Äù (can‚Äôt remember if that was the exact quote) comment identifies him as Your run-of-the-mill race huckster. 

Edit: mic, not mileyeah dude no group responsibility in this.  Dyson is a douche all on his own, plain for all to see.But then they‚Äôd be handicapped since they haven‚Äôt had to base a conversation in logic and facts.I thought his biggest mistake was not thinking. He just hauled out the usual worn talking points. He was so bad that he overshadowed Goldberg‚Äôs clearly antagonistic swipes at Dr. Peterson. I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôve been to a lot of black baptist churches and if they let Dr. Peterson speak, half or more of the congregation will be with him before the end. Well done. For those that are unwilling to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù 2 hours of their life to watch the debate, this is a good recap. Couldn‚Äôt even get to that part. I stop reading when they start lying. I actually don‚Äôt believe that they are all, even some of the worst offenders, intent on lying. But their worldview is like wearing a pair of pink tinted glasses: no matter how long they look at and investigate a white shirt, they are just never going to see it as white. And, they‚Äôve had the glasses (worldview) on for so long it‚Äôs now part of their identity- they refuse to believe they have on sunglasses. 

The only ones I trust are the ones that say ‚Äúsure I have on glasses, here‚Äôs what mine are...

Cause we all have ‚Äòem. 

The problem with PC, is that we are all being forced to wear the same ones. And woe be it unto you if you dare take them off or exchange them. 

Thus the rise of the IDW: ‚ÄúHey, how do you see ‚ÄòX‚Äô? Here‚Äôs how I see it. Well now, that‚Äôs interesting.

Even if I understood it. oh no... what have I clicked on?Welcome news.In the US, you typically graduate High School at 18. While seeking a college degree (typically 4yrs)  you are referred to as an undergrad. Once you are seeking an advanced degree, you are referred to as a graduate student or grad student. Does that help?Your analogy only holds true if all the dice are exactly the same. Humans are not the same in interests, abilities, skills, needs, desires, and a plethora of other variances.  haha please God someone just whisper that magical advice into our ears... in the form of a reply to this post!I feel like I've heard one of my friends make a similar sounding set of statements before.  You sure we aren't already best friends poopntute?  Wait a sec, Bobby Joe, is that you?  I always knew you'd make a great GI (gastroenterology) doctorExactly. As Dr. Peterson has pointed out, if you extrapolate intersectionality to its finite conclusion, you end up at the individual. And the best decision maker for the individual is that individual. This sounds like correlation instead of causation and it‚Äôs done on a univariate scale, which isn‚Äôt a robust or reliable technique.  

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really the necessity of the outcomes, to gauge the opportunity.‚Äù

If I understand your concern correctly (and I may not), you are asking why equal outcomes are a-priori necessary to establish equal opportunity. 

Am I close? 

That‚Äôs the beauty of it: they are free to think idiot thoughts and even to repeat them. Great. And thanks for the conversation.

1) The problem with Equality of Outcomes is that it must first be defined. Is it only by sex? By race? By skill? Should football teams have equal representation of male and female, short and tall, old and young? Should we quota race as well? The reason it is political and fundamentally terrifying is that someone, or some group, has to define what Equality of Outcomes even means. 

Then some one has to enforce it. And whoever disagrees, and says ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt make any sense! I‚Äôm old, short and fat. I don‚Äôt want to play football,‚Äù becomes an enemy of Equality and of the State. Result: 100‚Äôs of millions killed in the 20th century from both right and left totalitarian States. 

2) I believe you measure Equality of opportunity by the rule of law. Is there any law standing in your way of becoming a doctor or a lawyer? Im not asking if there are obstacles. There are always obstacles. That‚Äôs life. In fact, that‚Äôs what keeps life interesting. 

Equality of Opportunity means you get to decide what you want to do and who you want to become. Without any outside interference. And the rest of us get to judge you on your competence.

Orwell presents it much better in Animal Farm. Highly recommend.

It is certainly a factor!Well now, I could make a case that you should be able to hang out a shingle and start a law firm without doing either. The market would take care of you pretty quickly. So perhaps I should have chose a better example. The fact is that the State is already so involved in control and licensing (in the US) that it‚Äôs difficult. 

So to go back to the concept. You and I decide to run a 100 yard foot race (and there is no law preventing either of from doing so.) You show up fit and in shape with proper running attire and the best new shoes. I, on the other hand, show up old, fat, hungover and wearing jeans and sneakers. 

We both have the opportunity to try and win the race. No one is standing there with a gun (representing the State‚Äôs monopoly on violence) and saying that you can‚Äôt race because you are ‚Äúx‚Äù (inserts any immutable characteristic). 

It doesn‚Äôt matter how many times we run the race. Unless you fall on your face and knock yourself out, you are going to win 100% of the time. In fact the more races we run, the more likely you will be to win each successive race.

The only way to achieve equal outcomes is for someone to force you to run in sneakers, wear jeans, and load you up with enough weight that I start winning half the time.

The fundamental argument is this: To guarantee Equality of Outcome, you must pull the highest performers down to the level of the lowest performers. 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Tbh he also has videos that show Peterson in a good light so I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs necessarily trying to ruin JBP‚Äôs rep.JBP would be so embarrassed by the thread.
I can‚Äôt believe that everyone is jumping to a ‚ÄúIslamic Rapists‚Äù or ‚ÄúLive in a Muslim country, see how you like it‚Äù train. JBP is not a pro-white nor a pro-anyothercolour guy. He literally talks about individuals. You....as in, not your colour or your religion or whatever...just you as a person. This thread got overtaken by highly questionable individuals.
Edit: totally unrelated but she‚Äôs hot af btw!The comment was in response to the anti Muslim and ‚ÄúOh is it cause I‚Äôm white‚Äù rhetoric across this thread.
The bottom line is,  this is a Jordan Peterson subreddit. He wouldn‚Äôt like to be associated with the likes of the lady in the video and Tommy Robinson. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs sub Reddit‚Äôs for these types of videos.It seems as though you know more about Islam than me...a Muslim. Also, I wasn‚Äôt talking about individualism in Islam.

Your goal should be to conjure an aura of greatness around you. No this is not some fancy witch bullshit. Everyone exerts an aura, make yours great. Auras come from the root of your soul and extend outwards, there's no way to fake your aura.

Also not many men are able to get really hot women. You should expect to bang some 6s or 7s if you're lucky. If you want to fuck hot women get ready to pay. It's probably not that bad &lt;$500 to fuck a hot girl? Why not?

edit: and no one cares about your fat ass pathetic ass at the gym. I'm pretty fit and lift heavy and the only thing I think about when I see unfit people at the gym is that they're not giving any effort. I'm neutral that they're there but judgemental about their effort.Start by posting a picture then. You have to put yourself out in the world to be judged and take it if you want to become anyone close to someone fucking hot girls. First of all they're no where near comparable.

Jordan Peterson has a PHD and has taught at Harvard and is a tenured professor at UofT. He's been doing clinical work since before Milo was born.

Milo is a troll with a desire to be famous while being outspoken.

Jordan Peterson has been doing what he's been doing in university classrooms for decades, only now its exploded due to the internet and timing perhaps. Not really a fan of Shapiro and Harris to be honest. The rest are pretty cool.Tbh, I‚Äôve tried to listen to one of Sam‚Äôs podcasts and I just find his tone so boring and kind of a monotone type voice. It puts me to sleep lol. Another reason I don‚Äôt really like to listen to him, is that I think in one of his books he said to fix the Middle East would be to bomb the crap out of it. As a Muslim, i believe it‚Äôs ridiculous that he says that. However, I get why people like him. I mean, he is really good at talking through ideas and debating.
Shapiro just seems like a dick though! üòÇüòÇThat‚Äôs so true! Never actually thought about that. They don‚Äôt agree on so much and are still good friends.....THAT‚ÄôS the big takeaway from this pic.I'd like someone to explain that House comment.Keep fighting the good fight.One of the key themes JBP hits on constantly is that if you can't solve  a problem try not to make it worse. OP is doing just that.

/u/DefaultDrake is also going through the process reorganizing his worldview and has had very little in the way of practical life experence. I don't expect him to present alternatives at this present moment and appreciate his shared testimony. Thus, I offer my sincere my encouragement.

But by all means have fun punching down at random strangers on the internet, I am sure that's what Jesus would do. /s

world: "omg yasss kween! tell that white man!"This guy has been shit posting on this sub for daaaays! You‚Äôre just posting one side of the argument!A girl has no name, a girl is no one.It really is pointless to argue with people like that unless they have some sort of reasoned logical grievance.  But the majority will say that everything out of his mouth no matter what it's about or what words make up the statement is transphobic is misogynist is you name it. it's fucking Trump derangement syndrome but Jordan Peterson it's Peterson derangement syndrome. Like if they don't want to experience the positivity the Jordan Peterson has brought to my life and to everyone else who follows hims life swallowing their sick resentment and self induced hell. It's a free countI'd have gone with "Said by a Schaden Freud." Especially given the context.Donate once to his Patreon, then. I'm sure he wouldn't mind people sharing his videos, as long as they're not doing it for profit.Hey at least your teach is trying Seriously though, Chomsky is of a different caliber. Peterson might become something close to that if he continues for 40 years.

Obviously the comparison with Chomsky and Shapiro is meant to incite a dichotomy with Chomsky on one side as the standard to be measured against and Peterson and Shapiro as quasi newbies. I think that there is something to be said for this comparison at the same time it is almost trolling. Not Shapiro or Peterson would ever mention their own name in the same breath as Chomsky. 

They are each dealing with audience very differently and their approaches are hardly comparable.

Therefore, nothing to see here, move on.Actually i agree.Blood bowl frwIts simple. There's a case of Jordan Peterson derangement syndrome developing people I just like the Donald Trump derangement syndrome. I can personally attest to this because my roommate is an insufferable fucking moron piece of shit foaming at the mouth idealog loony Lefty and he has said some of the fucking most out they're cartoonish silly shit about Jordan PetersonLooking how white they appear to the camera, I'd assume.https://globalnews.ca/news/4330893/doug-ford-ontario-1998-sex-ed-curriculum-teachers/

This is the article that she was quoting, and it's not got any swear words nor even the phrase "good luck."  
And in the whole context of the video it certainly seems like it's coming out of his mouth.

I don't especially care if he swears, but it's interesting to see how much less eloquent he gets when he's relaxed.Dark Syde PetersonYeh it is coooThis shit is dope. Thanks for turning me on to this. I once met a woman who's mother survived the cultural revolution by finding mouse holes and stealing grain the mice had stored for the winter... while she was pregnant with her 2nd child. The cultural revolution was no joke man.

The lies in this article are pretty transparent to anyone who can follow what **Dr.** Peterson is talking about and care about truth and context. 

MDs and PhDs are often difficult to follow because they have a different, more specific way of talking. If you don't swim in those circles of people regularly it takes a lot of focus.Sounds like a load of cryptocommunism.Same as whatever "crypto-fascism" is but with communism.  
I despise this nonsense word game these SJWs make up. It's actually disgusting. I was just reversing the polarity so that one of them might see it, and think to themself,  
"wow, I must sound like a real fucking idiot."Israel has done it a few times.Sounds like a teenager. Teens have been trolling since the beginning of time. Other adolescent apes do the same. I do believe this adolescent is sincere in their inquiry but doesn't know how to deal with strangers on the internet appropriately.&gt;13) We demand the nationalisation of all (previous) associated industries (trusts).

Yeah not left wing *at all.* /s1. There's an evolutionary foundation for ethics (Haidt, Peterson, etc.)
2. Different groups have different ethical systems built on the same evolutionary foundation
3. Ethical systems cease to exist when they are no longer employed by an individual or group

Sounds like group selection to me. Sure, I'm going to lay it out as a set of premises. 

* Religion is a persistent aspect of social organization.
* Religious thought is not wholly static (Catholicism in Mexico, Greco-Buddhism, etc.).
* One characteristic of religion is an agreed upon set of ethics (Tao Te Ching, Ten Commandments, Sharia Law, etc.).
* Having an agreed upon set of ethics contributes to, among other things, social cohesion.
* A cohesive group is better able to respond to threats (war, famine, disease, etc.).
* A cohesive group is better able to raise young who are reliable members of the group.
* Groups whose religious and ethical systems are no longer capable of conferring these sorts of benefits are eventually out competed by those groups whose religious and ethical systems are capable (Christianity and Roman Paganism, Islam and Zoroastrianism, etc.). I agree but I think we may have a misunderstanding.

Christians out competed pagans through syncretism (mutation), conversion (reproduction), social incentives, etc. Religions aren't discrete traits; they're more like an organism.

This idea springboards off of the meme concept Richard Dawkins popularized.This is a rhetorical question, but it's got some nasty phrasing. The question is "better." And you don't know within which context "Better" is judged.


Does overcoming evil mean that you're still evil by nature? Obviously so.

Is a fake worth more than the real thing?
To quote an anime called Monogatari (series), which I recommend,  
&gt;1. The real thing would be worth more because it's the original, genuine article to which the fake is measured against.  
&gt;2. Both the Fake and Real thing are assumed indistinguishable, therefore the both hold identical value.  
&gt;3. The fake is worth more because the effort put in to counterfeit the original is far greater, where as the original is effortless.

I think this is the tell. I think the trailer is bait for NPCs.The NPC term is a jab joke and highlights commentors who don't get it.

Edit: For those who can't take a joke, please JBP short on a man named lunchbox.It's easy to blow this out of perportion. Honestly the progressive left lost the moral high ground haphazardly throwing around alt-right and Nazi lables. To people like me, it's hilarious and we don't care if people like you don't get it. If anything it makes it funnier.

There are many games where NPCs are beloved by the player. There are plenty of games where I have given my NPC companions more attention than RL acquaintances. I am an NPC when it comes to a lot of things in life. I am no player in politics or business. I have some limited sway in my local community but beyond that, not much going on.

In my mind it isn't much different than calling people sheeple. Sometimes it's appropriate.

Have you seen jbp talk about ~~lunchbox~~ lunchbucket?
