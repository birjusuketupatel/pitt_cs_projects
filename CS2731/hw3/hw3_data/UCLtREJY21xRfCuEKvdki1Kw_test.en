Hey guys, so, I have been thinking about this for a while. I've noticed that Ethan has been talking about suicide in the past few months or so. I feel like I could give some serious insight into the mentality of people who are on that mindset. I have been living with mental illness since i was in second grade. I have had a history of being abused emotionally, and a bit of physical abuse. I have struggled with self harm and suicidality. I have attempted about six times, and thank God I failed every time. I feel like there is a "stigma" and an aura of misunderstanding regarding suicide and mental illness. It definitely has lasting impacts on my daily life. I am happy to say that i am no longer suicidal. I was very lucky, but I want to be able to help others. If there is any way I could share my story and insights, it eould mean the world to me.Bitwit is a youtuber that also does technology, but his humor is more along the lines of Ethan's tastes. He tends to keep his videos upbeat and with a good amount of sketches and humor embedded in them. Kyle's wife, Heather (AKA Wifey Sauce) is also one for the same type of humor and seems generally down for anything. I think that Kyle and his wife would bring something good to the table for both Ethan and Hila. Both of them are talkative so there wouldnt be much of any stand stills if they were to be on the show. Another good reason is location. Kyle and Heather live in Southern California, a trip to the H3 podcast would be *very* doable and close by. They may have even driven by the studio already without realizing it. 

For those who may think " *It's probably too much tech/gaming to work* " , there lies the beauty of this idea. Kyle and Heather often stray away from tech in their videos and genuinely seem like they would be the life of a party. 

This has been my 2 cents...    *not JayzTwocents* .... appreciate yaLike I mean we've been rekt, rekt again, forever rekt and rekt together I've been waitingI would be interesting to know where else is podcast popular, other than USA. 
Also, how about gender split? 
Does Twitch provide the stats?With JP coming to the podcast twice, it would be nice if you guys could get someone with a more left-leaning political view on the podcast. Russell Brand has not only really good points about society and political/social issues, but he is also intelligent, well-spoken and funny. Plus he has done a lot of interesting stuff in his life and career. I think it would make an awesome podcast.
Now I know he might not be the easiest guy to get on the podcast but this is just a minor suggestion.
What do you guys think?While watching the podcast live, I've summed up topics discussed and listed for you below. 
I'll add time stamps when VoD goes!

* Jordan's popularity and comments
* Soviet paintings
* Quora list rule 1
* Talk truth
* Atheism, bible and ethics
* Shame and rule 7
*  Yin yang, chaos and order
* Jordan's agenda
* Rule 9 and walking meaningful path
* Traveling and motivation
* Reading books vs listening to them
* "You need to be a fool to succeed"
* Try new things, YouTube and Patreon
* "people don't want something for nothing"
* Online University
* What is a car?
* Competitive writing
* Channel 4 interview and Ideological Blindness 
* Logan Paul
* Why Jordan wins?
* Ghost story 2
* Book end notes

Thanks!
P.S. I took this idea from TotalBiscuit's Cooptional podcastSo I saw this video once and I want to go back and find it... But it's burried deep in my history and I cant find it through key words...

It came up after watching the bit connect video, Ethan talked about different companies who ran "legal" pyramid schemes or as they liked to call them dimaryp schemes... If you need any more info I think I could scrape some up... Thanks in advance lol.I literally couldn’t care less about your politics. And mine are personal. So please no political debate.

I just think He would be an amazing guest, just like Jordan Peterson is. 

Would make a great contrast with Ethan’s more liberal views. 

Having both liberal and conservative guests will make things very interesting. 

A little emblem for my favorite YouTube channel. Papa bless!This song from their new album is very fitting as it talks about it somewhat
https://open.spotify.com/track/1OKSnabbYXjkgjsO1Yfiww?si=obD6IzcyQPugN3lpmB7doAHey All, 

In case you, like me, Have not had a chance to see the channel 4 interview with the most Epic Jordan Peterson and Channel 4 you can find it on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54). For maximum gaffage I suggest getting a nice sodipop, a slice of papas best, and reading the comments before watching the video. Some of the comments are gold and have only made watching the full thing even spicier. 

Naysh, What did you think of the video?Popped up in my recommended and i thought that it is just as messed up as the old prank invasion wave. Tell me if this could be a promo for this dude, i don't want to do anything wrong, but the fact that the man is making money making out with half-naked drunk girls on youtube is just stupid, and people is just ok with it in the comments. What's wrong nowadays..It's from an old video of him reacting to a news vid about texting turning into sextingHey guys, I recently made a video reviewing TidePods Laundry Detergent. Unfortunately it got taken down because it "encourages or promotes violent or dangerous acts". The video survided on FB, and would appreciate if I could get your guys' opinion on it. do you think what I did was worthy of not only a take down of my video but also a community guideline strike on my channel? Please let me know what you guys think. If there's any group of people who can call bullshit on youtube's claims it's you guys. Thanks in advance, Papa Bless.

The video in question:
https://www.facebook.com/HealiumCrackle/videos/2010109922645950/Looking for a spare code or someone willing to share the new years special. DM me please, I'm really lost and this is the only thing that makes sense to me from reading about it, reviews, and so forth. Help...I love Captain Disillusion and I love H3H3. Do you think  Captain Disillusion will show up in his suit ( Facepaint, Gloves, ECT)? Who else would you guys want on the podcast?He recently said that if anyone invited him he would most likely accept. Would love to have ReviewBrah on the podcastHi! A year ago, I came across a lofi type song which has sweet lines from Ethan to Hila. The only I remember is I found about it from a video which showcases a bunch of other similar songs. 

I also couldn't find the video where *I think* Ethan says something along the lines of "It felt like Hila saved me from a tsunami."

Send help. Appreciate ya.Simple question, what would be good recommendations thanks!Hi everyone!

I think Ethan is a terrible host. He has no flow with conversations and he asks a question gets an answer and then it's  brief awkward silence until he asks another one. Hilas input is usually just "....yeah".

I have some problems with rogan but he is really great with keeping the flow going. It's a conversation with questions thrown in.

I have never watched a podcast all the way through. Thee just seems to be no aim or focus.  And there main channel is virtually dead at this point.

Honestly it's been about two years now since they made anything truly decent. They were at their best in Israel and were great in New York but when they moved to LA there was a definite shift in their content. I know Ethan said he was depressed and that demonitization  effected the main channel but they are millionaires to be fair. I don't think them making ad revenue on a video will make or break them. 

I knew from the start this would happen when they announced the podcast. The channel "cooking naked tv" h3 covered back in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_F0ZZbcugc) actually has no of its successful videos left and had to start to make overly sexual contend with more than an apron on.https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_sacat=0&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;_nkw=haunted+dolls&amp;_sop=3

These things sell for hundreds of dollarsSo I was in art, and I’m drawing Ethan, but the picture I used was apparently, “too low quality” so my art teacher (who literally is the worst) asks me to use another one, I said I liked the one I was using but he wanted me to change it, so he asks what his name is to search up on google, I told him it was alright but he insisted, so I told him it was Ethan Klein so he searches it up and boy, did he see some good pictures of Ethan, I could see the look of disgust on his face and I  was so embararrased, and all he said was “he’s a weird guy”  my art teachers the preppy type, greased back hair, probably carries a mirror around all the time to check himself out and god do I hate him ( but now the feeling is probably mutual)So there's a kid that used to go to my school named Justin Schmidt. I recently found out that he made a Vlog channel at the end of 2017. Upon looking at a video I noticed that it looked a little bit odd that he was able to go into a VR store and record gameplay from it. 

So I decided to look into it and soon I realized that he was commentating over a video made by a content creator named "AllGamesWorldHd." He stole about a minute of his video and is passing it off as his own. 


[Justin Schmidt's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GwKQ2JI_Ho&amp;t=1s)

[AllGamesWorldHd Original Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXq9b8ipfEc&amp;t=10s)

In Justin's Video Skip to 4:44

In AllGamesWorldHd Skip to 3:35

Play them at the same time and you can see that they are perfectly synced together with Justin's video having shitty fake commentary or call outs to his girlfriend.

So after that he had a Google Earth VR part in the same video. So to me that video is stolen and after doing about 3 Mins of detective work I found the original video made by "Alexander Choban." The video is named "Google Earth VR - Manhattan." He stole about 2 Mins of Alexander Choban Video.

[Justin Schmidt's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GwKQ2JI_Ho&amp;t=1s)

[Alexander Choban's Original Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ4vdDW9sc8&amp;t=105s) 

In Justin's Video Skip to 6:34

In Alexander Choban Skip to 6:55 

Play them at the same time and you can see that they are perfectly synced together with Justin's video having shitty fake commentary.

Now this is the MAJOR ONE!

He posted a video called ["TRY NOT TO LAUGH *MISHEARD LYRICS*"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCKRXz7pyzo&amp;t=3s) And if you plug the title of the video into YouTube a video WITH THE SAME NAME COMES UP! The original video is made by [Foeko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKvBBfp8-ng)

So Justin Schmidt pretty much ripped off somebody else's video completely. On top of that he covered the water mark with his own. If you think it doesn't get any worse then you thought wrong. ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS he straight up copy and pasted description. FINALLY ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT he copied the tags. 

Now I know H3 doesn't expose smaller channels but this is ridiculous he has almost 20K subs. It's like he's a smaller Lance Stewart. I DIDN'T EVEN MENTION THE CLICK BAIT.

Here's a direct link to his channel - 

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKpchZ_8kOYrN_-lPIuK6ZA

Just go look at the S&amp;%t Posting he does. 

This channel does not deserve to grow by stealing others content and click baiting. End it before it gets to the point where it can't be stopped!
 






I can't seem to find the video it's in, but I loved when he said you should shock everybody, and give your elders a heart a attack lmao. Anybody know which video it is?I forced myself to sit through the last one where he came off like an idiot and tried to plug his "personality test" as much as he could. I really can't believe they had him back, because he's such a slimy guy out for attention.

Is there nobody else they could have gotten?Dan from game grumps was talking about how he was watching one of h3s videos and how much he enjoyed it. Please Papa Ethan get them on the podcast &lt;3If you want to post a Suggestion on this sub, you must do it in these threads. If you don't post it here, the post will be deleted.

FYI: This is how you hyperlink text: [your text here](Link)
Hopped onto Youtube today and saw a recommended video for h3h3 podcast highlights and I'm curious to know if its actually H3 or just some ripoff trying to steal money. I'm straight as a whistle but Ethan can smash my ass whenever he wants baby. Ohh daddy Every time I listen to the podcast I hear about a company that sponsors the podcast but by the time I'm home I've forgotten what it was and never order anything. Is there a list of all the companies like Dollar Shave Club I can refer to?I know he’s probably a busy guy, but Ethan and Hila have had pretty big celebrities before right? Opinions?I didn't believe this would happen to me, but we actually watched the Coby Persin catfish video today in school. l0lI know that Ethan and Hila has always tried to toe the line politically and play a centrist role.  There is little wrong with this and it honestly fits their persona as the 'moral center of youtube'.

Recently though, the tone and politics of their videos have started to skew fairly obviously to the right and I can't help but imagine this is due to their interactions with Jordan Peterson.  There isn't an issue with started to become more conservative but there is an issue with spreading Peterson's message as something worthwhile.  Peterson is and has always been a snake oil salesmen of sorts who just uses thinly veiled Social Darwinism and often  unsubstantiated studies to push his own political message disguised as science, namely psychology. 

I'm by no means trying to police who they have on the show or even less so who they interact with, but does it bother anyone else that they're giving someone like this a message on a platform that has always been one of relative reason and coming from a place of 'centrist' ideology.  I can't help but think that this lends far more credibility and audience to his word than he has ever received before.

I might be screaming into a void here and if so I'll shut up, but I feel like I cant be the only one who worries about this.Summer will be here in a few months and I need my summer look, but I can't find a place that's selling the hat or the shorts. Does anybody know where I can find them?So I listen my podcasts on podcast addict because it's handier and then i can download my podcasts but does this support hila and Ethan ? Do they put it up there or just some random dude. Will me listening count as views for their sponsors ? I need to find the clip where Ethan goes "Gotem" and smiles while saying that. Hope you guys can help me &lt;3yo, can we get some unbiased expert talking about AI? I always here ethan quoting musk on it, and i'm just a random programmer on the intertubes dabbling in AI, but a lot of stuff seems a bit far fetched to me.

I'd really like some discussion with an expert that actually builds machine learning stuff.

I mean, machine learning is what gave us deepfakes, so it can't be that bad, right ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)y'all gotta bring Dj akademiks, do it for the cultureA president using taxes to give himself a parade, a car driving in space, the rain water turning our frogs gay, and the rising amount of ships falling over the edge of our disk shaped planet. It is time for the Musk to speak his mind on the H3 Podcast before the Zuck takes over the air waves with robotic brainwashing frequencies thus enslaving us all and forcing us to OD on that sweet Facebook powder.

-sincerely,
A concerned citizen of the Nation of the VapeI’ve really wanted him In more podcasts very entertaining guy please consider.I've been watching David Lettermans show on Netflix. I love his personality and would like to see him make an appearance on the h3 podcast. I think he has some great insights on life and funny stories to share with us. 
Seeing how ethan and hila treat their guests it would make a great collaboration

I don't know if this is a realistic guest as he has very little connection to internet culture. But I'd like to hear your opinion.appreciate yaHowdy fupa lads and ladies, just wanted to drop a quick Papa bless for the H3 crew! I work at a group home for teenage boys and I have an hour drive every Saturday and Sunday both ways and I always have the latest Podcast downloaded. I feel like you guys are family. You make me laugh, cry and blow my high in the best kind of way! Love you guys and keep slamming my dudes!

-honorable citizen of the Nation of the VapeI'm not sure if Jeff ever does this kind of thing but some reasons why I think it would work out. 

1. Podcast audience of twitch, youtubers, gamers, ect. would all enjoy and find relevant. 

2. Ethan likes Overwatch and used to play WoW (most likely in the period of time when Jeff was working on it.

3. Jeff is pretty sociable and funny/interesting. The Podcast would be really interesting, entertaining, and also good PR for current Overwatch League probably. 

Thoughts?In the last podcast of season one Ethan talked about stepping up the number of podcasts to several a week with the big guest interview podcast on the Friday. Any updates on this?  I like the rambling podcasts and enjoy listening to Ethan's stream of consciousness. I don't know if this is mentioned before but I've been seeing Facebook "Videos" of just a still image. I believe it's part of a cash grab of people cheating the algorithm to get views without people knowing it's a video since Facebook just automatically plays it. I believe Facebook originally cracked down and didn't monetize videos that didn't move. But now It's basically just a picture with floating shapes around it. So they have cheated the algorithm again.

[example](https://www.facebook.com/820752194760229/videos/897188807116567/)Ethan, if you are reading this, I need your help. One of my facebook friends shared a Rick Lax video about him giving his girlfriend "FEMALE VIAGRA" and I wasn't wearing the correct safety gear. I now have stage 14 cancer. The only thing that can save me now is if you DADDY THE FUCK UP ON HIM. Please help me Ethan-Wan Kleinobi. You're my only hope. 
papa bless I'm just out of the loop. I've been edging myself all week for this Captain Disillusion video, but now it's only on Twitch. 

Please advise. What is delay between twitch and YouTube uploads?

EditBIT CONNECT!!!!!Right? I'm like 99.99% sure, but I'd figure Ethan would know by now and would say something. Or is it teasing for a Psychic Pebbles podcast? Hi everyone!

Ethan really seemed like he wanted to give him an opportunity and that seems like one.  Maybe get some sponsors and make it a real thing?We need him in there!I created an h3h3 piece, inspired by vape nation, in art class at my high school. It is a linoleum print, a process in which you cut a rubber like material, which is then inked and pressed. My teacher decided to put it in a show, and it won "Best in Show" out of 70 other pieces. The piece was mentioned in my local paper, with a small description of "h3h3." Happy I got to rep the nation and slip my boy into my local scene. Papa Bless. I could tell at first by the way he talked when doing the Jordan impression, and then the Trump on solidified my opinion further. Then on the Captain Disillusion podcast he said that they were going to have Psychicpebbles on as a guest in a few weeks.Is this Jordan kid a character that E+H have created or is he legit.
His call on the CaptainDisillusion episode had me in stitches.


It's kind of a win/win because if he's a creation then it's a masterpiece... and if he's just a LP fan then... wow haha :)

FYI: This is how you hyperlink text: [your text here](Link)
So it’s a V on the left, and an ^ on the right. How exactly does that equal VN? Should it be VV because with VV, you can see a V on the left, and then use the right line on the V, to start the N and use the right V to finish it. 

Unless I’m seeing something wrong. I thought I understood the signal, but now I just don’t see what it’s supposed to be I was curious about what kind of gear you use to do your podcast?

Like microphones, boards and cameras? And how do you get your sound effects that hila drops sometimes to play or do you have a hotkey machine?

I am really curious if you enjoy your equipment or have recommendations to what kind of board, mics and cameras to get for someone looking to create something themselves. Is it just me or does anybody else think that this Jordan kid calling into the podcast and Ian letting him through multiple times is a bit fishy? I have a feeling that they’re all in on it and maybe it’s Justin who keeps calling in so they can “keep things interesting”. It just seems too “off” to be totally real. Maybe I’m wrong. What are your guys’ thoughts?it would be a good episodehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycuMyyqBWQY&amp;ab_channel=CaseyNeistat

Ethan &amp; Hila should comment on this video in the next podcast. As a youtube fan, as soon as I watched it I wanted to know the take from Papa Bless &amp; Hila Kliner themselves Im trying to find the episode of the podcast were they are watching news clip were the guys eyes glitch and look really creepy for a split second. does anyone know which one it is./u/kambam95 is [the](https://i.imgur.com/nexyBbH.jpg) [VapeNaysh](https://i.redd.it/87l9xsn6s3f01.png) [guy](https://youtu.be/qtiOdWwLMQw?t=8m2s) who hit the [/r/h3h3productions](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/7waigz/korea_reping_the_nash/) and [/r/gifs frontpage] (https://i.imgur.com/AGmFUDe.gifv) a couple of days ago.

Let's all wish him good luck! :)Did Klein ever retract the multitude of falsehoods he spread about the Dresden bombing of 1945? Such as:
 
* pretending that the deathcount was 300.000 (it was 25.000)

* pretending that Dresden was a purely civilian city at the time (it was a major transportation hub for inmates of concentration camps, weapons, troops and a significant amount of weapon manifacturing)

* pretending that the bombing occurred AFTER the unconditional surrender of the German Reich (It happened several months before the German surrender with warfare going on, the German Reich destroying German infrastructure, people dying in concentration camps)

* many other falsehoods stated by Klein, but let's focus on the major 3.

I find it incredibly distasteful for every person killed in those bombings, to have their legacy smeared by NSDAP propaganda, which is being repeated by Neo-Nazi propaganda to this day for revisionist lies.

They're doing this because its easier than stabbing someone. This has nothing to do with terrorism. Its usually Black, White and Turkish people In Gangs.

He pretty much did an Moe and Ethan Bradberry by going to the ghetto to get the best reactions.This is in North London, near the Tottenham's Stadium which is a football stadium for those who didn't know. Its currently being upgraded so that there are massive events such as American Football and live performances. Government is spending billions in this area in an obvious attempt of gentrifcation. 

He got very lucky because people here make sure they get there revenge whether its as soon as they get attacked or in a year.its 2/3rds into the videoHila kisses Ethan on camera for the first time.

Adult Protective Services has been notified since Hila is clearly taking advantage of a disabled diaper boy. We finally got the evidence we need boys! Lock her up!I just wanted to thank everyone in this community for being so welcoming. One of my closest friends Mali, took his own life around 2 weeks ago, I showed him h3h3 last year and we would watch the podcast every time he slept over. Watching it now just doesn’t feel the same. Sorry to depress your day lol , love you guys. Papa bless Honestly, I really miss Ethan and Hila. Their story videos and stuff like that were always my favorite.Im new to Reddit and i don’t understand what Karma is and what it does. Thanks for understanding im just trying to learn. Do you like it better or worse now that you guys have less of a part in your channel? Like now that you have a big team of people are you happier, or did you liked it better when it was just you two and maybe a camera man? Do you feel that you have less freedom now that you’re so succesful?I love h3h3 but iv never heard a more annoying voice in my life from this new guy. Is he just a guest? I literally cant listen to these without his voice cutting straight through me. No offence to the guy but some people have faces for radio and some people have voices for junior chess club.The podcast isn't showing up correctly on youtube so here's the link if anyone wants to watch who can't find it.

edit: added ' to heresWhen I watched today’s podcast, it seemed like Ethan has a bit of weight. I remember he mentioned he had started working with a personal trainer recently. Simply wanted to make a positive post supporting his efforts, not that we don’t love him big or small!I was in shock and just went along with everything. https://www.yelp.com/biz/fresh-brothers-santa-monica-2In the UK, Acid attacks are not related to young arab men according to this article.

I am a big fan of the show but I hate the ignorant assumptions ethan makes sometimes regarding muslims or arabs. I hope he understands that the show has fans from all over the world and " with great power comes great responsibility" lol.It never even blamed Elon for any of it, it was literally just pointing out a trend and they took it as an attack on Musk, then an attack on them for not caring enough.  All it said was "I'm depressed about this."

And the way they talked about moral responsibility, it's okay to question the idea that rich people are justified in doing whatever they want.  With great power comes great responsibility, and they're basically saying "Nope, you earned it, no strings attached go have fun."  It's a zero-sum game, money is not an infinite resource, it's okay to have a debate about how much responsibility for it's use falls on the rich.  I'm on their side over all, but I just thought it was really weird to seek out an article of someone just expressing their opinion, in an opinion piece, and argue that they couldn't be happy because this person was depressed about an event.  

It's not that different from their argument about the far left trying to change the nature of language.  Whether it's changing the nature of language, or changing the nature of opinion, you're limiting people's ability to communicate effectively.  It's easy to characterize someone's opinion in a way that's favorable to your argument, especially when they're not there.The one about women in comedy? I haven’t been able to find it Just realized this when watching the newest episode, can still find it via search but can't see it in sub feed or in the uploads section of the channeljust wanted to let people know before misinformation spreadsdon't wanna invade any safe spaces but ever since Ethan has started with his Peterson support I can't take him seriously anymore. Peterson is not a bright intellectual, he isn't a totally rational genius. His attacks on what he calls "postmodern marxism" reveal him to be an intellectually dishonest and, quite frankly, very stupid reactionary bullshitter.Pretty glad about it. Not many Armenians get to have a platform on YouTube (yea, Kim Kardashian does not count). Most big ones are just like Artist PR accounts, not actual youtubers. 

Alan Melikdjanian  did not say much about his Armenian heritage apart from his dad being Armenian (and mom from Russia), which is where he got his “-ian” or “-yan” surname ending. 

I am an Armenian youtuber myself and watching that podcast made me happy :)Its like me browsing reddit, but being narrated by people I like. I have seen the light. 

I spend hours online finding something that interests me, then reading comments and articles about it, and reflecting on it by myself. Now I can have this experience narrated by funny youtubers? I think we might have something really special here.

I don't believe h3h3 set out to make an educational podcast, or a political podcast. I dont necessarily surf the net for educational/ political reasons. Someimes my searching will bring me to those places but its incidental. I think the H3 podcast is the same, and they just want to be interesting. Ethan and Hila find "fascinating" topics and trending stories, then they share thoughts on the topic with a collection of awesome youtubers like Vsauce, Jacksfilms, Psychicpebbles, and Erik! These youtubers and their opinions are not only interesting, but deepen the discussion, and provide insight into their own personalities. The podcast is like grabbing a beer with good friends, and shooting the shit, but with a focus on internet/youtube culture.

Fuck yeah.
This super annoying video (~~Time Traveler From 2030 LIE DETECTOR Test~~) about the guy from 2030 was being called on Dutch television and in there also was an article about it in the newspaper . I watched the video and it is absolutely ridiculous, but some people still believe in that really annoys me. The answers are clearly made up by a 16-year old boy. Here is some ridiculous stuff in it:

* Trump will be president for the 2nd time. She will be followed up by this woman who has been dead for more than ten years (Yolanda King).
* Smartphones will be bigger, operate faster and internet will be faster. Also, VR will be better, faster, smoother and you might not see the pixels anmore. All in all, these were very creative answers giving more absolute insight in the technology of the future.
* Trains will run on....badum...electricity! Wow, we don't have that many electric trains right now. Most of them run on steam now. 
*  Time travelling is possible by going underground and encloaking yourself in "a bunch of" electricity. Seems easy enough. Also makes sense that they only send this young boy from 2030 to us and no one afterwards to 2018 or earlier. Also doesn't explain why 2018 is so important.
* Now the biggest bullshit of all: climate change. Nothing really happens between now and 2030, BUT..it will become really hot. The temperature will rise with more than a couple degrees! In reality this would be really catastrophic globally, but nothing happens in particular in this story. It just becomes a lot hotter, especially in California. Everyone in cold Europe is fine though. 


Lastly, the detector is not shown on the screen and the actual X-ray is also not shown (only the photopshopped picture). My best guess is that the interviewer and the time traveler are friends in real-life. They don't know anything about the future, except that they will earn some good YT money. 

edit: And I haven't even talked about the fact that he should have a young version of himself in 2018 and relatives.

Despite all of this bullshirt, news websites still report this? ASS!
I just wanted to point out few mistakes, I noticed while watching latest podcast. First of all, there is NO continent of united states; Kelly Ripa has a show with Ryan Seacrest, NOT Kelly Clarkson and last but not least David Bowie's song is called Starman NOT spaceman. Anyway I love you guys and just want your show to be better.I saw the video months ago, and at the end they played a really cool blues guitar instrumental over the words at the end.

It wasnt a remix of the h3h3 theme or anything. They did link the original song but cant find it, or the video it was featured on.

Anyone have any clue what Im talking about? Would save me sifting through all their videos to find it...I'm curious about the price of shipping from teddyfresh to Europe. Their faq page is kinda vague. How much did it cost for you? ThanksI'm 4pm CT.. So it's 2pm pacific. Shouldn't they already have tweets confirming "so and so in a bit"

?

It's today right not next Thursday? I humbly beseech of all thee Reddit users to comment nut all over the internet, in YouTube comments, Twitter, Instagram even Tumblr. For no reason whatsoever giving no explanation just comment NUT everywhere

Yours sincerely 
A nut enthusiastEthan posted this on Facebook yet I'm not experiencing this issue and I'm posting here just to get his attention.

I don't think YouTube is screwing you in this case, it's just a glitch on your end somehow. The video has half a million views too, which I believe is in line with the sub count on the podcast channel.They should do another video on psychics and gurus, there's so much crazy shit............................they need to make money that's all....no problem....except it's BLEEPS IN AN H3 VIDEO!
Whatever, they gotta do what they gotta do to keep it half-monetized with their yellow $. I mean I see a midroll on my screen I don't know about yours.OH MY GOD IT SUCKS BRO -Ethan Klein 2018I was watching the fundraiser podcast for Irma and I thought of a great idea. I think it would be awesome if Ethan and Hila would do "Papa Bless" prayers for call-ins. Like if they did a prayer for the caller, to Papa John himself.So.... No podcast tonight? I was looking forward to this all day. I'm fine if they canceled but why zero information or anything letting us know? She is a great photographer. Think about it, the videos where Ethan and Hila are mobile and doing something, Hila finds a way to always come up with dynamic shots. They wouldn't be able to edit the footage the way they do if it weren't for her skills. Props Has Ethen decided to self-censor , because I feel like content has changed maybe I'm not aware but I feel like cursing is no longer standard have I missed out on something? Are they trying to reach a wider base which I have nothing wrong with, I just want to know the content these days.  Still love you guys honestly.Does anyone have any info on the equipment they use for the podcast? Like cameras, microphones, sound boards, streaming softwares? I'd love to know.I loved the video, but I was kinda surprised when he bleeped out words. I get that he needs to for the algorithm, and what not, but I was kinda disappointed and   Made me feel weird for Ethan  to do that [The Dumbest Products of all time](https://youtu.be/wLjza0c-ykQ)look at shanes channel, most of his recent videos are spooks and he is a intense conspiracy theorist, defiantly is gonna be spooky and wild, exicted for this oneWhat's the difference between a good YT prank and a bad one? Are there any good ones that you like? Do good ones even exist? I LOVE IT! This is one of the best vids in a long time! I’m so happy! The podcast is great and all but these videos are everything! appreciate yaI was watching their video about how they were drug dealers and he said that he graduated from college and couldn't get a job. What college was that?I have set a goal of being on the h3h3 couch for an episode, I have even gone as far as to request a none speaking role! Ive emailed semi regularly (but not extremely often in order to not bog the email) and also offered to pay/sponsor to no avail, so now im starting awareness campaigns. Im open to all feedback good or bad and the hope is just to raise awareness of my goal, I have no intention on self promotion.

If anybody would like to contact me, just private message me on reddit, maybe i will even give you my email and you can sell it on the internet. thanks for any and all support.Until the last video i thought he was pure yorkshire terrier but now i think its a mix with dachshund , what do you guys think? Just want to buy some of the shirts but I'm not sure which size will fit the best.Anyone know where I can get a Matter of Law shirt? My boyfriend really wants one, but they don't sell them with the rest of their merch anymore! Would love to get one! I couldnt find what he studied. Im interested in finding out thoughDoes anyone know when the podcasts are usually uploaded onto YouTube? I really want to see the Rhett and Link podcast, but I don’t have Twitch Prime. Thanks!I'm currently listening the podcast with Rhett &amp; Link and I just feel the Ethan is pushing the subject a little bit too muchI was looking to finally pick up the I Feel Like Shit jacket and it's completely gone from the Teddy Fresh website. What happened to it?which H3H3 shirt should I buy?What do you guys think about getting Ryan Higa on the podcast. I think it would be cool because he is a youtube og that has never really done interviews of podcaatsHaving James on the podcast would make a great episode. These peeps would work great for the podcast especially arin and dan Two months ago I made this prediction: https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/7e1rlf/theory_ethan_hila_working_on_live_in_front_of_a/

Tonight it was announced that the first step to this goal is being reached. h3h3productions posted this on facebook: &gt; "We're having a live podcast at the improv in Hollywood on March 14 , hopefully the first of many, looking forward to seeing you guys there"

You can buy tickets here: https://hollywood.improv.com/comedian/tw-eventinfo/H3H3/8105255/if anyone know of any video from top of their head where ethan says boiiiiiii plz let me know. much appreciate pappa blessI know you use it a little comically, but don't you wanna take some Tums to deal with the Acid Reflux thing? Like, that must hurt homie. I feel bad lolI haven't seen this since his last video. I'm relatively a new sub. I searched for ethan bradberry, slamberry etc but those give out too many results and strangely enough gives results from other channels too. It is strange because I'm searching in his videos tab on his channel, not the youtube search bar.

Anyway, if someone can link to first slamberry video, I'd appreciate it.Not trying to be controversial but I'm confused by the way Ethan keeps referring to these triggered SJWs as 'the far left'. I'll make these comments as neutral as I can. 

The far left is socialism and communism in the UK. The labour party, workers unions, momentum and Jeremy Corbyn; these are groups are associated with the left in the UK. Not these triggered liberals. 

These SJWs who are triggered and try and control they way people talk are just extreme liberals, who believe that identity politics is who you solve the worlds problems. 

The far left is against identity politics, so I don't understand why Ethan refers to then 'far left'. Is this an American thing? I hope Ethan don’t turn into one of those obnoxious dog owner. “Because it’s so cute, innocent and blameless”

Where your dog fail to learn boundaries is where the human have to set them. Link was trying to tell Ethan but he refuses to listen and proceed to justify it. 

Your guests have given you their time, the least you can do is to respect them and not letting every little thing in your life distracts you, especially when you are working. I find him interesting and given his new game is pretty popular he might be a fun guest to haveHis wife is Hila-rious He's one of the most hardcore and yet most genuine people on Youtube. He doesn't conform to the stereotypical Youtuber persona or editing style. He's been uploading for many years, has plenty of subscribers, but is still underrated imo.

I would love to see him interact with Ethan and Hila.Ethan https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.k2i-adUNBKdQ8pTBR1e0IgAAAA&amp;pid=15.1

Timer ends at 2018-03-01 00:00 west coast, 2018-03-01 08:00 GMTAfter the Rhet and Link podcast, I started to wonder what channels Ethan and Hila think are good. There was talk about a woman who is doing good stuff that I had never heard off, and will need to double back to check her out. I'd like to see a part of the top of the month or a specific video to give a recommendation to a video or channel to check out. A way to support good content that may be  getting left behind by youtube. Start rallying the lost channels being screwed by the ad revenue so they can build and grow without the direction of the algorithm and youtube.I still regularly watch the podcast, and I’ve been enjoying it a lot. However, I’ve pretty much lost all interest in the normal h3h3 uploads. Anyone else feel the same way, or am I alone here?The h3h3 podcast twitch channel is streaming some wierd shit. I havent seen much about it on the sub or twitter or anything. Just to let people know it isnt official h3h3. The accounts name is h3h3podcast (https://www.twitch.tv/h3h3podcast). The official h3h3 is h3h3productions (https://www.twitch.tv/h3h3productions). 

Most people wont know this is a thing because, unlike me, they used their brains and realized this account was fake while searching for ethan and hila on twitch. Just letting anyone who is curious know. 

There is 3 links on the twitch page. One links to a web page with a morphing cube and a discord link in the top left (https://extineiden.pw/).  The other is a twitter Account with one single tweet (https://twitter.com/extineiden). The final link is a straight to discord invite in which you must wait ten minutes before speaking in. Even after the 10 minutes you do not have permissions to speak.

This is most likely someone hoping to gain followers and change their usernames to look popular. Thought people should know about this mainly because i almost subbed to this twitch channel without thinking and some other people could do the same. just a heads up and a description of what happens if you go digging to save you some time and settle your curiosity. 

EDIT: Apparently its some sort of puzzle. The first clue is in the source code of the linked website i believe. I dont plan on cracking the code if it is some sort of puzzle but people should know. Since my post 2 photos of a girl/women have appeared on the stream. Also the twitter account linked in the stream only follows the podcast, Teddy Fresh, and Ethan and Hila's individual accounts (thanks u/parthosaur).Does the merch get restocked very often? I would love a block hoodie but it's always sold out I want to give thanks to these wonderful people for their content. I've been going through an incredibly rough emotional patch in my life (if a patch means like a year+, and if you don't belpieve me and you think this is karma whoring or something just check my post history), and I've taken to rewatching h3h3 content lately. Whenever I'm feeling bad I always can get a little smile from seeing another hilarious video of theirs. Thanks Ethan and Hila, you really, truly brighten up my day when I need it the most. I hope you come out of this horrible place too Ethan, you're a hell of a fighter.If you want to post a Suggestion on this sub, you must do it in these threads.

I was recently rewatching the Logan Paul Odyssey video when I noticed something interesting in the background. The Confidence Machine. You can see it here in this picture. 

https://i.imgur.com/Bd8neG1.png

I know in the Dumbest Products of all time video Ethan mentioned Hila has been buying up products for at least a year, in the time since their last Dumb Products video which they posted on alternate channel "Ethan and Hila." This got me wondering, when they did actually buy the Confidence Machine? Rather than asking them on Twitter I decided to do some half assed research. Here you can see the Confidence Machine in their newest video Dumbest Products of All Time where the Confidence Machine plays a major plot point. 

https://i.imgur.com/DXdZ2AZ.png

Good place to start. Knowing that I spotted the machine first in their Logan Paul Odyssey video I knew the machine had to have been purchased sometime before Jan 16th 2018. In true half assed research way I decided to click random videos until I found it. The first step is to recognize the background. H3H3 recently went through a background change. You may not have noticed it but you can see the difference between BBC Intorudces "Digital Blackface" and The Human Mail Challenge is Stupid videos. Here are some pictures for you to see for yourself. 

https://i.imgur.com/2yVL3sW.png

https://i.imgur.com/N7xfJdL.png

In the Human Mail video Ethan mentions at 0:52 that they just moved to a new house. Boom. We've got a new television set. In neither or those videos however did I once see a Confidence Machine. I was beginning to give up hope. I even did a quick half assed search through the "Ethan and Hila" channel videos but their recent videos take place in their gaming room or not their house. Scratch those off the list. Then I saw it. The light at the end of my ass tunnel. YouTube's Rules Don't Apply to Everyone. The Confidence Machine is there. 

https://i.imgur.com/KjZ1d9E.png

That video was added on October 8th, 2017. That puts the Confidence Machine in their ownership at least 4 months ago. They could've owned the machine longer than that and we just never got to see it. I tried to watch through older videos like Daddy of Five ft. Steve-O since you can get some decent shots of their living room but alas no Confidence Machine. My last ditch effort in this half assed adventure was to watch EXPERIMENT Glowing 1000 degree KNIFE ft. iDubbbzTV because you got many shots of Ethan and Hilas house including the Garage, Kitchen, Livingroom, and Guest Bedroom. No Confidence Machine to be seen. 

So there you go reddit. Your almost answer to a question no one asked. I didn't even ask this question but I did the half assed research. The first appearance of the Confidence Machine on H3H3Productions is YouTube's Rules Don't Apply to Everyone. During the podcast with with Good Mythical Morning they were talking about how MysteryGuitarMan was "wave 1 of youtubers". I found that quite interesting and was wondering how you guys would create the rest of the waves. 

Example:

Wave 1: Fred, Nigahiga, MysteryGuitarMan, Shane Dawson

Wave 2: RayWilliamJohnson, Smosh, Jenna Marbles

Wave 3: FreddieW, EpicMealTime, FPSRussia

Wave 4: 

Wave 5: Pewdiepie

Wave 6: Filthy Frank

Wave 7:

Wave 8: h3h3

Wave 9: Leafy

Wave 10: Maybe it's just me being nit picky, but as a working adult I don't have two hours to sit down and watch a single video, so I'll listen to podcasts at work, h3 of course, being one of them. However they do something that I never hear in other podcasts because it's just stupid. Watch videos. I don't want to hear an audio reaction from Ethan's mediocre improv comedy while he watches the latest meme for 15 minutes, it's just not entertaining, and I find myself skipping ahead through it anyway. On top of that, Dan or Ian or whoever needs to figure out how to balance levels becasue I'm also annoyed when the guest is whispering 40 miles away from the mic so I turn it up, then Ethan comes in later with the ear rape. It's not that hard to tell your guest how to use your mic, and if they don't, fix it in post. 

The podcast has obviously become E&amp;H's main project with their brand, and I think as a community we need to hold them to a higher standard. I love what they're doing, and I look forward to each episode, but some of the things they're doing just aren't great for us listeners (not viewers).So since I saw the video with Jake Paul offering to box comedyshortsgamer in public I’ve been thinking about how Jake was acting and I believe that during this video he was on cocaine.  4 minute 30 seconds into comedyshortsgamer’s video, keep an eye on his eyes, and his body.

Maybe I’m wrong but I wanna know what everyone else thinks. I know there’s been some speculation about him and coke use.Hey, just wondering if anyone else has experienced bad shipping?
I ordered socks on the 15th and they still didn't ship them out. Is it just me?Last night I listened to the h3h3 podcast with Rhett and Link. At about the hour mark, they began talking about the issue with ad's and demonetization, how channels such as Idubzzz's and Filthy Franks aren't being promoted or given the same opportunities as the Paul's. Well this afternoon I was reading "The Lion and the Unicorn: Part 1-England Your England, Section 3" essays first published by Orwell while living in London during the war in 1941. Orwell while talking about the British Press said something I thought was very applicable to the current situation with Youtube. Here's the link to the original paper. It's at the bottom of Section 3. 

-
-

&gt; Is the English press honest or dishonest? At normal times it is deeply dishonest. All the papers that matter live off their advertisements, and *the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over news.* Yet I do not suppose there is one paper in England that can be straightforwardly bribed with hard cash. In the France of the Third Republic all but a very few of the newspapers could notoriously be bought over the counter like so many pounds of cheese. Public life in England has never been openly scandalous. It has not reached the pitch of disintegration at which humbug can be dropped."

[Link](http://orwell.ru/library/essays/lion/english/e_eye)







I thought this passage would go along well with what's happening currently and might give Ethan and Hila some food for thought on the "Youtube situation" 

(Edit) Got rid of me smoking weed cause that's not relevant.I remember either in the episode with Brendan Greene, or Jordan Peterson Ethan said that Tommy was coming on the podcast, but he never did. Did he flake or what?The H3 podcast should take a note from [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/) and make a proper page listing all the podcasts, shownotes, and a thread to the reddit page for that episode.

I've been trying to find the thread for a particular episode of the H3 podcast here, and it's goddamn impossible. It probably doesn't even exist. What with two interns/producer or whatever, you'd think it was possible to be a little more proper than this.They used to be huge with hundreds of comments now they're nonexistantHey guys. Don't usually post here but something really strange has just happaned to me and I thought i should share. 

So do you guys know that show "How I Met Your Mother"? I'm a huge fan of the show but haven't seen it (or research about it online) for a couple of years. Yesterday, I was in college and started talking about it to a friend (5 min talk ). Well, I got home about 1 hour after that, and opened the YouTube app on my phone. The very first video on my box was a How I Met Your Mother clip... I was honestly a little confused but then I remembered a similiar topic being brought on one of the podcasts ( they were talking about Facebook listening to conversations).

Was this just a coincedence? Could YouTube actually be listening to our voice? Anyone has similiar experiences to this one?We get it. Logan Paul did some fucked up shit but now hes back to his usual cycle of shenanigans and seeing ethan try to find every way to connect it to some controversy is getting pretty old, for example, on the podcast with psychicpebbles when he brought up that tweet logan made, ethan tried to make it seem logan was making fun of the mentally challenged, that was a reach and even Hila saw it, i love ethan but seeing try to rile up every guest he has over logan paul is turning into a circle jerk, yall feel the same?

I remember watching the H3H3 edit videos first, what feels like forever ago. The first video I watched was the Ainsley Harriott exe video.I'd imagine that this has been talked to death on this subreddit, but after watching (in the middle of watching it now) the most recent H3podcast, I wanted to cough up my thoughts.  

I don't like ads.. no one likes them..so I don't watch them.  Right now my support method for creators I like is Patreon or merch.  I would be so happy to sub to a H3 patreon.  I would sub to a H3 podcast patreon too.  I think it makes good financial sense for the creator, long term to "make hay while the sun shines".  As the Adpocolypse has shown, things can change.. and they can change fast.  With that douche canoe LP and his dead body, and the ol' Pewdiepie debacle more dark times are coming.  We as fans want to support the creators we enjoy.  We don't want things for free (not in the long term).  We are looking to reciprocate.  I vote to get that Ian kid to put together some Patreon now that he's an assistant.  Let us help you entertain us.  love ya, appreciate ya all.
GO IAN!From redditor /u/CloneSix on /r/AskReddit : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7z3hja/what_is_your_favourite_conspiracy_theory/dul44k7/

YouTubers purposefully mispronounce words to get tons of comments and, therefore, traction to the video thanks to the algorithms. With the recent surprise of Ethan and Hila self-censoring themselves, does it spell the end for all things FUPA? Can they risk the ad dollars talking about Ethan’s thicc ‘fat upper pussy area’? 

I, for one, am not willing to lose anything FUPA related. What is h3h3 without it?I feel like these two could have a really funny collab especially if it was "fupa loss" themed.  I don't know if they have worked together or know of each other (I assume they have at least heard of each other). what do you think?Ethan &amp; Hila you guys should get Glink from YouTube on the podcast. Underrated and very talented YouTuber. Papa bless.Can you please make a video about Ed Bassmaster??What about Eric Andre on podcast? I wonder if Ethan and Hila like his work.H3 and I made the **EXACT SAME** workout gag, using the exact same music and overlay meme. Obviously I'm not saying he stole it ya dinguses, its just cool.

I was only able to catch the last 10-15 minutes of the podcast but what I was able to watch made me super uncomfortable. Ethan was asking Shane if he would be willing to share any names of creepy youtubers who he thinks might be pedophiles. It just felt really irresponsible and not something Ethan should be pushing someone to say on a podcast with as much reach as the H3 podcast.When will the new ep of H3 podcast will be uploaded with Shane dawson? I've been waiting for hours now.I figure at some point this must have happened: People like Jake or Logan Paul and prank invasion etc mainly appeal to the younger, less mature audiences who don't really know better yet.

There must be some fans of this kinda stuff who started to grow out of it and then discover a H3H3 reaction video of it via the related videos box and end up and switch sides.

 Has anyone here experienced this? any Jake paulers who turned into Hila Kleiners etc?I can't find it anywhere, a timestamp will work as well, but I remember Jordan calling again during the Rhett and Link podcast and it was so funny. I can only find clips of the first time he called in, any help?I think that it would be interesting to have coyote peterson on the podcast what do you guys think. He has to have some sick stories. After watching the new video about our boy Chris being a fucking tryhard I noticed that I got this feeling. A feeling I haven't had in a long time, a feeling of [rebirth](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/h3h3.png) and something new working far more than what I would've expected. They went out and really tried something new and I can't tell yet but I'm almost certain it will be extremely successful. I hope to see more of the "Closer Look" series if you wanna call it that or at least something similar.  Uhhh question? Is this you? Or someone stealing clips? I always see it and never watch. Pls help.I really like the H3 podcast, but there is something that I think would be an improvement on the format. In terms of audience engagement there is the question thread before the podcast, and the call-ins during the podcast. These are great, but not only are they underutilized, they also only cover pre and during the podcast. There is the discussion thread after the podcast, but they are pretty barren.


I think Ethan should, before every podcast dedicate say 30 minutes to discussing the previous podcast. Right now there's not a lot of point to the discussion threads, and this way the audience can give feedback and ask questions that are guaranteed to be revisited. The Hello Internet podcast does something similar, and it works well for them.Like the one with Skippy, the 30 y/o virgin, or Ryan Jaunzemis or Steven Reed
Videos with no over the stop message or being too judgemental. Or them being too self righteous towards the assholes of society.

Or videos where you don't hate the person they're talking about. Most their videos for a minute now became about JP and LP, Ajit Pai, Prank Invasion, or just anything insulting that Ethan tries to be self righteous about like he's trying to fix the world (i.e: Educational videos on youtube, Youtube rules don't apply to everybody, BBC Digital Blackface)

I get that they need to make videos about trends nowadays or stuff that will get a lot of views somehow. But they have to podcast, they should have more freedom on the H3H3 channel since they have a side one that's working well in terms of views and earnings.

Sometimes we (I) need some innocent fun, with Ethan and Hila being their funny selves without some kind of message or hate and rage filling the videos.

Anyway that's my too cents.Hey waddup, another Cris invasion video.

My boy matt champion from brockhampton always liking h3h3 posts on Instagram .  Just cool to know that he appreciate the fupaOdd question, I know.

The footage looks familiar to me, and I'm trying to figure out where the clip is from.

The clip I am talking about starts at [3:00](https://youtu.be/SV1ho61qaG4?t=3m).Catching up on old podcasts; on 39 w/Post Malone. What happened with this Patrice Wilson creepy livestream countdown?I can't find the magestic picture of shredder looking out the window that Ethan either posted on instagram and deleted or it was a story. 
It said "If you come into this house you will be assassinated"Random but I'm trying to perfect a cosplay costume I'm working on and the hood on Ethan's bodysuit is pretty much perfect. The one I have has an awkward bump on the hood directly in the middle. THANKS!!! Always got a kick out of watching him stream PUBG, but don't think he plays anymore?I'm a little out of the loop since I don't visit this subreddit and I don't follow H3 outside of youtube so I'm not sure if there was any more information on the subject. Kripparrian is one of my favourite streamers and was pretty excited to hear him on the show, I already know about the appendicitis thing and I was just wondering if there are any plans set in place to get my boy Kripp back in the lineup. Thanks guys.

-ya boyA lot of (all) of the youtubers Ethan interviews are "Mega" youtubers. Who else would be interested in h3 doing podcasts with somewhat smaller you tubers with dope content? I guess the emphasis for me isn't really on the subscribers. But I tend to usually find non-"mega" you tubers more interesting as people. Dr. Disrespect

Hi everyone! I’ve been a fan of H3 for quite sometime, but only recently become faithful with watching the podcast anytime it is live. the one issue is, i cannot really find the time weekly that it comes on. sometimes i get a twitch notification on my phone, other times i get no notification whatsoever and have to rewatch it on youtube. does anyone know the schedule?I don't know why I felt like saying this or if it makes any sense. But I feel like ever since Hila went though the voice training for Payday 2, her presence on camera and the podcast has been so much more open and less nervous/shy. 

I dunno. She just seems a lot more comfortable and it makes me happy because I love her. &lt;3 

Also, she's a great PR manager for Ethan when he starts getting side-tracked, lol.Thank you for calling out the douches and creeps of the world. It warms my heart to know you two are willing to face the cringe for the greater good of holding people accountable for their bullshit. &amp; Ethan I dont care what they say youre beautiful to me. Lets be honest we would all rather bang you than the shirtless ab flexing loser pick up artists making sad excuses for pranks. #Keepupthegoodwork! 👍👍 #HilaKleiners4lyfe! The FCC voted to kill net neutrality, letting internet providers like Verizon and Comcast impose new fees, throttle bandwidth, and censor online content. If this happens, subreddits like this one might not exist.

But we can still block the repeal using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), and we’re just *one vote away* from winning in the Senate and taking the fight to the House. That’s why we’re joining **[Operation: #OneMoreVote](https://www.battleforthenet.com/onemorevote)**, an Internet-wide day of action on February 27.

I have to parody a song for school projects any suggrstions?I know it sounds far fetched, but it would be a great way for some small channels on Youtube to get recognized, and it would also provide some great variety for a new podcast. Tell me what you think.I just really want to know if there is any significance to the part with Michelle Obama, it's been bothering me every time I watch a video lol.Just like the fucks that smear boogers in the urinals. Just call out complete assholes for a few videos. Go out and film the plebs being shitheads.I was thinking Elon Musk could be a guest on the podcast. You talked about him once maybe twice on one of the podcasts. I just think it would be cool having someone like him, Elon Musk, on it. 
Just a suggestion.

EDIT:
 
So I really didn’t explain why. 
I really think Elon Musk is a very influential man. Something this generation needs more of. Mr. Musk seems to be a laid back man who would probably be very fun to have on the H3 podcast.  He probably is very busy but he does do interviews which the podcast could happen with him. 

Hopefully Ethan and Hila see this!!!That would be great, thanks. Sincerely, someone who USED to be a fan. RIP Ethan. Hila: "Yeah..."A hoodie for $75? A t shirt for $35? Come on. As a construction worker I see crazy amounts of hate and swastikas in porta johns. I like to tag h3h3 over or next to them as a way to get back at them.  papa bless I mean I find it hard to believe that a Jew that preaches acceptance and kindness could be alt-right, but they all seem to think he's either actively or passively a recruitment tool for alt-right and white supremacist causes.Yo I'm trying OD on some juicy Salad memes but the video with the "Salad think tank", "Was it you Cobb?" is the line that made me want to watch it, I don't remember anything else in the video, but either way it's [been removed for violating terms of service!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2910852951&amp;feature=iv&amp;index=9&amp;list=PLjrhosP-Fp_qxqGhr82EIws4zreyANqj9&amp;src_vid=Dl6sPqdeaTM&amp;v=sYc2XLGmCLA) .  Did I miss this/can I watch the video somewhere else?Just curious.. Hoping it's awful.. Which video begins with Ethan in sunglasses saying “today we’re gonna be threatening people with physical violence”? [http://video.foxnews.com/v/5791558808001/?#sp=show\-clips](http://video.foxnews.com/v/5791558808001/?#sp=show-clips) \- More and more kids are going to capitalize on the opportunity the media gives them. My close friend is live on Facebook right now because her preteen daughter is a Jake Pauler. He's performing in Orlando tonight, and I tried to show her the way, but it was too late.



As the whole goofy troupe is being introduced, the announcer says "Jake Paulers!!!! That's an awful name by the way, it's literally just your name with 'ers' after it."

Otherwise, the show has been what you'd expect, pauses for everyone (Team 10 included) to watch too-long skits play out on a screen, immediately It's Everyday Bro, followed by another skit, then followed by a song which sounds exactly like It's Everyday Bro. 


It's like a kid has gotten a hold of a microphone and started screaming "Look what I can do, look what I can do, look what I can do," until a bunch of people actually did.Anybody seeing these ads on youtube? some guy talking about “the great lie.” Got a huge Tai Lopez vibe to it. Would like to see a video about him.I am sure a lot of you noticed it too. Ethan has become really unhappy and, by his own account, an asshole. His recent videos have been exremely cynical and his attitude has been changing from Silly reactionvideos and parodies to outright anger, over and over again. 
Even the H3 Podcast seems to be mostly about drama and shit. 
I really hoped that we could all move past Drama and Outrage but not in this climate. One of the reasons why I can not watch any commentary community videos either is because the entire genre seems to be more about furthering outrage and drama instead of solving it. I get it and many of you probably do too. They need to get money and drama seems to make a shitton of clicks but this is exceptionally toxic for the entire community and I feel like it is taking Ethan from us. 

His recent Social Media endevours regarding Roseanne and his Hiatus are really telling too. 
Ethan needs a break, but we need to help him too. 

I think it would be wonderful if Ethan could go back to Comedy videos. The last time I truly enjoyed his content with laughter was the Vape Nation video, because the rest is mostly complaining about stuff and the occasional wholesome content. 

I am glad that we can all have a reasonable dialogue here and I am glad that we can all be critical of Ethan because we care. 

The chances that he is reading this are very low. But if you are reading this Ethan, I hope you will get better soon. 

Papa bless.

http://time.com/5296435/florida-school-shooting-suspect-cellphone-video-stoneman-douglas/The video was a reaction video to a user on Facebook who said he could predict what you were thinking or do a magic trick (or something like that). I remember one of the goofs was on the fact that the user always said "but first, you have to like this video" and he would wait a few seconds before continuing his act.
They haven't uploaded in over 6 months... please... 

I need and answer.So that dope wizard shirt is on sale again.. but only in tshirts, did any one else want long sleeve or am I in the minority?Does anyone else think that Skippy bit went to far and was in really bad taste? I felt bad for him the whole time.I felt like Ethan and his team didn't  think at all when doing that. They knew the guy already had specific religious  beliefs and wanted to wait for marriage.  Just to get shit on andtold that his  religion  doesn't  exist and it's better  for him to just  fuck old ladies..

I hope that was all fake or something..

Though  Kyle did bring up a good point if he is waiting  for marriage why is that such an important part of him as a person?

I hope my boy skippy can get his life together  and find him a lint loving werido like himselfTry it outOk so seriously, this shit terrifies me. I'm 25 and the thought of havin a baby in me is still a kronenbergian fuckin *nightmare* so it's super cool to hear the most badass lady in the world talk about it calmly. Great moves. Preciate ya. I honestly think that the best part of the podcast is when you look at funny videos

I am a person that watches all of your podcasts never mind what happens, but I still think the funny/cringey videos are the best bits, as it creates new memes as well as new topic discussions. I also like when you talk about recent news such as the Drake drama. 

I think that most of your new viewers come from watching your channel on YouTube, rather than from people randomly finding the podcast or other methods. 

I know I’m just a normal viewer, but that is my opinion.Guys, maybe I’m insane, but those parts of recent videos have actually been really funny to me. I think it’s the handheld factor, really takes me back to the old days. Don’t get me wrong, I like the TLC videos and the new format, but I almost like the ad stings better.

Thoughts?Discovered by the LinusTechTips channel \(papa bless em\)

It's not as bad as you may think.

[Link to the video \(12:20\-End\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JERw5YcbmDg&amp;t=12m20s)Just wonderingI watched the beginning of the show and did a little digging around, and I can't find any mention what happened.  Didn't they announce last week the next podcast would be Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero.  Did they cancel again?can someone make a parody of the danny phantom theme song but instead of "hes a phantom" make it "hes an intern" thank you much appreciatedDoes anyone know what this version of this outro is called or where I can find it?

https://youtu.be/XdkMrDmODtw - 'if YouTube does this it's doomed'

  Thanks!What is the phone number to call in a voicemail? Okay, in these trying times this will just seem like another nitpick criticism of Ethan among many, but since this is the point of the segment I will give my two cents. When discussing the bombing, really Ethan was just like "lol i didnt do anything what are you talking about, but anyway, sorry I guess." The segment really lost its point when the issue was Ethan spouting Nazi propaganda due to limited research and now he just brushed it off as yeah the book said 100k it was 25k nevermind that i said 300k, completely omitting the points about the bombing taking place during the war, not after and the fact that it was definitely not some spiteful operation made just to kill innocent people. I dont think anyone would say Ethan is a Nazi, that does not make sense, but he did spread nazi propaganda. The irony being that he had limited (wrong) information about the subject and now he is discussing it while again not really having any info about it aside from the numbersI got to say. I'm very happy that people are opening their eyes to Ethan Klein really is. but I'm pretty sure that others don't think things through enough and just buy the excuse he tweeted on the Roseanne situation. Guys it's time to wake up. This is not the guy I lot of us subscribed. This Ethan is not funny,  is very hypocritical, and does not care about us. I'm not telling you to stop watching. After all you're your own person. But I hope that some of you see what I mean someday.I would like to follow his account on reddit and if anyone knows it can I please have it. Also if anyone knows hila's account I would like that tooH3H3 seems to have become a Mandela Effect from his latest video.

Do you remember watching Ethan reviewing the car lover before?

Discussion at:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/8o52w6/h3h3in\_love\_with\_a\_car/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/8o52w6/h3h3in_love_with_a_car/) Why was it not transmitted via Twitch, as per usual, but only via YouTube?

I must've missed the memo.Change my mindWhat happened? Did I miss something? He seemed to be more on Team Eric I mean I love Hila, but Dan would just do a better job. On the latest podcast he knew everything and it was originally supposed to be his thing.My girlfriend and I saw you yesterday at our local Trader Joe’s. Both of us immediately knew that it was you and wanted to say something. We didn’t because, well, social anxiety is super great. Truthfully, we are big fans and think your levels of creativity are top notch. We were super glad to see that you literally dress just as rad off camera as you do in your videos. Instead of babbling on, we will keep it short and sweet: Great moves Ethan, keep it up! 

- /u/LavaAquarium &amp; girlfriendI wrote these comments whilst watching [this video](https://youtu.be/vH4_K-ZsfWc).

Ethan can come across really badly in these types of videos. He comes across unnecessarily crude. I just think it he should show more respect to his guests, because multiple times during this video he came across to me as being kind of an asshole. It isn’t difficult, or costly, or anything. An example I’ll use is his frequency of crude sexual references. I was only able to listen to the words “dick in a tailpipe” so many times before it pissed me off and I had to leave the video.

Another thing that annoys me — his recent obsession with TLC, and their ten year old videos. I’ve seen them, I don’t care anymore. He’s trying too hard for new content. I liked it more when he made one video a month, because he talked about interesting topics and cases that I often wasn’t aware of.I really like the style of the "we were drug dealers" and marriage proposal video, I haven't heard them really talked about much on here (I might be wrong), but I'd like to see more videos in that style. I'm not sure if thats something they would consider doing again, but I think the personal videos like that are really entertaining.    

https://i.redd.it/sfz0bjrk0x111.jpgHi I have seen your Ethan and Bradbarry videos and noticed how you stopped hateful contents for kids bypassing YouTube guidelines. Just please check these new channels out you will know , School Fun TV, MLP Fun Animation, MLP Animation TV, MLP anything sort of channels. These contents have no sounds just plain cartoon. The problem is what is inside these videos. They are very absurd and should affect a child's mind. I checked and they have no previous traces just million\+ views on every videos. So they are popular as well.  I would be very great full if you guys check these channels out. I am really worried about my little brother.

Hey guys,

on the latest podcast Ethan said that people could remix Hotdads jingle for the segment with Ian, so I was wondering if anyone had a clip of it or if the guys even uploaded the stems. Can't find anything and I'd be interested in contributing!Sure Skippy may have overreacted to Kyle's joke by most people's standards. But to Skippy the joke was way over the line and it really bugs me that Ethan couldn't read the situation and even made things worse by egging Skippy on. I have a lot of respect for Kyle for realizing how upset Skippy got and apologizing. I feel like Hila and Dan even felt a little uncomfortable about the situation (Dan mentioned that Skippy's mom was next to him during the call), but they were too hesitant to stand up to Ethan. I think Ethan is so caught up in the goofs and gaffs he doesn't care how anyone feels.I don't understand their obsession with trying to make everything 'a bit' and thus giving it it's own theme music, transition, sting, et cetera. Each one is a completely different tone, so it doesn't even match the tone of the show, and I think it's really difficult to pull off a jingle in general without it being down-right annoying.

I especially dislike the H3 Voicemail sting. It feels way too upbeat for the kinda 'smooth' vibe of the show (the shaded environment, the kinda jazzy theme music of the show itself), the timing/beat of the vocals seem off and on a personal (and hopefully not insulting) note, the accent kinda piles-on to the annoyance I feel at hearing it.

It isn't limited to that, though. I disliked the "News" intro (and especially how, at least to my recollection, they still haven't updated it from Jake Paul climbing on a van), especially because they use the intro inconsistently. A LOT of the thing Ethan covers can be called 'news' and indeed such discussions are identical regardless of the use of the bit's intro.

So, when I heard "IAN THE INTERN-- IS COMING OUT!" three fricken times -- such a busy, distracting tune that states nothing that Ethan can't communicate himself with "Ian, come in here!"... 

These are all really petty and opinionated notes to make--in reality, these musical bits aren't hurting anyone and I can't even make serious technical critiques of them-- but I still figured it was enough of a topic to make a post about. I'm curious what other people think. In MY opinion, if they DO want to do musical bits and intros, I'd like them to be consistent not only to each other but to the podcast's overall theme music (which I really like) and the 'bits' need to be something more established.Both Tom Segura and Christina So recently I posted a YouTube video which sort of jokingly talked about the science of the famed Alex Jones quote: “I DONT WANT EM PUTTING CHEMICALS IN THE WATER AND TURNING THE FREAKING FROGS GAY.” Within an hour of posting it, it was struck down for hatespeech?!?! I don’t know what to do and I have no idea who to go to. You guys gotta help me out.For me, it may have been the 'It's Time to Stop!' playlist, though I came late to the channel and good Youtube in general.  I am just curious what got people to SMASH that like and sub button.Was watching back some old videos and man am i curious I mean at one point the dude even went on a larger show and announced that Ethan and Hila were SCREAMING at each other over the wall. Not only was this not even a true comparison he alleviated to show the wall he was talking about not the massive temple wall everyone who was watching didn't know about. He also makes alot of direct comparisons of him to Logan Paul that just seem downright wrong. You dont have to watch the video hes only got 6k subs but rising. Maybe put a stop to it? Heres my response \-\&gt; \(H3  is the main subject of this video\) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A47L0f8b7a0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A47L0f8b7a0)Okay it’s high time we had this discussion.. 

Dry wiping is at the bottom of the list (no pun) not only is it the most abrasive, but it also cleans the least. Not only does is do a bad job of cleaning, it isn’t very comfortable either. 

Although using dry wipes in conjunction with wet wipes (Wet wipe to begin, then a couple of dry ones, then polish off with another wet wipe) 

Bidets are fine, they do a good job of cleaning but the process of angling yourself/ the bidet is unnecessarily complicated, also shooting water onto my ass is risky business. I’m not a fan. 

I know technically wet wipes aren’t flushable, but the health and well-being of my ass is more important to me than the impact that flushing wipes causes. 

The downside to wet wipes is that it’s impossible to turn back, I have driven my family mad trying to convince them to use wipes. I preach about the power of wet ones all the time.  Hello!

The latest podcast was hard to listen to. To some degree the one before as well, but not quite to the same extent. It felt like an almost 3 hour long childish debacle filled with toilet humor and genuine cringe on Ethan's part. 5 minute conversations about shitting, as well as antagonizing Skippy to provoke a reaction being a particular low. the whole thing just felt incredibly awkward and forced. Some of the content really was god awful and considering how intently I used to listen to the series every week this makes me incredibly sad. 

Just to first make clear, I have been a huge fan of H3 for 2 or 3 years, spending most of university binge watching videos on repeat. I have bought several pieces of Hila's artwork and have loved both of them to death for as long as I can remember. 

Am I just getting old, or are they running out of steam? surely a fellow fan listening to that last week felt the same? Would appreciate your thoughts!It was mentioned in the last podcast that h3h3 was going on tigerbelly. When is it happening? Did it already happen? Where do I watch it?It was a video where he was explaining his sexual experiences with Jesus Christ in a dream. I remember him saying ''Booy am I just...   full up with the feeling, aaah!''  that shit was hilarious, does anyone have a link for that or is it just removed off their channel? It was really old btw, 2013-2014 stuffi like h3h3, i love hila, but i have noticed, does hila have her own opinion apart from ethan, on...anything? has she ever asserted her own opinion apart from him ever?I’m about to binge and catch up on the h3h3 podcasts and want to make sure I’m supporting these guys by using the medium that provides them with the most revenue. Any suggestions appreciated! Papa BlessI just went onto Youtube to look up Duck Tales and was flabbergasted at the second recommendation...BY YOUTUBE!

I am asking if anyone else sees what I saw (I am not putting the results here), and if they see what I think they will see, if Ethan can figure out what is going on with Youtube's algorithm...which should NOT be trending this video based on the title alone, at all. Alright so I had one of my wisdom teeth pulled today. And the doc put like three shots of the numbing stuff to start, and I was a nervous wreck but he did it no problem. So five hours later I’m watching h3’s PUBG stream and I go into the bathroom to take an ibuprofen, and immediately feel sick. So I guess I passed out and the paramedics came and everything. But my dad got me to come to and And the first thing I heard from in my room was Ethan saying “Dude that was the most intense episode of blacked ever.” XD just kind of a funny thing that happened in the scary situation. I’m good now! Thanks! I actually just found a vapejuice called SlamBerry (form Charlie's chalk dust). This is too much meme. please use it in the 150 battery mod ont the podcast XD

(would link the website but I'm in europe)anyone know?I would say Harley Mornstien, Hila Klein or any episode with Posty. anyone know what episode ethan and hila talk about countersueing matt hoss (not the one called we won the lawsuit) So was the strawpoll just for shits and giggles? And fuck Twitch subs too while we're at it?Are the YouTube podcasts prerecorded because they uploaded a video during it and haven’t mentioned it... and I thought it was like going to be a funny joke but they seem unaware I was so stoked to see him on the podcast, the chat was cancerous and hardly even let him talk about his channel and what he does.   Kinda whackThe true star of the show, ian the interncan someone give me a link to that fucker who thought It'd be a good idea for iDubbbz to make a content cop on h3? Fuckin drama drainer...Does anyone know if there are links to the Ian the Intern songs on today's podcast? Papa bless🙏[*This*](https://i.imgur.com/hPFoLNE.png) is what I see instead of comments, and it stays that way for the entire video.

It seems to be an issue with having the live broadcast use the same URL as the video upload, as I never had this issue when they were streamed and uploaded separately.I’m confused. A couple of Podcasts ago the said Tommy and Greg of The Room fame would be on the podcast finally. I’ve yet to see a mention of them canceling. 
Did I miss hear it? Was it a goof? 
I was excited and but very confused now.Hey, I usually only watch the H3 podcast on twitch (because its unedited and whatnot)  


I noticed the last one they did on Twitch was with Jack and Erik)... are they done using Twitch?

PS sorry if this has already been addressed. Papa Bless.What up pimps (and big pimps), 

Hope everyone is having a slamming weekend. I just wanted to touch up on the latest video H3H3 post. This is suppose to be a discussion post for you guys. I’m all for a goof and a gaff, even maybe a little spoofing. But I wasn’t very comfortable the way Ian and Ethan were treating their firearms. I have shot for many years, from handguns all the way AR15 matches at military camps. I was raised around guns all my life. I was educated they are meant for self defense and for sport (hunting and march shooting). 

I’m all for having fun and shooting rifles, shotguns, handguns are a awesome time. I love going to range days and hitting my marks or going hunting with my father. But this is not something to goof around. You should always act like a gun is loaded, even if it is not. Never point a gun at something that you do not plan on destroying. Always keep your finger off the trigger until ready to fire. I could go on and on about safety and gun etiquette. 

I just want my homies to be safe and know what is right from wrong. I would hate to see one of the H3H3 nation in the ED that I work at. 

TL:DR 
Please be smart when handling firearms.

Anyways. Stay safe out there. Keep slamming 
Two of you are fucking hilarious when you collab, spread that to the twitch channel 

Pappa BlessEVERYTHING up there is positive, it's almost as if he is actively monitoring the channel to dispose of criticismSeriously, literally every video/tweet/podcast/whatever, people have to get angry about something. This time it's gun safety. I honestly don't think any of the people posting really give a shit about Ian and Ethan "making a joke" of gun safety. They just wake up needing something to be angry about. 

This is actually the thing I immediately thought of: http://time.com/3766915/trevor-noah-tweets-outrage/I’ve been a fan of Ethan and Hila for a little over a year now and usually I can look past some of their “edgier” humor as just goofs; but in the video of him and idubbbz shooting guns, Ethan asked Ian “Sandy Hook or Columbine” which to me seemed pretty fucked considering they were not only making jokes about school shootings, but ones where children were actually shot and killed, WHILE they were shooting guns. Just seemed really thoughtless and insensitive to me.Does anyone know what kinda sandals ethan was wearing in the Mr. Beast video? They're fly and I want a pair.

https://i.redd.it/ikp5bgvoy1311.pngDo you guys remember how in the modern art video Ethan talked about 3 white canvases that sold for 95 million dollars? When I showed some one that, they didn’t believe it so I went to look a source to back it up with but I couldn’t find one.   If anyone has the link to the auction video or an article I’d appreciate ya. When Ethan called ryan  on Skype, Ryan answered and said he was waiting for him, there was a 'to be continued' bit at the end. Was there a follow up video or was that just for laughs and/or gaffes?Been trying to get a hold of the green teddy cap but it doesn't show up on the merch store :( anybody know where I can get one? Thanks, papablesslove them both, thought the 2 hour episode was one hell of a ride. idk if it's part of bobby lee's antics but that part when he was closing his eyes while ethan is talking about depression was kinda off. overall loved it. your thoughts? I was extremely excited to have the H3 gaffs and goofs world and the William Osman Engineering worlds collide.  I usually love the H3 Podcasts and the time you spend with guests, but this was just really poorly planned.  I feel extremely bad for William, driving all the way there just to have a chat about the one thing he probably doesn't want to be the center of his interview.  Like, yes, most of his stuff was lost in the fire, and yes, it is a topic to discuss, because he saved the beanie and it was part of the video itself, but it is not the only topic.  How about how creative and interesting his engineering and inventions are?  How about more about the beanie itself, how about more about William himself.  Cameraman John, his wife, all of his cat gear, IT'S LASER TIME, what he has coming up etc, etc.  I just really feel like this episode was so rushed, and in quickness of getting things prepared you guys went "uh, idk we'll just talk about the fire."  I love you guys, and I hate to be so critical but I feel like William was done so wrong here.  I really hope you guys made more content with William or are preparing to, cause looking back at this, this was a huge mistake to dismiss someone so incredibly talented and who really went out of his way to make you something so amazing and to be there.  I just feel like not a lot of research was put into this, or into William's content and at one point when Ethan was like "William Osman? Am i saying that right?"  at the end of the interview?  Come on man, you don't even know if you're saying his name right?  I'm incredibly disappointed.  Please do William Osman right.  Papa Bless.﻿ I feel William Osman should have been on longer he only got like 20 minutes while other guests will get like an hour. William is such a great entertainer, a full podcast would be lit. I also felt like you pushed him out prematurely, he could have at least stayed the rest of the podcast. Literally the EVERY SINGLE comment of the first 100 top comments on YouTube is about William getting screwed lol.

Saw a video about why the podcast needs Hila but we all know its really about her boobs.This is a h3h3 fan page, not a find excuses to call Ethan out page. Yes, I get that Ethan is not a God who is inept from all criticism and I get people complaining about William Osman getting kicked off, or something Ethan said on the podcast that is problematic. However, my problem is when people start saying "Ethan is just a plain shitty person now" or "h3h3's content is trash". Then why are you here? Why are you still supporting him if you don't like him? It seems everywhere I go on this "fan subreddit" I'm being bombarded with hate. 

Can we make a subreddit for people who like h3h3 for fuck sake?On the episode before TB, Ethan ends the episode by saying “Next week we’ll have Kripparian on the podcast.”

Yet next week we got TB. Still was a great episode. But what happened to Kripp’s appearance?https://youtu.be/2ueEZ7ZoEFQ so is a new theme song or copyright infringement? Even without all the William behavior it seemed as if Ethan didn't really want to be there, even from the beginning. At the start of the show he slips out a few negative comments on the contents of the show. "The greatest episode we have ever produced here" and "this is a very mediocre episode" Also a few minutes later when they have to take Shredder out of the room Ethan kind of yells at Hila in a pretty rude way. Yelling "We are live Hila, FOR CHRIST SAKE WE'RE LIVE HAVE A SEAT LET'S MOVE ON" I don't know, he seemed like he wasn't having the best day.

papa bless.the European Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee will vote on changes to copyright law that would put untenable restrictions on how users share news and information with each other. The new Copyright Directive has two big problems:

* **Article 11** would create a "link tax:” Links that share short snippets of news articles, even just the headline, could become subject to copyright licensing fees— pretty much ending the way users share and discuss news and information in a place like Reddit.
* **Article 13** would force internet platforms to install automatic upload filters to scan (and potentially censor) every single piece of content for potential copyright\-infringing material. This law does not anticipate the difficult practical questions of how companies can know what is an infringement of copyright. As a result of this big flaw, the law’s most likely result would be the effective shutdown of user\-generated content platforms in Europe, since unless companies know what is infringing, we would need to review and remove all sorts of potentially legitimate content if we believe the company may have liability.

So i learned about these and notice that almost no one in Europe  is talking about it, so i thougth it would be a great a idea to tell ethan and hila about it so they can also talk about these problem in the podcast or twiter or anything so they can tell their European fanbase about the problem we are having that way we can increase the awareness.

sorry about my english not native language.

https://i.redd.it/9xs8kqkmzj311.pngWhere can i find the song played in the last podcast on ian the intern. Its so good. I started watching their video’s in 2014 and really loved it. 

However the last 1/2 years their content has been really stale, the same jokes over and over and it is clear that Ethan doesn’t enjoy the h3h3 show anymore.

Especially since they found the cashcow of a podcast, seems like they’re changing their content completely and branding themself totally different. As well as hypocritical comments and lame ass normie goofs on Twitter. Me and my friends made some hand signs for a school photo. Now we’re facing suspension because they were considered gang signs by the school. I was wondering what your guys’ opinion is. 

Ps I’m the one doing the vape nation

https://i.redd.it/tog98uc68q311.jpgHi :)

I am planning on creating a hand etched wooden board featuring Ethan and Hila that I will end up sending them. The problem is that I need a template to work off. I need a outline template of there heads or upper body. Can anyone help out? 

Much appreciated, Papa Bless... Syndicate is in LA at the moment - not sure for how long. Would be really interesting to get him on the podcast.Now even though it certainly wasn't me who did this, even though I wanted to, I just happened to find a summary for the article [of the cover page of Der Spiegel from the other top post on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/8qrlqd/why_putin_look_like_he_about_to_drop_the_hottest/) on Imgur! Again, this was certainly not me. Now for anyone interested in the rough content of this controversial sounding article, I can only recommend you this summary. I just wish I knew who wrote it so I can thank that person very much. He or she must've spent hours on this article, oh wowy!

[Link to Imgur post.](https://imgur.com/a/y2PQJrz)Hi there fellow Hila Kleiners,

For a school assignment, I have been studying the community for the past two months and what the purpose of the community is. For someone who has been part of it for the best of two years, it wasn't a difficult task.  
But now I've reached the crossroads and you could lend me a hand!

Is there a point in your life where Ethan and/or his videos have influenced you to do something you've been hesitating to do? For example, creating a YouTube commentary channel or stuff? Or have you made anything because you were a huge fan of our Papa.   
And is there a moment where your fellow community members have supported you to do something?

If you could briefly answer, you guys would help me greatly! Papa bless and stay vape naisj xxHey all! Hope you're doing well.

I remember in an H3 podcast not so long ago, Ethan, was doing an ad read for MeUndies and gave himself an atomic wedgie. I don't remember in which podcast this was and I'm too lazy to find it myself, so I was hoping one of you could help me find that part.

Papa bless!Lately I’ve been personally feeling like the podcast quality is going up while the main h3 videos have become worse. I’m still an h3 fan but just not for the same reason. I tend now to look forward to the podcast every week while I could care less when a video comes out from the main h3 channel. Anyone else agrees or have a different opinion?Hi all, how bout that fancy condescending title!? Love it right?

To Ethan and Hila, you have mentioned a few times now that you have been trying to conceive and it seems like it's harder then it should be. Well I wanted to tell you that I agree, it is harder then other people make it out to be, for me and my wife, being the same age category as you are, it took a while and after we finally did it and were very happy, we found out at week 12 (when you are supposed to hear the first heartbeat) that the little thing stopped developing at 6 weeks and had to be taken out, we were crushed, and its even harder with everyone asking us when we were going to have kids.


It's very common for a couple to take a long time to conceive, and its not common for couples to disclose this part of the story, maybe because of some base belief it will make them appear inadequate or something.


The feeling I had when I would hear about someone's Oops baby (which they probably share as I guess they think it attests to their virility or something) was really painful, I'd wish people had more tact than to discuss this with other couples, especially childless ones. 

So I suppose I just wanted to tell you that you are not in any way shape or form an exception and that no its not that easy, be strong keep trying and good luck.


To the community I'll be brief, don't be the people asking about this in the chat all the time, while Ethan and Hila have shared alot with us, some things a couple should go through by themselves so unless it's shared don't bring it up, let them have their time and move in the pace that works for them.


And yes we did end up succeeding (writing this cause I know Ethan would call me out for not finishing a story). 



May the tuck be ever chubby Hila kleiners!Don't you guys think the TLC videos are the must unoriginal thing to come out of the H3 channel? With the videos made about MattHoss, the Paul Brothers or DJ Khaled it was funny because the original content they went over (the MattHoss parkour pick up video for example) was cringy and not aware of it. There was room for Ethan to crack jokes at the expense of the people on the videos. The TLC videos seem kinda lazy, a little bit redundant as the videos are clearly made to ridicule their protagonists and Ethan doing that again is not as funny as him ridiculing someone who is trying to present themselves in a "positive" light.

I feel like those videos are the in-between their channel as it was when it started to those cancerous "reaction channels" that only sit in front of their screen and watch a video.

And yea I know I'm late.http://shanghaiist.com/2018/06/14/foreign-pick-up-artists-arrive-in-taiwan-to-harass-exploit-unsuspecting-women-for-their-videos/

This has it all: racist thumbnails, scams, god-level cringe, and victims speaking up. 

Found it interesting because unlike guys like prank invasion or others who hire actresses to react a certain way, this guy just harasses unsuspecting women, edits them out of context, and then composes videos titled “Japanese girls are super easy” and sells them for money. Is there a podcast tomorrow (Friday)? Thanks! Can anyone tell me which podcast where Ethan was talking about the closing statement on the lawsuit where Matthoss was still making demands? Ep. 24 is the big talk about the lawsuit but Im looking for the final update where Matthoss finally gave up the Zone\~In your video about your opinion on the 2016 election you state that you want to see Trump succede and your rooting for him to prove you wrong. So far into his presidency how do you feel he's done?
Hey dudes. I'm super excited for some of the upcoming podcast episodes, which I'm pretty sure are gonna slam. Is there a spot where I can see the schedule for them, specifically day/time? I noticed that their Twitch page hasn't been updated since the last Jack/Erik episode so I'm curious where the schedule can be found.does anybody know why they no longer stream the podcasts on twitch?4 stroke gang anyone? Can someone, looking at Dan, explain why the podcast is basically back on youtube and twitch is no longer used? 

I am subbed, and bell is rung. I rarely get notifications that the podcast is going live from youtube.

Are they promising to not demonitize or something on YT ..... Should people unsub on twitch? 

Did I miss the memo. Please let me know if I should unfollow / Unsub on Twitch, and how to make sure YT tells me when you go live. ThanksPapa?! Y u do dis?!The one he is currently wearing in the Tom Segura podcast.She adds nothing to the podcast and her voice in annoying. You'll do a god's favor.Waking up to the notification of Tom on the H3H3 podcast. I thought I was dreaming! Been a huge fan of both podcasts for years. It's about time!!

Piss on me, beat me, bring a friend, try it out!! Bring some moose soup you boys!! And videos of people screaming in pain! 4 stroke gang.It's so funny. Somehow he's sarcastic while also making it genuine and honest.  He's the only podcast host that's actually made me want to look up the products.  Love himAnd Jorge is still with that G O L D  D I G G E R

On 90 Day FianceI remember in one of the suggestions adam (PsychedSubstance) being chosen to be on the podcast. I want to know what happened to that, is it not going to happen?The two best ones I can think of off the top of my head are:
-Vito Gesualdi (Berkley Pepsi guy, does a talk show on Twitch)
-Micheal Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal (Independent hip-hop duo People Under The Stairs, have both appeared on The House List podcast)

Anyone got more? The idea being that these people are known enough, but would also be relatively easy to book, and would benefit from the exposure.[Period.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/0JVwfJGfins?start=29&amp;end=32)Has there been an update about this that I missed or is it just a no go?https://i.redd.it/hhrnt6nbof411.pngI've been watching Ethan and Hila for quite some time now, they're fantastic people and entertainers. However, despite knowing a great deal of the memes/references on both H3H3 and Ethan and Hila, I don't know which are the most iconic (save Vape Naysh). I have a rough idea solely from watching their videos, but this is *literally* the first I've ever engaged in their fandom. I've nary a clue what's caught on with you guys.
Also, I am completely out-of-touch with anything related to the proper usage of this damn website, so forgive me if I do something indicative of that. 

Anyway, the reason I ask is so I can accurately incorporate their most notable iconography into a neoclassical/rococo-styled portrait painting of them for my Painting Techniques course final. Figure it'll make for a decent gaff.
At the end of episode #66 with Erik as the co-host, Ethan brings up Tommy and Greg will be on the show sometime after Hila got back. I'd love for this interview to happen. I'm a big fan of the Room, and listening about the making of that movie makes me wet myself at night.

\+Just sayin'Im so excited for this one, as Marc Marons WTF is the only long form type conversation Ive seen Bo have, and he's so talented and unique that Ive always wanted to get a deeper dive into his mind.

I know there used to be question threads for guests, but i didnt see one (im also on mobile so maybe its just not visible for me)

One thing recently that Bo has done post-make happy was direct Chris Rock's new stand up special, tambourine. I noticed the camera work about half way through the special and that it was shot in a different way than most specials. My jaw dropped when the title card flashed at the end and it said directed by Bo Burnham. I've been dying to know how he landed that job, and im sure him sharing a story about that experience would be immensely interesting and make for a good topic, as its something he rarely speaks on.

To you in the subreddit, if you havent seen Bo's new movie, eighth grade, give it a shot. It was not at all what I expected it to be but was still top tier amazing.I don't know about yall but I actually enjoy watching their ad rolls. They always seem so genuine and hilarious.

I forget which earlier podcast but Ethan was going on about how sweaty his balls were and you can hear Hila off camera trying to get him to stop. The way just goes off the cuff and gets overly excited shows makes watching his ads enjoyable.It needs to happen. Have Ian get ahold of Young Jamie and set this shit up.All of a sudden Ethan has been rocking some heady Grateful Dead gear. Where did this come friend? Years with no mention, no other shirts, no wook-like behavior and now he's a Jerry Jr. Is he pandering to get John Mayer on the podcast?Did anyone else notice that in the reaction video where Ethan is watching the Law and Order: SVU episode about gamers, that Logan Paul is in the episode as one of the gamers who is a criminal? Wild.

All H3 podcast listeners know about Ian the Intern who is occasionally brought on to the show by Ethan. But along with H3H3, does Ian have a Youtube channel of his own? The channel in question is called LyricalHub and has just over 100k subscribers. The host of the channel never reveals his face, but his voice is virtually identical to Ian’s when he is featured on the podcast. Ian has also talked many times on the podcast about his involvement in rap culture, as he gave Ethan and Hila a whole run down on the Drake and Pusha T beef, as well as mentioned that he attended the most recent Kanye West album listening party. This love for hip hop is significant due to the fact that the LyricalHub youtube channel is solely dedicated to analyzing songs, videos, and topics in hip hop. Is Ian running this channel with over 100k subscribers? I would like some confirmation on my theory...I've been curious since they have been using youtube only lately, and it seems to be staying that way, what does that mean for the twitch subscribers?  [https://www.ranker.com/list/vote-for-the-h3-podcast-ian-the-intern-song/steven4297?ref=dshare&amp;source=pshare](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ranker.com%2Flist%2Fvote-for-the-h3-podcast-ian-the-intern-song%2Fsteven4297%3Fref%3Ddshare%26source%3Dpshare&amp;redir_token=SZn9rjjqz5YxsfeMXZfmb692HEN8MTUyOTUzMjkzN0AxNTI5NDQ2NTM3) 

Its based on this video they uploaded

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qozo6YLnxXM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qozo6YLnxXM)Ethan totally creamed his jeans when boogie just told the cherry in the vagina story lmao 😂💯It was such a heartfelt podcast. The previous one was also amazing. Just wanted to show my appreciation to Ethan, Hila and, of course, Boogie. I'm watching the new Boogie interview as I'm writing this. Of course it's reminding me of his first appearance on the H3 Podcast. The one word that comes to mind when I think about his first appearance on the show is ANXIETY. 

Last year Boogie seemed extremely anxious. He even talked about anxiety multiple times through out the interview. Watching the new interview feels completely different. He's calm, confident, and peaceful. Also, when Ethan showed last year's picture of Boogie next to this year's picture of Boogie, I couldn't believe the difference. Not only the weight (which is really amazing), but also his face is shining now. 

I'm proud of Boogie. Just wondering. It sucks because he's entertaining, but being that anti feminist is so goddamn annoying. Talk about appealing to the lowest denominator of YouTube. 

Edit for clarity: I first noticed after the second time Jordan Peterson was on that they have had one woman guest who wasn't a girlfriend of another guest. The main really shitty people I'm talking about are PETERSON, JonTron, and Joey Salads. There are others, like the guest today, who are clearly anti feminist or racist. It wouldn't be bad if it was just one conversation, but it's an ongoing theme between both of their channels. So for someone, like myself, who is extremely feminist, but has been a fan for a few years now, it's really testing. Any idea where I can get it from? Hila is such a fashion killa.https://imgur.com/a/JyupfJg

looks siiiiiiiiiickI love your podcasts more than anything, but one thing you do alot is interrupt (not rudely or anything) the guest while they are talking and you’ll change the course of the conversation right when they are about to say something interesting, and then they lose their train of thought and may never get back on that subject. This probably doesn’t need its own reddit post but hey take from it what you will.This podcast gets ~1M+ views each episode and this subreddit has more than a quarter million subscribers. Yet the podcast ep. threads get 30 - 100 comments if you're lucky. Can the mods sticky episode discussions please? The only reason I come here is to talk about and read comments about the podcast, not give video suggestions or browse memes. Surely I'm not the only one?This is pretty crazy if you consider the timeline that just over two years ago is when Joshi posted the original sexual harassment video. He must have been going through a crazy tough time when this all went down - h3h3 probably saved this man. 

https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=462576944188877&amp;set=pcb.462576994188872&amp;type=3&amp;theaterI used to love h3h3 so much, but I will now unsub and forget about it. It's sad. He already killed the channel with lack of uploads and I don't like the podcast, but he also recently deleted [DJ Khaled Hold You Down -- h3h3 reaction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5HWWhFSaww). [Well, he made it private](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdobS107uxU&amp;list=PLjrhosP-Fp_oUhj9MLAJw-otDDB6_Oz63). I couldn't believe it. YOU SAID "NIGGA" ETHAN, IT'S JUST A FUCKING WORD! You don't say "NIGGA" anymore, good for you! But if you feel so bad about it just apologize. There will always be someone re-uploading shit! Who are you hiding from? That was one of my favorite videos dude! 12 min and 21 sec of good comedy hidden because of a half a second ["mistake"](https://youtu.be/s5HWWhFSaww?t=9m6s)!

I hope one day you finally loose weight and get healthy because I want you to live a good long life. I will keep watching your classics no matter what. Every time iv stumbled across one of his videos  on YT its always been him sat there crying about how hard life is but i thought id give the podcast a chance. 

I cant even finish the podcast its just him sat there whining and crying for the whole thing and all iv seen is positive comments. I just dont get it. I dont even understand what hes about. Am i missing something here? He just seems to feed off pity.Howto guide on "pushing those O's like a pro!"

Who else would like to see Ethan doing this?Hey guys its ~~massive legend~~ low quality post here. Just want to congratulate Ethan on being one of the first guys to get Bo to do a lengthy appearance on camera since Make Happy. I saw a few of us asking for him in the suggestion threads so its a welcome break for us Bo fans and Im really looking forward to it, and as a ~~great man~~ ~~man~~ toupee almost said: Thank you Ethan, very cool!Im talking about [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTyhFYVHUBA) video. Did anything end up happening?I just found Connor Murphy on tinder and was in such shock I forgot to screenshot. I super liked so hopefully I get a second chance to show the world. Just thought everyone would want an update on our favorite twink.I'm sorry but the askh3 video was funny and I feel there needs to be more. Thats the whole statement. Its kind of funny really. So I'm sitting in the dentists office, and they are promoting Coby Persin on abc57. It is actually hilarious to think that people are watching this and getting their info about the world from these kind of shows.https://i.redd.it/lfvmxfgeae511.jpgLike seriously, I'm not the kind of person that says that a sub is going to shit because of a small amount of spam. I'm a mod myself, I know that you can't always have full coverage and you can get rid of the spam quickly. But most of the posts here are just shitty YouTube drama or stuff that isn't at all relevant to H3H3Productions. And judging by how long they're all staying up for, it seems that either the mods are allowing it, or are just really, really inactive. This place, in recent weeks, has become worse than r/jontron in terms of useful content. While some posts are great, most just aren't good at all. I happen to re-watch/listen to older podcasts and sometimes I do not need to watch the whole video to find that moment of discussion. So, since I was happy to rewatch latest [Boogie2988 episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C00igZTktfc), I took notes of "now discussing" segments so if anyone wants to easily find certain topics of discussion, they can click on timestamp (on YouTube description or even comments) and be right where they wanted to. Essentially, just like Podcasts on phones work, divided in Chapters or how famous Co-Optional Podcast works on YouTube.

With respect and love, imicca.

P.S. - I know you do "H3 podcast highlights" videos, but that's not the same as having chapters/now-discussing segments. You won't chop up every discussion into a video anyway. 
​
I don’t know if I’m the only one, but I don’t like it when Hila doesn’t let Ethan talk about controversial subjects. I watch H3 videos for Ethan’s controversial takes on issues he seems kind of tame now instead of the YouTube force he used to be I am loving that Ethan and Hila are getting all these big name comedians on the show but I am curious on how they got it all started? I feel like the bobby Lee podcast really hit it off for them!Specifically what kind of video cameras and other equipment they use to make their streams? Just watched H3 Podcast #56. At the very end, Ethan says something like "Ups and Downs, dead air, and great hair"

You need to put that shit on everything. Shirts, hats, mugs, roadkill, keychains. The works.

Please merch it. What other verbiage needs to be sold for bitconnect money? Sing-ging?Hey folks, feeling like maybe I've missed something but is there a way to download an audio only version of the podcast?I believer they were science fiction or there was a book or a person that was forced to bury bodies? What was the name of that person?2 separate pictures and for some reason no link to the video.I found and matched with Connor Murphy on tinder in Orlando and I'm hoping its legit.

Why is this sub so shit? lumaow unsubbedHe told me he would TRUST me guys I’m a professional and not a liar at all in any way.Does anybody know what happened to the laci green video I can't find it or anything about it being taken down it was about gender specific toysBut please ask him about his Alex Jones impressionI like to watch the chat replays and such when I watch the stream and recently the only time I see recording of the podcast they are uploaded to YouTube and not twitch. Are they even doing twitch anymore? If so why?This man is the number one victim of crime in the entire world, and his website shows it. He also has a youtube channel with some very interesting videos ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNoq8YDZh2I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNoq8YDZh2I)) ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vMXfF8h4rU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vMXfF8h4rU)) that explain everything. You can also help out by volunteering, or buying some of his merch. Seriously though, I need someone to get to the bottom of this, I don't know how it could be real.How did Hila learn English in the Middle East?Can someone comment a link to the video where Ethan is talking about a subject (cant remember what) and Hila keeps correcting/interrupting him talking about how it's not PC

I've been looking for quite some time and still cant find it. I hope the description I give above is clear and you guys know what I'm talking about.

Papa BlessDoes anyone know them? They almost have 2 million subscribers and they are pretty interesting dudes with a clear objective. I discovered them after Philly D recommended a video of them. They could be great guests for the podcast and I believe you both live in LA. What do you guys think?I think TJ and Ethan&amp;Hila would have great chemistry and it would make for great epizode.But... I have to say it is interesting... you guys cover my recommended feed! Maybe because I have been watching your stuff while at work and at home. So many hours its crazy! I just wanted to let you know that Youtube is recommending you guys all the time... and I'm just sad that the flow of media isn't a constant drip feed into my brain hahaSince Ethan and Hila are discussing the art of cleaning your asshole on the h3 podcast I keep thinking about them sitting on the toilet. 
It might be a little wierd that I think about the fupa lord himself while touching myself around my anus but it always brings a smile to my face. Am I the only one?Lately Ethan has been rocking some heady grateful dead gear.  All I wanna know is if these shirts have been registered. He shouldn't be disgracing fupa lord Jerry if they're not. Thank you.Hdbreadpic.com

I PROMISE THIS IS NOT A SCAM I’M JUST HIGHLY CONFUSED WHY THIS LITTLE KID IS MAKING MONEY (like $20-30) OFF OF PICTURES OF HIS FACE PHOTOSHOPPED ON BREAD ??We were bored so this happened, sorry I couldn’t make Ethan THICCer :( https://imgur.com/a/HqJklUz/I think more people should be talking about this guy... He claims to be able to talk to spirits using his "spirit box", ghosts use it to talk to him (Those voices definitely aren't added in post...). He also has a Patreon where people pay him to "communicate" with their dead loved ones. Basically he's scamming people who are desperate enough to believe in his bullshit, pretty disgusting stuff. Can't think of a bigger piece of shit than this guy. More info on how he's scamming clueless people is available on his Patreon and Youtube. In case the video doesn't link (because I'm a retard who doesn't know how to use reddit), his Youtube is "Huff Paranormal".https://i.redd.it/gkfeqlzhao611.jpgHonestly just thought of this after watching a few podcasts. But if been making music for a few years, mostly a hobby now or making beats for people but would fucking love that podcast. I know you guys supported his remix of your stuff and he just recently dropped that remix of post Malone not to long ago. Honestly love his style of videos and I think it would be even more interesting if him and post were both on at once. Know that would be hard but please try. Love you guys and papa BLESS.
What up pimps!

\#VapeNationPlease let me know the stepsSo, after watching EmpLemon's new video (Leafy Was Here) I wanted to relive the 2016 YouTube drama (best year btw). I thought that by now someone made a collection of the videos, but I coudn't find anything neither on YouTube nor on Reddit. So, I decided that while watching the videos and listening to the Podcasts I would make a playlist (in chronological order) to make it easier for others to rewatch the videos. Now, I might not have found every video, so let me know if I missed something.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLULbQSf7XQ5Xve_dV7w5B3OcIjPMjnGdlDoes anyone else just enjoy taking a big ol’ shit, or is it weird. I just thought you guys should know because it's a pretty well kept secret and there is possibly no way you would know browsing this shit hole of a sub with zero good content. Figured I'd add to that.Ok so for those who use YouTube to listen to music/podcasts whenever in the background, you know that you had to use certain apps just so YT would still play in the background. 

A few weeks ago however Google Play Store suddenly came out with a guideline change, which meant apps that were used for this function would no longer work correctly and be tedious to the user.

Such examples include forced phone vibrations on any input, stopping any minimization or screen lock which meant that the moment you close your phone cover you have to restart the app.

Now suddenly YouTube is charging a monthly cost for the same fucking function these apps were meeting, this is just scummy as fuck.Upvote to get this legend on the podcast It was a reaction to another video from a while ago I believe. I want to use the sound-byte in something.As I'm sure everyone is aware that Ethan and Hila are friends with good ol' Posty. Posty is also close friends with popular YouTube muscian Jared Dines. I've always thought it would be a good idea to have Jared and Posty on the pocast at the same time.[The article in question](https://www.indyweek.com/news/archives/2018/06/28/dear-dpac-we-really-need-to-talk-about-jordan-peterson?media=AMP+HTML).

Hello all, new subscriber here.

Truthfully, I have no idea whether this is the *correct* place to post this, nor do I know if Ethan actively views this sub. But Peterson seems like he's on good terms with the h3 channel, so here I am. I personally wanted to send this to Ethan via Twitter, but I don't actually have or use social media (other than Reddit) and didn't want to make an account just that. I also wanted to see what others thought of the article. I'll go ahead with mine.

In my opinion, I felt that they used some pretty big leaps in logic calling Jordan a racist, a misogynist, homophobic, transphobic, and someone who makes threats. There's also this:

&gt;Bowles goes on to connect Peterson’s most regressive ideas about men and women to recent murderous rampages carried out by incels, or self-proclaimed “involuntarily celibate” male supremacists: “Violent attacks are what happens when men do not have partners, Mr. Peterson says, and society needs to work to make sure those men are married.”
&gt;
&gt;This, DPAC, is rape culture. This is what misogyny looks like.

From what it looks like they cherry-picked Jordan saying, it seems like what he's trying to say is that incels are frustrated with their position not having a partner and are motivated to violence over it, and that *maybe* if they actually had a partner they would chill the fuck out. Note that Jordan never actually gave methods on how society should work to marry/partner these men, just that they should. That's an incredibly nebulous statement and undertaking, but *clearly* (sarcasm ahead) this means Jordan intends for women to be forced, against their will, to marry men in arranged marriages as part of a "rape culture". Seriously? 

It smacks of journalism being sensationalized for the sake of clicks, and it smacks of deplatforming another because you don't agree with them. But if you truly cared about resolving issues like this, you'd be open to a debate between all sides of the issue. Frankly, it's insulting.

Of course this is all my opinion, and for all I know this isn't even the sub for this. What do you think?Who would you wanna see.. Ian aka idubbbz? That wouldn't be fair though because Ethans 47 years oldMy friend told me that Ethan ended his life. I can’t find anything about it. Can anyone confirm whether this is true or not?

a lot of shit makes sense now when it comes to h3h3 vs the bradberry boys. for example, when post-malone contacted them, they pretended to not know who ethan/h3h3 were despite the "kill h3h3" thing the same week(?), because they didn't want to shittalk ethan/hila without knowing them so they did the next best thing: pretend they didn't know who they were. it's very likely they saw the h3h3 vids on them and realized that they weren't hateful in nature, but weren't sure if they had beef or not. I guess they didn't want to be like "oh ya we know OF them, just don't know them personally. have no opinion on those two" since they'd just come across as robotic or maybe seen in the wrong light. I get what they did, they did the best thing in the scenario they were presented.






def gained a lot of respect for them, and have been the most surprising guests up til now. 




I wanna hang out with ethan bradberry, he seems like one of the extremely few "pure" people left on earth. I believe him when he says he didn't know what a meme was. ... is that Ethan never asked the Bradberries about the "kill h3h3" thing. I know it might've been tough, but that thing was really strange and I think we need an explanation for it.The Bradberry boys were much nicer and cool-headed than i'd have imagined from watching their vids. 
Ethan seems like a really genuine, kind fellow, whereas in the vids he looks like an absolute lunatic. 
I was surprised that there was even a podcast featuring them because of how they ignored ANYONE who mentioned spidermanelsa, but they faced and embraced it like true chanpions.
Newfound respect for those guys, and i'm glad they finally learned what memes are.

Anybody know some good h3 themed gamertags for Xbox?After the Asian Jake Paul roast it would be great to have Idubbbz back even though Ethan probably knows a lot of info since be collabed.I could have sworn it hasn't happened yet, but I saw someone got a skateboard.https://clips.twitch.tv/PeacefulSpookyBobaTooSpicyI'm doing a research report on fair use and want to sight the H3H3 fair use lawsuit against Hoss. Does anyone have a link to a copy or a PDF? I can only find one from 2016 which is all that Hoss alleges. I want the final say that Ethan and Hila mention in their video
Papa BlessI recently went looking for the shirts available when E&amp;H first opened their store, but can’t find them. I remember there was an oppressed one and a black psychadellic looking one that were both awesome. Are they still available, or will they ever be again? I can’t find any info on this.regardless: I enjoyed his stories, fake or not, and he actually made me want to *try*. so I think I get him and his appeal to a certain degree. that being said: he definately has a high "speaking IQ", I doubt he's mensa level in any way, though.appreciate yaCan someone tell me which h3h3 vid Ethan said “you must be fuckin SIIIICK!!” in? I need the audio for itLike many of you, I have been anxiously waiting to rep the Hila Kleiners with her fashion line that's coming out soon. Specifically for the hat that Ethan and Hila wear. Does anyone know if it is "one size fits all" or does it have an adjustable strap. Appreciate ya!
Does anyone have gifs of Ethan from the content cop? Particularly the part where he first turns around and also the walking bit? Thanks :)Maybe I'm dumb. I wanted to know what time the podcast goes live, basically info on broadcast times/dates andcould not find this information ANYWHERE.

Places I checked:

* H3H3 Facebook page about section

* H3H3 twitch channel about page

* H3H3 subreddit sidebar

* H3H3 main website

* H3 podcast YouTube page about section

I was finally able to figure it out by looking at last episode's instagram post with Tai Lopez at the time it was posted.

As a suggestion to Ethan and Hila if you see this, you should make that information very easy to find. I knew how to figure it out but it should be easily accessible for new viewers who wouldn't necessarily know where to look.

Ethan would probably love an Elon Musk hug pillow. I imagine it with a dapper business look on one side and a muscular topless physique display on the other.

I am of course a cheap bastard not living in the US and without any clue about how to make such pillows, but I just wanted to throw this idea in here.Sharing my Highlights so far! if you see me around with my H3h3 Pallid mask, come say hi!

This is not flair that came from Ethan and Hila, but the subreddit mods loved what you did with your merch posts and 'preciated the creativity applied to your H3H3 flexxin', so this deserves its own flair. Be warned. This flair may blow up once Teddy Fresh is released [more info in the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/wiki/frequently_asked_questions).


Papa Bless!Please, it bothers me that ive watched this channel since 5k subs and have no idea what it is, is that Michelle Obama? Was she talking about our Ethan? Please. It was posted an hour ago and already has over 457,000 views and 113k likes     Ethan recently pointed out YouTube's bullshit ways on enforcing their own rules.  It has become quite obvious that their platform has become over saturated with creators and in return YouTube distributes rules to maximize their own profits as it lets its community fall.  Whatever looks good for YouTube/Google is what's going to fly on this platform.  Creators are no longer a first and freedom of speech is limited to YouTube's automated enforcement system which is scripted for the eye of the advertisers.  The mess of facilities that host YouTube's faculty is filled with men in suits and who speak in tongues of business.  On the outside of this facility creators are getting slammed left and right.  Large creators' earnings and growth get struck by bias opinions among YouTube's staff and the majority of the creators, the unknown creators, get hidden and killed off by the botched automated system.  
     I'm by no means the most credible creator to speak on behalf of the whole community which is why I ask of you to voice your problems with YouTube here.  Almost every creator on YouTube's platform goes unheard because the majority of YouTube's creators are small.  They are... unknown.  And it's these unknown creators that are being killed off by YouTube's growth.  YouTube's attempt at managing such a large platform is taking a turn for the worse.  The system has become completely automated and designed against small channel growth.  We see the problems that are going on with the large creators and we experience them on a whole other level.  Yet no one seems to know the problems the majority of creators are facing.  I know there are many channels far worse off than mine which is why I won't use it for an example.  I'll simply type out my issues with YouTube below in attempts to encourage others to speak of their hardships with YouTube.  All I can do is complain at this point.  Most people will not hear that they're among the same difficulties as one another and most of the small creators will never understand what they're doing isn't wrong.  This platform is being turned against us.  Overpopulation always results in a purge.  Recently Ethan uploaded this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj8n78AuN3w

despite being confronted by this, youtube is still remaining quiet about the adpocolypse and their monetization policies. I do have an idea on how we can finally can get some answers from youtube and perhaps even some much deserved change.

it may sound crazy but seeing how Ethan kept on referencing Jimmy Kimmel, I believe we should tweet Ethan's video to Jimmy Kimmel himself.



Here's my reasoning:



1) Youtube is a business, Kimmel on the other hand is 1 person (a public person on top of that). 



2) He is not on Youtube's Payroll.



3) Given that the context involves supporting the charities for the Vegas Shooting victims and how youtube is interfering with that, this might get him mad at Youtube.



4) If he is willing to invite a youtuber on his show, then he might be willing to at least talk about Ethan's Video.



5) As crazy as it sounds, we are more likely to get Jimmy's response/opinions on youtube's policies than we are going to get answers from youtube themselves.



If we tweet him enough, he might get results. I'm not saying you should harass Jimmy Kimmel. I'm saying we should ask the guy who's always in youtube's trending section about exactly why he's always in youtube's trending section. Again, if you going tweet him the video, don't harass him.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctmZGSyMFy4 Right at the beginning of the videoTalks about how YouTube is selectively enforcing their guidelines but still supports and streams on a site like Twitch where that has been happening for a while. Really makes ya think.How can ethan go and say that when he was favored in twitch and got away with stuff that others got banned for?

I think YouTube communities who are tired of this trending page on YouTube need to put together a day or a week to just down vote everything on the trending page.The H3H3 Merch site defaults all clothing sizes to XXXL, whereas most sites just default to "select a size"

So a month has passed since the Mattsacre, and the guy hasn't done anything to his channel, facebook, G+, or official website. Does anyone know where he is? I'm curious to see the aftermath.[Copying /u/neohylanmay 's comment here because more people need to see just how wrong Ethan's newest video was. The comment right under theirs further drives the point home.](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/754ne5/comment/do3ha8p?st=J8K7W8R5&amp;sh=5c36e3de)


&gt;OK, I gotta fucking vent about this because I am sick to fucking death about people throwing the word around and to also strike before the comments section is too full for anyone to actually see.

&gt;It's not fucking "censorship", Ethan. Casey's video is still up. YouTube are still hosting them to be viewed publicly. Considering how much it costs YouTube/Google to even keep Neistat's video up (bandwidth, storage) while simultaneously not making a cent off of it, YouTube are practically pissing money down the drain and willing to keep it that way. Considering how much of a cash drain YouTube is to Google;  you'd think they'd want to hand onto every cent they could potentially make off of any video.  
&gt;And those are the videos that *YouTube* have demonetised: What about everyone that uses the website who skips - or worse, blocks - the ads? As a fellow YouTube Partner yourself; you know as well as I do that if anyone does either of those, you don't get a molecule of ad revenue from that view. Sure, that may just be one view, but how many people on this website do it? I've seen people outright *boast* about it. Fuck, I'm guilty of skipping a good portion of the ads myself. When we do it, it's "convenience"... but when YouTube does it, it's "censorship". If you're going to go after YouTube for their demonetisation policy, the least you could do is also go after every single YouTube user who do the same thing.

&gt;Also speaking of Neistat: for a video highlighting his video on the Las Vegas tragedy (and thus could be argued as being about it by proxy); way to not link to the [GoFundMe page that he created](https://www.gofundme.com/lovearmylasvegas) and had linked to in his video (or not mention it in the video at all).

&gt;And since I mentioned the Partnership Program; [the *Jimmy Kimmel Live* channel is overseen by a MCN (Disney)](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/jimmykimmellive). And since some MCNs actually have their own ad partners, it's possible that the ads aren't directly from YouTube themselves, more rather a third party. So what MCN is Neistat part of? None. Completely independent, not signed to anything. He is under as much scrutiny to YouTube's Policies on monetisation as I am (as a YouTube Partner myself who is not signed to any MCN).  
&gt;It should also be noted that the likes of Kimmel, Colbert, Fallon, or any type of "official YouTube channel of the TV show"-type channel all run on TV.  
&gt;Where they have ads running on them.  
By default.  
&gt;I'll assume the advertisers were OK with having their ads running during those shows' commercial breaks, so YouTube auto-approves because they already have proof: The clips can't be "advertiser unfriendly" *if the shows were already running adverts during their initial broadcasts*.

&gt;Additionally, you do know that when a video is monetised, the creator is not the only one who makes money off of it, right? YouTube takes a cut of it, as well as the MCN (if you're part of one, like Kimmel is and Neistat isn't). While I nor you nor anyone here know the ratios in Kimmel's case (and those under the Partnership are contractually obligated to not say anyway); assuming those ads you showcased on Kimmel's video are indeed first-party, YouTube supplied: if you want to be mad at YouTube for anything, how about *profiting off of the deaths of innocent people in a fucking mass shooting*. ***THAT'S*** why they actively chose to demonetise Neistat's video. Because he's not signed up a multi-channel network, YouTube would be taking a much larger cut of the revenue earned and they don't want to be making that kind of money, hence their phrasing of "no matter the intent" in the tweet they made.

-----

&gt;As a sidenote, since you briefly mentioned it: On the topic of "iDubbbz not hitting Trending": You make it sound like the video completely failed to reach anyone. What does the view count on that stand at right now, 16 *million* views, half of those within the first 24 hours? For a channel that has fewer subscribers than that number ("only" 5.3M) and only does a video once every few weeks (isn't that kind of behaviour known to "kill" a channel because that's pretty damn infrequent?), I'd chalk that up to a success: it didn't need to be "Trending", since everyone ended up sharing it anyway. That "Share" button underneath the video exists for a reason.

Ethan's become the very thing he likes to make fun of in his videos. He's basically the leader of the YouTube drama cult of outrage. Please don't say "haha, but his sister is in ever video, haha"As far as I can tell, he is still in Israel, is this really true?Streaming at: October 10, 2017 at 02:56PM Game: Talk Shows Current viewers: 0 Stream preview: http://ift.tt/2osx19a Channel URL: http://ift.tt/2opC9dk Papa Bless!

appreciate yaCan some one tell me why this guy has almost 1 million subs on YouTube? Why is he going to be the next guest on h3 podcast? From what I can see, he only makes content of him playing the card game Hearth Stone. He seems to be a pretty average "Let's Player" who plays a game I've never heard of. Not as entertaining as Video Game Dunkey or even Maximillian_Dood. 

I'm thinking next week's episode won't be for me.   I'm planning on making a gift for my boyfriend of a dunny doll. I'm pretty confident in the process of making it (but if you have any measurements or advise please tell me) but what material of fabric do you think they're made of? Thanks!I'm not sure if this has been addressed yet, but I find it very frustrating the amount of visual stuff there is in a podcast. It makes me much less likely to listen when I'm in a position where I can't watch it. I don't mind a few bits as long as whatever's on screen is described and isn't that crucial tip the discussion.

Other than that, great work guys. Keep it up! :)This just occurred to me, if Jimmy Kimmel and others push their own advertisers on their YouTube videos, are they also getting part of the revenue from YouTube Red subscribers that watch their videos? It seems like if YouTube were consistent in their campaign against monetizing videos of tragedies they would block this source of revenue, or are they just blocking these videos from being seen next to advertisers. I'm not sure how this works at all, but I assume when a video is demonetized that would include YouTube Red clicks as well. [According to TotalBiscuit, YouTube Red clicks are worth, on average, 20 times more than a normal ad view.](https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/totalbiscuit-youtube-red-payout/)Ethan has a good YouTube persona, but he's kind of an annoying person when you just watch how he talks during the podcast. The one time he's ever been criticized he didn't really handle it like an adult and just sort of whined about it when he was drunk and blamed everyone, but him for the hate towards him. He actually never really acknowledged he did anything wrong to this day. Even though I believe in the end Ethan had more hate toward him than he deserved, he still handled the situation somewhat like a child who can't admit he's ever wrong. Idk I will watch h3h3 on YouTube till the day I can't anymore, but I might omit from watching the podcast to save myself from not liking Ethan as a person. Again no hate towards anyone. Title. The hell happened to this guy? Has anyone seen him around since the lawsuit? Is he just gone? Did he ever do that AMA? 

&amp;nbsp;

WE NEED ANSWERS!I freaking love the H3H3 Podcast. Ethan and Hila have gotten so much better at hosting and the guests have been phenomenal. 

It really feels like a natural progression for the channel as the supply of reaction videos got out of hand. I fell in love with the channel because of the reactions, and I am glad that they will always be there to watch over and over again. That being said, I have not been a huge fan of the more recent reactions. There doesn't seem to be the same passion going into them and a lot of the topics have been covered already.

The podcast, on the other hand, has been getting better and better. You got all the meme legends coming on and we get to hear their genuinely interesting perspectives. Dunkey and Leah were awesome and with Kripparian on the horizon, I cannot wait for the future of the podcast. 

Papa BlessI’d happily watch them on Vidme if it meant they got more money and didn’t have to compromise their content.Honestly curious about how far he fell into the everquest hole. Has Ethan ever talked about that other than the Dunkey podcast?This is getting crazy, i know that the reaction videos were on fire but lately this is getting full SLAMMING.

PLEASE Ethan address the issue because the cringe is to strong.

Do you think anything will go down for the 5 mil milestone? It looks like it's only a couple of weeks away.Hear me out,

A former enemy who, later in life has "swapped" sides and has  a connection to the hero but is still kinda a jerk. 

Ethan and Gila are Goku and Joey Salads is Vegeta. Just a reminder to everyone who tries to support the show. The $5 that they take from your account can be used as in-store credit, but it's not refundable. Very slimy if you ask me. Don't think I'm going to try anymore stuff from any of the show's sponsors.It was a comedy show, can't remember the name, Ethan suggested it very strongly a few podcasts ago. Thanks for the help! On one of the podcasts Ethan mentioned he has a favorite TV show. I IMDBed it when he first mentioned it, thought it looked interesting, planned on watching it, but have forgotten which show it was. Anyone leads???Back on September 5th, I ordered two shirts from the H3H3 shop, and I have still received nothing, not even an email confirming it arrived. I kept searching and on the shop's site, it said if you haven't received your package within two days of said "delivery" then to email them. I tried multiple times and I have gotten nothing back. I don't know who to contact at this point because I don't know where it is at, or who has it. 

Has anyone else had problems with the shop or is it just me? I have been waiting for a long time now, and it seems highly unordinary to wait this long for two shirts. 

As always, papa bless! that is allI needed a place to barf this out.  It started as a youtube comment, but it became unruly.  
I didn't want to post this on a MORE relevant subreddit 'cause I'd get TOO much bias.  So I thought I'd emote here.  I know there is a lot of bias here, boi, but at least you people -YEA YOU PEOPLE- will have some content.

This post is in regards to a Keemstars twitter video babble the other day. I don’t have a date because I saw it reposted by someone on youtube. (Full blast violation of fair use)

This rant is about how in the video he says that people are saying "Keemstar, you've changed. I like you now. I didn't before, but I like you now" and he blames it on the fact that those people didn't like him because they were told to like him. It's triggered me.

Preface, I am not a fan. Never was and struggle to fathom how I ever could be.

I'm not upset about the claim that people didn't like him 'cause they were told that he's a piece of shit from someone else, then instead of investigating they just agreed. I believe he is accurate with this. It may be a fault, but it's a fault of humanity. It's what we do.

What I am irritated with the how he says. "I haven't changed one bit" Yea. That's the problem. He hasn't changed one bit since he was 16 (that’s a full blast guess ‘cause I don’t know the fuckin’ dude). He's the TMZ of the internet - but less relevant. Content that’s provided is nothing but mindless gossip. A man who seemingly hasn’t ever brought up a discussion that created a space for intellectual debate or an opportunity for learning and growth. Oh… minus the times he was exposed for being a kid diddlin' pervert and the time he dropped the "N-Word". Interesting and important conversations were brought up by these things - so kudos to him for being a scumbag.

In that rant, he says that if you didn't like him in the past, but do now, you're a dick 'cause you're going to turn on him again later. I am taking liberties with what he said, but it's basically how I’ve interpreted it. He is so disconnected from reality. For a person who has had brand loyalty issues in the past, I wouldn’t think he can afford to alienate newcomers.

I want to hope that he’s an intelligent businessman who put on this show. A show where he creates drama as a means of bringing more clicks (and dollars) to his channel. I want to believe that this is calculated behavior. I think in part it is true, but if anyone has succumbed to Poes Law, it’s this guy. The value he brings is minute. Shit, I'm not a religious man, but he's the reason Christians have rules against praising false idols.

He has biases but feigns neutrality. He is manipulative and disingenuous. He stirs shit and wallows in it. This is not a man worthy of praise. Newcomers or old fans.

He is fucking alzheimers.
Ever since I saw the "I feel like shit" bomber jacket on Twitter, I've been wondering, do we have any prices or general range to go by? Ethan said "stylish and affordable" but really, how affordable?So after some expert googling for the h3h3 merch stores, I've come across two different stores that both seem plausible. 

there's this one: http://www.h3h3productions.com/merch/
and this one: https://h3h3shop.com/

Are they both affiliated with H3H3? Is one more real than the other? Am I being goofed? Has this question been resolved and I'm asking a redundant question? Am I asking too many questions?This Chrome extension mutes the pre roll ad automatically and unmutes when you skip the ad or when the ad ends.

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youmuter/hbhjkldledabllijjmnmfhhiejephibe   So recently I found Susan (I'm not even going to try to spell her last name), the youtube ceo, new YouTube channel. Now at first this sounds like YouTube trying to shove down that they are "listening" without actually listening. What I was surprised is a pretty good way to try and communicate with the community on how to improve youtube.
[Her explanation for the creation of the channel](https://youtu.be/APdx_RTC8Bs)
The gist of the video is that
#1 try to create a simpler way that YouTube content creators and viewers can have a conversation directly with the CEO. 
TBH I think she may stick to the more kid friendly creators in since that's the people she showed in the video. Which may be a bit troubling but I still think this a step in the right direction.



#2 she wants to start a series where she has a conversation with content creators that would  usually be private.

Again kind of troubles me becuase although she did show pictures of some of these creators they mostly stayed within the vlog/comedy type of creators. Which doesn't show the whole spectrum of different creators on the platform.

#3 she wants to experience how it feels to be a creator and use the tools youtube gives them. 

This is probably the thing that I thought was the most interesting. Her trying to experience the problems that youtubers Are experiencing  is a good way to try understand the community and it's complaints. Now I don't think she'll get close to experiencing having her livelihood depend on whether or not the demonization monster comes for her but it's better than what they were doing before. Which was nothing the closest thing was tom and his creator insider which was still a bit underseen even after the vid Ethan and hila made shouting him out.
Now the main issue I had with this video were the comments and dislikes. Most of these  are saying things like. I don't want communication I want change. Which isn't how the problems are going to get fixed others are people just hating Susan for her politics and saying that's the reason youtube is broken. I think that a lot of people are hurt by how YouTube has treated them  rightfully so but youtube is taking steps in the right direction and people are over reacting most people making videos are 100% hating without any constructive criticism. 
Just something I wanted to bring to the community and Ethan

This is what originally lead me to subscribe to h3h3productions. Though the topic is outdated, the style was ahead of it's time, and still is. It has been said a lot of times before, but I would love a return to this kind of style; slightly edgy, but had a true purpose.You guys *might* recognize me as the douchebag hipster old guy who gave away his winning sauce during Szechuanpocolypse.    Well, the other day, pewdiepie featured me in his video here: https://youtu.be/sSJ0Rtvs5Z4?t=239 (3:59 time stamp) and was upset I had also shared the sauce with /r/roosterteeth (and /r/bingingwithbabish), so i tried commenting about 5 times on that video and even sent out a ton of messages on Twitter, but to no avail. I even had my friend /r/antvenom tweet it out from a verified account, but he has still not noticed.

I legit want to send him some and figured some of you might be able to make that happen.

Here is a pic of me, right now, for proof: https://i.imgur.com/vK1pK1O.jpg

I want to wear this for Halloween this year, but all of the links to the articles of clothing are now sending me to target pages with the product removed.

Does anyone know where else I could find these products? I'm mainly worried about just the shorts and hat, the rest of it shouldn't be an issue.

Thanks!The link is down from the description of that video and I can’t find it anywhere else. Thanks in advance.What would I search up to find the wide shorts that Ethan’s wears a lot? Heard Ethan [tell an interesting story here](https://youtu.be/hrEFpGiETu8?t=3910) about a party as his house. Also mentioned things like how money changes people around you, etc. I think it'd be interesting.  
   
What do you guys think?I need help finding a particular blue beanie and I thought: who better to ask than the beanie gods of Reddit. I received it as a gift from my girlfriend a few years back. I had worn it for the past few winters but this year, I just can't seem to find it anymore. It's my favorite hat so I'm really looking hoping to find and order another one.

Here's what I know about it. It's a dark blue hat that looks very similar to the right one in this image:
https://image.rakuten.co.jp/jxt-style/cabinet/01958586/tn-7574715_08.jpg
It does not have the black "Tes Cal" logo though. Instead it has a brown circular logo badge that is leathery. I don't remember the actual logo though and I can't find any photos that show it. I do know that she purchased it for around $40 from the Newbury Comics in Providence place a few years back.

If anyone's seen the beanie online or even know what company makes it I would love to know! Thanks a lot guys!

So, I know that they don't make as many vids because of the YouTube Ad-pocalypse, but was there any mention of them making videos on other sites? I mean like real videos, not podcasts. I am aware of those.I saw the gif on this subreddit and I think it said it was from an old video but the gif is Ethan sort of duck walking and making faces at hila as they walk past each other. It killed me then and could use it now... Any help?Does anyone have a downloadable sound byte of Ethan or Hila saying whuddup pimps? I want to make it my text sound.Oh Lord please it's so good and I'm a sucker for jazzPoor Kripparian had to have an emergency appendectomy, so we shuffled some things around and Total Biscuit will be joining us.

In a nutshell the guy for all his flaws, he is incredibly charismatic.

I stil see people saying how “he has improved a lot” and how “he has changed”. No he hasn’t.

Don’t get me wrong. The guy is a bully. But every trap needs to be beautiful otherwise nobody would fall for them.

He gives the illusion that he is a “genuine” person becuase he seldomly hides his asshole side. Say on h3h3 podcat you can see how Ethan can pretend to be super nice with people he hates. Keem can’t or not as well at least.

He is always helping people. But he ain’t a charity. He  does it becuase this gives him control over others as idubbbz pointed out. 

Yes Ethan was an hypocrite with the pewdiepie fiasco. But Keem doesn’t care about it. He is only using this to get revenge on Ethan.
Just like he tried to use Riccegum to get revenge on idubbbz.

Ethan is not perfect and neither is idubbbz. The gnome will find things to use on them, obviously, becuase they are just human. Like you and me. We humans make mistakes. It’s what we do. Doesn’t mean they are suddenly as bad as him.

The difference is how we can accept and improve from our mistakes. Ethan is doing it. Keem isn’t.

Don’t fall for it. This is still the same bully gnome that will destroy lives as long as he gets money and views.


You don’t have to always agree with them

They won’t always be right . Like any other human they have flaws.

But as long a their heart is in the right place who cares? 

I personally don’t agree with Ethan on the “n” word fiasco. But I still like him as a person. 

Probably Ethan was more hurt about people siding with keem than him, possibly, being wrong.

Everyone that makes a stand against bullies like him is cool in my book.

Relax and give them a chance. 

Let me tell you a secret. Most, if not all, comedians suffer from depression. Ethan suffers from it as he told Jordan Peterson.  So it’s best to rememeber that behind all fuppa jokes there is a human being with feelings and weaknesses.

Y'all are a bunch of entitled fuckheads. Go cry somewhere else. They don't like making YouTube videos anymore and have been doing quality podcasts for over a year now. They aren't going to go back to doing something they don't like because some people on the subreddit are salty. Get over it.I'm really frustrated by the argument in this  community that because other community members are upset about the ad that because of their upset they're not truly a part of the vape naysh.

1 point I would like to make:

1. I've been with E&amp;H/H3H3 since their videos were about leaving for america for the last time to get started with their lives. I got to know them as people a goofer and a shy young woman who were working thier asses off to MAKE something of themselves. We shared jokes and memes and crazy stories and even if it's single sided, got to know ethan and hila. Then all the sudden TF comes along and they're wearing it EVERY EPISODE of H3 Podcast. plugging it on their social media, and generally doing whatever it takes to get their name out there. Then ethan gets depressed and stops making videos all togeher cause that's like your friend going away and you can't do anything about it. losing a friend sucks, but whatever we stick around for the podcast anyways cause we want to support ethan and hila. Me Personally I'm annoyed with how h3 does ads many others are annoyed by it too and but this is something E&amp;H need to figure out in terms of refining their show.  BUT NOW THIS BULLSH\*T!? The first video you make in a month is a straight up AD for a game YOU directed the development of, and its basically a money sink? That's straight fucking greedy, and that's not cool. I think you can tell intent by a finished product so if they're putting out a game that basically sucks money in for a good experience, I think we know what the priorities were when it came time to plan the game. So yeah as a member of a community centered around two people, it's really starting to feel like those people, who aren't putting out funny videos or making appearances, or anything like are really just trying to make a money grab with an ad laden podcast and a freemium game that sucks money from your wallet.

Just because we're here and upset doesn't mean we're not part of the group or our frustrations aren't legit. I think it means we're disappointed by how shallow something we used to love has become.

After listening to this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Rg86IrNbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Rg86IrNbo) it showed me he is just as sensitive as Ethan. And don't say he was just doing it to be funny. There was more than a hint of jealousy in his tone when talking about Gervais.

I'm not defending Ethan either but it does show that Burr can't take a joke when he's defending Hollywood royalty because Gervais was "Too mean" to them. He took it WAY too personally when Ethan asked him how many siblings he has and the rest of the interview went to complete shit after it. I'm leaning more to Burr just being a dick rather than Ethan being unprofessional in the podcast.

Also FYI, I've NEVER liked the h3h3 podcast except the couple of boogie ones. Ethan ISN'T a good podcaster and hasn't improved with time either BUT I feel as if the fans just piled on him for other reasons than the podcast with Burr itself. Seemed unfair to me.If you want to post a Suggestion on this sub, you must do it in these threads. If you don't post it here, the post will be deleted.

check this out bai**WADDUP BEEG PEEMPS!!**I have a tiny channel where I talk about keeping pet praying mantis and random ideas and other stuff I'm interested in. I got two videos yellowed last week. It really sucks, because I already make such a tiny amount of money.

[Here's a video, if you guys wanna check it out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUdw_FHypQg)Please share the comment if you canWhich email address did you try to contact? We had some issues with customer support on this first round that was really unforgiveable, so sorry about that. We'll refund you and make sure you get the t shirts as well. Please send an email to shop@h3h3productions.com and we'll sort you out ASAP.We know about direct ads because, like Kimmel, we also use them. When we get the yellow mark our direct ads still DO NOT run. Also, all direct sales still go through YouTubes system, is approved by them and they still take their 45% cut.

For clarity, our MCN sells ads directly on our content, just like ABC does on Kimmel, but YouTube is always the middle man. They are completely involved in the process and it uses their ad system. They make 45% on all sales and approve all sales, just like regular ads. The only difference here, which has already been confirmed to us by YouTube, is that Jimmy Kimmel (and a select few other channels, mostly owned by big media) have special exceptions that bypass their ad policy so they would never be demonetized.  Since our video has been posted, they have confirmed to us that they are working to close that exception because their ad policy should be consistently enforced across the board.

Regarding their comments about censorship. What else would you call it? Rewarding some speech and punishing others? Sure they are not straight up silencing them, but they are heavily dissuading them from making a type of content. There is also a good chance the algorithm promotes them far less once they've been demonetized and marked as "problematic" by classifiers.  Meanwhile Jimmy Kimmel is #1 trending and full ads.Email me h3h3productions@gmail.com Sorry guys, we totally flipped it up. We were doing the Teddy Fresh photoshoot today and got completely distracted, we meant to change the offline screen to say no podcast today but no one was in the office to change it in time. It won't happen again. We're going to make a podcast twitter to make any announcements and we're also going to publish our schedule for the entire month because the days won't be consist anymore. Because of our guest's dynamic schedules, it makes more sense to plan it around their availability instead of always having to be on Friday or Tuesday. 

Sorry if we wasted your time D: I'll definitely boof that podcast if they do it again. Erik always has a unique way of making his talks interesting, and then Jack's forehead also compliments Erik's contributions well.  Ask him "Are traps gay" and see how he overreacts and is sensitive to memes ... Pewdiepie ?Don't get ahead of yourself, there.Philly D is as cheesy as as a Philly Chee. I usually agree with his point of view, which I guess can be cathartic to watch for many, but his subject matter is down there with TMZ, and he primarily focuses on YouTube drama and clickbait titles for clicks.

For instance, his most recent video headline is "DISGUSTING! McKayla Maroney Reveals Horrible "Treatment", BBC Twists Youtube Problem, and More..."

Yea right fucking kidsI dont have questions but Ethan should bring up how big of a fanboy Julien is for Doc.You weren't awkward! It was great meeting you, thanks for the awesome pic w my mom, I took her for her bday! 🤗I don't really watch either but my roommate watches both and to me scarce is just flat out boring. Keemstar is, if nothing else, high energy. Oh yes that is one of my favorite videos of theirsH3h3 should collab with his brand 

Teddy Fresh x Suprem How is your sex life?What is elsagate? I don’t know anything. Google is not helping before a smartass shows ups.It's not that we don't want to talk about it, we've already made 3+ videos on this. Heck, one of our videos is even featured in the linked Verge article, it's also worth noting that YouTube demonetized that video. Glad to see its finally getting traction, but at this point I feel like we'd be beating a dead horse, on top of that YouTube has removed any incentive to actually make the video.  

I'm digging in for sure seeing if there is anything new here.*Implying youtube red doesn’t exist. And as long as they charge for it they well dam give a good service for it. Because they DO owe us a service for paying youtube red.Is this person fucking retarded?

Not my fault you lack reading comprehension skills....lolNot live, looping. He prolly filmed alot of stuff and gonna loop each clip 20 times before the next clips start loopingLook at the channels playlists, bunch of kids singing, kinda pedoish

https://www.youtube.com/user/patomuzic/playlistsLook at his liked videos, bunch of kids singing....

https://www.youtube.com/user/patomuzic/playlistsOh ok, didnt know thatI do not like posts new forehead tatOmg this guy added an extra line in the thumbnail call the fucking policeWow incredible job you guys, what a thrill ride, especially for myself who woke up at 3am last night with fever dreams of Patrice peaking thru my bedroom window. I knew I could count on you guys to save my ass, papa bless ya detective boys!Kinda sad for him that people already found out, he prolly put a lot of work into it and then after the first day people know his motive. BLOOD-TEE HELL!!What's creepy is some of these just look like people living their lives in other places and then their videos get over run with sexual creeps. It's scary to think what's put there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onyFMJJ6ji8

At some random anime convention some kid decided to start peeing on stage in the middle of a KA-MEH-HA session. Hope you will watch it on the podcastLmao you must watch rick and morty and have an iq of 200. I bet within the first 30 seconds of the livestream u said to yourself "you fools, can't you tell it's just a marketing stunt?" before you cut off the stream and continued you work on your revolutionary theory of quantum physics that is going to change the world as we know it You should be able to decide on your own. Have convictions. Or don’t. That’s up to you. The majority is not always right.That’s a misconception. YouTube doesn’t have profits. But Adsense on YouTube sure does.My point is that their parent company google does make a ton of money with them, through Adsense.Well guess We’ll have to see a citation from a reliable source to know for sure.No. You made the first claim by saying youtube gains nothing. I only challenged it.

The burden of proof is on you.Nice. Here is my counter:

https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/26/alphabet-earnings-q3-2017-.htmlA for effortNah he s more of a  sociopathTropes don’t apply to real people. Even tv tropes admits it's not appropriate.

I don’t think vacations are an option for Ethan. The internet is his only slurce of income for one.Knawledge!!!!!I love how he claims he loves books yet also admits to only read book summaries. He is great memorizing quotes but the guy is a huge scam.Yah let’s be real. The only reason Scarce and Drama alert exist is becuase gossip is super profitable. There is no artistic desire on reporting youtube drama.https://twitter.com/KEEMSTAR/status/935632710244208640?s=17

As for why, as in how it started I don’t know. But you can see Keem admitting his beef with Ethan on that tweet up there.Yeah I personally didn’t like digibrony’s idea that you can judge a whole anime on just the first episode. But that doesn’t substract merit from everything else he does.I only know Chad (anything4views) said Ethan is an asshole on real life. Chad claims Ethan is a plagiarist, but he didn’t prove any of his claims.

Seems to be related to the fact that idubbbz lost contacrt witch Chad.

Keem also says that Ethan is fake in real life.

Neither Keem nor Chad have given evidence. But Ethan admitted some guilt on his twitter.As much as it pains me to say this. Keem doesn’t care about that money. I don’t doubt he has more. That sum is nothing to him.

What Keem really wants is to get revenge on h3h3. I have yet to hear good advice from him. He just gives random quotes from succesful bussines  people.

His advice on half assing  a book daily is bullshit.

And his program is a scam. He claims to be Selling the secret to happyness on his program I call bullshit on that.

Tai Lopez is super charismatic but he is also full of shit.Not really. My disagreements on how much it’s him just being” a character” aside


The context is actually on Ethan the  person:the real human being. The context is of him admitting having issues with fame as a person on the OP.

Real people aren’t “flanderized”. At most you could say he overacts. &gt;are you new to this garbage?

Condecending much? 

If you have paid attention you would know keem doesn’t like Ethan nor idubbbbz. The fact that he will use it for profit is .... obvious.&gt; control

Yeap. Textbook Bully.What racists things has this jonntron guy had said? First time I have heard of himOh I see. Seems like he is indeed a horrible human being.

Thanks for tellingI can tell you're really upset and I'm sorry you're feeling that way. I tried my best to toe a really difficult line, it was tough. Sorry that I disappointed ya. Wish ya the best.Downvote me a way. But I have to admit you have a point.

Sure being nice to guests is a thing. But EThan not calling a literal white supramacists while still calling PewdiePie on using a slur (without any racial connotation ) is something  I don’t agree with.Escept being a POS white suprmacistOn the other hand having racist opinions doesYes it does.

There is no “my people” We all are human beings. The idea of “my people” is in itself racist.

JonTron is a white supremacist and so are you.

I am very sorry. Words cannot describe how saf this is. But least he know he isn’t alone.

My prayers go to him.He's a whiney fat bitchYo dude email us at hilalilushklein@gmail.com and we'll definitely sort something out!Cos nobody knows who the hell Team 10 is. I'm pretty sure neither of them are happy about it, they tend to disagree with Israeli politics being influenced by religion, which with it being a Jewish state, is largely unavoidable. Ethan tweeted that they were invited but couldn't do it because of scheduling issues. Damn, that Fupa loss has been working Just ethnic. I think she wears the Star of David but I don't believe she practices Judaism like she eats pork and stuff, but she doesn't like bacon. I read that this guy was an asshole and a sex offender. It's the top comment on the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/4x2zlo/how_can_a_cooking_show_be_this_sad/d6bzs6j/)Hey dude, no clue how this happened but our support is run completely in house by us Dan and Ian. They are usually excellent at getting back to people and we do our best to make everyone happy and make sure everyone has a good experience, we're really sorry you had a bad experience 😔. The fulfillment service is way behind right now because of the holiday but it's totally unacceptable and we'll be looking for a new partner in January so there is less waiting between ordering and receiving. That being said we'll give you a full refund and make sure you get your sweater too, appreciate ya and sorry again.

Shoot me an email at h3h3productions@gmail.com and I'll make sure you get sorted.I like how the first time he showed Shredder on the main channel he said he was going straight into the gas chamber. Hila already had her pregnancy years ago, but they kept it a secret because this is himBest anime crossoverGenuinely won't be surprised if he just handed it to the dog and said "here doggy!".something.exe video... from quickscope simulator game lolwrong angle. camera should be from bellyThe nice chintendo 64 above the shirt is a fine touch, sir. Tip of the beanie to ye. I very seriously cannot wait for this, too perfect.Oh yeah, that bit on the Podcast with Joji and Post where he started talking about Slaughterhouse Five and some sort of fictional version of the Dresden bombings. Half of the posts in this subreddit are about Austin.  Im pretty sure it doesnt matter if it belongs here when the whole subreddit is informal enough to enjoy random memes and creative stuff that's even remotely connected to h3h3 and FF quitting is big news so yeah.Well Charlie Brooker has 2 young kids and is pretty into internet culture so I can see this happening. I was hoping he'd do a 2017 Wipe and feature the rise of the 'Logang and Jake Paulers' and everything else that's happened this year, but sadly he isn't. Really really late to this. But yeah, I don't think Ethan is malicious or devious, he just isn't that informed or interested in real world issues. Like in the Post Malone podcast with Joji he's talking about the Dresden Bombings and has no clue of the facts, according to Ethan, Dresden was bombed *Two days after Germany surrendered* as revenge for something??? In reality it was bombed in February 1945 *two months before Germany's surrender* he also quotes 300'000 as the number of casualties higher than both the Nazi propaganda figure (around 200'000), and the official figure of 20-22'000. He got all this from a book that also features aliens and time travel. So yeah he's not very well informed.  Feat. royalty free sad piano music, 2 minute hollow reflection on suicide, and then back to the goofs. At least he didn't dab on him. 

 But really he went to a place known for suicides happening so frequently they can't remove all of the bodies, and is then shocked to find a body. How did his handlers not stop him? Invite small youtubers for filler podcast Episodes!

Between inviting pewdiepie and Idubbbz we could  have a small channel we could meet.

That way you don’t have to improvise with Hila on a topic and you can promote small creators!Just found out my long time friends' dad took his life on new years. I want this fucker alone in a roomThis is really good! great job, Keep it up.I think the title is a little strong. he isn't WANTED (Criminal implications), the authorities just want to question him about the body he found. AFIK the article doesn't say anything about charges, unless I missed something?
glad I'm not the only one who thought the title was a little strong.&gt;When he's thicc and a weaboo

When he's thick and a [wehraboo](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitWehraboosSay/comments/6q8tlp/h3h3_and_dresden/)It would be a better role than any of the films he's been in for the last  20 years. Yes LWIAY and meme review are all about loganD00d, we love you guys. Everyone has something they need to figure out. Don't worry, you take as much time as you need. We'll always be here for you guys. Papa blessLol he's trying to look stupid so people make a video on him so he gets publicity. He was right he needs to re learn comedy  and get rid of those stupid half a frame pictures flashingHila looks cute afYou'd better open with 'Dis Ethan' Nah Ethan loves Howard Stern and fake callers are Stern 101. BAHDAT, MERCH. BAHDAT, MERCH.A+ for effort whoever made the wallpaperI don't get this love for Jordan Peterson, I find his theories tedious and overblown. An example would be the statement above 

&gt;He gives a step by step in dimensions on how to fix your life I believe. Not fix but BE Aware.... And how to fix any issues you have by Viewing them in "x amount of dimensions.

Surely this is just common sense. You identify a fault and you correct it. There's no need to view it in any other way because you can never accurately view it in any way other than your own perspective. 

There's also the sheer inaccuracies of his statements. He argues that the use of Zyklon B in the Concentration Camps is intrinsically linked to Hitler's obsession with cleanliness, Jews being parasites and its use as a pesticide in German factories which Hitler discovered when he was touring the factories. However, this negates that the use of Zyklon B in the camps, according to Rudolf Hoss, Commandant of Auschwitz, came from SS Captain Karl Fritzsch after he had used it on Red Army POWs. It also negates that a vast percentage of those killed in the Holocaust died from their treatment as a result of slave labour, starvation, disease or shooting. Hardly the methods of a man 'obsessed with cleanliness and order.' 

His views on Hitler and the Holocaust also ignore, the traditional European antisemitism and the rise in German antisemitism during its unification, which gives you a societal movement ready to explode. Peterson's ideas that this is all born from the German condition after WW1 is lazy and has already been largely disproved. This 'poor Germany' rhetoric ignores the state of the rest of Europe post 1918 with France largely in ruin as it was the battleground for the Western Front and the collapse of the world economy in 1929. It also ignores that the German war debt was funded by American loans with generous payment plans and the debt as a whole was reduced several times and eventually scrapped once the countries that demanded reparations were satisfied.  

tl;dr: Jordan Peterson's ideas are unnecessarily abstract and he attempts to rationalize Hitler's thought with no historical evidence to support it.  Don't believe the hype

His 'theories' are so abstract that he says things and people go, "oh that makes sense", even if his statements are factually inaccurate. On the last Podcast he argued that the use of Zyklon B in the Concentration Camps is intrinsically linked to Hitler's obsession with cleanliness, Jews being parasites and its use as a pesticide in German factories, 'which Hitler discovered when he was touring the factories.' However, this negates that the use of Zyklon B in the camps, according to Rudolf Hoss, Commandant of Auschwitz, came from SS Captain Karl Fritzsch after he had used it on Red Army POWs. It also negates that a vast percentage of those killed in the Holocaust died from their treatment as a result of slave labour, starvation, disease or shooting. Hardly the methods of a man 'obsessed with cleanliness and order.' I'm going to need to see his whole theory on this, all I can find is his work on abstract thought.Let me know why it looks like he’s wearing heels...
Well this is the H3 subreddit is it not? And these remarks were said on the H3 podcast were they not? History is my area of study not political science or psychology, and from a historical basis, the statement Peterson made on the H3 podcast is incorrect. 

Someone is salty because daddy Peterson isn't as clever as he seemsI’m gaggingIs 'The Thinning' referring to his hair?I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEE THIS REPLY What are his thoughts on Dresden and The Nuremberg Trials? I'm interested in his interpretation of events. Alternatively does he believe that strategic bombing can actually break the will of the people?  That kid will never be the same...People have nothing better to do Doggie what's ur apartment number for those hats? Won't let us send em without it! Looks awesome! I’m in highschool and we’re drawing portraits so I’m drawing Ethan as well! But it looks no we’re as good as this
I love his channel!I thought he plays chess?Really a high school edition?! I mean really Pretty sure that was a soflo thing? But yeah it's gonna be a cringe time Well of course ^ that is why you use cringe protectionYou know, that is actually a very good ideaWell to a certain extent everyone likes to be surrounded by similarly minded people, else life would be a constant battle of opinion. Watch the damn podcasts. He mentioned several times he cannot read comments. Yes, he can’t handle it. Would you be able to handle thousands shitty replies? I bet you could not. 😒 calm down. I am experienced with shitposting too. If you actually watch his videos, trews and/or listen to his podcasts, you'll see that he has opinions and valid points about almost everything. Even if you're not a leftist you can appreciate how much the guy knows about what he is talking about.
Politics aside, he has been through stuff that I think would be great to discuss in the H3podcast.Of course there's people that know more about leftist politics or that are more involved in leftist politics and social questions, but I think Russell Brand as I said is both funny and well-read about most things.Yea they seem like good choices as wellI disagree. Watch some of his videos or listen to his podcast. He also appeared in one episode of "Hot Wings", which I thought was great.I meant I don’t want to debate politics. Hence me saying “here”.To say "everyone" has valid points is a bit of a stretch. There's a difference between having an opinion on something you know nothing about and pretend you do, and having an opinion about something that interests you and that you know a lot about and have reflected a lot on.
Take JP for example. I disagree with most things he says, but you gotta acknowledge he knows a lot about the subject he is talking about. Even if you disagree with someone's views, the fact that they are well-read changes your view on their opinions and points, because they're not just spitting stuff out their mouth.
But yea I agree Russell can sound a little too "deep" and philosophical sometimes but that's what makes him fun to watch/listen to imo.Kind of cringe how they go from Jordan talking about the struggle between art and propaganda to Ethan having to interject about Teddy Fresh. The intellectual deficit is tangible. I agree with him, but from the historical context rather than the abstract thought he employs. For example when he was talking about the social structure of religion with the king being the highest tangible figure. This ignores Catholicism and the Pope who, until the Church of England was formed in 1534, was the highest religious figure, superseding all European kings in countries where Catholicism was practiced. Not happening. He'll want a big fat paycheck to fire up that big fat moral barometerBecause Ethan complains about the Pauls plugging dat merch,  yet takes the opportunity to talk about it every time he can. Jordan was talking about Soviet art, then Hila mentioned buying vintage t shirts on EBay, so of course we needed a Teddy Fresh plug.Why would I need to allude to it in my original post? lol I said it was cringey that Ethan mentioned Teddy Fresh, you asked why it was cringey and then I elaborated. &gt;This has never happened to another student before at this school

= I need attention My favourite acronym is HYNIMSY
Have you nut in my son yet it's widely used across the internetThere are videos of people eating glass as a "joke" why doesn't youtube take those videos down?Put it on a shirt and i'll buy itJust stage a "to catch a predator" on Patrice Wilson, while wearing the vape nation outfit Mind-numbingly stupid. That's the best you've got? You fools will keep defending hypocrite Ethan to the last. There's nothing wrong with adverts, that's why he has segments for them. 

The Paul's have songs specifically designed to sell merch with lines like "BY DAT MERCH" in the actual song. THE SONG IS THE PRODUCT. THE PODCAST IS THE PRODUCT. They are alike. It is not comparing apples to oranges, it is comparing apples to apples. In the middle of a conversation with an intellectual, Jordan Peterson, Ethan decides he's going to plug Teddy Fresh. It's occurring IN THE PRODUCT, not within an allotted advertisement. Ergo it is the same as the Pauls, ergo Ethan is a hypocrite, and incredibly disrespectful to his guest.  

There, I've broken it down for you. I never expected you people would be so intellectually lacking that I'd have to break it down to this most basic principle. If you can't understand it in this most basic form, then you are in no position to be questioning people's 'critical thinking skills.' Holy heck! This is great!, Idk why I feel like this would fit in with like an 80's cokacola poster ad or something. It's got that really nice asthetic, amazing job!Fair enough, but nowhere in the video are the tide pods actually ingested. They land in my mouth sure, but would the video have been taken down if the pods were replaced with a box of nails? I just find it frustrating that I couldn't even make a joke about eating the tide pods without getting flagged. . . no no this isn't it :( Ah, see this how I know you're stupid. You have decided something is not worth your time without actually reading it, a tell tale sign that you're living in an ideological bubble, why challenge your perception when you can rely on cognitive bias? 

Unless of course you read the whole thing, still didn't understand it, and realized that you're intellectually deficient and have now resorted to speculating the age of strangers on the internet in a feeble attempt to mask your own shortcomings.  Yeah, I don't see that happening, they currently have major beef.  Gotcha! You are indeed as ignorant as I predicted.  He's leveraging his academic background to pose as an expert on a civil rights issue that he's intentionally misrepresenting in order to draw attention to himself.

This is a message for another get rekt video from Ethan No, he's in it for himself. He's not fighting for free speech, and he's lying when he says that they're forcing "compelled speech." He knows that's not true, but he says it anyway.

He's either a crazy person, or an aging professor looking for some attention. I'm guesing the latter.Compelled speech is forcing someone to say something. Nobody's forcing anyone to say anything to anyone, if you don't want to address someone by gender, then don't. And he's not fighting for free speech, he's fighting to keep gender identity off the protections from discrimination, right after race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation. It's crazy to make such a fuss over something that's not even real, as it relates to protecting such a tiny minority of people from discrimination. 


Yeah, what's the point?

Why would you dress up for a fancy senate hearing to fight to keep people from having protection from discrimination? Just let it go.Didn’t have the linkI appreciate it What does that mean? "snack"? Does it have a meaning like THOT or is it like it sounds and he just looks tasty?that whole channel is hilarious, but honestly, it isn't active anymore. Still this should be reacted to on the podcastI just compared their recent views (about 10k) with their millions of views from back when.I'm open to discussion here btw. They're fairly explicit in their attempts to stay in the realm of relative centrism in early videos. 

Happy to provide sources for whatever concerns you have.I made this post to create a conversation to gauge where other fans were on this. I assumed that most people were familiar with Petersons work and his message V.  other who Preach the same "toughen up to live a good life"  message but personally while about their own rights being infringed upon by some invisible hand. 

Agreed.  He just ends up being inflammatory for the sake of being inflammatory under the guise of reasoned thought.It's more than their own politics though, it's giving Jordan a larger and more credible platform I really have the most trouble handling.  If he treated Jordan like other guests and forced him into discussing some of his missteps I wouldn't care at all.  They just let him spew, lend credence to it, and treat it as if it were a high level discussion.Not to double reply, but it just seems like they put their normal "Devil's advocate" role on hold when it comes to him and let him just talk without ever bringing up real counterpoints.https://youtu.be/nBHkIWAJitg

CoincidanceI mainly agree but I feel like with Paul and others they at least treat teh podcast as some kind of journalistic endeavor to get more info and ask meaning questions.

With Peterson I feel like almost, he runs the show and just pushes his own stuff.  This may be my own bias and I'm willing to admit that, it just feels like a sea change between when he is on and others are on.I may have misspoken, but I really don't have issue with them having him there, but it's they way they treat him V. they treat everyone else.They don't ask him hard hitting questions about his past, they don't push him at all.  With nearly all of the other external guests they treat it like at least a somewhat journalistic endeavor.  With him it just seems like they like him run the show and talk about whatever he's pushing.I have been and I am.No, but honestly by using that term at all you're missing the entire point. He softballs him, while he puts others on the spot. Yeah I never advocated that. If you wanna resort to buzzwords go ahead. I'm happy to back up any specific claim. This copy pasta is getting old. Y'all can't just lump everyone you don't like into an sjw group. Again, not advocating that. Mainly his messages about social Darwinism. Additionally his "toughen up" rhetoric falls pretty flat when he whines when confronted with personal issues publicly, like "his free speech being taken away"  when the reality of the situation was not even remotely that dire.I'd be happy to help you Google specific instances, but anyone touting Social Darwinism who isn't in the 1890s might be someone at least worth double checking. Yeah that isn't what is happening here at all. Not spreading his message is different than censoring him. You can have a conversation with someone without openly giving them a credible platform. Boogie is center, center-right I honestly can't tell if you're goofing me or you're just not reading what I typed so I'll try again. 

You can have a conversation with someone publicly without inherently lending all of your credibility to them. H3H3 are doing the latter with Peterson and they rarely ever do that with their guests. Therein lies most of my issues with his visits. That's not what I'm trying to accomplish. It's not. Good lord. Again. That's not what I'm saying. You can continue to pigeonhole my words and others into some lump, but eventually you'll have to see things at a more detailed level and stop with blanket generalizations and buzzwords. You're literally not bringing up any new points, you know that right? I never said to prohibit. I've gotta head to bed today  be up early to work bit I'm happy to answer more questions tomorrow during my breaks and the evening. 

This didn't go entirely as planned, I didn't expect things to be so /r/thedonald but I respect the data. Words have meaning for a reason, and  purposely ignoring or misinterpreting words/context just to fit your tiny piece of the pie is a strange hill to die on. Though I suppose that's the vast majority of modern population discourse so I can't really blame you for this surface level shit. Again I never said that. Just said it sounds a lot like it. The same line blurring happens there constantly under the guide of free speech as well, when in reality the end goals of the Darwinism Peterson spews will take away free speech rights of the vast majority. Dude, read anything about social Darwinism's origins. 

Canada 'hates him' because he goes on lecture tours spouting outdated science as fact and calls the free speech police when people call him out for using outdated information as new research. 

You're not saying anything new. Brother bear, I'd be happy to copy and paste a website for you but I just told you where to look. 

As I posted in a previous comment, I'm going to bed, be happy to keep going tomorrow. Please look that up and we can discuss it tomorrow. Those are caricature descriptions of real life situations that happened to him, but unfortunately  the reality was nothing like that. I would love to put effort into a useful discussion, but I'm not  going to describe basic concepts on his ideology to someone who is already a fan of his. Literally nothing I provide to you will matter because you already see the situation as he describes it. His philosophy of brazenness just creates a slow of people touting less than basic understandings 100 year old science, yet have the confidence of Ph.Ds in their field Once again, I never said that. You're again extrapolating from an empty data set to fit your narrative. Not to you I can't. Go to bed boo boo. I have given you more than enough info to figure this out or at least move into another topic of discussion. I'm desperately sorry you've fallen ill to this line of thinking and can't hold an actual argument down and instead have to resort to single plot mining. I've dug as deep as I feel like with you tonight. Maybe we can dig some more tomorrow but I hope you come back to the surface and we can dig a hole somewhere else. Are you serious?No I mean you, explicitly you. Please just go to bed where you can't hurt anyone. We can pick this back up tomorrow. Agreed. Apply that to Peterson please. And understand that Social Darwinism has been far from fact for 50+ years. I've given you more than enough info, that you should've already had given the argument that you brought up. You're picking this hill to die on on purpose. You're right. Thank you. It's very clear that is far from what you want or typically consume. I might post a link to a definition of social Darwinism with a few words about why Petersons message is just that reworked to include new groups tomorrow morning if I can get a break at work, otherwise I'm going to have to trust you do to that and full in the blanks. 

I know you can't and won't, but I figured I would make my plans public. I know you do booboo. Go to bed. I know you don't care, which is why there is no point in discussing this with you in the first place. I'm sorry if you can't see the correlation between the two things. I'm not gate keeping that info from you just because I'm not providing it.Keep on reading past the intro. Can’t believe people still defend this con artist Who would possibly confuse the two? As soon as my professor went on facebook to look for "the video" I knew what was up. So I am pretty sure he did smash it, and possibly also smashed that share button.Thanks ! Yea my mobile data is limited so YouTube isn't an option unfortunately.
What do you mean? Peterson is about as far right as mainstream US politics go and Ethan is in agreement, at least on the podcast, with most everything he brings up.  

Again though my issue isn't either of their politics, it is how much differently he treats JP V his other guests.  He basically just gives him a platform and lets him run with it, instead of asking questions about negative aspects of their lives and maintain the almost journalistic integrity most of the other podcasts have.  That is my main concern.I actually like most of their recent stuff, but this is a really troubling change in their behavior.He doesn't even read them. ON his ted talk he said he only skims them.dont think thats the one... cant seem to find the scene
Their response doesn't make sense. What is special about logan pual's channel that only his channel appears to get the benefit of random blasts on youtube? Is this happening with any other channel? and why is it that something so fundamental (Notifying channel subs of new content) is "broke" only for logan paul?I cal BS on that. How exactly is it obvious he doesn’t actually read anything?( unlesss you already know he is shady that is).


For the second question google about his old dating site for rich people for one example. I don’t have time to debate. If you want to buy his useless courses, be my guest. Just don’t say you weren’t warned.Nothing? He's just a great creator with a great sense of humor. Or, she is an imortalThank you for posting this.Also if your post goes anything like mine get ready for a shitstorm.Thanks my dude! It's because of his haircut.

 Logan, we are here for you in your time of hair lose. So what if the rat has more hair than you, it's okay buddy &lt;3 I guess it depends on what the actual contest wasIt's also the dumb ass kids he has for fans. You know this is going to escalate to people killing mice/hamsters to someone tasering a cat or dog. I doubt this is financially viable. Surely the creators would make more money on YouTube than on Vine particularly Vine 2, which is not yet out and it's totally unpredictable as to whether it will be successful or not.

 Cool theory thoughNah, Its always hit or miss with stuff like that. When Howard Stern did it, it was only good if the contest winners had a quirk about them/ got all the inside jokes. More than likely you'll get someone who'll freeze up and have nothing to add because the podcast is a different format to a regular radio show. That makes sense. I guess if they ever do something like that we can only hope for the bestIt's not just the action of him doing it, its the fact that his audience is mostly kids who'll do dumb shit. How long before we get the videos of kids killing their hamsters or tasering their cats/ dogs? 

The issue with YouTube is that adult content can still be easily viewed by kids, so to you or me tasering dead rats is stupid, yet harmless. To a kid who views his content as an accurate portrayal of his everyday 'savage/ maverick' lifestyle however, his actions take a different meaning.  Rhett: how is the squirrel lawsuit going? I don't believe he is racist, homophobic, transphobic or sexist and I agree with him on free speech. Those who try to protest him do nothing for their cause.

On the other hand I have no doubts that a GROUP of his supporters are all of the above and more. Peterson talks about totalitarianism and the Holocaust and you have groups of his supporters denying it happened. You get many classic neo Nazi arguments:

The Holocaust never happened

Hitler was a patriot, saved the German economy (he did the opposite), German/Prussian people are proud (as if that excuses invading other countries and war crimes)

The allied powers were the aggressors

Allied war crimes excuse German war crimes/Clean Wehrmacht/ muh Dresden/ and the fan favorite, history is written by the victors. 

The problem with pseudo-intellectual circle jerks is that you get people who are beyond debate. If everything is a conspiracy theory (typically globalist or Jewish, occasionally lizard people) then no evidence or facts you produce will ever make an impact. Kind of interesting that Peterson advocates evidence, facts and open debate yet some, NOT ALL, of his followers are beyond this. 
They occasionally get some reporting in there when they're not publishing apologies/ cash payouts. 

TBF, good on them for not publishing on the kids edition and having one of their drooling pervert writers comment on a girls 'shapely pins' DID YOU WEB BOIS JOHN WILKES BOOTH CHIA LINCOLN???

Aight rule question: Do you miss the simplicity of the old format of Good Mythical Morning? It seems tightly scheduled now. I have been watching since Chia Lincoln times and I'm a NC resident myself. So I was curious if you missed the old days of your channel or enjoy present times more? His shitty page https://www.facebook.com/ricklaxhasfriends/?hc_ref=ARR6FyWE9Yv_LiPA5LWto-AV5kZHTi9Ja5rhwicM389snhJuJLTDXL2JU4OEn8_-mIQWas the side by side view of the Iceskating challenge live or edited? Like, it seems like they purposefully set up the shot to allow easy editing of two shots. If it wasn't live, then it kinda ruins the magic for me in a "pay no attention to the man behind the curtain" type of way.

Also how many times did they have to try to get something worthy of publishing? And please tell Link that he should fire whoever was in charge of pulling his slackline.


ALSO 
Why did you guys have to show up Post Malone so hard on the freestyle segment? Damn you guys didn't even give him a warning.I second this question. In the past month we've seen shots of liquor, both hosts using the word damn, and sexual innuendos.By getting a jobThank you Logan. I will get my merch. My h3h3 merch that is.I'm pretty proud about that last lineYeah it sucksLogan Paul is the Anti-christ of the YouTube Adpocolypse. He came to us on the day of laughs to bring misery to all. To taser dead animals and make vlogs of dead bodies. To steal the children and form new religious ties so much that Scientology is jealous of him . 

"Tell your parents to return the Bible and buy Maverick merch", a quote by the Anti-christ, Logan Paul. 

I have been wanting this collaboration to happen for YEARSNice man! I like itReally? Thanks!!!That’s a better compliment then I got from my art teacher! Thanks😁I’m not proud with how it looks but rather the time and effort I put into it, my main goal in the end was to share with the subreddit to get Ethan to notice but that doesn’t seem possible, sorry you feel that way I added the age because I thought it was an excuse for the lack of skill in the drawing, will take note of that next timeHahahaha! Started watching last year, there’s not many people in my grade who watch him so I try to educate them!!!!Thanks! I plan to go into a digital art field so that means alot😁HAHAHAHA! This made me laugh out loud in class!!!!!There’s something off about it, definetly something with the eyes so I think it turned out subparI may do a digital drawing of hila next because that’s my strong suit, this was a bit out of my comfort zoneI saw that you too!Wheres the upload? i missed it and all i see are two hihglights They're usually gang related. If you stab someone its attempted murder but using acid is only GBH (Grievous Bodily Harm) so in most cases they would get a lighter sentence. 

Some reality stars ex got sentenced for an [acid attack back in October](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/10/towie-star-ferne-mccanns-ex-boyfriend-threw-acid-three-times2/) Oh no. I know all about the Dresden bombings. I got it from Kurt Vonnegut who got it from [David Irving.](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/the-bad-about-vonnegut/) Now let me parrot an idiom associated with Herman Goring, because that will certainly prove I'm right.  Ethan:

Said Dresden happened two days after Germany's surrender (It happened two months before)

Quoted casualties,(300'000), higher than that of the Nazi Propaganda (200'000) and the real number 22'000-25'000)

Said it wasn't a military target (It was a main transport exchange for shipping weapons to the Eastern Front, with a railway, Warehouses, Factories, Barracks e.t.c. It was a fully operational military and industrial center.)

The bombing was 'revenge' for the war and to terrorize civilians. (Area bombing was the only viable way to destroy a target due to technical limitations. In WW2 to hit a factory you needed to flatten a town, in the 1960s to hit a factory you would need to flatten a neighborhood. It wasn't until the late 80s notably the First Gulf War, that you could destroy only a factory with one laser-guided smart bomb. Also see above.

It was a war crime. (It was not. It was only after the war that it would be considered a war crime. But even so, at the Nuremberg Trials, no one from the Luftwaffe was prosecuted for the German bombing of: the UK, France, Poland, The Netherlands, Yugoslavia e.t.c. Similarly no one from the Kriegsmarine was prosecuted for the unrestricted submarine warfare because the allies did it as well.)

The allies were not 'knights in shining armour coming to save the day' (Debatable, if you want to argue that life would be better had the Nazis not been defeated then go ahead, you're free to do that because they were defeated. The allies took no pleasure in bombing civilian areas. Bomber command were never thanked in Churchill's speeches at the end of the war, in fact, he tried to remove himself from strategic bombing because it was so controversial. [It wasn't until 2012 that Bomber Command got an official memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Bomber_Command_Memorial) To say it was done for revenge is way of the mark.)

'History is written by the victors' (No, history is history. It doesn't lie because it isn't sentient. It can be misinterpreted, accidentally, or [deliberately](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving), but it cannot lie. That statement is used by Holocaust deniers or Nazi apologists like Irving, because to them history has literally been written. An example is 'the gas chambers were built by the Polish in 1948 because there was no Holocaust.' If anyone's writing history its Kurt Vonnegut, who based the 'facts' of Slaughterhouse Five on David Irving's lies.) Well I guess I was rightThey already are controversial, in fact more controversial than the firebombings which killed far more Japanese civilians. 

But My point was, history isn't written. It exists and cannot be changed, it can be studied, and yes had the Nazis won history would be studied differently due to the Nazis censorship of everything they disagreed with. But their perception of the 'objective truth' is not the objective truth, its ideologically and racially motivated. They were essentially seeking to begin the world again under their terms. Rather than BC and AD it would be before the revolution and after the revolution, pre Nazi texts would be viewed as incorrect whilst their version of events would make up the new world thought on history, similar to the censorship and oppression in the Soviet Union under Stalin. 

So essentially history can only be 'written' if you have the ability to change what the objective truth is. Peterson is a huge gutterballRhett and Link both have children, do they let their children watch Logan and/or Jake Paul's videos?  Where do they draw the line with what their kids are exposed to?



(So I know I already asked a question, but I thought of another great one. )Its part of Ethan's anti Mainstream Media crusade, he's become obsessed ever since the WSJ. There's also his blind devotion to daddy Elon. Just because his seems flashy and exciting doesn't mean he's beyond criticism. The privatization of space could lead to serious issues in foreign policy, especially as both Russia and China have active space programs.  &gt;Peterson is not a bright intellectual 

Sounds like you're not happy with your life 

&gt;Reactionary bullshitter

This sounds like Post Modernism to me, and post modernism is basically: fascism, totalitarianism, censorship, the Soviet Union. Believe me I've spent forty years studying dictatorships, and even though I can't get historical facts correct, I'm an expert on it.I thought it was about Ethan putting his foot in his mouth? Really? I though it was pretty clear that Ethan is actually kind of dumb given his comments on real things like Dresden. That was by far my favorite part of the videoThought I was the only person who thought of that when he had the thing around his neck!Is that his real voice? Because it is possibly the most annoying voice I have ever heard. Aside from that he is not funny enough to take on a 'voice of god', off camera type thing. But that voice, is it real or is he putting it on? I think they fell out a while ago and I'm not sure if they've made up yet. Not just that but Hila has a far quicker wit than EthanIt was during the Ethan vs Leafy thing. Fantano called him out for talking about how stupid YouTube drama is but then actively participating in it. The video has since been removed but Fantano and Ethan don't seem to have made up.No just dumb. He started parroting lies spread by a Holocaust denier. I suggest you educate yourself on the subject. The joke





Your headSo nice to see a carer who truly loves their work Meh, kind of over Post as a musician over the last few months its become increasingly apparent that he doesn't give a shit. He claims to be into rap then says its hollow and has no meaning. Typically musicians who give a damn don't leave the studio until they've got the album done, he appears to be doing everything but working on the album. Its clear he's not into it for the music, its all about the lifestyle and Gucci. If there's any music he actually wants to make its rock, he originally auditioned for a metal band, he's got James Hetfield's 1991 haircut. He wants to be a rockstar so badly. 

Shame cos I liked his first album and the bonus tracks were better than most of the tracks on the album so it looked like he'd be getting better. So you think Post gives a shit about music? If so why is he so unwilling to gt in the studio and finish it? It was supposed to be released on December 1st 2017.'Passion^beer^and^cigarettes in his voice'it SUCCS doodI mean sure but even then it usually takes away alot of time from the podcast with things that have already been said in the past. Not saying it isnt interesting, Ethan talking about anything on the podcast seems interesting to me and I'll watch that but on the same side they could have talked about something else which actually is about the guest on the podcast..Dude, dont be outing their immortalityI think that would make for an awesome episodeFantano would be cool tooI'm just mind fucked he still flies publicly! also is that his same GF? :Ou/lilklein
u/h3h3productions

Thoughts on this Ethan and hila ? saved, thanks for sharing god bless ya Oh God no. Please nobody get a Political Science degree, it's not worth the paper it's printed on. If you want to study politics do a joint Politics and History degree, it's more fact based. Fucking yes, god damn you and your funny ass me-me. Haven't seen a good Ralph Ed boi meme in years!He looks like Dr. Jacoby from Twin Peaks in this lolSteven, Cib, James all three need to be on it.In the last six months he’s managed to put out more platinum singles than they’ve put out ten minute YouTube videos. Ehhh babee!Yea i made a post about this before. He said in a livestream that he would join any podcast that invited himYes that would be great. If he can talk about fast food for 25 minutes he can do a podcastYeah, you don't wanna see him when he's really mad. It usually involves breaking glass or starting fights, the guys got a drinking problem. I hope this comes up in a future podcast
Please get reviewBrah on the podcast. Or maxmofo, ian and doji at the same timeI do have a 3d printer. HmmI'm not sure I understand.  I used blender to make this We still need the bit connect guyI dont think cringy is the correct word, but i get what you mean.I get what you mean. Pretty sure he's just a methodical guy who chooses the exact words he wants to to convey his ideas. If he memorised it that would be wayy faster, just look at that Michael McCrudden guy from 'Before they were famous'.vape naysh dude glad youre still here Dammit that means I'm the trope of the guy who reads tropes that were pointed out by the trope person who points out tropes.

BUT WAIT
Because of this comment I'm also the person who points out tropes, resulting in a duo of tropes.

Trope#1 Im the trope of the guy who reads tropes that we're pointed out.

Trope#2 The guy who points out tropes (see above)

I am accepting Nobel prizes for my expertise in tropology. Thank youIts a teddy bear on a cap, I doubt anyone can seriously claim to own that concept. 

Buts still, Ethan rant incoming in 3... 2... He's not 2 faced. The h3 videos is like a character. He brings people into the podcast to see if there is anyone behind the memes. Whoops, I mean the 3rd!Should we be sending Ethan some Twitter love? I agree. Didnt a similar thing happen to Joji? Like, he started doing one thing, and the fans tore him apart, so he just said fuck it and ended Jojivlogs all together.True true. I personally loved the golden age, and i appreciate them trying to return. With Frank and all of that, i know i didn't care when he broke the immersion. I personally think that people need to stop complaining about creators doing their own thing. I know that Pew Die Pie has hit that "fuck it" stage and is doing what he wants. And i support that.Don’t forget that jump scare that actually got me Why do people care so much lol, it's just a dude making some funny content, if you don't like 100% of it so what. Like people are entitled to get the a certain content out of h3h3. Constructive criticism is fine but hating someone for making free content for you that you can choose to watch or not is just low, Ethan and Hila are human too, let them do whatever they want without getting ridiculed. Its not just that they don't own the photo, what about the Bud Light plastered all over it, doesn't that need to be licensed by Budweiser?  Damn good point. Great information Color me surprised russianmagabot doesn't know what words mean.Reading is hard when you're lost.I mean I'm excited for ethan and hila. I hope they get pregnant with a fupa prince or princess soon. (also it's kinda nice to see the personal side of them sometimes. Sometimes its like "are these two REALLY married?")I mean, as surely as Ethan changed and started doing the podcast more than H3 videos, so to must their content. It's content about their lives, not ours. ya know?For what Phil's trying to do, lets be real, its pointless. You can rail against the MSM all you want, but its incredibly stupid of you when you rely on them for the information you are putting forward. 

Everyone knows that the MSM has 'narratives', but to say you are providing an alternative is an outright lie. All YouTube and a majority of online 'news sources' rely on the reporting and information gathering capabilities of pre-existing news outlets. Five people in California could never have the connections through trusted sources or reporters on the ground to cover events across the globe. Nor would they ever have the capabilities to process all that information, corroborate it and report it 24/7. 

If Phil feels that YouTube is stifling his format, perhaps he should change the format. In what way is this dumb? A repost fupaEthan saying China has better working conditions than the US, OK then. "Soulless, evil fucks"

Except for Elon of course. fucking CRINGE at this shit every time someone posts something like thisdude props to you on the shot! it was really good!does anyone else ever get the feeling that ethan and hila are throwing shady glances at each other on the stream? like they argued about something yesterday and kinda scraped the surface of it on their stream today? idk idkIt's not just about this tweet tho. I don't agree with most things people get triggered about, even if it sometimes has roots on a real social issue. And I think this tweet specifically if anything was a fucked up thing to do to a high school girl.
I hope Ethan would even consider to touch those topics, even if I don't really think he should as it wouldnt probably make "great content".
But I don't know, no high hopes here since the whole JonTron situation. Have you seen the gene pool shit? I mean damn.IDK why this dude is trying to low-key shit on h3 for doing what every established/reputable youtubers are doing. and when he goes on to say "its sad the couple behind some of the funniest youtube videos..." I think to myself, dude if they're making 100K per episode of the podcast, why do the h3prod videos need to be PROFITABLE!? Ethan can make whatever he wantsGod this is so cringey.This was so weird why was she even wearing this in the scene? My culture is NOT your GODDAMN cupBecause articles typically reference the YouTuber's origins, like 'Pewdiepie, a popular Swedish Youtuber.' But H3H3 the channel originated in Israel and Hila is Israeli, so it is Israeli-American  because Ethan is American and they now live in the USA. Awesome thanks!Sweet thanks!Yea. I'm a lazy piece of shit and buy everything online. This one hurts :'(Yeah, looks like he has lost a lil fuppa + the Shave makes him look Younger. Pappa is Lookin Good Boi! 
Wtf is with some people lmao that's just a reflection it doesn't even look closeI just miss when they weren't annoying reactionaries. But.. but.. can't we all just agree to disagree on racism? (Ethan &amp; Hila when Jon Tron was on the podcast). I don't know if I should cry or laugh.Honestly, i think all of the outrage here is stupid. On all sides. Lets stop giving a fuck about what people say. I dont care. Like for real, if Ethan wants to defend these people, let him. If Ethan wants to attack others let him. At the end of the day, everyone should be able to agree with / disagree with whatever they want. Ethan is just a person, just like the rest of us. He is allowed to have his own opinions.

EDIT: of course, i have my own opinions about this situation, and others, but thats exactly what it is. My opinion. Im not going to attack someone for theirs. Just though it should be out thereOk, i see your point. All im saying here is that i dont care what people believe. As long as they arent causing harm. There is a difference (in my opinion) between someone who hates minorities, but doesnt do anything, and someone who hates minorities and actually causes harm. While i dont agree with every opinion out there, i do beleive that we should all have the freedom to beleive what we wantAnd thats my exact pointIts really fucking annoying seeing all these holier than thou posts talking about how h3 is failingAnd you have every right to think thatDude, im not trying to normalize anything. All im saying is im not going to go around attacking people because they think differently than i do. Just chill broListen, i didnt come here to argue with anybody. I get that youre beliefs are important to you, so why dont we just let eachother go on with our lives?I want h3 to roast how shitty it is to use Jim's face as a meme everywhere This is probably the most haunting video I've seen on YouTube thus far. I couldn't believe someone would do that. Yeah I tried to do this, as I wrote, time my shits with my showers (which I typically do in the morning), but more often then not I can't take a dump in the morning. It's like my body system is still sleeping.Papa Bless So basically no one is gonna see your shot u less the specifically search for it, or its promoted. Otherwise you'll lose to established channels and metrics in the side bar. Great job YouTube. I think the thing here is most people curate (spelling.) Their subs. So take me for example, I follow like 10 people because the amount of weekly content is sufficient and adding more people would lead to me not having enough time to watch everything. I think if YouTube is trying to move the platform to a 5&gt; blurb platform then yeah, this wouldnt be such a big deal cause then who cares at that point, but when the shows I follow are an hour or more (usually more) it just doesnt make sense I think to a lot, ringing the bell is an unnecessary additional step. I cant speak exactly, but I feel like for the majority of youtube's existence everyone has been hitting the sub button with the same expectations and acted accordingly. Now you have to subscribe to someone, THEN choose another basically subscription subscription THEN pick if you even what the subscription button to DO anything about showing you videos from your subs. 

Why would I subscribe to not see the channels content? (Ring bell &gt; occasional notifications)

Okay why doesnt subscribe do this in the first place any more? (Ring bell &gt; every episode notification)


I think all this does is serve to start changing YouTube into a platform where you stop seeing random content but will really start bubbling yourself in with the occasional notification channels. 

It maybe be a difference of opinion but I think it's a bad move for YouTube. Get better inspiration lolI don't care that Ethan has opinions.  I care that Ethan has become a reactionary.I have the sheep shirt and now I must own this  😤Of course Bus Jackson would be an amazing guest!I miss Sean put some respek on Zach's nameWhos song? I want to listen. Is it post?Because it's the right way to say it.How is this good? Its just another attack of the anti-free speech, everything offends me Cultural Marxists. How about if you don't like it don't listen, that's what people used to do. I definitely got salty in the comments down below. That's real big of him Hila looking Fly as hell sonDid anyone catch that the verbiage of their tweet is such that what theyre saying is that they werent wrong for killing the stream, it says they just removed it wrong. Insinuating process wasnt followed but the result was okay. Sneaky shit broI don't know if this comment will get any traction but I'll make sure to post it again some time later.

When they don't have guests they should have a theme for the podcast unlike the usual top of the week. Say one is all about ghost stories and they find stories from the obscure parts of the internet (I'm sure Ian would know some good ones), or a podcast about future tech shit or whatever. The normal top of the week gets pretty bland to the point where I usually skip the podcast and wait for the next week when there's a guest on. Hope you guys come across this comment. Cheers. I folded in half from the cringe Lol I hope he just wants a story of them going on an adventure25 people disagree It’s fine :)Waddup invaders, Chris here, and today is national salad day. So I am here to use my super secret methods to get kisses from cuties. And maybe, get my salad tossedThey don't like doing videos anymore. Watch their podcasts. If you don't like them then go cry somewhere else.I'm kinda in the same boat as a lot of people now. H3 is turning into a shill for money. They're fucking always wearing teddy fresh, in everything, the first video Ethan makes in idk how long is a fucking ad for their game, I can understand doing the podcast over h3 videos cause they needed money, but they have that now, and it's fucking frustrating to see one of my favorite channels turn into garbage. "I miss the old Ethan"Wow this was super rude for no reason. You're a rude head. For me personally, I think it's almost that time. I just don't want to give up right away./r/unexpectedskaI wish Ska was as popular again...He should go on h3h3 podcast, Joe rogan is so stupid, didn't understand shitYeah and outside of people like gus johnson there's really no one else to watch. Everyone else is a sjw/politival/whatever cringe fest. I concede you're right about the clothes. I have fancy shirts my self and tend to ware them on days I dont even need to dress up because they're so nice. But dont you think its overkill when there is always something teddy fresh in all their videos and pictures? Why cant he? Have you seen what jake paul did and what happened to HIS fandom? People dont care, I think. Maybe I'm wrong My issues is that I know they arent the dev, they're the client. And the dev is responsible for explaining what they're programming, the game mechanics, to their customer. Better, they're supposed to decide that before the game is even written. To me, it seems very probable the dev's explained to h3 the impact of what they were programming and they either didnt care or didnt understand. I believe it's the former cause money grab features are usually explain as money grab features to the client. Idk I feel like this was explained and they were like "yeah fuck it I mean we gotta make our money back right?" I feel like people here are so quick to shit on Ethan. Like, calm down guys.Lol they tried doing a podcast and it became successful. Making YouTube videos sounds shitty and they enjoy doing the podcast more. Big dealWhy should they keep making videos if they don't enjoy making them?Because people are entitled shitsAlways rep yer nayshWhat are you talking about Haha, no, the small kid is my brotherLol fucking entitled kidsThat would be my best friendHe doesn't need to do anything for your entitled ass. Jesus you're acting like he killed someoneAmen, this sub has gone to absolute shitI’m pretty out of the loop what is happening?My god this sub has turned to trash. FrEmeUM iM pISseDBetween Ethan and hila. Had to turn up my phones brightness to see itYou know what kind of people "Act", like dicks? Dickheads, that's who. U know nothing about him, stfu. I love this dank ass tune so muchyep you're right, i think people know when something is up but they can't describe it, just a feeling in their stomachs. seeing that zoomed in just made it that more apparent.No, that's why i dont talk shit about his choices and problemsLOOOOOOOOOL first thing I saw when I opened the reddit app on my phone, DID NOT expect it, laughed so hard. That's asking for attention.Feeling the need to be supported over a two weeks miscarriage. 2 weeks. That's what I said. But it's not worth telling everyone in case of it happens over and over again.Yeah, of course. At least there's somebody who understands the concept of difference opinions instead of just downvoting me as if I'm wrong. No, if that were the case he'd have no viewers. Millions of people are clicking on those linksI honestly thought it was pretty shitty of Ethan to say he and Hila hate Keem right after having him on the podcast. Of course Keem is an asshole, but not really to Ethan, hence why he went to the podcast. Ethan is supposed to critique that behavior, not embody it.I have to admit I kinda like his podcasts, his shouting matches with Collossal is Crazy and A4V are entertaining.He also seems like less of a bad person than back in the day.This still matches the general impression one gets during baited etc whenever he breaks with the Keemstar character.Well, judging by the screen persona only, he is not doxxing people anymore.In Russia naysh vapes you (logo is backwards)Yea like you made this.
