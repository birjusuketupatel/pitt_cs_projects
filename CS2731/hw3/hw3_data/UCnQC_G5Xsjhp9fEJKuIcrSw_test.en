[Ben sets the record straight on Tommy Robinson \(50:40\)](https://youtu.be/hYxjqNR730Y?t=3041)

Ben apologized for repeating some of the leftist mainstream narrative in castigating Tommy Robinson as far\-right/alt\-right.   

Earlier in the week, he did a great job of explaining the absurd legal situation of Tommy Robinson and the malfeasance of the government restricting the media, but his characterization of Tommy's political ideology was less than perfect. [Ben on Tommy Robinson early in the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpRLCnDaJG4)Every week Shapiro explains a Federalist Paper on his podcast, and I'm putting together a playlist with those segments.

For the life of me, I cannot find Federalist 24. It should be somewhere during the week of Episodes 518 - 522. I know Federalist 23 is in Episode 514 and Federalist 25 is in Episode 525. 

If anyone remembers where Federalist 24 is, or is willing to skim through and help me find it, it would be greatly appreciated. Please comment the episode number and timestamp if you know. Thank you ![Klavan explains antifa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw0fFPoDG04)

Beautiful explanation of Antifa by Andrew Klavan. He has a way of explaining things in a unambiguous, straightforward way, while putting things in context of the larger culture at large. I generally listen to Ben Shapiro's podcast for a dissection of the news of the day, then to Klavan's podcast to get a more macro view of what's happening in the culture.

Balance.I am a huge fan of Ben Shapiro. I'm a Daily Wire subscriber and have met him in person once and am likely going to meet him again. A lot of my respect for him comes from him calling balls and strikes and I feel like he is terrible at that with Israel. To him, they can do absolutely no wrong. I get his biases but, nevertheless, it's annoying.I know Ben was skeptical of him to say the least, but I'm wondering if his opinion has changed at all.It was a book about justifying the existence of a God using logic and faith and I went through the YouTube episodes but could not find it. Anybody remember what it was?I listen to the Ben Shapiro show every day,  at lest enough to know his wife is a doctor (just kidding, you only have to listen 10 minutes to know that)  but seriously.  One of his sponsors is now a VPN service, he touts that internet companies should be like common carries, yet he was AGAINST net neutrality.  I wish I had transcripts of al his episodes so I could formulate an e-mail telling him how hypocritical he is being with actual examples...

Then: "Net neutrality is a bad Obama era regulation!!"

Now: "You don't want all these companies knowing everything and selling it to whoever!"


Money grubber.

For fucks sake, just add    pre recorded clips in the middle or something. I would like to make a case on certain issues from a perspective gets no representation - Classical Jewish doctrine. The claims I have are not in favor or against any policy as you'll see throughout the argument, but to better define the measures we use for judging others and to apply it on our self to improve our own understanding of concepts, and also to be ethically consistent for our own good because the measure we pick to judge others is the one that will be used to judge us at the end of our day - במדה שאדם מודד בה מודדים לו.

I want to make a claim that the state of Israel has no moral superiority over the Palestinians. Not that I'm on their side, quite to the contrary, in Jewish ethical law you can protect your life even when you're wrong, as absurd as it may sound, חז"ל say in אילו נהפך זמרי והרגו לפנחס היה פטור saying that although Zimri was indeed very sinful, and God not only agreed to Pinchas killing him but actually rewarded him for this and in consequence this ended the plague, however Zimri wasn't obligated to give away his life for this. More then this, the halaha of בא במחתרת tells us that a thief that comes at the middle of the night, since he knows that the home owner may fight with him to save his property he's prepared to kill him, therefore the home owner in such a situation doesn't need to confront him first nor warn him but he can immediately kill him . In Jewish ethics you can kill an entire nation with civilians men, women and children to prevent one minor casualty of your own soldiers, while this might not be practical if it will turn other nations against you by this risking yourself even more, and this is only assuming you're not the aggressor that started the conflict and might include even more conditions to be applicable, but this is definitely the basic moral stand point. This is what makes IDF a very immoral army for preferring to take casualties to save "innocent lives" of the enemy.

After saying that the right to save your own life is not depended on being right, I can now explain why Zionists( which I despise for what they did to corrupt our nation and uproot our religion, not what they did to others) have no moral claim on the Arabs by using their own measure in these cases:

1. **Arabs have better lives under Israeli Government then under Arab Governments**, true, but Zionists rejected the British Government actively engaging warfare against them to force them to leave, putting all the Jews in the country in danger of total annihilation (as many expected) for this shadow of a hope of having a country, so much for the "we need a country to be safe" argument. The fact they actually won (with heavy casualties) doesn't make this any less suicidal. Weren't we be more comfortable under British rule, or at least more safe? Sure, but hell with that we want our own independent government, well then so do the Palestinians. We gave them inspiration not to give up their dream. Every time I hear our moron Prime Minister speaking about the All Mighty State of Israel is the promise we have that there will be no more Holocaust, like if we would have a state at those days then Hitler wouldn't dare to even come close.
2. **They refused every offer to divide the state**, well so did the Zionists until they became tired and decided they can't fight anymore. In earlier stages actually the discussion was about not giving up East Jordan (I always wonder what made them think some one will care about their wishes).

I still don't understand why should they agree on giving up their land especially when the Zionist narrative was (until they actually got a state) this whole land is ours and we will take it from the Arabs and kill anyone whose in our way, why should thy accept this offer? Because you say you'll rule over them in a kind soft manner?  I'm sure they would agree to rule over the Jews on the basis of the same promise, we could have asked the British to be one state under King Abdullah of Jordan.

3. **The UN voted for the state of Israel**, right, this is probably the worst of all claims. The UN who are mocked endlessly for having no moral right on anything (and they really don't have) are the justification for giving these lands to the Zionist movement, isn't this outrageous? These nations can divide and decide on lands they have no claim on? How in the world someone accepted this argument?

4. **There is no Palestinian nation, and as for the Arabs and Muslims - they have a lot of their own countries.** True, anyone who'll look into it will see there is no major difference between Land of Israel Arabs and other Levantine Arabs any more then there is a difference between Jaffa, Haifa, Jerusalem and Beduin Arabs. But guess what, same is true for secular Jews don't exist as a nation and have nothing in common with real Judaism other then the title, they were actually divided between Communism on the Hagana side and Fascist ideology on Etzel and Lehi  (before WWII "fascist" wasn't a dirty word) - no Judeo-Christian values there, I'll tell you. Till this day Classical Liberalism thought is unheard of anywhere in society here in Israel, sure they can't deny the practicality of free market but same goes for China, but still this doesn't make them Classical Liberalists.

In fact, if they are to be considered Jews then we can solve the conflict easily by saying that Christian and Muslims are also Jews, and by "Jewish state" we mean all the above, and they can call this however they like and we'll also agree to be called Muslims and Christians.  If a biological male can be called a women and vice versa then obviously religion is much  of smaller difference. In fact I think I claim that although I look, act and think like you would expect from an Ultra Orthodox Jewish man but I'm really also a Conservative, Reform Jew Christian Muslim Buddhist a man and women of all nationalities, a fundamentalist yet moderate so I can preach to all the above for world peace (in modern science it's called superposition).

As for "our rights are written in the Bible" stupidity of Ben Gurion, this does not include those who violate its laws. Ever heard about this one?

Doesn't that say basically say "do what I've commanded you or else I'll throw you out like I've did to the nation that was here before you", and "You should be Holy because I've separated you from the nations to be mine"? This consequence being one of the least frightening of consequences mentioned over and over again for being sinful and rebelling against God.  I know why Jews don't see this because they want to ignore it, but how come none of our enemies ever actually opened the worlds best seller of thousands of years to actually read it.

5. **There was a growing Jewish population since about 1900 which in turn led to prosperity and more Arabs coming from surrounding areas so the Arab claim of not having any Jews at the land is false**( so therefore we have rights for government of our own), facts mostly true, however by this you actually turns their hospitality against them, they have their national feelings and religious convictions they didn't gave up when they've let Jews live within them.

Can you imagine today having the fleeing Sudanese demanding independent state inside Israel for whatever theological/historical argument they might have? Is it right for Muslims to take over Europe when they'll have a majority using European hospitality against them? This is claim of Zionists is essentially the same!

Oh true you offer the progress and prosperity of Western culture, but they can also make that claim that under Muslim dominance you will all see the beauty of Islam, one good thing might get under Shari'a law -  a chance to exist as a race since currently Europeans are dying out simply but not wanting to having children either for reasons of comfort or life styles that rob them of the technical possibility of having any. Which by the way makes me wonder why never did I hear a Darwinian condemn such behaviors that lead to an evolutionary dead end, nor do they seem interest in having children very much if any at all, how's that work with evolutionary logic? And how are those behaviors don't extinct through natural selection of simply not wanting to have children and dying out (which is also a general question  I have about any disease that prevents a human from actually being able to procreate, like some deceases that kill at a very young age etc. how are they still around? but this a topic for another long discussion).[Screenshot](https://imgur.com/g9YcxCc)

I know its not exactly a quantitative national poll but it's interesting to see that he is 1% behind Trump and ahead of Michelle Obama and Bernie among voters who have input their political compass. Does anybody agree with Ben that this will do nothing or do they think Trump was right to sign this bill.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGssuMioeKg

Unless I'm out of the loop, I don't see how it's brave to admit you're religious in hollywood. Even if it is in hollywood, it would be equally as brave as changing gender and being booed by loooooots of supporters. So why would Ben take the unnecessary extreme position to say Kaitlyn Jenner is not brave for coming out, but Chris Pratt is?

(just googled Christ Pratt - his speech received no outrage btw)

I think this is due to attitude polarisation bias. Because he received so much heat on his opinions on Kaitlyn, his opinion grew to be more extreme to the point where he said she wasn't brave (even though realistically speaking, she was).I feel like Ben only debates idiots and because of this it creates a false illusion that he is witty and makes clever arguments. It seems to me that many of his fans simply rally around his surface level labeling of liberals as "emotional" and "idealistic", but no one really evaluates his often fallacy riddled arguments. What are yall's thoughts on whether Ben will or will not run for president in 2020/2024 and why? Like the titles says. Do you go via the subscribers mailbag? Is that efficient? What else? I've got some fresh news from your Swedish friends regarding the boarder situation and how Swedish icons, with a lot of influence, spreads missleading information about the situation and the Trump family. I know theres a best-before-date on this debate but it might still be relevant since I've had a 1on1 change of texts with one of the responsible.

This is with positive manners in regards to Mr. Shapiro!So Ben's main solution to reduce healthcare cost is to make healthcare part of free market to let competition drive down the cost.

But how do we know the companies won't just ban together and keep the price high?

For example - in my city there are 4 major cell phone &amp; internet providers. They form agreements among each other so that the cell phone plan packages from each of them are still high, rather than low as what you would expect under a competitive market.

Who is to say this won't happen for healthcare industry too, especially when there are big bucks to be made???To me - it's his religious arguments.

As an atheist, i facepalm every time Ben brings up religion in his arguments.

And no, i'm not talking about topics of god vs no god. 

Ben brings up religion whenever he talks about how local communities should be responsible for looking after their own neighborhoods, rather than big governments.

To me, this is a facepalm because I don't think Ben realizes that religions are very divisive. For example - as an atheist, if I need community help, I cannot just walk into a Jewish temple and expect to receive free help. No, Jewish temple looks after their own kind. Same with many Christian churches - even those that claim to help you, there is either a direct or indirect expectation that you need to give their religion a chance (aka conversion).

Not to mention - there is a whole negative stereotype around atheists right now, especially in the Southern States.

So no Ben - religion is not an answer, especially as more and more millenials are non-religious. 
https://youtu.be/GErUHrA4oH4I just watched the segment where Ben discusses the Muller investigation on Russia and the topic of civility. What are your thoughts about it?Is there any way we can campaign or somehow push, drive or bring light to getting Shapiro to the supreme court?

/Foreigner who wants to see the jew ascendMy teacher does not know who Ben Shapiro is and so I wanted to show him a very good video of Ben Shapiro and how talented he is when debating people. Any suggestions for a video?A common criticism of Ben Shapiro is that his analysis lacks nuance when describing people on the other side of the political spectrum. I'm searching for evidence to the contrary. Thank you!I was a centerish of left liberal but have recently been intrigued by the positions of Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, Dave Rubin and the like. Are there any videos out there on his/their ideas regarding what role if anything government or other institutions should play in supporting individuals born into disadvantaged situations? And by that I mean individuals born into families (if at all) who don't instill proper values and/or are of low socioeconomic status so as not to provide the same level of opportunity or freedom of choice as those say in the middle class or above?

Put in others words within their view is there a line at which point the cards are so stacked against an individual based off of what they are born into that some level of assistance by the government or another institutions would be warranted? Is there any point at which a person is born into such dismal circumstances that the whole personal responsibility argument breaks down? 

Would love to hear Ben's or anyone else's views on this, in part because my historical liberal nature still imparts me with some sympathy for these (what I assume are not hypothetical) individuals, but also because I was born into an upper middle class family that instilled in me the values that afforded me the freedom of choice to pursue the life/career that I want.I've been looking for a place to ask fellow Shapiro followers their thoughts on these two at the Daily Wire. It's clear that Ben wants to share his platform with multiple voices, but I can't help feeling those two actually do more damage to Ben and the Daily Wire than good. What are your thoughts?Youtube thought I might like to see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL4q2hg1jiI&amp;t=1393s) slandering Ben Shapiro.  I eventually ended up watching the whole video as i thought to myself about how all these text to speech vids are likely bought and paid for by special interest groups...  Then I did a little digging and turns out the video was done by this company www.dynamicmediacompany.com !!  What follows is the companies own statement on what they do.

&gt; What we do:
We team up with great companies and organizations to create memorable media content to engage, educate and entertain. We utilize film production, photography, motion graphics, lighting design and live streaming to create media experiences that can be enjoyed around the world.

After developing an action plan, we set out to create, and launch a custom production plan to achieve your media goals. After producing the media, we optimize content for your online and social channels to expand the reach of your message. 

Now the question is who is paying dynamicmediacompany to slander Ben Shapiro.Hi all,
I'm looking for some guidance to videos, books, or articles that Ben has recommended or written regarding strategies to replace the social safety net that exists in most of the western world.

Over the last 6 months or so listening to Ben and the Rubin Report has shifted my views on the topic, but I'm curious as to how a libertarian/free-market solution could be introduced with minimal chaos and hardship.First speech and Q&amp;A of his that I have watched live, and I thought it was kind of disappointing compared to his other college talks. Only about two kids disagreed with him, so no real thug life moments.I noticed Ben mentions his father quite a bit and I tried looking up who ben’s mother was to no avail. If anyone could give me some information on her I would greatly appreciate it. I’m really curious and I know that Ben really treasures honoring ones parents. Thanks!So one of my big things I love about Ben is that he's actually a lawyer. His education at Harvard gives him an in depth understanding of existing in a hyper liberal space. This also happens to be the only corner of reddit where I know that I can bump into rational minds so I've got a question.

I'm a law student at a very left leaning school, I went to the recruitment event for the American constitutional society chapter of our school and was shocked to find out its basically a society around how the constitution should be applied or revised to fit left leaning goals (for example this event just today included a small lecture on how the 14th amendment should include universal Healthcare and living wage from the government). And literally every student group the school has has that same left lean to it (with the exception of the veterans law group which is pretty narrow.) So does Ben ever actually talk about anything he did to actually inject some of the counter argument to the narrative while he was in law school? And even beyond that any of you guys know what I could do to accomplish the same?I listened to his show today - nothing. I've checked his twitter since it broke, and I've seen nothing.   


Is he just going to pretend this isn't out there?I notice Ben jokingly makes fun of Knowles sometimes. Why?Apart from deleting a bunch of his tweets, he’s been awfully quiet about that whole thing, which is pretty uncharacteristic for him. Does that mean that he has no way of refuting it, or does he think it’s no big deal?

 In case anyone doesn’t know, I’m referring to him having been named in the Manafort probe as someone who wrote propaganda for him back in 2012.What did you guys think?My podcast feed is empty for the day. Was there no Ben Shapiro show?I realize this might seem like a silly topic, but I’ve noticed a pattern in Ben Shapiro’s rants against people he disagrees with. He seems almost incapable of criticizing the left without throwing around the word “evil” at any chance he gets. If I recall, he even used that word to describe Samantha Bee calling Ivanka Trump the c-word. What gives? Why is he so obsessed with that word? Doesn’t it seem a tad manipulative and strawmanny to constantly describe things you disagree with as “evil”?Up until now Ben has debated/participated in interviews with clueless legacy media muppets, feeble minded students and  the youtube Prat Pack (peterson, ruben, harris etc) that currently enjoy cashing in on an audience that is smart enough to want to hear a fresh perspective but not smart enough to think critically think about that fresh perspective.

When is Ben going to debate a serious intellectual opposition of his views? - Yuval Noah Harari

If you have not heard of Yuval check out any number of his talks or better yet read the book Sapiens - (the other two books are not worth reading imho) https://www.youtube.com/user/YuvalNoahHarari

Ben Shapiro fans, i guarantee it. You will be triggered :)
Context = Ben's argument against wealth inequality is that as long as the people in hte poor are getting better, then that's ok. Wealth inequality is not a bad thing as long as everybody is rising up overall.

To a degree, i agree with him, but i think history has shown that if the wealth gap is too far apart, this can still lead to social riots. Sure, the poor in USA may not be starving to death like Sudan, but they are still unhappy with the gap. And when the gap increases over the next 3 decades, more and more ppl from middle class may join their protest too, and when enough ppl feel angry, we have a serious problem with social stability.

And you can't say "well tell those ppl to stop feeling angry then". It's human nature. Can't change that.Anyone else think Ben might be related to or a doppelganger of NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon?

I know I'm not the first to think this. I just want to know if there's been any progress to finding out.There was a podcast episode in the last month or so where Ben recommended a book on the Civil War. I was driving at the time &amp; never wrote it down afterwards. Does anybody happen to remember what the book was?Great video about net neutrality that points out Bens lies.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oInAlTKlw64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oInAlTKlw64)I don't wanna hear about every freaking internet post ever that's why I'm not on those sites. Thanks Ben now I've heard Every tweet I meant to avoid. Rot.Recently I was having a discussion with my friend about the obvious leftist bias in academia. He responded that this bias is natural because the scientific revolution was started by people who were generally leftists. **Guys kindly provide your opinion on this**, i really don't understand this bi-polar categorization of history as Leftists against the Church. I think this is the same Marxist thought of perceiving the world as Bourgeois vs Proletariat battleground. Ben has had great guests so far on the Sunday Specials, but when you add Tai Lopez, suddenly one is not like the others. What do you think of Tai Lopez being on the program?

Tai has some controversy, and fairly or not, he often thought of as a scammer or someone who has questionable practices. Some examples:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v7fgl/we_need_to_talk_about_tai_lopez/What has Ben said about the subject? I know everyone thinks their favorite celebrities should run for President but in Ben's case I can't tell if it's something the fans are asking for or something he genuinely will do?Saw a liberal post demeaning Ben Shapiro, and one of the reasons cited is Ben Shapiro supports unfettered capitalism.

Is that true? 

I think we can all agree some degree of regulations and laws are required to prevent a too-unbalanced system...right? I don't think anybody would truly support an unfettered capitalism where even bribery technically could become legal.Don't know if this allowed or not. A few months ago I got a ticket for the show in Dallas on the 15th but have since had some things come up and will not be able to make it to the show. I got them for $50 and would sell them for $60 to cover for gas and whatnot. I'm in the area and would be willing to meet up. PM me for details.hey, does anyone know if and where ben shapiro's live podcast recordings in dallas and other places are gonna be live?As you probably heard from news events like ToysRUs, when a company goes bankrupt, the executives leave with a fat bonus, while workers are left hanging.

Even when a company isn't bankrupt, the executives give themselves more raises than they give to the workers. 

This to me sounds wrong. It's literally the rule makers making the laws to favor themselves!

Now i'm NOT advocating for socialism as a replacement, but am I correct to say something has to be done??I’m not sure if this is the place for this, but what do you guys think of Michael Knowles? I liked him more six or so months ago but he’s been increasingly smug and annoying. His audience is clearly conservatives who don’t care at all about winning anybody over. What’s the point of that? He’s just annoying. I’m sorry to say I don’t even like listening to him anymore. I just switched from Google Play Music to Spotify and can't find the Shapiro Show. After all the Alex Jones stuff I'm wondering.The common argument I heard from Ben is that if poor people need help, they should be helped through voluntary donations (e.g. local churches), as opposed to government welfare.

​

For the record, I agree most of government welfare is horrible and waste of taxpayers money.

However, I don't think Ben's solution is much of a "solution" either. Churches are not going to just give out thousands of dollars to a poor person who needs chemotherapy. Churches are not just going to dish out free 3 month rent in the form of $3000 (e.g. assuming $1000 per month) for a single mom of 3 kids. Churches are not just going to provide free tuition for smart poor kids who are eligible for college but not smart enough for full scholarship (which we all know is super hard to get, u have to be literally top of the top).

​

I think to just brush the issue of poverty aside with a generic statement of "let the local communities handle it" is a cop-out, and frankly, not going to work at all.

​

Thoughts?Or do they think it'll more or less be an indictment against Trump?I know that he plays an instrument but what else is there? Does he exercise or play any sports? I am going to assume he doesn’t watch much TV.What has Ben said about it?[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBGECJooyOI&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBGECJooyOI&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I found this review on the top of the list. It made me laugh. 

ByAmazon Customeron April 20, 2017

I accidentally bought this book for my child, innocently thinking it would teach her about the evils of communism.

Next thing I know, she's coming home from school wearing a black beret, drinking a vodka-filled juice box, and smoking a Cuban cigar. Okay, fine, I think; it's just a fashion statement, just a phase.

Then, she starts inviting all of her friends over to our house, where they hold meetings to discuss "what is to be done?" in regards to "the adult problem."

So far, it's all just talk, no big deal—but then they start raiding my fridge for snacks, calling it "reappropriation."

Now, fast forward two weeks: they've raised a red flag over the playground, which they've commandeered as their headquarters; they're patrolling the streets in their Power Wheels, brandishing Nerf Guns and Super Soakers; and they're rounding up all of the adults for a "re-education camp"

I've barricaded myself in my basement to evade their tightening grasp. They're banging on the door as I type.

I'm giving this book five stars in the hope that it will sell really well, and the author will thereby see the light, embrace capitalism, and cease publishing this book as a result. In the meantime, I urge you not to make the same mistake I made.

Don't be fooled. This book—OH GOD THEY'RE HERE THEY'VE COME THEY'RE FJDFHWEHGDBB@#*%H#)H FNDF jFEH#R$#!!!!1!- Does she deserve this moral titles provided by Hollywood?
- Is she a good person morally?

[ben-shaprio-recommended-reading.com](http://ben-shaprio-recommended-reading.com)I only started watching Ben Shapiro videos recently and I find him really  interesting as a person. He comes across as being quite cold and unfeeling yet has a wife and kids, also he seems like he lacks empathy at times yet has detailed some of the horrific bullying he received as a child (that story about him being whipped by belts is pretty awful) so I find it a bit strange that he doesn't seem more sympathetic in certain circumstances, or maybe he's the way he is *because* of the bullying? I dunno, but after watching him a few times I just knew he had some shit happen to him at some point. 

I consider myself pretty liberal so don't agree with a lot of the stuff he believes in (he's against abortion and is quite religious) but I enjoy watching him speak (although he could benefit from reducing the nasality of his voice by at least 40-45%) and especially enjoy him tearing apart the more "assholey" liberals (a growing number these days, sadly) with facts and logic so will continue to watch his vids. 

I realise this is a pretty pointless post but I just felt compelled to mention my view for some reason. What do people here think of him as a person? Ben has talked about this and I would love to dive in deeper to see "what actually happened".

From what I remember, he basically said there was a political push by some think tank to get it removed as a mental illness not because of new research, but for political votes on the liberal side.

I could be completely wrong on what I just typed haha. But curious nonetheless if anyone can help. Thanks

If 1/4 of the republicans were half as smart as Ben Shapiro, we might have a functional legislator.Such an idea has never even crossed my mind. It implies huge savings in accommodations, office spaces, transportation, staff, security and *no centralized access to our senators, congressmen/women - and government representatives of all stripes, by lobbyists.* Driving THEIR costs up.

I thought it was brilliant. But then I am not the most clever person in the world. Does anyone have thoughts as to other possible ramifications of this?Does Ben Shapiro have a public email address? I looked on The Daily Wire but it seems that you have to subscribe. Thanks.
[https://youtu.be/\_pRFFM5G1Mk](https://youtu.be/_pRFFM5G1Mk)Ben recently mentioned this in Monday’s podcast. Apparently a Starbucks down the street from the now notorious “racist” Starbucks  in Philadelphia prevented a white officer from accessing the bathroom. Ben mentions he made a Facebook post detailing g this. 

Anyone have any info on where I can find this post or story?

Appreciate it I can't seem to find this anywhere. How much do tickets to go see Ben cost? I can't even find a link to buy them on the YAF website. Seems like they're only passed out individually on campuses. I went to watch [Episode 527](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_fkz5gb6Zc) on YouTube, but it wouldn't work. On Chrome it appears as a grayed-out version of the YouTube interface, but on IE it tells me that the video isn't available in my country. I'm in the U.S. and can view all the other videos, and the whole audio is working on Soundcloud, so what's up with that? Can anyone else view it?

(I'm too poor for Tumbler Club. :P)

EDIT: "My wife works at a hospital..." Oh hey a different wording :VMaking this post to discuss economic implications, unintended consequences, driving factors behind Amazon's decision, etc.I know that they aren’t consistent on days they air but do they have a time they air? I’m particularly interested in shapiro, knowles and klavans live podcast times. Thank you in advance :). @24:00 of today’s podcast, I accidentally hit the speed change button, and as I tried to put it back to the normal speed, I listened to it on half speed for a little while. I literally can’t stop laughing, Ben sounds like he’s hammered especially when he’s trying to recall articles and he looks them up. Just thought I’d share in case anyone else wanted a little laugh listening to his commentary. Ben seems pretty staunchly against the idea that sexual assault and rape are more socially tolerated than they used to be. I don't think studies are very effective in this space, and his anecdotal evidence is somewhat poor, considering his relatively sheltered upbringing. Want to hear thoughts, anecdotal and otherwise..There is a really unfortunate theme we're all familiar with. Ben Shapiro clips on youtube can contain really well-constructed debates and arguments. The uploaders bear some responsibility for stigmatising Ben among his detractors as a purely aggressive acid-tongued demagogue, by creating repulsive and juvenile titles.

&amp;#x200B;

This clip for example, is terribly titled: "SASSY STUDENT". The student is really earnest and respectful. Not sassy at all.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdFXIuC1f7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdFXIuC1f7o)

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, this reinforces an artificial divide between various camps of debate. Its a pity because the uploaders are sharing good content. Its just packaged terribly.

  
Feel free to disagreeI've been looking out for it, but it's not posted. Anyone know if it is going to get posted online? I'm speaking in the context of solving poverty. Ben has said he doesn't believe in big government to reduce poverty (which I agree), and instead advocates for people to support local charities, e.g. donating to churches.

&amp;#x200B;

But when I do a google search, I can't really find examples of charities that Ben has supported. You would think for a guy whose annual income is at more than 1+ million, he would be able to make substantial donation that gets him mentioned on the news. 

&amp;#x200B;

The lack of him appearing on charity news lead me to suspect one thing: he isn't donating much, certainly not to the level of his earning. Even with a biblical tithe of 10%, a 1 million dollar income should mean $100,000 donation each year, a sum surely enough to get him to be mentioned on the charity website!

&amp;#x200B;

The only time when he mentioned he donates is when he said he donates to his Jewish communities. Um, ok Ben, sorry but that doesn't sound very heroic, considering most Jewish are wealthy and share very low overlap with the low-income class. Jewish communities are also known to be very closed off to the "outsiders" so certainly not helpful to addressing homeless folks who live on the streets.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr  = i suspect Ben might just be saying people should donate to local charities, but there is a good chance he isn't really walking the walkHow come Ben insists on calling Iran a terrorist state everytime he mentions them Vs his pathetic response yesterday about Saudi Arabia. 

Saudi Arabia also supports terrorist groups throughout the middle east and the are the reason wahhabism is so predominant throughout the Muslim world. They most definitely were behind Bin Laden and 9/11 and Isis. They are comitting genocide in Yemen and Ben Didnt even talk about the 40 kids who died in the bus attack a few months ago. No mention about the controversy with Canada and the Saudis 

I can't understand why he is so shy about critisizing Saudi Arabia. They are the embodiment of everything the west and secular democratic people should hate. They are literally a theocratic dictatorship who execute women and gay people and  political dissidents. 

So why no introspection about our relationship with them?  Or even any critisism of them?After listening to some videos of Ben Shapiro talking about the United States Criminal Justice system, I am honestly surprised how vapid his arguments really are when anyone with beyond a college degree thinks about it. 

To premise my counter-argument, I am referring to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQUej3v3Qs) video when Ben was speaking at Northwestern University and was asked a question regarding the war on drugs/incarceration, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETcGHOeXgJU) video where Ben discusses some criminal justice/criminology related topics and related crime statistics. Below are my key conclusions.

##**Ben's main argument is a culture-of-violence argument.** 

Ben is regurgitating the Oscar Lewis [*culture of poverty*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Lewis) argument. This argument states that there is a subculture in the population, typically poor minority communities, that internalizes bad moral values and teaches its members to subsist on handouts from the government, promotes laziness, instigate violence or crime, resulting in disorganization and overall malicious behavior from individuals in this group. Hence, these are "thugs" and if they simply stopped committing crime all of their problems would go away.

However, Ben *ignores* the vast scholarly evidence of sociology, particularly Emile Durkheim and later the tradition of "Chicago School of Sociology". [Emile Durkheim](http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/dl.html) gave us the idea of mechanical vs organic society, which is a natural transition that all groups and societies experience when all groups of people integrate and the collective conscience governing morality is re-established. This broad idea ties into another book called [*Black Metropolis.*](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Metropolis-Study-Negro-Northern/dp/0226162346) Due to the very palpable and enduring realities of slavery and the Jim Crow era that followed the civil war, this mechanical/organic transition was stifled for African Americans unlike that of earlier Catholic immigrants such as the Irish or Polish. Unlike these white immigrants, African Americans experienced long-lasting discrimination and forced concentration into specific neighborhoods, which seriously deprived their economic employment opportunities in the division of labor because of things like the lack of limited wealth or skill accrual and structural racism which prevented blacks from transitioning into organic society via employment or housing opportunities.

The Chicago school describes the unique historical process &amp; ecological growth of cities and communities. How is the unique growth of cities impacted by the story &amp; successions of African Americans? It ties directly into critiquing sub-culture theory &amp; social disorganization theory. When Ben says races (particularly blacks) develop their own subculture of values, morals, and behaviors, he is ignoring all of the academic evidence on social disorganization theory &amp; misrepresenting the statistics we use to measure crime. Ben ignores all of this in favor of simplistic arguments regarding statistics and big data. [Andrew Abbott](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580667) mentions the danger of simply using “big data statistics” to understand the complexity of our history as a country. Kalil Gibran Muhammad has another excellent [book](https://www.amazon.com/Condemnation-Blackness-Making-Modern-America/dp/0674062116) explaining of how we interpret crime statistics matters. This was echoed in [*The Philadelphia Negro*](https://www.amazon.com/Philadelphia-Negro-Social-Study/dp/0812215737) by W.E.B. Dubois and his documentation of early historical accounts where social scientists tried to justify black criminality or inferiority with statistics. This was done to justify racial inequality in areas of crime rates, literacy, and poverty. 

Finally, Harvard sociologists Robert Sampson and William Julius Wilson just came out with the [reassessment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/reassessing-toward-a-theory-of-race-crime-and-urban-inequality/68C99328C0574E23D1CBC6FDFD60BED9) to their famous 1995 article *Toward a theory of race, crime, and urban inequality"*, which I think does the best job of dismantling Ben Shapiro's entire argument. If he would debate me on just that article alone I think I would win. There is no way that Ben would bother reading that article anyway because his overall sub-culture argument would instantly fall apart. 

Other small corrections I would make against Ben is his plea bargains quote, which Ben does bring up but does not elaborate on by saying that many of these individuals are actually innocent due to our out of control criminal justice system and lack of indigent public counsel. Another issue I had is the false-equivalence Ben uses between crack and crystal meth to make a false-argument regarding discrimination in drug sentencing. Crystal Meth and Crack are two entirely different drugs, Ben should have compared crack to cocaine and the characteristics of those individuals arrested for possession. This is because cocaine is seen as a wealthy white drug versus crack being seen as a poor minority drug. This is key when understanding disparities in drug sentencing between blacks and whites and their representation in the criminal justice system.

In sum, I just hate how Ben Shapiro will only debate college students who know nothing about a topic and who are by definition (you go to university to learn) ill-equipped to tackle Ben's fallacious points. Debate one of the living professors that I mentioned and let's see how fast facts care about Ben's feelings.   Ben has mentioned that he has a few, as he calls them, A+ celebrities that listen to the show. He advises them (and rightfully so) to not reveal that they are fans so they won’t lose work. 

Anyone have any guesses as to who these celebrities are? I have a few: Chris Pratt, The Rock, Ashton Kutcher. Anyone know if he is debating at politcon yet? Haven't seen anything and everyone else has basically revealed their schedules. I'm a huge fan of Ben Shapiro and have been listening for over a year. No host or commentator is "perfect", all make mistakes, but I think Ben is toeing a line which isn't the best for his show or listeners.

For a bit now Ben has amped up the "humor", his "quippy" jokes about the news. When it comes to this type of content for Ben Shapiro, however, I think less is more.

I listen to Ben for his take on the news and politics. I don't listen to Ben for his jokes. Ben is GREAT at analysis - but let's be honest, his jokes simply aren't awesome, to put it mildly. When was the last time you _actually_ laughed at one?

I imagine someone listening to Ben for the VERY first time and hearing his jokes and quips, such as the ones in the last few episodes - and imagine that person cringing at them at worst, and feeling "meh" at them at best. It's not a good "look" for the show.

In terms of funniness, Ben's jokes/quips are similar to the skits that get "clapter" on talk shows. Clapter, of course, is the term Ben penned to describe the polite combination of fake laughter and clapping studio audiences do when the skit they are watching is supposed to be funny, but isn't. But they have to pretend to like it because they are in the studio audience.

I think Ben should peel back the attempts at jokes and the quippy, "clever" humor. He's not a comedian; leave that kind of stuff to folks like Bill Burr or Joe Rogan.

Ben's joke/quippiness level is like an 8/10 at the moment. He needs to take it back down to a 2/10 or 3/10.

I feel if he doesn't peel it back his jokes, eventually it may start to impact how seriously people take his analysis.I know Ben is widely recognized as a conservative, and he refers to himself as such, but I’m confused as to why. If you actually look at what policies he supports, he’s more of a libertarian/classical liberal.

Not only is he in favour of complete economic freedom, he’s against any sort of government regulation on marriage, sexuality, morality, etc. He’s even against having his religious views imposed on anyone.

The only conservative thing about him is his support to aid Israel, and him wanting to increase the military budget—as far as I know, anyway.Finally got around to listening to this.

Wow, I'm a kinda former, kinda current lefty, and this episode was just fantastic.

He used to be a laughing stock (definitely from the left, and maybe from the right?) and his current even keeled presence on this show was so refreshing.

I never would have thought I would have agreed with almost everything he said.

I really feel like my horizons have expanded since seeking out right wing sources, and his calling out of misdeeds from both sides coincides with a lot of the realizations I've been have lately.

First class episode all around.

Had to laugh at Ben chiming in with his social media addiction after Glenn delved into his serious past alcoholism, still appreciate his viewpoints though.[This video](https://youtu.be/4ttcOo8rK4U?t=165) is a good example of what I'm talking about (I skipped in to the appropriate time).  

The girl started by making some claim about privilege which isn't particularly important but went on to 'set up' her point by stating that gender and sex are conceptually distinct. This is a matter of definition more than anything. 

The way we define sex with reference to biological characteristics like reproductive organs, gamete production, and chromosomes is pretty uncontroversial. 

People who push this 'social constructivist' argument define gender along some lines as the way in which a particular *society* or *culture* categorises people into 'men' and 'women' e.g. by reference to certain characteristics. For example that men are more aggressive and women less so. Or that men are the 'leaders' and that women are the supporters. I'm not saying that modern western culture has this dynamic but that social constructivists may make these distinctions. I'm actually of the belief that the differences between those we typically consider men and those we typically consider women can be boiled down to biology as well as culture and society. 

A social constructivist may then go on to argue that since these differences are constructions, they are unimportant and therefore whether someone considers themselves a man or woman (or other) by *gender* is a matter of how they identify. This is a charitable account of what most people who support gender fluidity might argue (or what *I* would argue if I had to make the case for them). 

My problem with this example of Shaprio's response is that after the girl establishes what she believes to be a reasonable distinction between sex and gender, he doesn't attack the strength of the distinction by arguing for example that the differences between the male and female "genders" are cross-cultural and therefore more likely an essential part of men and women than some cultural construction. Neither did he argue like Steven Pinker does that one can use statistical tools to talk very coherently about men and women as inherently different groups with different psychologies, skills or interests in many cases. 

Instead, he simply declares that he does not accept the girl's definition. The relevant quotes are "I'm saying, you are not the sex to which you claim to be." and "I'm not going to modify basic biology because it threatens your subjective sense of what you are". 

This seems like his understanding of the meaning of the word 'gender' diverges from the girl's. He therefore straw mans her by regressing into arguments from biological definitions of *sex* and the distinction has already been made. Unfortunately, she isn't sharp enough to clock onto that.   


TLDR; She made a distinction between sex and gender and instead of attacking the distinction, Shapiro ignored it and appealed to a different definition as though that were an argument. Full disclosure: I'm a Democrat.

&amp;#x200B;

Ben often accepts that Trump has been great for the economy, and that he deserves credit for the current state of the economy. This always sounds like nails on a chalk board to me. Beyond the case specific arguments that can be made against that idea (Trump's economic policies have barely even been implemented, he inherited a booming economy, he imposed tariffs which are objectively bad for the economy etc.) it just strikes me as wrong to claim any president has that degree of control over the economy. It always has, by the way. The economy crashed in the first year under Obama then proceeded to recover and eventually begin booming as it is now. Every single indicator under Obama was better at the end of his presidency than it was in the beginning. What did he do to make that happen? Got elected during a down economy that was bound to go up, that's what he did. Every Econ professor I have ever heard address this is incredibly dismissive of the idea that you can blame/credit the current president for the current state of the economy.

&amp;#x200B;

When, not if, WHEN the economic down-turn hits is that going to be Trump's fault? My guess is Trump will blame Obama once that happens and the dumbest among his supporters will believe him. Democrats will run in the next election (whenever that may be) with the message that Trump caused a recession and the dumbest among their supporters will believe them.

&amp;#x200B;

So why does Ben actually parrot that line of crap all the time? Does he actually believe it? Does he say it to try to cover for Trump? 

&amp;#x200B;

Ben's enemy, Chris Cuomo, actually also says this. He readily admits that this is Trump's economy and the Trump is clear to brag about it. My guess is Cuomo is playing the long game and wants to be able to hammer Trump on it when the recession hits, which is the definition of disingenuous. 

&amp;#x200B;

So why would Ben, who really ought to know better, fall in line with such a silly line of thinking?Hi Ben, I was wondering what do you think about this chapter of the book "the great controversy" from a Jewish point of view

https://youtu.be/QLwsVN8JISgStop blaming white people for blacks poor behavior start taking responsibility for the culture that glorifies the negative aspects of black culture.many blacks and minorities think white people are bland soft sqaure and only they can be"down"they have convinced people since the mid to late eighties that black culture is hip and cool.this culture has infected our society as a whole.black slang music and dress is accepted emulated and glorified by society at large.the problem is law enforcement and the judicial system does not condone accept or tolerate the criminal behavior associated with being a playah,a hustlah,a pimp,a thug,a gangstah an og or a g..examples of this phenom is depicted in"grand torino".hell i use some of this slang myself it has become so pervausive i might even refer to myself as an OG but im not a gangsta but i look around me when im out in public and most the people are younger than me an OG lolI was having a "discussion" with a friend about kavanugh and she was asking me where I got my facts. I realized that my "facts" from the left were from comedy shows like the daily show and job Oliver. Can anyone recommend someone on the left who is like Ben Shapiro so I can be more well versed?A great Ben Vid

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDY7Sixk7Tk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDY7Sixk7Tk)Do you think this report shows Ben Shapiro to be exceedingly intolerant and hateful towards GLBTQs as the majority report says it does?  Do you think this makes Ben Shapiro look downright awful?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoIkHty\_vtI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoIkHty_vtI)If Shapiro is as capable in debate as conservatives believe and if he  really does have that faith in his abilities, what reason would there be  to not engage with them?  And there are reports that he backed out of  debating with all3 of them; what would be the reasons for this besides a  fear os losing to one of them?Ben has been an online meme for awhile now, it’s time for him to take his first step into a larger world, the world of memes!I heard a clip of Ben talking about minimum wage where he made the argument that increasing the minimum wage inherently leads to unemployment which is why it needs to stay low. This sort of generally fits into his argument that people need to develop their skill sets and be responsible with money to avoid poverty.

Now, according to the BLS 30% of people in this country are making 200% FPL or less ($24,000/year).  The median rent in the US is $1,000/month. HUD defines affordable housing as spending less than 30% of your income on rent. This means that for a large chunk of that 100 million people, housing is unaffordable and basic necessities become difficult to attain based on your wage alone.

Who is supposed to work these jobs that are paying wages that aren’t livable? It seems like Ben is making the argument that everyone should be striving to get out of that bottom 30%, and if you don’t then tough shit. My question is does he have anything else to offer? I’ve heard him mention vaguely a few times that “fighting poverty is good,” but if the bottom 30% are stuck in poverty what do you do about it? I don’t disagree with his economic argument against the minimum wage, but it seems to me he’s identified a structural problem with the economic system we live in. But then he continues to champion it. What gives?Ben refers to it in several videos, does anyone know what paper he's referring to? Link?

&amp;#x200B;

It says something like:

\- attractive woman asks men for sex in bars - 80% say yes.

\- attractive man asks women for sex in bars - **0%** say yes.Title says it all really. I have been discussing gender quotation and affirmative action with my father recently, and I’ve stated that women go to social professions because they are better at that and enjoy it more, while men start companies and compete for leadership positions because they are more inclined to take risks, and are more interested in start-up work.

I also stated that any woman who wants to do get a leadership position is free to do so, and if women really are paid less for the same work, everyone would be hiring women.

The only counter argument I got out of my dad was that we need affirmative action (we’re Norwegians) and we should keep the 40% women rule because some companies and leaders won’t hire women because they’re more comfortable in a boys club.

And I know Ben Shapiro is anti-affirmative action, but I have never heard him address this argument. Does anyone know if he has, or does anyone here have their own take on this?I’m referring to the fact that he was willing to call out the conspiracy theorists regarding the bomb threats that were sent to prominent Democrats. There have been an absurd number of conservative figures who have already come to the conclusion that those suspicious packages were an inside job, so kudos to him for being willing to call those people out. I don’t think that’s a particularly high bar, but I will give him credit for not letting his hatred for Obama and the Clintons turn him into Alex Jones. 

As a side note, I realize it’s old news, but I’ll gain more respect for him if he owns up to the whole writing propaganda for Paul Manafort thing. In some of the episodes last week, Ben referenced more than once the shooting that happened by a Bernie supporter, as evidence that both sides partake in hyperbole, and the fact that the media doesn't criticize them equally, shows a bias.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone else remember the "Death Panel" wave that swept conservative radio in 2009?  Hannity was going nuts over it, our own local right wing host was telling listeners the government was going to decide who lived and died, it was madness for awhile.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm definitely not denying both sides don't use hyperbole - but you **absolutely** can't deny one side has been pushing it much harder and longer than the other.  

&amp;#x200B;

Bens argument is essentially -&gt; the Right spent 7 years telling everyone the government was going to euthanize people they cared about.  Bernie Sanders said in an interview if sick people have health insurance taken away, they would die (which is backed up by numerous studies, BTW...).  A shooting occurred by a Bernie supporter, and (numerous) attacks occurred by right wing supporters - WHY ISN'T THE MEDIA TREATING THEM THE SAME!?!!

Since we're in the early stages I'd like your suggestions, advice, etc. To start things off if anyone has some CSS skills and is willing to submit a design or so we could get feedback from the community and implement. Also maybe we could collectively include a good bio, sidebar, information, etc.  
  Curious as to what was said and how the discussion of religion went down If you want to get hydrated, do this with water. If you want to get dehydrated use alcohol. If you're low on vitamin c use orange juice. If you need more calcium use milk. If you're lactose intolerant use almond or soy milk. If you need to stay up all night use espresso. If you're British use tea. If you're adventurous use all of these. 

Take a drink (shot/swig/gulp whatever quantity you want) every time Ben says "the idea that," and down the rest of your drink whenever he mentions his wife being a doctor or he says "but first I want to say thank you to my sponsors over at..." You'll be having a good time by the end of his podcasts, and you'll be educated. 

I originally posted this in r/benshapiroshow**Flashback** 
I came across his viral video(Ben shapiro educates college student on transgender) on youtube 3 months ago and from then started listening to his views on certain subjects through similar videos including interviews. Been listening to his podcast after that. So i want to discuss the following topics that i think are his views currently. 

**Abortion**: First time i actually got to know the pro-life side deeply. I actually shifted to pro-life side after that. Good and fair points with less emotional facts and more logic+moral arguments.

**Climate change**: I still believe climate is changing. But i think he has fair point that some people are blowing things out of proportion and using it for political advantages.

**Religion**: I'm still an agnostic atheist. But after listening to him i developed respect for religious people, understood your logic and understood the importance of religious rights. (Eg: the cake shop vs gay couple case.)

**Small Government**: Agree completely. First time i heard these arguments. I have a communist government.

**Trangender**: I think he has a fair point. But i won't be saying any of that out loud in public for now (I want to keep my job).



 ***Things I don't like***
--------------------------------

**Leftists tears mug**: Kind of aggressive in my opinion. It has a steven crowder vibe to it. (I may be wrong. You guys can correct me.)

**Daily wire**: (This is not directly related to Ben. But since he is the chief editor i'm including this point). I check the site daily. Some contents are too cringey. The way the headline goes. It actually looks like the titles for his youtube videos. Youtube videos are uploaded by random people. So i know it's not in his control. But Daily wire titles, i think he can improve. They should lose that Buzzfeed vibe.

 Forgot to say. I stopped watching late night shows after listening to Ben. I was surprised that all the shows i watched at that time were one-sided and unfair to conservative ideas.

PS: I'm not from United States. So some topics were new to me.
PS again: Thanks admin for notifying me about the sub-reddit status.To clear things up, I do not mean “liberal” as in a group, but as a way of approaching an issue. I’m curious if a majority of Ben Shapiro’s fans (on this sub) are conservative. 

I tend to be more liberal leaning, what about you?That's all folks!Has he debated anyone who wasn’t an idiot? Really wanna see his best. Because it’s clear his potential hasn’t been reached. All I could find is him debating college undergrads. Kinda boring lol.I know the reason it's a bit small now is because it was locked/private for years, but now that it's open what do you think  we can do to help?   
  
He has one of the most popular podcasts in the world, surely there are people who just don't know it's open now?   
  
Thoughts? I’ve heard before that he thinks every generation thinks they are the one to discover sex. Is there any thing that discusses this more and the morality behind why it is better to wait until you’re married, etc.? Sex is everywhere and liberals view it as a bodily function but obviously conservatives believe it to be more than that. Any insight would be appreciated.I watched the debate between Ben Shapiro and Cenk Uygur.

Ben was just shilling 1990s trickle down economics.https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMeta/comments/87mn4l/you_should_not_censor_people_for_calling_someone/Ben Shapiro explains why Parkland students have a right to speak out on political issues, but not a right to be free from criticism in light of David Hogg's push to boycott Laura Ingraham.Welcoming fans, haters, and those that are still exploring and/or willing to debate.

It's a new server--still looking for mods and such. I'm looking for mods that will make sure that they won't ban people for their political ideology and will avoid using their authority to create a circle-jerk or safe space atmosphere.

This server is NOT a safe space for anyone--from any side of the political spectrum--however, there is a channel specifically designated for debating and I ask that you use it when debating.Episode 532 this past Friday galvanized me to create a google docs spreadsheet of my favorite Ben Shapiro episodes. There have been so many good ones that I have now forgotten and want to go back and relisten to all of them. Before I do that though, I wanted to ask which ones are your guyses favorites?He has a high pitched voice, ideas that are blatantly wrong, constantly states how taxation is theft, and does it all with a smug "I know more than you" attitude. 

Sure you may criticize me, but these are facts. And they don't care about your feelings of himPlease let me know if you're interested. This subreddit is very new and up until this year was private for many years, so people don't really know a Ben Shapiro subreddit exists.  
   
If you're interested and are dedicated in helping this subreddit grow, please let me know of your ideas, how you will contribute, and you can definitely join our team.   
  
Or, we can always wait until 2024 until the subreddit explodes when Ben runs :)A while ago I remember Ben was answering a person's question whether it is true blue states essentially "fund" the red state's welfare. Thank you for anyone who finds it.I see that there are a few clips on youtube. Following the link to the Dailywire site only led to those same clips, except on the website. This is the longest clip that seems to be available:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkONHNXGfaM&amp;t=11sI just want to join a conservative network that doesn't require me to worship Trump.I am a huge fan of Mr. Shapiro.  That being said, this sub does a disservice everytime a top rated post from our sub is a video montage directly from the show say, "Ben Sahpiro owns X", when I've already listened to the podcast and know about him owning X. 

Reserve these types of posts for Ben responding directly to a question at a live event.  

Maintain the vision, folks.  I listen every day, and can't find anything that says noSo, Mr. Shapiro is coming to my hometown in August to host an evening speech. I am more than excited to be a part of this event however, I do find it hard to justify the $50 ticket fee, for someone I can listen to with fresh material almost daily.  

Has anyone here ever actually paid to hear he speak? 

Was it really worth it?  For context, and to potentially elicit some conversation, I'm writing an article about this and want to hear reddit's view on this topic. I understand each have their own appeal which can be deciphered and debated, but I'm more focused on discovering commonalities to derive a more comprehensive societal perspective.Theres a video of ben shapiro answering a student who challenges mr. shapiro to give examples of black privilege. Ben Shapiro answers him by citing i think mortgage lending practices tailored towards african americans and also the under-policing of black neighborhoods among other examples. Can someone here link me that video or a list of what he says? Thank you!I didn't see anything on my feed...I'm interested in listening to some of Ben's podcasts. I'm just unsure if I can start getting into it without context or knowing more than I do. Can I just start listening without having lots of background knowledge? Any advice helps. Thank you very much! **Calling all Intellectual Dark Web fans \(Sam Harris, JordanPeterson, Ben Shapiro, etc\) What would it take for you to align yourself with a new political party, \(coined as "The Good Faith Party"\) which stood for the restoration of honest "good faith" discourse in the pursuit of truth? And what platform components would you want/expect to see?**I’m at my father in law’s with very spotty internet connectivity.  I’m trying to find a segment where Shapiro explained why the FBI investigation into Trump during the election wasn’t a political “spying” thing.  It was within the last 2-3 weeks.  I think there were a couple of them.  I’m trying to jump around through some of the recent episodes but can’t find what I’m looking for with such poor internet connection.

I think this was the segment where Shapiro talks about trying to look at things like “what if this was the other side” and the lays out done of the basic facts and points out that if the same was the case for Hillary, no republican would be claiming the investigation was inappropriate, so they shouldn’t claim it was inappropriate for trump. I havent seen him on any debates in a few months (that i know of) . Wish he would debate that racist priest on the munk debateHas Ben Shapiro mentioned Tommy Robinson getting arrested and jailed in the UK? I know the perception of Robinson in the UK is "far\-right" but when objectively looking into his political ideals, he lines up significantly more with Ben Shapiro than any sort of "alt\-right" figure. I would like to hear his opinion regarding the reporting restrictions on the case in the UK.The only criticisms I've seen were calling him racist, nationalist, beta, etc. Just seeing if there are any real/true criticisms about him that are common.Trying to understand who Ben Shapiro is since I've recently got interested in Jordan Peterson and the debate around political correctness and BS's name keeps coming up. Wikipedia states:

&gt;"\[Ben Shapiro\] has written seven books, the first being 2004's *Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America's Youth*, which he started writing when he was 17 years old. \[...\] In his 2004 b*ook Brainwa*shed, Shapiro argues that students are  not exposed to a variety of viewpoints at universities and that those  who do not have strong opinions will be overwhelmed by an atmosphere  dominated by liberal instructors even if discussion is encouraged in  classrooms."

How could this young prodigy have a formed opinion on the state of American universities at age 17? Did he get any data from somewhere to argue his analysis? Usually people at 17 haven't even started college/university, how could he even write a book about it? What could a teenager possibly have to say worth reading on that subject?

I know my questions sounds critical, but I honestly don't know anything about Mr. Shapiro and I don't see myself buying his book in the near future to find out the long way going straight to the source, I will be grateful to anyone who wants to answer and help me understand.If you were to balance Ben with only one liberal podcast, what would it be?I am not that good at making cogent arguments so I need some help. Someone made a post on a graduate admissions subreddit about how they needed scholarships because they are a female and a minority. I responded with, "don't you want to get ahead in life by your merit instead of by being a female and a minority?" Then some SJW came in and made all these assumptions about me being White and privileged and how I would never understand what its like for OP because of being privileged and White, here is what they said:

&gt;I take it you are white, and your attitude reminds me of that Fisher chick who tried to sue UT because she was rejected and thought it was "just because she was white", essentially. Familiarize yourself with the case and change that attitude. It won't get you far in academia, and her case is proof. You don't get what it's like in other countries because you aren't from there, and I take it you've never been there and never will. But coming from a lower privileged family, you aren't offered as much earlier on in life and it's a bit more difficult to work you way to where you want to be. I know of a few first-gens who didn't even know that graduate school existed or was an option for them.

The funny thing is I am not White. I am a minority. I was born in and lived the first 13 years of my life in a country which is ranked about 160/190 countries by GDP per Capita - an extremely poor country. I regularly have $0 in my bank account.

Could someone help me create a good argument against this person.One day Artificial Intelligence will take over a lot of our jobs. As recently shown in Google AI conference, Google can now create chat bots that are so good it (almost) passes the Turin test. 

I believe 50&amp;#37; of our jobs can be replaced by AI in about 60 years, if not sooner.

What should we do about the people who lost their jobs? Would Ben Shapiro support universal income like what some people (e.g. Elon Musk) has proposed? That sounds highly socialist to me, so my guess is no. But at the same time, when 60&amp;#37; of our jobs are replaced, what should 60&amp;#37; of the workforce do? It's not like other jobs will open up...this is not like the Industrial Revolution. This is different.Ben Shapiro denies overpopulation based upon false predictions from the 60s and 70s.

The world hasn't ended. People are not starving to death. We are able to feed more people than ever before, and we still have plenty of space on the planet left to expand. 

I GET IT.

But have you considered the QUALITY OF LIFE in major cities?

I don't know about you, but i don't exactly prefer to live in skyscrappers where when I look out the window, i'm surrounded by other skyscrappers. I prefer TREES, MOUNTAINS, OCEANS...u know...NATURE.

Sure, we can squeeze people into densely-packed skyscrappers...but at what cost? 

And for those who say "why don't u just move then", that's a shitty argument because 1) you're not actually addressing the problem, but fleeing from it, 2) that's where the jobs are.Hello fellow redditors. Quick background - I'm a Californian, grew up in a solidly Democratic household, and am about to graduate with a degree in history from a UC school. As you might guess, there was a time not long ago that I would fervently support affirmative action, even ideas like basic income, and I naturally and unthinkingly dismissed right wing policies.

But, I fell in love with a girl whose parents are fiscally conservative. Because I wanted to do justice to the beliefs of my future family members, I started trying to 'steelman' libertarian/classical liberal/conservative arguments. And then I discovered Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, etc. While I don't agree with those two gentlemen on everything, my eyes have been opened to the toxic elements within the Left, the critical importance of the rights protected by the Constitution, and the dangers of big government and bureaucratic overgrowth. Now I find myself unsure what to believe on a variety of issues. I consider myself a rationalist and I want to sort of approach politics from square one and build up my political beliefs based on both core values and a careful analysis of each policy, rather than jumping right into a given camp.

Could someone recommend me any essential reads? Much obliged in advance. Sorry if this is off topic, but I've found Mr Shapiro's civility and intelligence quite thought provoking and thought this might be a good place to turn. And saw Ben Shapiro lowering his basketball goal to 6 foot and practicing some pretty sick dunks I recognize abortion is essentially murder. I agree.

But I am pro-choice because of economic consequences. Let me lay out the facts in a logical fashion:

\#1: Banning abortion won't stop unready people from having sex and getting pregnant.

\#2: Unready people will still pump out thousands, if not close to a million, of babies PER YEAR

\#3: By current social laws, it is the taxpayers who end up paying for those kids

\#4: Adoption is frequently not an option, because there simply are not enough eager couples wanting to adopt

\#5: Taxpayers won't feel good about paying for other ppl's damn kids

So this is why i'm against banning abortion; the consequence would have led to socialism in the extreme where responsible taxpayers are paying for the IRRESPONSIBILITY of others.I agree with Ben that white privilege is a myth. Plenty of white trash bums living in the streets just like the blacks.

However - what about wealth privilege?

For example - in a job interview, we all know it's not about your college degree or even your previous job experience. It's about WHO you know or WHO you are connected to. If your daddy is Donald Trump, or if your mommy is Hillary Clinton, you can easily get ahead in life as compared to someone who may have worked hard and aced his SATs. 

Or vice versa - imagine you're applying to a prestigious medical school. Someone with a rich daddy who made a 5 million dollar donation would be able to sneak his son into the admission, even if by any fair standard that son's academic performance should not make him qualified.

Has any1 asked Ben if he recognize this is a problem in this country, and if yes, what does he plan to do about it?I wanna know for personal reasons.My position on welfare is it should only be given to people from either:

1. Disability due to work-related injuries (e.g. war vets, injuries on the job...)
2. People with curable diseases (e.g. get them fixed up so they can go back and contribute to society)

imo, anything else should really be left up to individual communities to engage on a voluntary basis, and if ppl start dying due to lack of support, well, that's tough, natural selection ftw.

For example, a single mom who choose to have 3 kids with 3 different men and now cannot afford to pay for her 3 kids...too bad, not my problem. I don't want to see my taxes spend towards her welfare. That's not to say ppl should not donate to her, by all means go ahead, i'ts your money. 

Do people who follow Ben Shapiro generally agree with me on this?A clip from a Daily Wire episode, I'm pretty sure. Saw it a little while ago, wanna rewatch it, and talk about it with a friend.

I can't seem to find it at all. If anyone else has also seen it and has a link to it, I'd appreciate that!

EDIT: [Found it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq07oyDvnDU)I am against capital punishment for two reasons:

1) If you're wrong on the sentencing, you can't undo it.

2) It's more expensive for the taxpayers. I read a financial report back in early 2000s where it's actually more expensive to submit someone through the capital punishment process than to simply throw that person in jail for life. Surprising, eh? But apparently that's how our politics work.

I welcome counter-arguments for ppl who wish to challenge. I am happy to change my mind.Which of his texts is a must read? I was listening to the Sunday Special with Weinstein and wished it would have gone on for many more hours. Any thoughts/ideas as to why Ben keeps his content to 1 hour?Hi guys. Shapiro mentioned some books that did a good job of helping resolve some of the (seeming) contention between evolution and the Biblical account of creation. I'm so pressed for time, I can't listen to months of podcasts trying to find it. Does anyone happen to know what these books were?

Thanks for your time.Ben's main argument against calling a trans by their preferred pronoun is "you're biologically a male, therefore you're a he" (or vice versa).

But surely he realizes that there's sex versus gender? The two are NOT the same! Gender is a social construct, while sex is a biological construct.

Sex is determined by your chromosomes, and gender is not.

So to me, Ben's argument doesn't make sense. A female person can indeed identify as a male by GENDER, but her SEX would still be female.atheism is one of the most ban happy subboards- i guess they don't like when people genuinely go to ask their opinion.So, Ben Shapiro's audience is primarily conservative and evangelical Christian. Part of that Christian faith is that the only way to heaven is through Jesus, and becoming a good Christian, which Ben Shapiro will never do.

So, does the majority of Ben Shapiro's audience think he's going to Hell for all eternity?Just started reading the book Capitalism in the 21st century, and I find myself agreeing with a lot of the points mentioned.

Did a quick google search but can't find Ben's critiques on this book. Any1 able to cite me any link, if there is one?so i remember a ben retweet from a while ago of shoshanna weissmann's reading list but has ben himself ever posted a reading list of books he particularly enjoyed, im slowly working my way through jbp's list among others and im looking to get peter thiels one reccomended book sometime soon but does ben have one? if not which books do you all reccommend reading and which of ben's books is a good place to startben shapiro wasnt epic :OOOOOOOOOOOOOOWe could definitely do a daily discussion of the podcast.Thank you! Perhaps some discussion threads for each podcast released to start?I like this idea!Thanks for opening it back up. Happy to help! Look forward to seeing this community grow.BEN SHAPRIO 2020~Seriously can't wait for this, though I don't anticipate as much fireworks as I think.Also add "in any case"- Make Ben himself aware of the sub.  He might just interact.

- Post a FAQ/Bio and stick it at the top of the sub.  
Me too. Hope they are planning on releasing it.This game is masked as a Suicide Remedy. You'd drown yourself internally before the first half of his show was over.                    DON'T PLAY THIS GAME SAVE YOURSELVES!!!!!I really wish Chris Hitchens was still alive to take on Benny Shapiro. Hitchens was way more adequate and in depth in politics than Harris is and he would of absolutely destroyed Shapiro in a discussion on religion and how it poisons everything.  Looks about right. Now let's make it happen.I like Ben's style and incredible articulation. I certainly don't agree with him on everything but I still rate him highly as a commentator. You raise some good points here. I'm not as unequivocal on Israel/Palestine as he is, though I would veer towards the Israeli side, and I think, like you- I'm also not as prepared to stand over his very blunt approach to climate change and transgenderism. But I do really take on board his basis for believing what he does. I also agree with you, he changed my mind on abortion and some other issues. I believe he certainly has the most practical line to take on TrumpI love how seriously he takes it. Hah. Quality laughsYes, finally! I've been waiting for a Ben Shapiro subreddit for over a year.Take a shot every time he says "alright folks."I disagree with him on Wikileaks. I think it’s important to provide a legal framework that such organizations can operate. But he seems to oppose leaks entirely, which goes against the principles of small government and accountability.

without wikileaks we may not have even known about great government expansions in power such as within the NSAYou can never find anyone you agree with completely. That being said, I agree 90-95% with what ben believes.  Also, I don't believe the leftist tears mugs are too aggressive, yes it's got a crowder feel, but like ben says, "screw your emotions!"The mooch!Take a shot every time he says "gang"Good point. :)

Edit: Just want to add that when you thrash an entire side like that it kind of make debates with each other difficult.You really can’t hate too much about they guy. He makes points based on facts for the most part. 

I disagree with the pro life thing, but I can see his views. To me, I think the argument over this issue is rooted in sentiment. I don’t think there is a correct answer to whether or not a child should be aborted because I don’t think we can define valuable human life. It’s completely subjective. Citing scientific facts about how your side is correct is missing the actual argument. I would have the position of “it’s okay to kill a child as long as they don’t have consciousness”. But consciousness has no practical ‘be-all-end-all definition. Plus I *feel* it is wrong to kill a child (based on what I define as valuable life). It’s as logical as any other argument. We want to not abort (or murder if you prefer that) the child because we feel it isn’t right. I don’t think you can justify either side without bringing feeling into it. 
I understood. I am always confused in the case of a rape victim. I feel like we are violating their human rights when we tell them not to abort and also i understand pro life argument that it still a life like in other abortion cases. I don't know which argument weighs more. Always confused to take a stand on that.Correct me if i'm wrong. I think wikileaks lied about how they never made mistakes and also read that Julian Assange is not trustworthy. These things make me shy away from supporting wikileaks. But yeah i agree that overall organisations like wikileaks is necessary.Yeah. That' a good idea* We need to style the banner and sidebar ./u/mav89 commented on this post that he knows CSS. So we can take his help.
* Flairs will be good idea. Easy to interact and it would be fun.


You really can’t be wrong no matter what. Both sides are equally right. It’s a tricky issue because you can’t prove your point without rooting your own argument in an emotional bias. 

Personally I am pro choice, because I view a human life as important when it is conscious or able to live without relying on the mother. (I use my own definition of consciousness here.) But I cannot bring myself to justify killing off a newborn child that isn’t considered self aware yet. I’m aware that my logic has flaws, but I’m not sure if there is a better way to view it that isn’t equally as flawed.
If I went full utilitarian here I would say screw emotions kill the child. But I don’t think that I’m capable of thinking freely like that. (By freely I mean able to properly evaluate what is an illogical emotional thought and what is logical *without bias*)

Do you think there is an end to this debate?  What made you ultimately pro life?What changed my mind is the comparison of a guy in coma to a fetus.
We will never allow killing of a person in coma just because he is relying on external machines to survive(Heard this from Ben's speech). A person in coma may never wake up again. But in the case of fetus we can say in confidence that this fetus is going to be a girl/boy. Even though fetus has no brain activity we know that it will develop that in 2 months. So i feel like an abortion takes that baby's right to live.(I want to add something quick, I think the pro life standpoint is simpler. Less room for a broad spectrum of opinions. Pro choice on the other hand, has so many different views of life. Usually people who are pro choice have different views on being pro choice.)

Back to the coma,

I have heard that argument. And I think the counter used by most pro-choice people is that the person already has a fully fleshed life. (Instead of the potential of a life in the fetus). The argument is that the fetus isn’t a “worthy” human life. (Which in my opinion is a valid and ridiculous statement at the same time.)
The fetus has yet to become a life. Usually pro-choice people will respond to this with saying something along the lines of 
“It’s potential for a (worthy) life.”
Which doesn’t help the argument on either side, because this is a statement that is equally invalid as it is valid. 
People who are pro choice don’t see that potential for a human life capable of thought. They just see a sub human. And this argument falls in neither sides favor, because the deciding factor is again, a biased opinion on whether or not the potential for life should be taken away.

(The most common argument is that the life never existed to begin with, so it is okay to terminate while it still isn’t worthy)

My spin on the coma patient is a little unethical to some, but if he/she is highly unlikely to stay in a vegetative state and not reclaim their life, then I would pull the plug.  

Each time I am pushed to make a decision with only an emotional moral code, I see a stalemate. &gt; My spin on the coma patient is a little unethical to some, but if he/she is highly unlikely to stay in a vegetative state and not reclaim their life, then I would pull the plug.

Yeah. I understood. But in the case of a fetus we know that it will grow and develop normal human activities.

&gt; the counter used by most pro-choice people is that the person already has a fully fleshed life.

This is kind of cruel i think.

Every time in an abortion debate it ends up in both party repeating their arguments. There is no middle ground. I agree.
It comes full circle, I don’t see an end to it. Both sides are equally flawed.

(And yes I can see why you think the fleshed out life thing is cruel, valuing one life over another because of an opinion, or what I see as an opinion) 

Back to the coma patient, you are forgetting that pro choice people don’t see the potential for life the same way that pro life people do. They don’t consider that idea. In their minds, a fetus is just another animal, hasn’t even registered as a human. So they never think about the potential of its life, because they view the fetus as a separate entity to a baby.  The whole potential argument boils down to an opinion. Honestly the more I write about it the more I wish there was some sort of neutral option. 

You are right. The viewpoints are different. So it's difficult to convince the opposite party(for both sides).Stalemate then. Good conversation.Good conversation. Thanks for your time. :)Where do you get that?A Jewish Christmas StoryLmao, I love Ben. I'm willing to try to post YouTube videos of the podcast everydayOh God I love being disgustingMy life is busy I don't have time to do the work that Ben does for a professional living. That being said he has never steered me wrong and seems to have a good grasp on reality and facts. Add to that he's willing to admit when he's wrong, he has my utmost faith and I regard his opinion over anyone else on this planet. #fanboyI grew up a leftist because I didn't know any better. I'm a millennial at age 33. When ObamaCare took place I could barely afford my bills, I couldn't afford Obamacare let alone the tax penalties that came with it. I was so pissed off that the government was forcing me to buy a service I didn't need or want. Shortly after I found a video of Ben on YouTube. He has become my spirit animal per se. I've literally seen every single video he's ever made and got his books for Christmas last year.

Edit, also I just wanted to add I really wish I could change my username.The only thing I disagree with you with his leftist tears mug you got to remember leftists and Liberals are two different things. Leftists have to be met with small aggression and satire because it's what they listen to in my opinion.Pinned political discussion on current events like that tax bill that just passed so everyone could calmly and politely talk about it in a calm and civil manor?Thought I was a hard core libertarian. Listened to Adam kokesh quite a bit, then I heard ben speak a few years ago and I quickly realized he reflected my views much more accurately. Heard ben shapiro accusing them of the same.Do you have any sources though?Not able to find the link. I saw an article claiming WikiLeaks deleted some information from website after people pointed out that the info shared in the leaks are fake. The year is 2011 i guess. (I will post the link when i finish travelling)Liberal by bens definition, conservative by the lefts definition Conservative.Use his twitter banner as the banner for this page. It’s rhe logo to “the Ben Shapiro show” 

Also, articles from him on daily wire and NRO should be posted. Ben's Twitter is on fire🔥🔥🔥🔥"Prostitute"  lmfao😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥Definitely more left.  

I don't see the point in only listening to things you agree with.  Libertarian then? 
Conservative. I agree with Ben like 99% of the time. Liberal is more accurate. More accepting of a certain amount of government regulation than him (generally) or libertarians.

I like libertarians overall though. I appreciate their dedication to free speech. /r/libertarian is one of the best political subs on reddit.and then *@Rosie blocked you*Can't agree more with the comment about daily wire. These days I only read the ones they get from Malkin and the like. For regular articles I switched to national review. Much better.I'm aiming more for him to be VP on Nikki Haley's ticket.Well, I'd say Mr. Shapiro has contributed to my political beliefs. 
@age 19 I was a "Bernie-gang liberal" and . Now I am 21 &amp; after further college education &amp; many intern positions I've come to see that the democratic party is self-destructing. 
I am Constitutional-conservative, pro-choice &amp; free-speech  can you imagine ben shapiro being a vp? one of the reasons i respect ben so much is because he doesn't kowtow to points he doesn't fully believe in...which is kind of in the job description of a VP. I'd love to see him go california congressman/senator for 10 years or so -&gt; presidential run around age 45 or so but i just honestly don't think he's interested. as he has said before, he believes he can effect more positive change from outside the system than from within.I would suggest to make a wiki about Ben Shapiro to see what he holds on the issues.I pretty much agree with him on all those issues in the original post. My main disagreement with him is on capital punishment, which I strongly oppose. I also suspect that his coverage of Israeli issues is rather biased, but I honestly am not knowledgeable enough about the complex situations there to comment further.Lmao Ben is savage as fuck.

Seems like Twitter reversed themselves

https://www.dailywire.com/news/25039/oops-twitter-reverses-itself-calls-rosies-obscene-daily-wireIt would be a substantial debate for sure but I think Ben would have it in the bagRosie did something very similar to what Milo did to Jones.  I don't want her kicked from the platform, but easy to see there is a type of political thought favoritism going on.

I'm not huge fan of Milo, but the recent Buzzfeed leak shows just how incompetent the high-level staff is at Twitter.On the political compass, I'm a liberal libertarian which some might call a Classic Liberal.  I'm a fan of Ben because he challenges the values I hold.  I'm also happy to listen to him challenge bad values on his side on a consistent basis.  They reversed their decision too, shows that they KNEW they were wrong.My guess is January 2nd. Hey there! Just read through your conversation with OP and had a few things I noticed. You said you didn't agree with Ben, but then proceeded to note the issues and counters addressed from the pro choice side of things.

I believe I can address the pro life argument to you without it being based off of feeling, or bringing scientific facts you say misses the point. 

Killing people is a no no(not a feeling, a truth of society). Babies are people(not a feeling again). No no to killing babies. 

Extremes used to through fallacy into the logic, such as rape or incest or the mothers life in danger, seem to be the best hole in pro lifes stance to pick at. On this idea personally I am not okay with killing babies. I understand situations this extreme. I don't have to like these extremes, but I wouldn't harass a poor woman who had to have gone through such an ordeal. 

I don't believe you can say the view points are equally flawed with the lack of argument against pro life. Do you any counterpoints you can add against pro life side we could discuss?In my mind a person begins the argument like this...

Consulting moral foundation -&gt;

Establishing a belief -&gt;

Being oblivious to the first steps -&gt;

Looking at the issue with a bias -&gt;

Attempting to justify a point of view -&gt;

Moral superiority


I think every opinion on this issue will have some sort of deep affiliation with personal morals. 
(The utilitarian standpoint having the least)
And we build our argument around that.
You have to ask yourself what is human? Why do you value it?
What counts as a life?
I think you’ll realize that you might have some opinions that can never be proven. This does not make them incorrect, just not correct.

Sure, I believe what a person defines as life is feeling first, then a justification second. You believe that babies before birth (third trimester or whatever cutoff you use) are human. I’m bringing up the idea that there is no correct cutoff for what is human. 

Animal lives differ from humans, and the argument that follows as soon as I make this statement is also biased to support any individuals views. 

Both sides arguments fall apart after you realize this. Since there is no way to separate sentiment and logic when it comes to value, you cannot win. 
Morality does not work in absolutes, especially person to person, so you cannot have a correct answer. There is no correct answer to what defines a human life, or even a valuable human life. 

I’m not here to say pro choice is correct,
(Mostly I was playing devils advocate, but I do feel it is the individuals choice.)
I am here to say that we should not assume we know what is just. And because of that we cannot establish an absolute for other people.

To sum it up, I’m saying we cannot dictate another person’s life while claiming we have the superior morals.

Randomly, that face she made at UN made me think of Churchill.When she was votingI'm kind of amazed that Shapiro and Peterson haven't had a conversation yet.I'm following you pretty well I think. Thanks for the discussion BTW, always appreciate a good mental workout.

Are you saying it is impossible to establish an agreement between everyone because at base everyones thought is subjective? Literally unable to have a correct answer because no one thinks alike?

I would say the accuracy in that little statement is near perfect reasoning for pro life to be the morally superior option. None of us can say for sure what is going on in anyone elses life. Meaning any feelings are biased and therefor anything I say you can say is flawed. That being the point. If we have the common agreement that "Killing is a no no", allowing for grey areas, because extremes happen(self defense, euthenasia), then we can get to a point of agreeing that we have a standard.

That seems to be the farthest back with the biggest issue that seems to get ignored by semantics the closer to the surface the argument gets. 

If killing is a no no, then whatever the question, the answer is no. Should we kill this? "No" no other answer. When you get the point you did kill something, the question is Did we need to kill this? Animals? Well if I killed a cow to feed myself for a day, no. That was unneeded, bad. Did I kill a fish to feed my family today? Yes, alright, well if you can eat without killing then good, so maybe work towards that because we shouldn't kill. 

If you take responsibility for all the actions you can before hand to prevent the consequence of sperm meeting the egg, and then succeeding to fertilize, you should be able to stop that from happening. Obviously extremes happen, but that's not the point here. 

At that point we can say we have no idea how to define life, I agree. So if you get to the point where, the two things we know need to come in contact to form a child(sperm and egg), do, that is where we lose the ability to chose what to do next, because we don't know if life has started at that point. We can't say it has. We know it ends up there somewhere, so the entire path along the way, would be the time to make sure extra care is taken to prevent killing.

Since we can not define life, and killing is a no no, then we can not knowingly interfer with a process known to end in life. 

I think if you take that to the extreme one direction in your belief, you end up with the Catholic stance of sex is only for procreation. If you stop enough people from participating in the act of procreation until ready to procreate, you don't need to worry as much about "killing" anything at all. 

We can't know what life is in the sperm, or in the egg, but we know that separately they do not create a child, but together they do(can). I haven't been able to agree with your point of it being the individuals choice. I would agree that everything leading up to the intercourse would be individuals choice. Once the individual participates in an act no longer possible with just an individual, it turns into a collective issue.

We do dictate another person's life while claiming we have the superior morals, we do it all the time in life. Creating laws are specifically that, though the laws are not always moral. If it weren't an issue of killing, I would be probably completely libertarian on this issue. I don't care what you do to your body. 

So tl;dr? Since we can not define life, we can not actively interrupt the process we know ends in life. Taking your fact of life differs between species, applying agreement that killing is bad, and the argument for abortion turns into an argument for lab grown foods.What I do not want to come from my reason is an absolute. An absolute removes room for questioning. What I’m trying to say is that both sides are attempting to establish an absolute, where the problem should not be approached by it. 

You are missing what I said earlier. I am not stating that feelings are biased therefore not correct, that’s syllogistic abuse. I am saying that neither side is correct, and neither side is wrong. 

I am not saying that the reason we cannot agree is because everyone’s thought is subjective, but that the problem has no correct answer because it’s rooted in sentiment. 

(A step above subjectivity, but directly related)

I am not saying we should or shouldn’t interfere, that doesn’t relate to my argument. I am explaining that interference doesn’t have the same meaning between groups. The idea of “killing” doesn’t carry the same weight. The idea of human life doesn’t mean the same thing compared to another person’s idea. 

&gt; So tl;dr? Since we can not define life, we can not actively interrupt the process we know ends in life. Taking your fact of life differs between species, applying agreement that killing is bad, and the argument for abortion turns into an argument for lab grown foods.

While I think the syllogism is a great tool, this is where it fails, even Aristotle (the creator of it) understood where it goes wrong. You are closing off grey areas and making assumptions that can be questioned in order to make a statement.

We can interrupt what we consider life in order to benefit, but the benefit differs from person to person. It is not a question of what we can and cannot do, but what each person sees as just. Without a concrete definition of life, we can still act according to our ‘flawed’ definition, as long as we do not consider our flawed definition perfect.
The definition of a valuable life is not absolute, so killing isn’t the correct word because it assumes the life in question is valuable. Again, we cannot say whether or not we are “killing” outside of what affects us.

Let’s say we are killing.
Killing is bad because people say it is bad, other than that it has no reason to be bad. I cannot say whether or not killing is truly “bad”. You cannot say why killing is bad other than it is wrong. It’s only wrong because the moral foundation you have classifies it as wrong. I understand I’m sounding like a postmodernist here, but I’m trying to simplify the argument.

We end a ‘valuable’ life to benefit ourselves, the same holds true for an abortion, the only difference being how valuable you see it as. When you strip the value, it is just.


*(Edit: realized  I said absolute an absurd amount of times)*nah, the mug itself is an appeal to the emotions of the person using it. it's inflammatory just for the sake of provocation. 
soapbox for a second:
shapiro is my favorite commentator, and his use of clear, rational thought is a breath of fresh air in a climate of putrid pandering. that being said, i wish he wouldn't make so many attempts to appeal to a polarized base - his logic and reason could appeal to everyone, ideally. phrases like "those on the left" and "that's exactly what the left wants" are just forms of pandering rhetoric that drives a deeper wedge between bipartisan folks and alienates those who otherwise may warm up to his line of thinking. i think this is a mistake, and Ben does his otherwise highly educational and limpid discussion a disservice everytime he plays into this. that being said, shapiro for presidentHe debated Cenk Uyger at Politicon this year. I guess it depends on your opinion of Cenk if he qualifies. It's easily found on YouTube.  A few times he makes Cenk lose his cool and Cenk criticizes the audience because he knows he can't do that to Ben lolYea I haven’t watched the young Turks (is that cranks show?) in like...3 years maybe? I don’t think he knows much or is very smart. I did watch a few minutes of it and he made me cringe so I shut it off lol. To be fair I only suggested him because he's not a college student and he is someone that I think people on the left consider an intellectual (that is an oxymoron, I know) I suppose both have that “the other side is evil” thing going on. But for Ben it’s pointed at SJWs and for Cenk it’s pointed at anyone on the right lol. I don’t like that stuff. It’s hard to avoid of course but that’s me. I just wanna see some good ass debate from both sides really. Doesn’t have to be Shapiro I suppose but he speaks so well lol. The fucking crowd at that debate is literally unbearable. I don't want to hear teenagers boo &amp; cheer after everything either of them says.[Of Course!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwxnWi3mn6o)At work on my phone so can't look back upon the conversation as much to reply right now, I can later when I get off work. I'll respond with what I remember for now.

I'm seeing why you want to avoid establishing an absolute for the situation. If we are to turn the discussion to the topic of establishing law on the topic. Do you believe we can establish an absolute standard that should be upheld by society as a whole, while allowing the extreme situations a compassionate evaluation to handle the extreme? If we want to discuss situations where terminating a pregnancy is beneficial, you can always find positions to pull forward. 

I feel like we are(in society at present) looking at a screen with white one sliver of the side, and black being a small sliver on the opposite side, with a whole lot of grey in the middle. This being your argument here, of we can never agree on the definition of valuable life so I can't say you are wrong for seeking the termination of a "valuable life". With the grey being the disagreement between people on what valuable life means. 

I would rather try and turn the screen to half white, half black, with a small sliver of grey in the middle. The grey then should not be used as ammunition to push back either side. If you stop trying to establish a value on life, and just say no killing, then trying to place a value on life doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if who thinks there is value in the life if it is law that we not actively take steps to cease interference with pregnancy. 

Fact - if left alone, pregnancy develops life. Could you not consider that an absolute? Obviously things can go wrong, but as of right now, this is how we know absolutely how to create more life. If we establish that ending life is not okay, which we established as a foundation of society(thou shall not kill is a staple of societal growth). Then making it law to prevent the interruption of a process that creates life, protects life. People need guidelines and rules to follow, even with guidelines people still ignore them, but in general, on the whole, society functions better. 

If you let extremes stay extremes(with compassionate observance) and don't try and use them as an example of fallacy, then on the whole you have more life. And less people growing up believing they can judge the value of a potential life.

Since no one can accurately be correct in judging the potential value of life, we must remove ourselves from the practice of interfering with the process of life. We must as a community pull together to help each other through extremes, and not leave people to their own devices when it comes to these extremes. 

I can't say your life wouldn't be better if you just left your crappy breaking down vehicle on the side of the road. I can say say you aren't allowed to abandon it there though. I don't care if it's breaking down because you didn't take enough preventative measures to ensure the car wouldn't break down. There was ample opportunity to prepare yourself before hand to be able to handle the situation. There must be personal responsibility and accountability. Just because I can't accurately value the vehicle doesn't mean I can't observe the issue in letting you think it's alright to leave it there.
I think that if nobody can define life, we should not take one side (not aborting), instead we stick to what we think as long as it’s within the moral boundaries/laws we have set. (Meaning if they define a baby in week one is not valuable they have the choice)

I think this hypothetical might clear some things up.

Woman ‘A’ gets an abortion every month because she doesn’t feel like taking birth control or having a condom in use.

Woman B has a one night stand and ends up pregnant and gets an abortion.

Woman C is pregnant with an ex. boyfriend’s baby, she gets an abortion 

Woman D gets pregnant when the condom breaks, she gets an abortion.

Woman E gets pregnant despite using a condom and birth control. Gets an abortion.

Woman F gets pregnant, is single, but loses her job and fears she cannot support the child. She gets an abortion.

Woman G is sixteen years old, she gets an abortion because she cannot handle the responsibilities and needs to stay in school.

Woman H is raped, and gets an abortion.

For which woman (list as many as you want) do you think it is ethical to abort? 

(This might give me a more clear view of what you think)


Getting back to the idea that there is ample opportunities to prevent conception. I would agree. 

&gt;I can't say your life wouldn't be better if you just left your crappy breaking down vehicle on the side of the road. I can say say you aren't allowed to abandon it there though. I don't care if it's breaking down because you didn't take enough preventative measures to ensure the car wouldn't break down. There was ample opportunity to prepare yourself before hand to be able to handle the situation. There must be personal responsibility and accountability. Just because I can't accurately value the vehicle doesn't mean I can't observe the issue in letting you think it's alright to leave it there.


But when it comes to whether or not people know to use it, I would disagree, I think sex education is failing. In the extremes, people can’t afford birth control or condoms, (But this is a flimsy argument as most people can afford it). 

But I don’t think I should argue that people know less than they should on average, this is common knowledge. If everyone was more educated on the topic, I think your car scenario would have more merit.


I do have a quick question, would you consider sperm and an egg potential for life? Conservative, capitalist, Catholic, but libertarian in many ways.  

I want to applaud any liberals here.  I too believe it's important to hear the other side and challenge your beliefs.   I find this very difficult to do, personally, and admire those who give it an honest attempt.Good for you!!! I agree an be open dialogue is healthy and important!!!!
Hey thanks for the discussion, I am really enjoying it.

You say we should not take one side(not aborting), but you take one side(aborting). The problem  with sticking to moral boundaries and laws, is that they are changing to ignore previous laws and boundaries. If we really stuck to them then they would not be so different than 50 years ago. You are saying that since you can't define life, I can define a baby, and then use that definition of what I call a baby to bypass the roadblock of not being able to define life. The change that comes with progress should not be considered comparable to change that comes from convenience.

Woman A - Completely unethical. And an extreme look into the danger of abortion not being considered wrong. Woman A may honestly legitimately believe that she is doing nothing wrong, because she has been taught its her choice. Abortion =/= birth control. There appears no depth of thought into the possibility of the pregnancy being a special unique experience that should not be taken casually. Special because it is the only way we have to create more humans. There seems to be no respect for the process of life.

Woman B - Unethical. Sex is typically an enjoyable activity, understandable people want to be able to participate in such activities. Again, this is the only way we have to get more humans. Be more careful.

Woman C - Unethical. Even if the father is not wanting the child, adoption is still an option.

Woman D - Unethical. She tried, unsuccessfully. "Oops" isn't a reason for abortion.

Woman E - Unethical. She tried even better than woman D. Abstinence is the only 100% effective form of birth control. Abortion takes away the sense of personal responsibility. Creating an "Oh shit!" button to try and get you out of a difficult time distances a persons respect for the process of life.

Woman F - Unethical. Again, adoption is still an option. A life not coming to fruition because someone else couldn't afford the life is not ethical.

Woman G - Unethical. If the girl wasn't educated well enough beforehand to be able to make the right decisions to avoid ending up being pregnant, how can an argument that she needs to continue along the exact same path with no consequence be ethical? At the very least going through the pregnancy and letting the baby be adopted seems reasonable. The girl can learn a valuable important lesson that can benefit society with the information she gains from the experience.

Woman H - Unethical. Two wrongs don't make a right. Adoption again is still an option. Hopefully the woman is able to get through her situation with all the support of the community, not letting the actions of a criminal ruin the lives of not only the woman, but the child and their community. Unlike all the other women, in this situation the pregnancy is of no fault to the woman. If her life is not in danger, I still can not say I believe it is okay to terminate the pregnancy. I don't think there is any reason the woman should have to endure her situation with no help. On the contrary I believe there could be a special program to help victims through pregnancies, helping in any adoption work, medical appointments and bills. Still, in this situation, if a police report has been filed, and the crime is not being swept under the table, I don't see a need to instigate a disagreement. A crime happened and justice is after the offender. Let's leave it at that. A hospital exam and police report seem adequate diligence to ignore any further inquiry into this conversation.(also encourages reporting rapes)

Preventative planning seems like an important part of life. Rather than relaxing boundaries and ignoring responsibility by dismissing the respect and reverence a pregnancy deserves, wouldn't it be better to reinforce education and discussion on not only the fun activity that adults enjoy, but also the ridiculous process and intense responsibilities of a human being created? Just because people know less right now, due to present attempts at education failing, doesn't mean we should relax standards.

If we were to rank experiences people can have and the frequency at which the experience occurs, by the impact said experience can have on the world, sex and pregnancy would be so high up on that list. I'm not sure what else could come close on that list.

Since pregnancy is the only known process that ends in life, and we can not be correct in our belief of when in that process life starts, how can we plead ignorance as an excuse? "I don't know when it's wrong so I can do it whenever" does not seem like a good healthy reasoning. 

We know that in order for a pregnancy to occur, sperm needs to fertilize the egg. If sperm does not come in contact with the egg, pregnancy will not occur. What ever else may conspire, pregnancy will not occur without the fertilization. After that sperm enters the egg, we should not be able to intentionally stop the process. 

This is where I start to have internal debates still. And would enjoy your input. If it is the sperm entering the egg, what of plan b? It stops the fertilized egg from attaching to the womb. So does this interference stop a pregnancy in process? Or prevent a pregnancy all together. Is Fertilization &gt;=&lt; pregnancy? I don't dislike plan b, and don't feel bad when girlfriends have used it in the past, but I wonder if maybe I am on a hypocritical side of my argument at this point.

Cheers!Yeah I like discussions like this,

I think you’re starting to see the line between sentiment and logic. It’s not exclusive to you, everyone with an opinion on the issue suffers from it. I recognize that I am hypocritical, because I would not kill a child outside of the womb because I feel that is valuable life. But I won’t hesitate to abort a fetus. While there is hypocrisy I don’t think I’m wrong, just not correct (going back to the flaws of establishing a definition for valuable life).The same applies to you with plan B, or sperm and eggs. We could argue that sperm and eggs are potential for life, but I think we can both see where that could not be applied in real life (literally no way to prevent ovulation/sperm production besides surgery or hormone blockers). We ignore the extremes because we chose to, but they are as valid as our own stances. I think we are entering a stalemate, both of us know where the line is drawn. I So, since there is an infinite amount of opinion on this topic, and there is an infinite spectrum of morality as it is subjective, and is not possible to say anyone is correct because we can never know for sure there is no real reason for any of us to change our mind, just accept that everyones opinion cannot be proven so we separate wrong and not correct so we enter a stalemate.

I believe personal responsibility is morally superior evidence for my argument. The argument always gets too close to "well its my choice" and stays that shallow of an argument. Your choice has consequence. That consequence deserves observation and evaluation. How does your choice effect the community around you? You may not be wrong, just not correct, but the consequences could still be net negative, if that is the case, maybe your choice is morally negligible but structurally detrimental to society.

I believe the discussion could go further if we discussed the consequences of our stances.This feels circular.Cenk was right about a lot of things that Ben Shapiro has now been proven to be wrong about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIAyudtNicY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2021First panel debate i ever saw with him. Black lives matter

https://youtu.be/_cUDl_LEtakMilo is not the face of conservative movement. He is the face of anti-pc movement at best.I'm a huge fan of Sam Harris' and I listen to his podcast all the time. With that being said, I'm really looking forward to hearing him and Shapiro having a discussion. I don't agree with Shapiro on everything but he's articulate, very intelligent and a really good arguer. Looking forward to sticking this on.Not a good showing by Ben.  I can't remember many questions he answered or points he addressed directly without changing the subject, which is a shame because I was really looking forward to this discussion.This is like watching your parents argue. Love them both so much..It was a great conversation.It was to be expected. This is Harris's expertise inside and out. I haven't heard much of Shapiro talk about free-will prior to this exchange but from what he offered it was underwhelming compared to his usual standard of discourse.From my understanding of Shapiro's explanation here, if the Torah was lost, the "7 basic commandments of Judaism", 7 fundamental truths about of the moral universe pre-installed by God, would always be revealed again? Ben seems to insinuate that such a re-revealed religion wouldn't necessarily have to look too much like Judaism (which he states here is "not particularly exclusive") as long as it has these 7 commandments central to it. 

I'll grant that there might be a number of incidental physics-like moral principles which, when put into practice by this particular species of ape on this particular planet, optimizes their lives, but I still don't see how this makes any headway on the argument that there is an intelligence behind it. 

If such moral truths do exist, based on the violence associated with human history, it seems more likely that each human culture stumbles into pieces of morality, and through the hard slog of history, combines them and makes the world better. I seems way more likely that moral truth occurs through cultural R&amp;D, not revelation.Ben would wipe the floor with this guyRosie lost her mind a while ago. I don't know much about her except for the she's somewhat of a leftist. That alone scares me if she would become president.I feel like there's a lot of news out there that he doesn't touch on and I would love to hear his opinion on them. Plus I listen to his podcast at work and 45 to 50 minutes is not enough.I agree, I also notice that other shows like Hannity can do 3-4 hoursExactly I know he can do it we need to talk him into itTrue I know and he's growing, I just hope he gets there one dayIn short I want more BenI'd also like for it to be done a little later in the day. Sometimes news breaks the podcast can't address it because it's done relatively early. Regardless, I'll always take more ben shapiro knowledge bombs!I've noticed that too. Like the whole Bannon leaving Breitbart thing yesterday. I have to admit I got kind of lost in this conversation. Having to re-watch it a couple of times to see if I can keep upOprah ran around with the same Hollywood elite that she was protesting against at the GG. 
If she runs she will get hammered.Really looking forward to his take on that. I imagine he will be laughing and calling Bannon a "garbage human being" quite a bit hahaShe is weird.*This list is a mess, but I'm posting it anyway and will organize it steadily.*

**Did I miss something?** Comment with the episode number and timestamp, link to the tweet, video, post, etc.All I know about her is that she has a sort of "rags to riches" story going for her: she grew up poor but found a name for herself and is now worth billions.

Not sure if she'd make a good president.Nah. Seems like they already increased from 40 to 50/an hour. Any more is too much. 

Ben does a lot more than just the show. He keeps up on the news, he writes, does research for the writing. And we're talking both books and articles. He has kids/family. I imagine he tries to be home for dinner. He manages his company. 

Instead of wanting more Shapiro, why not listen to Knowles or Klavan.

I don't really like Knowles too much, but I like Klavan a lot. [mp4 link](https://i.giphy.com/3o6nUUfQOQ2KZ0OQww.mp4)

*Beep, I'm a bot.* [FAQ](https://np.reddit.com/r/anti_gif_bot/wiki/index) | [author](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=MrWasdennnoch) | [source](https://github.com/wasdennnoch/reddit-anti-gif-bot) | v1.1.2He commonly states that he doesn't believe empathy makes for good public policy, specifically when referring to Jimmy Kimmel's pathetic attempts at using his kids to push the universal health care agenda. Since he is usually talking about his political beliefs in these videos maybe that is why he doesn't seem particularly empathetic.  However, on his podcast he tends to seem more "human" I guess you could say. It's clear how much his family means to him.  I totally see where you're coming from and I'm a big fan of his but that's just my two centsHe is a quintessential constitutional conservative, I think that makes him come across as uncaring or unemphatic to some individuals or groups, not because he doesn't care but because he is an idealist, he would rather espouse what he believes is right than let empathy dictate what he believes.

He also believes in hard data, an emotional argument that isn't backed by data is not an argument at all. 

PragerU has a good video on what differentiates the left and the right. It boils it down (maybe oversimplifies) to the left want policies that feel good whereas the right want policies that do good. 

As for his arguments against abortion, while its true he is quite religious, none of his arguments against abortion are based on religion. They are based on facts and logic.

I would recommend his recent appearance on the Rubin report where he has a cordial discussion with a moderate liberal (Dave Rubin) on a wide variety of topics.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9IwamztdqA
I'll check that out, thanks. As u/Chodan9 stated: "He believes in hard data. An emotional argument that isn't backed by data is not an argument at all" 

That says it right there. It's not that he doesn't care, it's that emotion should never be the only reason to hold a position. 

He is also very well educated, extremely smart, and knows how to debate. He's a Master Debator!! He will tell you himself that to win a debate, you have to frame opponent as the enemy, and expose the worst part of them. Basically, he can be quite personally insulting, in a deliberate way, to get you to stumble.

I like his lectures, and most of his YouTube videos. I cannot stand his radio show or many of his podcasts, as he sounds like Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity, and other conservative pundits - an insulting crazy right winger. His apparent hatred for Democrats and constant name calling is excessive I think. Then again, I'm getting there myself these days with all these regressive leftists invading the party. I think he's too smart for that. But then again, he is in media, not politics or academia, so I suppose this is to be expected. Got to get those ratings and exposure. Being controversial but still speaking to your conservative base does that for you. And he does sometimes use some mental gymastics to justify his objective positions as a libertarian (his position on gay marriage comes to mind). 

As a person, I have no idea. His public persona is all we know, which is very well calculated. From wearing his
Yamika all the time to the tone he uses when he speaks is all intentended for maximum effect. He does seem pretty genuine and consistent though.

He is definitely a worthy warrior in the effort against tyrrany from both the alt right and alt left, and is a voice for reason and tolerance. That's ultimately what I like about him. Good reply. 

"I cannot stand his radio show or many of his podcasts, as he sounds like Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity, and other conservative pundits - an insulting crazy right winger."

His Facebook page is a bit cringe as there seems to be so many uploaded articles with silly titles but I heard it's not *actually* him that controls the page so it's not too bad I guess. Lmao i love BenBy my estimation you'll be conservative with in about a year if you keep watching himHaha sometimes I forget that I'm actually quite liberally-minded because I hate most (modern) liberals and find conservatives a lot more palatable (at least the ones I follow on YouTube)Going back and listening to it, he explains the nuance pretty well. He didn't want the economy to do poorly, which it supposedly would due to Obama's policies (and it certainly was not doing as well as it is now), so he wanted those to fail, which you could say is wanting Obama to fail because they are his policies. Then, he says that it is different from Democrats wanting Trump to fail because the economy is doing well under his policies. Time on video where he explains is 6:30-7:15ishHe has a long way to come still.Hey, just starting out on youtube. I attend university in Canada and needed an outlet to keep me engaged and critical about the various craziness that goes unaddressed on Campuses. Just starting out, any feedback, as brutally honest as possible, is going to help me make better content in the future!Shes a hot weirdoLol so trueProf used Selfies as "data" to prove systemic sexism. Thoughts?https://youtu.be/NFGLU2bxJGE

Youtube linkLooks like WHO is pushing for it. I remember Ben talking about it too in the podcast a long time ago.

A common related argument is: “homosexuality was considered a mental illness too”

This isn’t even close to a coherent strawman. This is the conflation of sexual orientation and gender. A correlation that is probably born of the same notion that gay men commonly come across as effeminate.

I’d argue that preferring a same sex partner is very different to the desire to remove one’s reproductive organs.

Also, a condition effecting 0.7% of a population is considered an anomaly. How and why we should begin to consider something that falls outside the bellcurb of normalcy a triviality, should be carefully considered before it becomes dictum.

The world is going mad in pursuit of political correctness.I'm not sure what he said exactly, but that sentiment is offbase. The DSM V was a recent revision to a psychological diagnosis manual that's considered mainstream for the United States. That's probably what he's referring to.

The DSM IV was an extremely comprehensive document - by the end of its lifespan, overly so.  By a lot of measurements, 20-35% of the population was "mentally ill" per their standards.   In addition to updating disorders to reflect the latest research (Asbergers was eliminated in favor of "autism spectrum disorder" to recognize that it's all related) it also refocused the disorder on things that cause substantial harm.  Disorders must cause persistent distress or dysfunction in a person's life as an innate result of having the disorder. 

For instance, suppose there's someone who is sexually attracted to feet, or is aroused by being whipped.  In the DSM IV they might be classified as having a paraphilia.  In the DSM V, if the attraction is causing them no distress or dysfunction in their relationships, ability to function within society, or negative impact to others, it's not a disorder.  

The DSM V's criteria for gender dysphoria includes that it is causing significant distress.  This means that it's not permanent - if the disorder is no longer causing significant distress (probably due to proper treatment) then it's no longer a condition.

Further there's a general question if being transgender belongs under mental disorders, or if it's more akin to epilepsy. [There's strong indicators of a biological basis](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/) including brain differences and twin studies.  Since that is the case, if the primary treatment is physical and the causes are physical then there isn't much reason to classify it as a mental illness.Do you see a study with 24 people as a strongi ndicator in a biological basis?   Also, the study has no control group anddid not include any cis gender people who identify as the gender they were assigned at birth. 

&gt; Male-to-female subjects tended to have thinner cortical regions in the right hemisphere, which is characteristic of a female brain. (Such differences became more pronounced after treatment.)

Thinner than what?

The second sudy referenced is more intriguing to me but again they do not use a control group of subjects without gender dysphoria to compare against.  There is no link to the study or else I'd dig down to try to understand it better.

The final study listed regarding response to a clicking sound reads as hocus pocus to me and doesnt even mention a sample size.&gt;Do you see a study with 24 people as a strongi ndicator in a biological basis? Also, the study has no control group anddid not include any cis gender people who identify as the gender they were assigned at birth.

You know, I see this fetish with sample size a lot on Reddit, and it's very off-base.  Sample size is very important when you're dealing with polling parts of the general population to try and draw statistical conclusions.  For instance, if one person says "I'm voting for Ralph Nader" I wouldn't expect 100% voter turnout to say Nader.  

It's startlingly less useful elsewhere.  If you knock one glass off the table and instead of falling to the floor it floats to the ceiling and sticks there, you've found something weird.  If it happens 0.14% of the time, it doesn't mean "it's statistically insignificant" it means that we don't understand gravity.  Very few sciences rely on the sort of numbers that social polls pull, because most sciences are trying to do something other than draw inferences about people's voting preferences and favorite colors.  

The correct question to ask is "p-value" regarding these things, and if the p-value says that it's incredibly unlikely that 24 people randomly happened to be outliers, then that's very significant.  

As for the control group, it's a trait that's been measured before.  You're measuring versus known information. It's like you don't have to find the material properties of water before you do an experiment to compare the material properties of some substance you're examining to water.  You know it's 1g/ml at 4C, you don't need to get out a scale and a volume measure to verify.

&gt;The second sudy referenced is more intriguing to me but again they do not use a control group of subjects without gender dysphoria to compare against. There is no link to the study or else I'd dig down to try to understand it better.

Again, control groups are ONLY used when comparing the effects of  a drug versus a placebo.  They're not appropriate for most experiments.  Nor are double blinds, etc.  I have seen people suggesting a double blind on finding the properties of a material, something which couldn't care less what the observer thinks of it.  no solid points in my opinion from destiny.Until, he said Concentration camps, I thought he was just another, idiot, but this guy's just a prickA current campaign happening on my own campus to tear down the statue based on charges that I found contradictory evidence to in my own research and in a conversation with an informed prof.

https://youtu.be/PbNYOyPRpggThis one is a little long, and it's  not really a debate as they both have many of the same views, but it shows his intelligence and beliefs. But I like it because it's not controversial. 

https://youtu.be/kteHW6t4G0gWow, this person is able to take reason, and completely flip it on its head. Disgusting. This is the best one of all time

https://youtu.be/PI5LeFo1EJUWhat do you mean? I thought he defended his points rather well, and he cited Shapiro's own words every time he criticized them. He showed that Shapiro's "reason" is mostly superficial at best.Lol ya no. As someone who has listened to everything by Ben i can assure you this is a poor hit piece. It seems rather successful, based on all the specific points he raises. 

I used to like Ben Shapiro even if I didn’t usually agree with him, but now that I see what kind of empty debate tactics he uses, I am no longer fascinated by him and instead am fascinated with those who still find his method of argument fascinating.

Do you have anything specific in the article you take issue with?Well, I'm convinced. I've heard him say that he defines leftists and liberals differently. He was basically saying that you can work with liberals on some issues and some of them will have common sense in some areas - but when it comes to leftists they do not allow for compromise and are more commonly for using the state to get their way, basically antifa tactics and that type of political promotion. I think it was Winston Churchill that once said "the fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists". Yeah, the issue I have is it doesn't defend any points. The whole piece is identity politics at its worst. It's just a long piece that calls him a racist because he isn't "Checking his privilege". It's the exact garbage he, and most people against the hardcore left, are fighting against. Well-argued.When he makes a lot of statements, he says  "the left", more than liberals. I do think there is a distinction between liberals who support constitutional rights, including guns and freedom of speech, also "hate speech" if there ever was such a thing, and people on "the left", who seem to be more of status quo, Clinton democrats who actually are hypocrites to the highest level, supporting a man who was credibly accused of rape, tried to use political and governmental faculties to destroy Monica's credibility and defamed her, destroying her life, not to mention the other women who I believe, like Broadrick and Flowers, just awful awful things. And many people do not ever want those facts discussed, when they are facts.Error has occurred? 

Anyways I hope Ben realizes that this “crash” isn’t a big deal at all.Stocks on sale!!!!Thank you Ben!! You’re so brave to give assholes a voice like this!!
/sIf I recall correctly I believe Ben says that this is what the social fabric of religious societies are for. Not government. I believe he said the first you go to your family for help then your neighbors then your church or social institution. But I too would be intrigued to hear if there was ever a line in which the government had an obligation to step in. If it's for the safety of children I do believe I recall him saying that the government could step in.Yeah I've seen that argument too which makes sense, but I feel (and maybe it's my stupid liberal tendencies) that there is an area where there are toxic values perpetually passed from generation to generation in a way where safety isn't of concern. While there are definitely individuals who can overcome this situation how can you expect the majority to overcome them if they are essentially brainwashed from the start? I'd be interested on what he thinks the best way to break this cycle is and if external intervention is required.I understand what you're saying there are certain cultures in our society that tend to absolve themselves from accountability for their actions. Instead blaming society as a whole, when it is their community that perpetuates the ongoing misfortune. I truly believe rebuilding the social fabric in that community and preaching conservative values is the best path forward and to avoid stepping on anyone's civil liberties.

Edit: Grammar Helping disadvantage individual is should be the government responsibility as they had the fund, mean and duty to fulfill it goal without bias. Social fabric or religious society are like counting on the mercy of individual. My analogy for this is an empty parking lot, the government are those white line that keep EVERYONE park accordingly. Sure there will always be an asshole that will double park, but at least we aren't naively hoping unselfish human know how to park with out the line. I get where you're coming from, but my argument/belief is that its not the government's job to enable people with assistance. It's not what the founding fathers wanted. However i do see the need for government assistance when dealing with mental health as there is externalities that go beyond the individual involved. What our founding father wanted is irrelevant. Environment, culture changed, human involve, different time, different people of knowledge. Government aids on social issue is a way to help, prevent, or as insurance to a larger population that these small group of disadvantaged won't be a burden to us all. It also reflect how we, as a society treated other. Base on Ben or JBP idea that there's no unity among human. Its divisive in a 100 years from now. That we prefer privately individual or group to care for each other without bias? I rather bet on the layout, the system that majority of us voted for, to care without looking at our skin color, religion or our belief.I definitely agree on trying to rebuild the social fabric in the community but am hesitant to believe that preaching conservative values will do anything but fall on deaf ears....I was a starving grad student for most of my 20s and have since progressed in my career and become financially secure. It is that financial security that has allowed me to re-evaluate my own ideas and opinions. 

I was essentially doing what I loved and getting paid peanuts and while there was a huge potential there it was hard to see at the time and it would seem patronizing for someone to preach conservative values. I can't imagine what it would be like if instead I was making peanuts at a dead end job that I hated and didn't have the opportunities that I was fortunate to have. How do you make conservative values resonate with a crowd like that?The way I'm thinking about this is a figurative version of "get your house in order." Some people are already born with a figurative plot of land, some are born with a foundation on that plot, and some at the top are already born with a mansion. However some at the bottom are born almost ready to drown in the middle of the ocean. I'm not advocating for leveling the playing field so that those starting in the ocean start the same as those with mansions, but there needs to be at least some level of assistance for those that start in the ocean to at least get them to shore so that they can find a plot of land themselves.Sounds like Jane Leavy - but every search directs me to a sports writer. I'd like to know so please update if you find out.Well, remember, Ben is also a conservative, religious, and not poor (never was). Im not being judgemental, just saying he comes from a certain backround and set of experiences, so he sees things in a different light. 

He believes that social institutions like churches and charities should help people bridge these gaps where they exist. It doesn't take into account children raised in non religious, non church going families, who don't belong to any social fabric outside their family and friends. So their span of influence it very narrow. As is their opportunity to be influenced. He sees this lack of social structure THE problem. 

It takes a village to raise a child, Right? Ben agrees. The thing is, he doesn't see the "government" as an extension of this village the same way he sees a church as an extension of this village. I think this is his failing. 

I do understand why though. It's because the government collects taxes through force, as where you CHOOSE to give to a church or charity. His argument isn't that government shouldn't help, it's that the government shouldn't take MY $ by FORCE and give it to someone who THEY deem worthy (who chooses who gets what, and by what measure, and how much, etc). 

Also, smaller institutions like churches and charities are local, small, and can look at each individual case and help accordingly. Maybe they really don't need $, just an opportunity. Maybe they need help with education, or finding a job, or making ends meet this week due to medical bills, or food, etc. Government can't do that, it's too large and impersonal, so they place arbitrary lines based on certain parameters to decide who gets aid and who doesn't, so it's completely devoid of any accountability. 

Basically, if people were better people and took personal responsibility for their lives, not so many would need the additional help. We could all help each other out. The problem is that it doesn't work in reality. People by and large are selfish. Add to the fact that asking for help makes you appear weak and people won't admit that their kids are failing school, that their parents are pieces of shit, that they are going hungry, that they need help. They just want someone to understand and "know" how bad it is, without me having to explain it to you. 

But Ben is right to some degree. Our sense of "community" is all but gone, and we rely on our government to fill that gap. I don't think that's a bad thing as long as people are involved. Ben does, because people are largely not involved and that lets the government do what they want with the $ they take from you in taxes. 

Tl;dr   He doesn't think everyone is fully capable of forging life on their own through personal responsibility. Everyone needs help once in a while. Some more than others. But the government shouldn't be the ones to help, the "community" should, whatever you want to call it (church, charity, etc). 

That's how I see it anyways.I think this is the fundamental gap that separates a lot of liberal and conservative ideology in that it appears to me that conservatives are arguing for the status quo in which the community and local institutions are the safety nets for individuals born into disadvantaged situations. Ultimately failures of these institutions and parents that are either too proud or too dumb to ask for help result in a perpetual cycle in which their children do not have the same freedom of opportunity as more well off individuals.

I can understand the argument that government is too big and potentially detached to actually take our money and actually fix the problem. Essentially it seems as if the liberal position at least gives you warm and fuzzies that paying extra in taxes will help to solve this issue and protect yourself if you should fall into tough times as naive as that may be.  The conservative position just seems to argue for practices that are already in place and failing.Yeppers. The main point here is that both arguments are valid. So where do we go from here? Because we see the problems, but no one has a proper solution. It's a complicated issue. There is no magic bullet. 

But you kinda missed Ben's main argument: that with the government doing it, there is no "choice" involved. Ben is against most taxes in general, so taking tax $ and giving it to people someone else chooses is akin to stealing. Too much like wealth redistribution. So the next logical step would be a Basic Income for all to make sure everyone has the same equality of opportunity. Thats really the only true solution of you want true equality of opportunity. Then that opens up even more issues. Yeah I get that there is no choice for the majority but the alternative comes at the expense of freedom of choice/opportunity for the disadvantaged.
I don't really get the argument for a basic income as you would assume that there would be too many freeloaders taking advantage. One of the reasons the idea for tax payer money funding public college/trade school tuition has resonated with me is that at least it removes a huge barrier for the disadvantaged to get an education and could even provide a path for changing careers for those in dying industries (manufacturing, coal etc.). In addition I think it helps to promote personal responsibility as disadvantaged individuals no longer have an excuse not to get an education when needed and ensures they still have to work to achieve success.Yeah I agree with you. And to be honest, I am actually in favor of a Basic Income. I just know that Ben and other conservatives are not. And that's for the same reasons. "Don't take MY money away and give it to someone else without my consent." They consider it stealing. I can see their point. I just disagree with them. And back to your original question, Ben doesn't have a solution for those that have little opportunity. 

A basic income would be great! But it's working out the kinks and getting more people (like Ben) on board with it. For example, how much do you give? Enough to carry basic needs, but small enough to incentivize innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as social contribution (shelves need to be stocked, trash needs to be picked up, nurses needed, teachers, ect). At what age does it start? 

I don't think most people will just be freeloaders. H
People need a reason to exist. They need responsibility, otherwise there is no meaning. That's the truth. Some don't need meaning, but the vast majority do. So people will still contribute by And large. Those that want to live very modestly and have no responsibility, well good for them. 

I personally think it's time for a Basic Income. As we get closer to a post scarcity society in the US, and more labor jobs become automated, something will have to change. In the past stocking shelves could support a family of 4. Not anymore. So it is already changing. A basic income is a good start towards a future economy. And it relieves the lack of opportunity many live with. the video is unavailable This title is misleading as it signals that Ben was unaware of these particular facts and is at odds with Ann. Ben and Ann actually get along quite well. Makes me wonder if its a lame attempt to sew discord amongst the right. " Is there any point at which a person is born into such dismal circumstances that the whole personal responsibility argument breaks down?

YES FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK.Yep. And I'm tired of seeing this show up in so many places on my feed, titled in similar ways...like YouTube clickbait. Sheesh. Why add Milo in this? Ben would not approve. I would point out that Kimmel didn't say 'late night host', he said 'talk show host'.

Who is the REAL most successful talk show host of the last generation?

Rush Frickin' Limbaugh. laughed way too hard at that. Haha thanks dude. I have another one on my channel I did with Louis CK if you want to check it out. Lol peace.Its tough to watch.... Love BenWhy did you open a brand new account to post these few shitty vids? This sjw shits so weird. When blade came out things were better between the races. Blade was awesome. But now we have segregated movie theaters? Hell in a hand basket. It's supposed to be a joke. An experiment, because I was curious to see if people found it funny. It's either they do or they hate it. According to you 2 hahahaIt's totally a joke. Not to be taken seriously. Same with the other.He's making such a big deal about something he could just ignore.

Sorry Ben, but blacks don't care about your feelings., can you give an example? I second this...
I feel as though Walsh and Ben see eye to eye fairly often.Sure. The yoga article is what I'd consider the silliest from Walsh. I like some of what Walsh writes, his pieces on education and raising kids shine brightly. 

My problem with Knowles is that he's just so much less eloquent than Klavan or Ben, and it shows. He's also behind the native american video, something Ben's made clear he wouldn't have ever published.

Maybe this is the millenial conservative in me identifying more with Ben's take on things. But even if Ben agrees with them, he's much more careful with his diction and I rarely find his writing style off-putting. I do wonder how many Americans dislike the media now. I understand that there are poles out there, however I don't trust the polls because they are easily influenced by biased variables. I've seen polls taken by 500 people that said Trump would not win 90% to 10% we saw how that played out. Also I'd like to see the ratings statistics. I truly hope that the mainstream media is taking a huge economic hit from all the b******* they spew.

Edit, voice to text doesn't save time when you have to edit for grammar. Ben Shapiro is by far the most delusional, egotistical political commentator I've ever seen. So a shooting at a school isn't a "school shooting" unless someone dies????I thought this segment was kinda funny he's being a bit sarcastic here but it definitely pushed people's buttons. There's a video that a black liberal 'news' channel made about this that is going viral on facebook.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbzghvJqrzMIt is too soon after the shooting to talk about actions. But not too soon to attack liberals and grieving survivors. Crowder said it best.  Conservatives are forced to respond because of the immediacy of the left's grandstanding.And of course if there is any terrorist act we have to respond right away. Right?
Absolutely not. Like with all tragedies we should morn the victims.  I hate grandstanding on any side of the aisle.  We can debate ideas later.She needs to shut up and look pretty on cameraYeah. Guns aren't the problem. We've had guns as long as we've had a country. This epidemic is about 20 years old (Columnine was 1999).  There's a bigger deeper issue here causing this. The media contagion effect is part of it. But not all of it. But no one wants to talk about that. They want easy buzzword solutions for complicated issues...no one gives a shit about thisr/titlegoreThis is child abuse!When did he mention it? This is why I don’t like commenting without all the information, I had no idea there were 4 deputies just chilling outside, ascarred to go inside. His Ben impression was good, but the spacey act was even better.This was easily the best part of the talk not going to lie, i was expecting more shots from him jabbing fun at this guy for dating a lefty...

Good on him for actually giving some damn good advice even on a 'fun' topic where it is easy to get distracted with the other points. 

His view on a lasting marriage is 100% true, and if your in it for a LASTING marriage where raising children is involved, then he is 100% accurate that values matter above all else... You can't be teammates and raise children if you cant agree on the basics of what your kids should understand.[I think NOT](https://media1.tenor.com/images/1bc989dccd20dfede42c4cf8697862e0/tenor.gif?itemid=5757189)The room was completely full when it started. I don’t think they would let the protesters in to scream at Ben unless they had room, otherwise less fans would have been able to get in I mean Ben made fun of him a little but. But he lets people do what they want, and he is happy to give people advice without being a jerk about it I think this may have been in part due to the event being moved off the main campus. This made it less likely for dissenters to come to the speech.That townhall was a disgrace. Jake Tapper knew it. Thats why he grilled the Sheriff later imo. I feel prison is too good a place for Hillary Quality contentHeard she's smoking hot too You're missing the simple fact that pee is stored in the balls good sirI actually I think his eyes are very attractive She didn't get "owned" because of her impression, she got owned because of her ideology. BUT, we've had humans since the dawn of man. huh huuuuh see the connection.....WE MUST BAN ALL HUMANS.


PS not an alienwhy do caps have to be used in these titles like this? just cheapens the presentationit amplifies the message.....To shreds, you say?Conservative and SJW are contradictoryLove Ben but these ridiculous titles got to go. You shouldn't post these videos there clickbait crap. Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro both agree on Free SpeechDoes anyone else have trouble playing these videos? I always have playback issues and am not sure if it’s my browser 🤷🏻‍♀️That's pretty nice of him. Are these posted by bots? Seems this sub is spammed with crappy click bait titles, filled with over capitalisation and grammatical errors. Ben hates Milo....Would he still do episodes from the oval office :hmm:What a bitch thoBy getting him elected president. Unfortunately society today would view us as the new t_d, but they hate truth and logic these days anyway.I think a way to start is to get rid of all the crappy clickbaity videos like “Ben Shapiro destroys liberal snowflake!!!” They make the sub seem really unprofessional and detract away from the political understanding Ben has and makes it seem like a cheap way of just scoring points. Agreed. Focus on Ben himself not the dumb "destroying" videos that are posted by YouTuber's that are making money off Ben's back. Feature links to statistics and books that Ben uses.these titles are literally cringe - but they clearly are click bait titles. When that man coughs it's a masterpieceWhy is ben wiping the floor "for" Katy Perry? Is he talking to Jon Snow? Ben Shapiro - The Hero - 2020! :)It's the only content being submitted at the moment. Shall we recruit mods to help submit and slightly editorialize titles so they're not so clickbaity/cringy? I'm open to suggestions.  
  
Maybe we can reward people for crossposting to other subreddits. I'm open to suggestions.I think that would be better. Many of the videos aren’t the worst but the titles alone make me not want to click them. 

I think crossposting could work too. Maybe a podcast discussion thread after every episode? Or that may be too spammy. Good idea, maybe I can get the auto-moderator to add it after each episode. Will look into it.##r/politics

[^(Ignore Sub)](https://np.reddit.com/r/ClickableLinkBot/comments/853qg2/ignore_list/)Reddit is a very liberal and left-wing oriented media, and that is why r/The_Donald is such a popular and controversial subreddit. R/politics is extremely anti-Trump, and don't expect any conservative to argue an issue on this subreddit, it would simply be a waste of time.  

I'm not Pro-Trump myself, but I understand that this subreddit is one of the only place on the internet in which you can have conservative views and not get shutdown. This alongside r/conservative are pretty much the only places in reddit in which conservatives can feel at home. Probably because the "pro-trump" article you linked refers to the dossier as a "hoax" in the title, which pretty much destroys the credibility of everything that's actually in the article. Nice try, though.I would love to add something to the discussion over at /r/Conservative but they banned me for some reason. I'd argue the same pattern could be observed on submissions like in this example. While r/politics is biased and downvotes just because of the source r/conservative wouldn't even allow a comparable submission in most cases.Katy’s floor is dirty.

Some would say...

He’s a master debater.I should not have called him at that timeBen and Milo have their disagreements and might straight up admit that they despise one another, but I have seen videos where they by and large agree on some key things. They have more in common than they do opposite, and if the situation called for it they'd certainly go team attack, trying to one-up each other in the process.I would try the recent episode where he talks about Aziz Ansari. I believe he talks about his views there.Cuz it works lol.

Also, he's explained that it's actually called "supply-side" economics, and the term "trickle-down" was coined by leftists attempting to smear the idea. It really does work, though. If you have reasons to think it doesn't, I'm happy to hear you out and try and explain the position to the best of my ability.The Bush tax cuts are the primary cause of our exploding national debt.Well, no, the primary cause of our exploding national debt is the broken system that is fiat currency.

[This is an absolutely fantastic video that shows exactly what I mean,](https://youtu.be/DyV0OfU3-FU) and it's a well-kept secret. Once you realize this, you'll see that the debt spiking has always directly correlated with the printing of money, which president Obama did the most of, causing the debt to rise the most in his terms. I really, really, really, hope you watch that video, because it's great. If you can find the time, it really will change how you see things.Video linked by /u/nathanweisser:

Case closed.Aren't all economies trickle down?Oh please... really? Ben can attack all kinds of people personally, but not Oliver huh. 99% of that broadcast about Pence was regarding his alt right views, especially Pence's history if espousing and trying to take rights &amp; freedoms gay people. Only at the end did he make some fun of the book a little. That was the comedy part of Oliver's show. His show is a comrdy/satire show on HBO. Not a "news" show like Ben's, not on Fox or MSNBC. He comes from The Daily Show on Comedy Central for goodness sake! 

My personal opinion of VP Pence aside (as a gay man, I find his views and policies regarding my life choices personally offensive, deplorable, and abhorrent - But it honestly is irrelevant here, just saying it as an honest disclosure), I do not believe Oliver crossed any line whatsoever. Look at other shows like South park or Family Guy. They are FAR more offensive on a regular basis. I am NOT prepared for a culture that is SO politically correct that we can't make fun of someone or their book. 

I like Ben Shapiro. I'm honestly a huge fan of his lectures and speeches. I defend him regularly to my ignorant leftist friends. But this kinda missed me off a little. He's as bad as Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh on his show sometimes, and I find it very ugly, disappointing, and a little disgusting. I don't typically watch his YouTube videos or listen to his radio show because when I do, I lose just a little more respect for him every time. I asked my econ teacher to explain the "trickle down" theory of economics.  He proceeded to tell me that no such thing existed, and that it was merely a straw man used by the left.

Of course, this is just proof of the ciswhiteheteropatriarchy that has taken over "sciences" like economics.This is out of context and was a single line of dialogue in a tweet exchange. I think the previous line was not all Arabs but hamas specifically or something. I keep waiting for the day somebody walks up for a book signature with Reasons to Vote for Democrats, just to get a reaction.Then get off this Sub, nobody cares Exactly, this dude typed a full on college essay This is a really interesting perspective.

But is it possible to have a title for the submission that's less inflammatory than "Ben Shapiro DESTROYS BLACK PEOPLE".

That's a pretty fucking intense way to phrase this.
Just my 2c. Cashier: would you like paper or plastic?

Ben Shapiro: plastic, please.

Cashier: alright. Have a good day, sir.

Ben Shapiro: you too, ma'am.

I know you think this was a gotcha, but it's not.He'd probably point out that it's wrong for Republicans and Democrats have a fairly poor track record. 

He also might mention this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdulrahman_al-Awlaki**Abdulrahman al-Awlaki**

Abdulrahman Anwar al-Awlaki (born al-Aulaqi; 26 August 1995 – 14 October 2011) was a 16-year-old American of Yemeni descent who was killed while eating dinner at an outdoor restaurant in Yemen by a drone airstrike ordered by U.S. President Barack Obama on 14 October 2011. Abdulrahman al-Awlaki's father, Anwar al-Awlaki, was an operational leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Anwar was killed by a CIA drone strike also ordered by President Barack Obama two weeks prior to the death of his son.

You want to point me to the part where Ben said "Republicans are always right", or even the part where he said "Republicans are right a majority of the time"? He's never said either. We all know a big chunk of Republicans are complete baffoons.&gt; who almost certainly statisticaly vote dem

[Or you could just look at the same poll](https://i.gyazo.com/2c7f2d033ca74629c93465743e4b5011.png)Im looking at a subsection. Please actually read my comment. &gt;As a gay man

Well as a liar, as a thief, as a drunkard, as a fornicator, etc.

Being a particular type of sinner doesn't give you an elevated perspective on an issue, sir.jew talk a lot, but why speed it up like stupid? And why use a preview of a pic that suggests a discussion that never has happened? Maybe Hitler was right.. kekspoiler - there's no mopping. Shaprio is stroking his disfigured bar mitzvah'd dick over nothing (yay, disgusting mythologies and their victims)John Oliver commits suicide over jewstapo clown's personal attacks :-(as dead as this sub is, I'd say you are spot on :-) .an upset christapo pig has entered the field.You bless me.How much are this is done out of boredom, or just a real lack of a purpose to benefit the world. Quite possibly be for Pure shock and attention who knows.This was the second panel I saw ben shapiro in. The first was against black lives matter. Both of these red pilled me. I wonder what happened in this person's life that they went "Yeah, this'll do."Your rhetoric here is completely lopsided. You presented a claim with little to no evidence to back it up, a man rebukes the claim with facts, and you resort to your ethos rather than using more facts to counter.His views are traditional. Wait until you’re married for many reasons, but one is because consensual sex can get legally tricky because the woman can claim it was not consensual and then it becomes a my word versus hers.He linked to a scammer who sells gold and silver.  If you think those are facts, you are a moron.What’s your opinion on investment in materials such as gold and silver? Ben's wife may be the doctor of the house, but he's a surgeon when he takes these statists apart.

I'm scared that he could never be elected in California due to their political demographics, though if he could *somehow* make it into a debate of any magnitude...  Ben would make a Tarantino movie look tame in the way he'd work his foes.well that's sorta the difference between the conservative and nationalist wings of the republican partyI see similarities between the twoHoly crap they kind of look alike thoughI don’t see it tbhIt's good that you post these links every day. But dude, you have to work on making better titles. When you TYPE LIKE THIS and use sensationalizing headlines it makes you sound like an angry grandpa on facebookagreed. it comes off as immatureIs Brad Pitt a closet conservative? I'm pretty sure he was agreeing with her rant.... not DESTROYING as the click bait title would imply.Okay dude remove this post this is clickbait b******* I watch this exact show and ben totally agreed with cardi BIs this account a bot? Why you post this old ass shit?This show is a cultural reach out to conservatives but undercuts virtually every conservative belief about social morality in almost every sense. 

[Ben Shapiro talks about it here](https://youtu.be/X87FI5j7P2M) Notice how even in this subreddit noone gives a flying fuckYou'd think "going haywire" would entail not casually sitting in the same spot and speaking in a polite, mild mannerThese fucking clickbait titles are so cringeyI love Ben Shapiro debates and interviewsWell for starters, the gap is not between "whites who do those 3 and blacks who do those 3." The study shows a sizable gap between income for black men from upper class families and white men from upper class families, but the same gap does not hold true for white women from upper class families and black women from upper class families. Black women from upper class families actually tend to make MORE than their white counterparts, suggesting that racism probably isn't the root cause,  as the NYT is claiming. If you want Ben's full analysis on this study, [here it is](https://www.dailywire.com/news/28473/nyt-claims-groundbreaking-new-study-shows-ben-shapiro)that's exactly the link i wanted, thank youClick baitGood thing he's an actor and can learn script, he just is not articulate.I guess network security is always an issue. As well has physical security staff having to be at multiple locations. You'd probably need more security. Ex: Let's say two security guards are needed to secure one senator. You could have the same two guys watching two different senators at the same location. If they're split apart, then you need four security guards to watch two senators.

I'm not saying it wouldn't work or be better than what we currently have but it's not without problems.Without in-person meetings, we'd never have great historical moments [like this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caning_of_Charles_Sumner)Non-Mobile link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caning_of_Charles_Sumner

The Caning of Charles Sumner, or the Brooks–Sumner Affair, occurred on May 22, 1856, in the United States Senate when Representative Preston Brooks (D-SC) attacked Senator Charles Sumner (R-MA), an abolitionist, with a walking cane in retaliation for a speech given by Sumner two days earlier in which he fiercely criticized slaveholders including a relative of Brooks. The beating nearly killed Sumner and it drew a sharply polarized response from the American public on the subject of the expansion of slavery in the United States. It has been considered symbolic of the "breakdown of reasoned discourse" that eventually led to the American Civil War.

^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28Why is every link from this sub that comes across my feed some terrible, cringy Buzzfeed headline?Not EPIC. Just another crappy compilation courtesy of 'Please Watch My Rehashed Vids'Not allowed to leave comments unless poster feels it promotes him. Douche
Another compilation. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOI love Ben but you people posting these stupid clickbait titled videos is getting on my nerves. You're doing Ben a huge inJustice by doing this. Stop it please r/FreedomstarsWhy is every fucking post in this sub CLICKBAIT OMG YOU WON'T BELEIEVE HOW HE REKD THEM :DDD:D:D:DDDDDDWhy is this subreddit poisoned with posts like this? If you guys need mods you should start recruiting. Jesus.You said it, man.Stop posting these stupid clickbait titled videos post the full episode where been casually talk about how David Hogg is immoral. This does Injustice 2 Ben making him seem like a provocateur when he has something actually good to say. It also takes intellectual property away from Ben and steals revenue. Very annoying practice. Should be banned.&gt; Social media are now playing a gatekeeper function they were not meant to play. Social media were supposed to be like your phone line. They're supposed to be a platform... When you pick up the phone and you call somebody, what is said over that phone line is not the responsibility of Verizon or AT&amp;T or sprint, it is the responsibility of the person on the phone. Facebook was supposed to be more like a phone line...

I believe he still claims to be against net neutrality though. Funny how he only seems to start caring about open access to information when it's his viewpoints that are targeted. Is this not complete lunacy? He's saying that's what they claimed to be. As Cruz pointed out, it is well within their rights as a publisher, but they have to declare it.Even being moderate left leaning,  I totally jive with what he says.  Really well put together guy.  I see that point and agree with it, but there's no reason the same shouldn't apply to the company that is moving your data. Same as a phone call, as he pointed out.
That's what the new thing is though. They can do whatever they want within reason,( they still have to answer to the FCC on some matters)  but they have to declare it to their customers if they do something like slow down certain sites. However, the idea of cutting back regulations isn't about slowing down stuff, but speeding up everything else. This is a way better title than the last couple you have posted. 👍WTF is this BS? College pamphlet? Okay...I laughed.This is an apple.

Now, if you'll hold my hand, I'll show you what an orange is.I'm not arguing about what's already been passed, but pointing out the contradictions in his arguments. His arguments apply perfectly if they were about ISPs, since those too are supposed to act like telephone lines.

Slowing down one type of website isn't a reasonable way to speed up everything else. That's akin to slowing down phone calls about pets to make the rest of the phone calls better. It's a joke maneIt's just funny that he thinks the guy who owns the wires you use should have more of a say on what goes through them than the people who run the media you're looking at.Seriously though why the fuck do people keep posting stupid titles for Bens videos. Clickbait But we aren't talking about slowing everyone else down. We're talking about speeding everything else up so that the other stuff is slower proportionally. 


Furthermore, you are taking his words out of context.We all know that "speeding everything else up so that the other stuff is slower" is exactly the same thing as slowing stuff down. 

Additionally, I'm not taking his words out of context, but pointing out that he takes standpoints that clearly contradict one another.

Another point, this all completely subverts his talking points about how people will just switch to a different company or service provider when that company wrongs them. Even on the internet, where everything else is just a few clicks away, people clearly need protection from what companies will do, beyond how he proposes that market forces will fix everything.Thats the point. I'm being sarcastic with the whole post. If we're talking about the first guy, then it's not quite an obliteration. How about, "Ben Shapiro gives a reasonable response to a good question."Whitehouse100 your post titles are annoying. Ben would not appreciate it. Stop. Now there is a proper title for a Ben Shapiro segment. 👍WTF did i just watch? This is a very poor title. Stop portraying Ben as a provocateur. Stupid title. Ben would not appreciate it. The people in the Ben Shapiro sub need too seriously stop posting misleading titles. Ben Shapiro did not expose the Iran deal. He merely commented on it.Exactly my point. I've always wanted to knwo about this. Please stop with the clickbait titles. It actually makes Ben seem like a provocateur rather than a person with a rational point to make. Exactly https://youtu.be/Nv1fdymsHuIGetting sick of the clickbait titlesTwo of the greatest men ive ever had the pleasure of listening too. Was this pic from a new special or something?That's right, thanks for the info.Lmao, ok ive been sick of the clickbait but this title made me laugh. Thanks. So how would you counter the numerous times he's directly stated that it's nonsense to cite to religion? He even points out the problems with jumping to the Bible or Torah for debateLmao, facts don't care about you bank account! Possibly the best quote ever... Though it was about sociology not economics. Extremist are extremist. Doesn't matter what political ile there on. We are all capable of evil. So fuckin glorious! In all fairness, we barely just started, and had 169 subscribers last night :)Just got tickets to see Jordan in june. So freaking stoked. They're conversations not debates, quit posting clickbait. Great point, so much in fact that I think it should be stickied for a while.   
  
The reason we allowed those videos initially (and you may still see the rare exception or two) is because the subreddit was new and people were generating content. It's really hard to be picky about quality when you had no quantity.  
  
Now that the subreddit is growing and there's more and more Shapiro fans posting/discussing, then the ratio of the higher-quality submissions compared to the 'Ben OBLITERATES x/y/z' type videos will increase.His doctor is a wife.Hey /u/delle_ali I really do appreciate you contributing to this subreddit but a lot of people are complaining about the titles, so unfortunately we'll have to remove this. Please feel free  to resubmit without editorialising the titles. You haven't presented a single reason why.He's not in the persuasion business. Ben defends Conservative values, you could argue that someone like Jordan Peterson is more apt for persuasion. Ben does what he does best.This is GOLD.When I started back in December, I just picked up with the one he recorded that day and got on the train so to speak. It's easy to pick up after a few days. I've found myself doing both-focusing in and out. For the most part, you do need to focus a bit, but I've found Ben comical and engaging enough that I want to focus and listen. Agreed, but I do get the sense he is trying to educate himself further about firearms and is willing to apologize when he gets facts wrong about guns. Here is Ben Shapiro commenting on Tommy Robinson during the podcast today. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l26wXavO054](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l26wXavO054)  I wish he was more nuanced on explaining who Tommy Robinson is, but he does an excellent job at explaining the absurdity of the reporting restrictions in the UK.  I am interested in seeing what the mainstream news narrative evolves into now that the reporting restrictions are lifted.... Not going to hold my breath that it will be accurate.Thanks, yea I heard it earlier today. I posted the clip above. No one can claim Ben is anything less than consistent in his philisophical/moral outlook.Ben apologized on Friday for categorizing Tommy Robinson as alt\-right.

[Ben on his podcast on Friday apologizing for calling Tommy Robinson alt\-right](https://youtu.be/hYxjqNR730Y?t=3041)

In this day and age, how rare is that?  His listeners definitely gave him an earful, glad he is listening. To be fair, in the first podcast he had not outright said he was alt-right, just that he had some alt-right views but it lacked any real nuance. I'm just glad he looked a little deeper into TR. He did outright condemned the media restrictions in the UK from the beginning.
In terms of standing up for our liberties in the US, I think it's one of those things that you can't really know how you would react until you experience it. I have to keep that in mind as I find myself writing off the UK as lost.Please don't editorialize titles, people don't like it.Please don't editorialize titles, people don't like it.Not to mention Pewds did a whole segment on Pogo, who's featured in Steven Crowder's show. Could be a total coincidence, but Louder with Crowder is the only reason I and everyone I know are aware Pogo's music exists.It's a much more complex issue than just that. I think that's partly why people, especially Ben, get it wrong. They think the issue is way more simple than it is and get rid of all standards for Israel.Agreed. I would be a fool to say that there aren't issues with Palestine but I would also be a fool to ignore Israel's transgressions as well.Never said it does. Nor do most 2 state advocates.Thanks for adding to the discussion. Lol your response isn't much better. What precisely don't you like about him? Anyone can slander someone without giving examples. Thank you for *trying* to clarify at least.Thank you. I'm assuming this is the consensus here then. I'm trying to figure out my own thoughts about Trump, so I've been looking for different sides opinions.

I actually think the Russia US connection is bogus. When I say that I don't mean that Russia didn't influence the election, I think that's indisputable at this point. I think Russia had an ulterior motive for that which is basically outlined in [this](https://youtu.be/y3qkf3bajd4?t=4101) video.Yeah the identity politics game the left is playing is worrisome to me as well. I'm glad the "liberals" aren't in charge that's for sure.Great analysis man. I agree he's been the source of a lot of division in the country. I think that was Russia's plan for getting him elected actually which is outlined [here](https://youtu.be/y3qkf3bajd4?t=4101). I don't think Shapiro would make for a bad president overall. He's honest which is what I love about him. Without knowing too much about his politics, my only criticism would be that he seems to be a bit too conservative. If he was a bit more progressive then I would like him a lot whereas now I just like him.I pretty much agree with you. I think he'll win one more term and then there will be a rubber band effect from the left.It's really just a feeling I have about some of his policies. For an example I wish he would advocate for prison reform. I think our prisons are pretty brutish. We spend a lot of money on prisons, and they don't help rehabilitate offenders. I believe in the death penalty, but it does pain me that it's possible some innocent people fall through the cracks. My views on prison are a bit more liberal though because I have a stupid cousin who's a career criminal lol. Overall like I said I really like him. I went to Isidewith to find some more issues I disagree with him on, but couldn't find any more in the short amount of time I spent going through his policies.Yes. I think it's certainly possible, if you're a follower of JP like I am then you must believe it's possible. Oh yeah, I agree on JP being Bens Secretary of State.Trump is going to sweep the nation in 2020. I think it'll be a bigger margin then it was in 2016. I agree with you that Bernie would've had a much better chance against Trump though. I think in 2024 there's no chance a Republican wins lol.I think that may be it I'll have to check it out! ThanksThis really isn't related to my question though Same. I felt like the father's day conversation was 60&amp;#37; ads/them joking about ads as well. Let down. I've examined the logic of 5 moral claims and tried to apply it the other way around. 

My point wasn't to support Palestinians as I've mentioned in the beginning (and is evident to anyone who actually attempted to read past the title) that you don't need be morally superior to kill your enemy, to the contrary giving away gifts to your enemies (as Rabin did in Oslo and Sharon did in Gaza and many many more) leading to casualties of your population is very immoral.

 It might be even immoral to the Palestinians themselves because perhaps if more aggression was used instead of "peace offers" it might lead them to surrender, by this ending the war and lowering the number of casualties on both sides.I don't understand. If you agree it's not a moral superiority issue, this leads in my logic to look for the fastest solution with least casualties, whatever is the best tactic.

However this cannot be pursued being constrained to the European "equal casualties" moral policy who's aim is to forever make the unequal equal by this never reaching an end leading to more casualties thus being less moral. Can you debunk this claim?

And by " palestinian agency isnt large enough to take advantage of such decisions" do you suggest that the ability to surrender is somehow depended on agency being not too big? Who told you this?You're not out of the loop, the same logic that disqualifies being openly transgender as "brave" should also disqualify Chris Pratt's moronic speech. Sure, I'm not saying he's not a very bright commentator, I just question the idea that he is some unbeatable force of conservative wit.  Sure, but many of the "professionals" he debates with never fully commit to the debate (Piers Morgan for example), or are simply professionals by title. There are hundreds of so called professionals that are pretty stupid. Its not that I disagree with him on everything, I just feel like most of his debates that are available for people to watch or listen to again are with people that are half informed of the topic or have some kind of underlying agenda as most talk show hosts do. I bring up Piers Morgan again because it just comes to mind easily, but Piers is a relatively smart guy, but you could easily tell that before the interview started some PR person told Piers to stick to certain talking points which ruined the whole debate.  True I forgot about that one you got me there. Yea for real 
The media/hollywood are accepting of transgenders but the general population are extremely mixed. I looked on the comments of the kaitlyn-jenner-coming-out videos and many people called her a disgusting diseased monster. She lost a shit tonne of supporters after coming out.

Plus where does it say that hollywood looks down upon religion? I don't know what reason they would even have for doing so, and I already looked online and nobody criticised his speech.As much as I agree with Shapiro on his stance on transgenderism, he seriously goes too far and gives no leeway to other opinions.

For example, is there evidence to show that encouraging transgenderism gets in the way of finding the so-called cure for the illness? Ben says the acceptance of it stops researchers from treating it like a disease, but that simply does not hold up. Research on the causes of transgenderism is still done every day and has not suddenly stopped since we started to accept transgender people.

Also, in my opinion, Ben offers no solution to the problem by saying they should just stay with their chosen gender. It's been shown countless times not to bloody work. Transgender people are distressed no matter WHAT decision they make, they're neither better nor worse when they make the decision to change genders, so let them do whatever the hell they want. Biological and social psychologists still carry out research on the causes behind transgenderism till this day, so Ben's argument does not hold up, and his solution does not hold up either.

Coming out is realistically brave because you're not encouraging mental illness. You feel terrible no matter what option you take. So if you feel the need to choose one over the other, and you get heavily criticised by a mass of people who refer to you as a gremlin, rationally speaking, you are a brave person.

If you disagree with that, you can at least agree that Chris Pratt's speech was not brave in the slightest. It was a very normal speech that received no criticism whatsoever and Ben's religious bias caused him to contradict himself.Sound's like Ben up until that third statementThanks! I wasn't aware of this until now.

My question is does this actually work in practice?  
For example - Does this apply to oil too? How come all the oil prices seem to be adjusted by the oil comglomerates, rather than let free market decide?  
Conversion is damaging because if I don't want to be converted, but still want to be helped, do religions offer that? Most don't. 

I agree we need charities and institutions that teach good moral values, but I don't agree that religion is the answer. What we need is secular organizations that welcome EVERYBODY, e.g. community centres, public libraries...

In fact, like i brought up earlier, majority of Jewish temples won't even let you past the DOOR if you're not a Jewish member. Jewish people are extremely close-off in their community, and they rarely, if ever, do community outreach that help other people not part of their own. Given that Ben himself is a Jew, I would hope he talk more about this close-minded attitude among the Jews, but thus far he hasn't.The guy on the right looks like an older version of Jessie EisenbergI thought the same thing. It really made me realize how spoiled I am by podcasts. What about that new video where he dressed as a judge and asked to be put in the supreme court?This is fuckin creepyIf the comparison is against Islam, for sure I agree with you hands down.

But i'm not sure if the whole free speech platform is a product of Judeo-Christian foundation.

For example - didn't the US founding fathers FLEE Europe due to Judeo-Christian theocracy?

I think the whole free speech is simply a byproduct as society advances. This is why we see free speech in other advanced non-Christian societies too - e.g. Japan, Taiwan, South Korea.What about the initial phase, where jobs that involve secretary-like position would be gone?

Would Ben still support UBI if it only affects \~25&amp;#37;-30&amp;#37; of  the jobs, which he himself may not be affected (yet)?But let's even just say self-driving cars - once they get perfected (e.g. within the next 10-15 years), you're talking about a replacement of tons of jobs right there - from truck drivers, to delivery folks, to bus drivers, to taxi, and to Uber and similar businesses!

That's A LOT of employees going out of job, no? 

And this is just one example.If by "true AI", you mean one that can pass Turin Test, yes we're probably still a few decades away from that.

But things like self-driving cars are coming, and will likely be perfected within the next 15-20 years (which is really soon if u think about it).

In fact, i read a report that says that the accidents per car from self-driving cars is actually LOWER than accidents per car from human-driven car. The reason self-driving cars have a bad rep is because when a machine makes a mistake, the media goes crazy. When a human crashes a car, it rarely makes the news because we assume it's normal for humans to make errors. But when a machine does it, we all go bananas, even tho the error rate may actually be lower than human error rate.Good points all around.

I agree people would have to adapt. But what would you say to a 50 year old truck driver? By age 50, he is too old to learn new skills, certainly not to the level where he can compete against the younger workforce. And he can't exactly retire by age 50 either, given the already low-pay for most of these delivery jobs.

Should he just...i don't know...go rot and die? 

or would you support some kind of universal salary for people like him? (aka socialist policy)Thanks for your reply!
I agree with you. I like your cautious approach of "lets look at the data first before jumping into welfare".I'm confused - do you want stats to show like cities in Vancouver are growing bigger and bigger year by year?"but I'm not seeing much evidence that quality of life has deteriorated"
=&gt; 
You need to look at a really big city to see the impact.
Take New York.
I'm not anti-people, but I don't want to live in a place surrounded by skyscrappers. 
There's a reason why I don't live in Manhatten New York City. I love to go to New York City as a TOURIST, but not as as resident.

Now...this is just my subjective feelings, but I wouldn't be surprised if most ppl feel the same way.
We humans did not evolve to live in skyscrappers.But as our populations continue to grow (not necessarily from local, but from abroad), don't you see this is a concern?
New York may be ok for now..but imagine when it gets TWICE as crowded. 
Think of the traffic jam that is already happening, and multiply that by 2X. 

I don't know if you have been to Asian cities like Beijing or Shanghai, but they are very unlivable. And i'm not talking about poor infrastructure. Hell no - Beijing has some of the best tech gadgets that would put most American cities to shame. But despite all the tech, they are still in the end very unlivable because of simply too many people.
(and if ur question is "why do ppl stay in Beijing then", the answer is simple: jobs. For most ppl, often we have to live where we work, but that doesn't mean we like where we live)Ouughh  ouch!The reason I don't agree with you is because I don't see that happening, or at least, not happening fast enough.
I invite you again to look at Asian cities, because Asian cities tend to be a lot bigger and crowder, representing a likely future of where North American cities are heading.
You claim that NYC won't get that crowded, but cities like Beijing and Tokyo easily are indeed twice as crowded as NYC.
And like i mentioned earlier - it's not something tech can solve. You don't think Tokyo has fancy tech? They do. Their transit system make NYC look like stone age! But is Tokyo livable? Not at all. You would have to pay me an extremely high salary to convince me to live there, a job where i can only work for 10 years and then retire.#1 I agree.
#2 Probably at first but take away the license for 'free murder with no consequence for bad choices' and things would change.
#3 This is true.
#4 False. The problem with adoption is the bureaucracy to adopt and not the number of willing parents. I know this is a bit anecdotal but I know at least a dozen couples who are waiting to adopt and have been waiting for over a year with no child in sight.
#5 Those of us who are true 'pro-lifers' would rather pay for "other people's damn kids" than see them murdered.

But the biggest problem with your argument is that you are okay with legalized murder ("I recognize abortion is essentially murder").

The basis for your argument is still one of economics and convenience and not moralistic. I would say yes you did perform 4 abortions, but I would be ok with it because the otherwise consequence is to have a high probability of down syndrome children (or worse), and IVF would be a dead technology.I disagree about adoption being difficult because of government regulations. Do you have data/evidence to prove that? Because last time i check, people in China or India aren't exactly eager to adopt orphans from USA. If anything, it's the other way around.

Also - yes it may be like eugenics, but u know what else is worse? Telling taxpayers that they have to pay for other ppl's damn kids because those other ppl don't practice safe sex. It's socialism to the extreme.I challenge on your #5 -&gt; how many pro-lifers are willing to pay for other ppl's kids?
If anything, i think pro-choicers are the ones willing to pay, since they are the ones voting for increased funding to social welfare programs.

Regarding your #4, do you have any literature on this?I agree, but UNTIL i see a better alternative, i am pro-choice.
If you have a system which doesn't force taxpayers to pay for those damn kids, i'm all ears.But for someone who is so strongly against socialism, doesn't that strike warning bells in your head?
Person Bob created a bunch of babies with pre-college women out of wedlock, and I'm the one stuck paying for his recklessness?Let me explain: it's like watching homeless die in the streets.
HUNDREDS of homeless die each MONTH in this country.
Is it murder to just watch them die, when there is money to help them? I would say yes. 
But then why do we let this happen? Because it is not economically sound to spend all our money on the homeless.
It's harsh truth of reality, just like abortion. Hey thanks for the link.
Let me challenge you on that further tho - let's assume the stats are true and there are 2 million couples waiting to adopt. Let's also assume each of them want 2 kids, so we're looking at a capacity to take care of 4 million babies.
Right now this country has around ~650,000 abortions each year. That means in a matter of 7 years, the capacity for adoptee parents would be filled. 
Even if you argue more people would come on board to adopt, that's still looking at best 10 years. 
10 years from now, you will still have a lot of babies being born and nobody is around to adopt. 

WHAT THEN?I argue that the pace of pop growth is not keeping up to the #of babies being popped out.
Again - i remind you that we have about 650,000 abortions per year. Do u really think we have enough people wanting to adopt to care for all those kids? COME ON!then make ur counter-argument. Don't just throw personal insults. 
In fact, isn't that Ben Shapiro's #1 debate rule? If u can show me where i'm wrong, then show it.No I did not. I addressed your point #1 and point #3. Your point #2 actually supports my views in the sense it highlights how adoption isn't the answer because most people won't even choose it (and then taxpayers end up paying).

And quit saying eugenics as if somehow that is the end all to all argument. 

That's not going to convince me. I'm looking for ECONOMIC argument, not some moral one. Convince me how we can solve the abortion issue WITHOUT relying on taxpayers.#5 That's a good question and source of ire for me personally. There are many on the Pro-Life side that are willing to scream for the life of the unborn but unwilling to do much more. This is a bit of a hypocrisy and/or weakness of the Pro-Life side (not in the argument, just the people). I don't claim to be a 'Mother Teresa' when it comes to helping others (born or unborn) but it's certainly something I can do more of.

Also, I think you're making some pretty big conclusions about Pro-choicers. While I would agree that people who vote Pro-Choice also tend to vote in more social welfare programs... abortion is not a social welfare program for the child. It's murder.

#4 As I said, my evidence is anecdotal. The couples that I know who are waiting on adoption all have their act together and would be great parents. Why some of them have been waiting for over a year is concerning to me. My assumption is that since the same people (the state) who run the DMV also coordinate adoption, it's not very streamlined. But hey... I could be wrong.Thanks for your directness!
I personally think social welfare isn't the solution. Throw a bunch of free money to irresponsible people, and what do u get? Those money don't end up being put to good use (stats: majority of kids growing up in welfare families don't even bother to apply to college), and the money only encourage irresponsible behavior (stats: a person who is poor and receiving welfare is more likely to pump out more children than a person who is poor but not on welfare).

This is why I'm for abortion. I don't see a viable alternative. Adoption is probably the closest bet, but there seems to be a lot of legal hurdles that need to be resolved before it can be viable at a nation-wide level.Let me summarize what I think we have talked about then (and then u can correct me if i get anything wrong):

You basically say: adoption can cover for the 650,000+ babies that would be born if abortion is illegal

I am saying: adoption can cover SOME of those 650,000+ babies, but not all. Even if you clean up the legal hurdles, I don't believe we have enough would-be parents wanting to adopt 650,000+ babies PER YEAR.

NOTE THE EMPHASIS ON "PER YEAR". It's 650,000 PER YEAR.I think ethically, life would begin at conception. Any subjective baseline like "first heart beat" or "first ability to sense pain" are just throwing subjective rules that don't really hold weight.
But unlike pro-lifers, i also include other factors into my consideration. Ethics is just one of the numerous facts to consider. Economy is another. Science is another. Like i said earlier, if we consider termination of any fertilized cells to be abortion, then IVF would be rendered useless, and I'm not willing to commit to that consequence.Thank you for listing your arguments, because now I can actually respond to them (rather than just trading insults, which imo, is a fucking waste of time).

Your primary argument is about adoption. I have a simple answer to that: GET BACK TO ME WHEN IT DOES WORK.
Currently, the adoption system doesn't work. America sees about 650,000 abortions every YEAR. Are there 650,000 parents-wanna-bes willing to adopt EVERY YEAR?

I don't think so.
But hey - i'm willing to change my mind when u can show me stats/data where adoption can indeed meet the quota!I think the counter-argument to your point is simply the same argument against socialism: if you take away my hard-earned money and use it on other people, why should I work hard then?
It's the same argument for why socialism doesn't work, and I don't need to repeat it because Ben Shapiro has already done it beautifully.Yes paying taxes is a fact of life, but to what degree, right?

Seeing 10&amp;#37; of your income being deducted for taxes is very different than 60&amp;#37;.

I personally would see no reason to work hard if my income is just going to feed other ppl's kids, rather than for the advancement of my own family.I'm confused by your analogy - because of course i'm going to see an increase in my taxes if we ban abortion. USA faces around 650,000 abortions each year, so if you ban abortion, we would need to pay for those 650,000 kids. So of course taxes would have to go up.

If somehow we can magically feed those 650,000 kids (per year) without increasing taxes, sure i'll be all abroad ur magical train, but as far as i'm aware, it's just magic, not real.Hilario- But first lets talk about policy Genius. You say that now, but i don't see actual action. Or at least, majority of you pro-lifers don't.
For example - who are the ones screaming for reduction in social welfare? Who's the ones screaming that "SOCIALISM" at any policy which involves taxing the rich and giving the money to the poor?In this case, yes. 
We're not talking about giving like $10 to a homeless hobo. 
Statistics show each kid, on average, costs around $250,000 to raise. And that's just putting them into college. The stats doesn't even include the cost of what would happen to them after college graduation, which often includes additional benefits as the kid struggles to afford all the living expenses with their initial job.
Furthermore, the stats also fail to account for the rising cost of living in many major cities, e.g. New York, San Francisco where even renting a 1-bedroom condo can cost more than $2000 per month.

So to be more realistic, we're estimating at around $300,000 PER KID.
Now multiply that by 650,000 would-be-aborted babies PER YEAR.

Do the math yourself.

So yes, we're talking about a SIGNIFICANT COST to the taxpayers.Then we should have a system where if you want to DONATE your money to the poor, you can go ahead.
Ban abortion all you want, i don't care. Just leave MY money out of it.
We shouldn't force people to give money to the poor like some kind of tax policy. It should be up to individual freedom, a donation.

I work hard for the benefits of MY CHILDREN, not the children of people whom I won't even meet in this lifetime.I disagree with your assessment of conservatives.
Plenty of conservatives certainly are against giving money to single moms to care for their newborns. Just look at the policies that conservatives support. It's not about removing free money to able-working people. We're talking about single moms with like 4 children who need money to care for their kids. If you truly care, you should support welfare for them. Yet conservatives don't (again, watch the news).
Even if you are not aligned with that, you cannot deny majority of conservatives do not agree with you on this.

And regarding your point #1, you are guilty by association. As long as you identify yourself as a conservative, you are guilty by the actions of the mainstream conservative. If you choose to call yourself an independent (like i do), then that's a different story.&gt; conservatives support groups and programs that serve the needs of children directly. 

In the context of single moms with 4 children, such as...? What alternative do u have to care for those 4 children?Yet conservatives support removing welfare to the poor, including single moms with multiple kids.
Clearly in their eyes, the lives of those children are not worth the tax money.I'm pointing out the hypocrisy among the conservatives.
If you think money shouldn't be an issue to help kids growing up in poor families (of whom majority are the ones that go through abortion), then you shouldn't be against welfare.
And don't  give me this bs of "welfare reform". You either give money to support single moms with multiple kids, or you don't. It's binary. 
To quote your own words - it's not rocket science. Either you are for or against it. "Reform" my ass.
Calling it "welfare reform" is just another way or saying "i'm not going to tell you if i'm for or against giving money to poor single moms, but i am going to say that the current system doesn't work".
SUUURE ok.Position A: kill baby while the baby is a fetus

Position B: let the baby grow up in a condition in which 99.999% of the time the person would end up in extreme poverty

Excuse me sir, but I don't see how one is better than the other. To me, both are equally bad.
And frankly, if you give me a choice, i would rather choose A. I would rather be aborted than grow up in a poor single mom where statistically speaking i'm more likely to end up in jail than any other life path.But if I work so hard to get to college, but then unable to find a good job because the good jobs are all taken by the wealthy 1%, then that's a problem, right?
Isn't the whole idea of Ben's argument is "if you work hard, go to college, then you will be rewarded"? What if that reward doesn't happen because the wealthy privilege overrides that?But imagine if you're someone who could have gotten into med school but because some rich kid took your spot and filled the school quota, you didn't make the admission.
Now obviously you wouldn't know that's the reason u didn't get in, but imagine this happened to u and somehow u found out that's the reason.

VERY UNFAIR, no?
I would be fucking PISSED.Ok bad example, my bad.
What about someone who is so rich from ancestral wealth that he doesn't even need to work. He just sits on his capital wealth, which as you and i both know, isn't taxed nearly at the same rate as the normal income tax. 

So I work hard 50+ hours a week only to pull in less than 1% of what some other person is pulling by simply collecting interest from his ancestral wealth. Is that really the best system we can come up with??

Doesn't this bother you at all?
I believe one of the core pillars in a stable society is a sense of FAIRNESS. If too many ppl feel the system is unfair, then they riot, and we don't want that.
"Of course, they're not obligated to do any of these things, but that's where our social fabric comes in (another one of Shapiro's key points that I strongly agree with). "

=&gt; could you elaborate on this? I'm not aware that I (as part of the common middle class folks) have power to tell the rich elites how they should spend their money.
If they want to spend their money buying a bunch of ocean yachts, rather than invest in companies and creating jobs...that's not my call, right? What can I do about it, as an individual?Ah I see, great points, i agree, thank you!I do - a stats show there are about 2 million couples willing to adopt at this point in time. 650,000 per year will easily filled that quota in about 3-4 years, even when you account for the new couples who express in interest to adopt.LOL are you seriously suggesting that we can have enough people wanting to adopt the 650,000+ babies EVERY YEAR???"You have yet to prove that outlawing abortion would result in 650,000 new babies being put up for adoption every year. "

=&gt; the 650,000 is the # of abortions happening per year, reported by CDC.
It is only logical to assume that by banning abortion, these same cases would become new babies.

Unless you are suggesting that the ban of abortion will somehow magically reduce the rate of reckless sexual practices that result in unintended pregnancies? cuz read a book, that doesn't happen.


"You have yet to prove that the number of perspective adoptive parents is not also a yearly rotational figure like the number of abortions."

=&gt; because the number of new people filing for adoption hasn't varied all that much from year to year. 
Go talk to someone working at this : https://www.americanadoptions.com/pregnant/waiting_adoptive_families
That's what I did. "You haven’t proven that every baby aborted would indeed by put up for adoption. That’s an assertion you’ve made without evidential backing. "

=&gt; as compared to what? Single moms leeching on welfare, which is precisely what I outlined in my original argument?

Or are you suggesting that some magical charity group would swoop in and save the day?&gt;  If the number of people seeking adoption has remained stead each year then that means they have a replacement rate. 

Yes they do, and we can calculate what that replacement rate is. The adoption website consistently cites '2 million' as a figure, and '5 year' as a typical adoption timeline.
That means we have about 400,000 newcomers each year.

400,000 versus 650,000...hmm.....we're short by 250,000. Hardly a small figure.

This goes back to my first reply to you: what's your solution for the remaining 250,000? Tax-funded welfare?Except in many cases, better degree or better grades don't translate to better pay jobs. Look at Bristol Palin. Dumb as shit, hypocritical as fuck, yet she gets paid so much for public speaking. Do u think she could have gotten to that position if her mom isn't a famous rich well-connected politician?

It sucks how our society is so heavily built around "who you know", rather than objective measures like test scores.

But...that's life i guess..Let's say they don't.
Let's say only half are put up for adoption.
What about the other 325,000? The parents would keep those kids. And then what? Stats show those parents mostly are single moms with no jobs living in poverty. Who will pay for those 325,000 kids? TAXPAYERS?? FUCK NO.I agree world isn't fair and socialism certainly isn't the answer.
I do wonder if we can set some regulations, such as increased taxes on ocean yachts and mansions.
If the goal is to encourage the rich to invest the wealth to companies to create more jobs, then we need regulations to penalize the rich who only spend their money buying up  real-estate and boats.I'm not suggesting eugenics.

I'm saying "do whatever the fuck you want, just leave my taxes out of it".
I don't care if abortion is legal or illegal. All i want is to see my taxes being put to other areas such as tech sector investment, and not going towards dumbass single moms who shouldn't be breeding in the first place.We don't have a public database about who the rich people are and how they are using their money, so no, I cannot answer your question.

However, do you at least agree with me that there is a problem IF rich people are somehow not investing their wealth to help create more jobs for the rest of the working class? Can we at least agree on that?Let me put it this way: I'm not the one having reckless sex. I'm not the one getting teenage girls pregnant. I'm not the one producing single moms.

So why am I, as taxpayer, being the one paying the bills? Why am I the one being PUNISHED?

Shouldn't the punishment falls on the people who are responsible for making those bad decisions?Help me on this one - i always hear news articles about rich people putting their money in offshore (e.g. Cayman) accounts. Is that bad, or good? If their money isn't in this country, does it mean they are investing in other countries' businesses?Ask his wife, she's a doctor.I agree with you but i think in practice, this often doesn't work. There simply aren't enough ppl out there willing to donate to the poor. Even in deeply religious cities with a church on every street corner, i still see a lot of poor people. Either the churches aren't doing their job, or they try but they lack resources.
And to be fair, i think majority of us aren't exactly keen to donate to random poor ppl either. Most of us are probably saving the money for our own relatives or ppl who we know in person.are you saying you would be glad to donate money to random single moms, rather than say...saving that money for your own kids, or for your aging parents, or for your siblings' children?That's true too. I wonder what Ben would have to say about this, and most importantly, how to fix it, if it's even possible.Fair enough.
I can't say i'm as generous as you are. Maybe that's because i find myself financially struggling to even provide college for my own kids. 

My rule of thumb is this: take care of your own before you take care of others. If i can't guarantee a good life for my own children, why should I donate to the kids of others? 

I'm guessing you're much more financially well-off than i am, so good for you. I hope if one day i become as rich as you, then i will find it in my heart to help out others.&gt; What worries me is that without first creating a relationship, helping immediate needs can hurt the person you're trying to help. 

What does this mean? Are you referring to the problems like welfare leeching?His Rage over Ariana Grande was a bit much, even for Ben.

Otherwise solid episode. For someone who basically speaks for a living, i'm surprised Ben hasn't seek out professional help to teach him to slow down.

If he ever wishes to run for public office, he really needs to learn to slow down.Yea but u can be smart without talking fast. Like Jordan Peterson.Do they actually disagree? I always view Peterson as just the Canadian version of Shapiro hahaI agree with you, but to be fair, i don't really see liberals attacking him for his height.

The more annoying things liberals do is called him by generic labels like "RACIST" or "ASSHOLE" or "NAZI". That's what piss me off, cuz it's just another way to reduce the entire group of people to one word.Question - why does the person have to be a conservative in order to be a mod? If he/she follows the mod rules, their personal political views shouldn't matter, right?If we restructure it to have less red tape, yes i agree!
I can't support it right now largely due to the red tapes, which adds to cost for taxpayers.

and yes, agree for illegals too.I am against it because I do not believe in giving the state the right to execute its citizens. That is not a power that I'm comfortable with giving to the government.

Rapists and child molesters should get life in prison or have the option to go free if they get castrated. But the castration would have to be voluntary to work with the 8th amendment.Interesting! Thanks for sharing, i have to think more about that..

From teh top of my head, for now I personally don't see much difference between a State that has the power to throw someone in jail for life, versus granting them the power to kill. 
Sorry for being off-topic here - i always wonder if we are actually achieving #2.

In order for #2 to succeed, the person needs to be able to have a sustainable job. But the way I see it, our system is setup such that if u have a criminal record, chances are u won't get a job. Even something as simple as a store cashier now has so many job applications that nobody would choose someone with a criminal background (as compared to an eager highschool grad who wants to work his/her way through college).

So again, sorry for off-topic, but i don't think we are achieving #2. Many criminals i know of end up becoming leechers of welfare system for life, never able to land a job.I figure it's because Ben produces his podcast five days a week. There's alot of prep and research hours per episode, so I imagine developing that one hour of content takes up a good amount of his day&gt;Gender and sex as words are interchangeable 

But it's not! 
A quick wiki shows gender and sex hold different meanings.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction

If you want to argue the definition is wrong, then that's a different topic, but i think majority of population has decided this is the way words are defined.yea specific wording changed here and there. Happens all the time with many wiki articles. The content has been around for a while tho.

And it's not just about the wiki, right? I think the whole distinction between gender versus sex has been around as early as the early 2000s. It actually amazed me Ben didn't seem to pick up on it.

Unless if Ben (and you) wish to argue that the definitions shouldn't be like that...which is a separate topic.If that is what he is doing, then yea i guess that makes sense.

Separate topic, if i may:
I do wonder where does basic civility comes into play.
For example - i am an atheist. I believe when Christians pray to God and worship Jesus Christ, they are being stupid and ridiculous. But I don't go around saying "hey, god doesn't exist, quit living in your delusions".

Ben said we shouldn't go along with the delusions of transgenders. But by that logic, why do we tolerate the delusions of religions? To me, calling transgender by their preferred pronoun is a sign of respect, like how i respect the Christians so that when they mention Jesus Christ to me, i keep a straight face and nod my head and go along with their beliefs. I don't say "your god is just an imaginary voice in your head" to their face.It did - https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gender

"Either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones. "

Note the last 4 words.

If you want to counter-argue that this is due to pressure from leftist movement, sure, we can talk about that if that is indeed your argument (and i might even agree with you to a certain degree), but either way, my point is this IS THE DEFINITION. It's IN THE FREAKING DICTIONARY. Since we're speaking English, we should try to use the definition as defined in the English dictionary, right??Please don't editorialize titlesIt's also cited in the online Oxford English dictionary, bro.But the distinction between gender and sex is cited in the Oxford English dictionary. I didn't make it up. Feel free to look it up.Having been through post-graduate training myself (i have a PhD in genetics), i totally agree with you. But at the same time, the wikipedia has its sources too, and I'm not here to write an academic paper. If you doubt what is written in the wiki, you can always check the primary sources and view them.  Or if you identify a crucial sentence in the wiki page which is not cited, you are free to point that out and counter me with it.

TL;DR = i find simply saying "because you cited wiki, therefore your argument is wrong" to be a lazy counter-argument that frankly doesn't tell me anything at all.The data i read right now shows it is more expensive to kill someone than to put them in jail for life. Surprising, eh? 

https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty

I think most ppl have commented that we need to make the process of capital punishment quicker, so the legal fees don't add up. That i think is a fair argument. But until it is done, i am not for capital punishment. Until you tell me the cost is low, i don't support it. Here's the link if you haven't found it - https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gender

My point about the wiki is simply that people shouldn't dismiss it outright. If you cite me wiki, i would certainly look into it, and read the primary citations if I am skeptical. I would counter-argue that you judge someone too soon if you dismiss someone's argument simply cuz they cite wiki on Reddit (come on, it's only Reddit, not like a freaking academic paper!)

Anyway - i see this conversation is diverged. Do you have counter-argument to the gender vs sex distinction, especially bearing in mind it is a distinction cited by official dictionary sources?Hey friend, they can all be found here broken down to the books he's recommended per podcast. 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ygeI9nOrgmOrlTVIkma7K9enDUhGsuhalh-05KTyDHA/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ygeI9nOrgmOrlTVIkma7K9enDUhGsuhalh-05KTyDHA/edit#gid=0)I understand your frustration. 
For me, my problem with Ben Shapiro is the technical flaw in his argument.

If gender and sex are defined differently (as we see now in the official English sources), and since we are speaking English language, we need o go by the official source. 

Just like how maybe I don't like the word human. Maybe i think human should be spelled huuman, with an extra 'u' in the middle. Do I get to decide that simply cuz i like it that way? No. Language is strictly defined by official sources, and we either obey it, or we go speak another language. 

That's my problem with Shapiro's argument - he ignores the official definitions. He might as well be speaking his own language then - the Shapiro language lol.&gt; Gender and sex are not different

But the official English sources have defined it so.
If we're going to be speaking English language, we should go by what the official sources say, right?

I understand your frustration, and to a degree, i am frustrated too, but i don't think we make a good argument if we were to go against the dictionary on topic around definition of words!Who listens to AA for politics, lol.

AA is good at exposing religious nonsense, but i don't subscribe for his political views.

Just like how i don't listen to Ben about his religion. That was my first thought when I saw the post. Kudos to you.

Also...do you remember Kudos bars?yea but it is human nature to judge comparatively. We can't change it. It's set in our DNA.And they kind of have started, right? 
Bernie Sanders movement was so popular, and it only seems to get more and more popular. Imagine 30 years from now where we assume the wealth inequality is even wider.Humans judge each other comparatively, so it is only natural for many of us to feel angry/frustrated if wealth inequality gets too wide.Fair point, but you can't deny movements like Occupy WallStreet really did happen, and trend is only to get worse and worse. Socialism popularity is increasing, there's no denying that.
Ben's argument seems to be "quit crying about it bitches", and i find that unrealistic because telling ppl to stop complaining is like telling humans to stop being racist. It's just our nature, right?maybe it's just a temporary thing. then. I'm just remembering how back in the 1990s, the phrase "wealth inequality" doesn't really get talked about, at lesat among the laymen. Now, it's pretty much the most popular subject today. I wonder if it's just going to get worse and worse, or if it's a fad.Naww, he's flat out lying.  If he was ignorant he would have confronted the criticism with tech specialists like the person in the video. He didn't, he just ignored it.  He is a liar. I'm not "butt hurt". I simply wanted to point out Ben Shapiros inferior, inaccurate and disingenuous presentation of how the web and net neutrality work. I want to help people like you understand how the world really works so that you don't adopt an inferior perspective. Does anyone know if she's a doctor? Is Ben Shapiro's wife a doctor?He's wrong and he is smart enough to know it. That means he is lying. The alternative is to accept that he is too stupid to see he is wrong on this issue and I doubt that.I assume you mean "Capital in the Twenty-First Century".  Ben's agenda is to promote a radical libertarian market ideology, massive tax cuts for the rich and a deregulation of the economy.  I doubt Ben wants to confront any of the granular details layed out by someone like Piketty. It's easier to just believe everything Milton Friendman and Thomas Sowell peddle and be done with it. LOL, its no surprise CNN doesn't have comments enabled on that article.Must either be a heavy advertiser or financier for Ben’s ventures. Disappointed he’d resort to that for booking a guest, so I’ll just avoid this oneI'm going to give a listen because I trust Ben and to be in the spirit of having my mind changed if I turn out to be wrong about Tai - but still agree with your sentiment.This is what happens when people don't have any real problems in their lifeIf someone is willing to assume a role of confidence about something they obviously know nothing about it is perfectly reasonable to assume the behavior is transmutable to other facets of what they say in other areas especially areas that are granular and debatable like economic policy. If you can not understand a basic and objective concept like page load speed on the internet how can anyone take Shapiro seriously about the highly ideologically driving, subjective and contested enclaves Shapiro wallows in? If you insist that 2+2 equals five then it is not "childish" to assume you will pass the same behavior over to other areas you claim to know about.  If you want to call my view "Leftist" then that is fine. Call it a purple fish if you want.I think your point is cursory to the broader point of what he says the left needs to "do" to win. In that regard,  I think he is correct. A cursory look shows the data being referenced is " Georgetown University’s [**Free Speech Project**](https://freespeechproject.georgetown.edu/)  "I don't know. But if you want to "DESTROY" progressive economic policy proposals Kelton is a much more viable debate candidate. I seriously can't see Ben trying to debate her .... he would look like a fool. [https://youtu.be/EegXpiHInVg](https://youtu.be/EegXpiHInVg)Bias in the media for the right wing? This guy is grasping at illegal California straws. I never heard of her chasing "people" around. Ben Shapiro should debate Kelton, she would wipe the floor with himYes it's the guy that rented lambos to pit in his garage when he made vids. He admitted he doesn't own them. And he has a library in his garage to show off.Yup. On the h3h3 podcast he said he rented them.He's a "social media influencer" and entrepreneur I want my hour of time back.

This fucking numbskull actually said the meaning of life was "happiness".

Weakest fucking answer I've ever seen. I'm honestly wondering if he gave Shapiro money to be on this..&gt; Also very disappointed Ben didn't jump on the ample opportunities to refute many of the silly opinions Tai was professing. 

There is only one reason he didn't. Ben was paid to have Tai on the show. Its the only answer. It was fucking awful. He didn't even question him on his "meaning of life" answer, which is said was fucking HAPPINESS. Are you fucking kidding me? UghReally disappointing given how much Ben has shown was possible with this format after the Sunday Special with Mike RoweI don't know what you poor morons would do.  I guess just listen to more Ben Shapiro !Fuck Alex Jones, sorry, I don't want to be associated with crazy.I don't know what everyone else is hearing, but he has said multiple times he doesn't/won't run.I agree. I think he'll soften up and get better at this with time, FWIW.  He's said he's working on it, which is cool - but the moments when he comes across as someone with not-so-great empathy I cringe.Yes. As I said in the post it was to cover for gas. Why, so you can protest it or fuck with them? 

Call me skeptical but I don't trust a brand new user asking these questions last minute.Ah yes, Ben shapiro, the jewish alt right leader.Yeah that was fuckin hilariousBen attacks and makes fun of individuals all the time. Do you only support it when he does it ?Actually that's not my "defense". It's just a question I asked you. I won't bother to give my "defense" because I don't think it matters either way to you or any Shapiro supporter. THe article points out his hipocrisy - that's what it does.  Ben Shapiro attacks individuals all the time. If you don't like it then go complain to him. Maybe you can tell him that he is "weak"Okay, you are right and I am wrong. Everything you say is correct and the entire article I posted is completely wrong and contains no revealing information about Ben Shapiro. I encourage you to continue on the path that you are on. This is adorable and I cringed hard. Beautiful content OP. Thank goodness Ben has gotten better. The Kosher CasanovaWhat was the tweet? It was deleted.Exactly. I’m really glad there are Democrats listening to Shapiro. Are they any comparable podcasts with liberal commentators you’d recommend? The only one I know about is Pod Save America. But they do it on a rare case-by-case basis, right?
Like i think statistically speaking right now 30% of the citizens are living below poverty line. If we remove government welfare, or at least severely reduce it, then will churches sponsor for all 30%?I don't want to put words in your mouth, but isn't that kind of saying "yeah we know there are 1000 poor people in this community, but we can only help 100. The rest 900...sorry too bad so sad"?But even UNICEF is not capable to help all the poor people in the country (forget internationally). 
I think the simple fact is we have about 30% of citizens living below poverty line. That translates to about 100 million people. 

Can charities cover 100 million poor people? (and not just like a one-time donation either, e.g. 100 bucks)I agree with you that government welfare is not a better approach.
But i can't help thinking under a conservative model, we would expect millions of people to starve to death. I mean...there simply aren't enough generous people willing to give so much money to sustain millinos of people.

And remember - we're not talking about giving $100 to a homeless guy and calling it a day. $100 can at best last only 1-2 weeks. Not enough to actually live.My gut feeling tells me people won't be donating the money they get from tax reduction. I certainly won't, and I don't think i'm an exception. It's just human nature.
I think churches and gofundme CAN work for some people, but to cover millions? i don't think so.That's a GREAT point...most people won't donate to what doesn't immediately impact them. Myself included.Maybe in a more rural setting, people are more willing to help each other because you personally know them.
But in a major city with at least half a million people....i don't know 99.99% of the people i see o the street, and if i pass a homeless guy on the street corner, i wouldn't give a fuck (sorry to be blunt). I would save the money instead for my own kids/family, u know? And i think most ppl think like me too.I was quoting from my own city, but nationally i see it is around 12% (which still translates to more than 45 millino people...)

https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-current-poverty-rate-united-statesThis is where I'm stuck - i'm a conservative, don't get me wrong, but liberals at this point would attack me as being "cruel", that i care more about "lowering taxes" as opposed to "helping the poor".

What's your response if they attack you in that way?I think in a small town or rural counties, churches are sufficient. 
But in a major city where poor people cluster together by the thousands...i haven't seen churches able to care for them (and not for a lack of trying).you have a point there. I think people dying is bad, but if the alternative is socialism, then i think your point is justified. 

I think your point is only bad if there is a perfectly valid alternative solution (that doesn't involve socialism) which our country isn't doing.What is your personal response if a liberal at this point accuse you of being heartless/cruel/selfish? Playing violin and owning libs.I 100% agree. I found through this article and kept up with it; which talks about the lengths these reporters were going to in order to demonize her.

[https://www.utahstandardnews.com/ut-school-board-member-stalked-by-kutv2-news/](https://www.utahstandardnews.com/ut-school-board-member-stalked-by-kutv2-news/)Remember when owen was funny? Pepperidge farm remembers.

I really dislike Owen. He went off the rails with his race obsession. I'm not going to call him a racist, but he is OBSESSED with race. 

I also find his constant use of the N word to be pretty offensive. 

Here is just an example of SOME of the stuff he said that all together made me really stop liking him. 

https://imgur.com/a/1NBq8FeIts piques, not peeks.


Yes rape is worse than saying that word but why make that post? And all the others? They're not even funny.He looks like a REAL winner in life too. So, Ben actually talks intermittently about his law school days. Specifically, his advice is always just get through the program by telling the liberal professors what they want to hear. Then, you can make a difference as a conservative person once you've graduated and have the degree. His general outlook is that it isn't worth it to argue in liberal classes. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, the very best of luck to you. We need more truly Constitutional, right leaning attorneys out there. Also, law school is a bitch. Thanks. Someone just alerted me to the fact that the Federalist Society exists and now I'm kind of excited to see if I can get students together to start a chapter Not sure what your trying to prove here. Many of the quotes are against trump, however he has said recently that Trump has proven him wrong on many occasions to his pleasant surprise. The best thing about Ben is he will call himself out when he is wrong.

Also some of these quotes are taken out of context as well.

Also thats why so many of us like Ben. Hes is willing to show his biases and admit when he is wrong. Plus alot of those comments are true. Like Trump is a liar.Have you been over to r/politics ? Many people over there are saying this now. And we all know this will be the lefts story after his acceptence Sensitive partStill waiting on him to address the whole writing propaganda for Manafort thing...He needs to stop throwing around the word “evil” any chance he gets. 

Oh, and I’m still waiting for him to comment on the Manafort situation.It kind of seems like he’d have to be an idiot to have not realized Manafort was sketchy the moment he paid him to write propaganda for a foreign nation. But why’d Shapiro scrub his Twitter timeline recently? That suggests that he’s embarrassed by this whole situation, doesn’t it? It just seems very unusual for Ben Shapiro of all people to not address something.I’m referring to the revelation that he wrote propaganda for Manafort back in 2012. That news came out just last week. I’m not saying you’re wrong, but if that’s the case, why doesn’t Ben just clarify that himself? As far as I can tell, he’s been completely silent on the matter, and has almost exclusively been talking about Kavanaugh. I’m not saying he shouldn’t discuss the Kavanaugh case, but I would’ve thought that someone like Ben Shapiro would first try to address the elephant in the room before going on about what a disgrace Feinstein is. His silence only serves to make me think that he’s too red in the face to admit that he possibly made a mistake.I personally don’t buy this argument that Ben Shapiro is a truly professional individual of genuine morals. I kind of get the impression that people only think that because he skipped a grade or two, and went to Harvard. Him and Jordan Peterson honestly just come across as what a pretentious teen or some edge lord think intelligent people sound like, so I have a certain amount of trouble believing that he’s simply waiting for the right time to address this situation, or if he’s even going to accept responsibility for it. With that being said, if he does admit that he made a mistake, I might consider gaining a bit of respect for him. I was referring to their fans. Both these guys have fans who seem to like them solely because they “own the libs” with their oh so edgy rants about political correctness, and because they come from educated backgrounds, so they must know what they’re saying. Also, Jordan Peterson is particular is really fond of promoting this idea of being an “alpha male”, and in my experience, most of the people who are obsessed with coming across as “alpha” are angsty teenagers and really immature adults, some of whom identify as incels. So where does his “enforced monogamy” statement factor into getting one’s shit together? To me, his entire statement about enforced monogamy kind of sounds like the kind of thing that a bunch of edge lord teens and young adults would eat up. "Why are you such an \*angry\* Jew today?"

&amp;#x200B;

Hahha, thank you for posting this!! I love how deeply uncomfortable Ben is with Steven in general. YES! I'm in!I wonder what would happen if you typed in Fox News into YouTube, and filtered by live?    
  
^^Thank ^^^^me ^^^^^^laterWow, totally thought that was last weekHit up modmailLove me some Benseen it , it's weak. Yuval is next level to be more specific the debate that needs to happen is the nationalist vs globalist debate.

The religious debates are inconsequential, albeit interesting  JFC, his story about his kid on the plane.

I would hate flying with Ben.Oh man i love me some spicy BenLmfao OP, your a shitty troll man. You gotta pump those rookie numbers up! 😂😂Ben 14 happened over Halloween one year. Wasn’t she accusing Ivanka Trump of being callous and tone deaf to the cruelty of the administration she was directly involved with? The Trump administration was accused of separating parents from their children, and many people considered Ivanka Trump’s picture with her child to be tone deaf as a result. Simply having a child shouldn’t mean that she should be exempt from criticism. You can certainly say that Samantha Bee shouldnt have been so vulgar in her attack on Ivanka Trump, but how exactly was it “evil”? Also, you are aware that Trump has had a history of saying lewd things about his daughter that go as far back to when she was a teenager, right? 

Of course, if attacking a grown woman for her supposed callousness is “evil”, what does that make this tweet (https://mobile.twitter.com/benshapiro/status/303889358489018369)?Your argument about the context of Shapiro’s tweet doesn’t really make him look much better. Citing some random mass shooting right when it happened in order to make fun of some political adversary of his just makes him look like a jackass. His tweet might’ve made a bit more sense if the shooter actually did turn out to be a fan of Morgan’s, but that wasn’t the case. He just picked some random shooting in order to try and make his supposed point.You know what's so shitty about this. This picture was made by a leftist which has more in common with nazi ideologues  than the alt right. It drips with irony.Lmao triggered much GeffLol its good to have a sense of humor. This is why Ben is important. If you 'fail to see what the debate would be" i'm pretty sure you did not understand any of it. Great listen way better quality and longer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugOcczsR6UsAd hominems are the best.


But yeah I'd assume anyone that graduated from Harvard law school at age 22 is pretty wicked smaht.Doesn’t Ben Shapiro use as hominems all the time? Also, simply saying that someone is smart of their academic background is pretty lazy.Don’t forget that he also likes to accuse anyone who isn’t 100% pro-Israel of anti-Semitism. He even wrote propaganda for Paul Manafort where he did just that.Uh no... I cant remember any of his serious arguments containing ad hominems... have you ever watched his show?How about that time he called Piers Morgan a bully on CNN? Starting his own media company? You mean after he worked for Breitbart, and was paid to write propaganda for Paul Manafort? Also, his ability to murk anyone in a debate? You mean random college students? He didn’t seem to do a very good job arguing with Patton Oswalt on Twitter, given that he resorted to accusing him of anti-Semitism.

Honestly, Ben Shapiro is a stupid person’s idea of a genius.Except that he did more than simply denounce Hamas. He’s attacked Palestinian people as a whole. Uh, because he was being a bully. He supported his argument extremely well. He only called him a bully when piers kept saying "how dare you" to his logical arguments.   He wasnt bashing his argument on piers being a bully. So ad hominems are okay as long as you think they’re true? Got it. By the way, what about that time he called a transgender woman “sir” just to trigger an emotional response?Who is stupider? The person participating in a subreddit that they enjoy or someone wasting their own time in a subreddit they hate?

Also if you want to watch a debate go watch ben vs cenk. 

&gt;Starting his own media company? You mean after he worked for Breitbart


Uh, yes... he started a company after working for another company. Is this supposed to be some sort of "gotcha" thing? I dont get it.

Doesn’t Ben Shapiro consider transgender people to be mentally ill? That would mean that he deliberately antagonized a crazy person just to provoke an emotional response. That actually kind of sounds like bullying. I get that he doesn’t consider transgender women to be real women, but why does he have to call a transgender woman “sir” to her face when he knows that’s just going to piss her off? No, I'm saying he isnt basing his arguments on ad hominems.

I’m not allowed to call out Ben Shapiro on his bullshit, or the excuses that his fans make for him? Okay then. 

By the way, remember that time Shapiro offered to illegally contribute money for Alexandria Cortez to debate him, and then incessantly bitched about her when she refused his illegal offer? 

Also, you are aware that a lot of people can start their own company, right? That doesn’t prove anything. I also can’t help but notice that you didn’t bother addressing the other things I mentioned, like his little dispute with Patton Oswalt.It sure sounded like he was calling Morgan a bully in order to discredit him. So tell me, how successful is his career as a lawyer? How criticially acclaimed are his books? Has he ever received a Pulitzer Prize? 

By the way, neither you nor Shapiro have bothered addressing the Paul Manafort shaped elephant in the room. As far as I know, the closest he came to addressing it was scrubbing his Twitter timeline...

Fact don’t care about your feelings indeed...Saying that Palestinian people as a whole are “rotten to the core” among other things is a generalization that qualifies as bigotry. Did Morgan also call Ben Shapiro out for calling him a bully? It definitely sounded like he was basing his argument around “you’re a bully!”Please don't editoralize the titles with things like epic, owns, destroys, etc.Yea I know he has said it, i'm just not seeing him really doing it.

Kinda makes him a hypocrite, if u get what i mean.oh I didn't know about that. Cool, ok thanks for this! This is exactly the type of example I was hoping to find. I second this question.I'd like to subscribe to your newsletter.lol why are you encouraging this? It's cringey as fuck.Watched this earlier, LOVED it.That's cool! But do you think it may eventually impact how seriously people take Ben's arguments, at least then they are first exposed to them?Mixed feelings. Ben was quick to assume considering there's a really good case that these are fake.

But they could also be real. Considering that I’m of Palestinian descent, and he has made his stance on Palestinians clear, I don’t think I could ever truly like him.If that’s the case, that only makes him scrubbing his Twitter timeline, as well as his complete silence on Paul Manafort ever since the news came out, even more suspect. Plus, he has an article on *The Daily Wire* called “So, Here's A Giant List Of All The Dumb Stuff I've Ever Done (Don't Worry, I'll Keep Updating It)”, and he doesn’t mention the Manafort article at any point in it.Okay. What’s his email? For the record, while I did grow up in a Muslim household, I myself am actually an atheist. 

Anyway, I was mostly referring to that time Shapiro said that “The Palestinian Arab population is rotten to the core”, which he doesn’t seem to have retracted.Do you mean this (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kMp_GJJPGCw&amp;t=0s&amp;index=19&amp;list=PLlVjFVMet3OWuRY5tQm1ArS2Nm7Gn5yOk&amp;noapp=1&amp;client=mv-google)? Could you give a time stamp of when he mentions it? I don’t feel like watching through the entire video.Well, I did find one point in the video at around the 29 minute mark up to the 31 minute mark where the kid asks him about some of the things he’s said that he regrets, and he mentions things that he wrote from when he was 18 up to when he was 22, but I so far haven’t seen him mention the Manafort article, which was written when he was 28. I guess I’ll just have to keep looking.With respect, you have a pretty skewed view of Ben Shapiro if his reaction to this surprises you. I am a loyal listener and huge fan but outside of a few examples, his views are very anti-conspiracy, safe and fairly milk-toast.  

It helps to remember that Ben is a lawyer, he does not (in general) needlessly speculate on anything that can be *proven incontrovertibly* false, regardless of the possible political advantages of doing so. That is *not* to say that the false flag claim is false. I think the narrative is far too convenient to not at very least be highly suspicious of it. But in the end this situation is relatively binary. It's either true or false. The safe move is to essentially tell people to hold off on judging until the facts are known.  After all facts don't care about your feelings.Why would I regularly listen to his podcasts if I don’t like him? 

Anyway, I watched through the entire video, and Paul Manafort’s name is never uttered at any point in it. Regarding Shapiro being a “let’s wait until we have the facts” kind of guy, that does seem to be the case for the most part, but I have seen at least one or two occasions where he came to some conclusion that ended up being incorrect, like when he initially insinuated that this one Muslim guy shot up that mosque in Quebec, even though it turned out that he was simply a witness.All I know is that he sure as hell didn’t address it when he “came clean” about his past mistakes to the Parkland kid, nor has he acknowledged it in his “List of dumb stuff I’ve done” article.This is from a 60 minutes interview. I will acknowledge that when people say Soros was an actual Nazi or helped round up Jews, that is bullshit. But the idea that he 'helped the Nazis' well...

&gt;**Kroft: “My understanding is that you went … went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;Soros: “Yes, that’s right. Yes.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Kroft: “I mean, that’s — that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years. Was it difficult?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Soros: “Not, not at all. Not at all. Maybe as a child you don’t … you don’t see the connection. But it was — it created no — no problem at all.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Kroft: “No feeling of guilt?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Soros: “No.”First, using snopes as a source does not lend credibility to your argument. 

With that said, I started off my post with:

&gt;I will acknowledge that when people say Soros was an actual Nazi or helped round up Jews, that is bullshit.

I would define that as the “conspiracy” about Soros, (and Shapiro does not claim that as far as I can find). 

Where things get significantly more complex and ambiguous is how you define “helping the nazis” or what the definition of a collaborator is.

Even in the snopes article they acknowledge that Soros worked as an assistant to a Hungarian beaurocrat whose job it was to confiscate Jewish property and had accompanied him at least once (according to Soros himself) in *directly* confiscating the property of a wealthy Jewish aristocrat named Mor Kornfeld. 

The degree to which one classifies Soros’s actions as being a Nazi collaborator is up to interpretation, but to label it a conspiracy is highly disingenuous. 

The part of your argument I find particularly objectionable is the classification of the criticism of Soros as ‘anti-semitic’. To begin with, labelling Ben Shapiro anti-semitic is patently absurd.  Beyond that, it's becoming more and more common to see those on the left using ‘anti-semitism’ as a shield against ideas that they do not want to argue against. It’s intellectually lazy and weakens the validity of the label. Save the label for real examples of anti-semitism.

Then again, by your logic, is you calling Ben Shapiro anti-semitic, anti-semitic? Makes you think.

Finally, Ben did specifically speak to his criticism of Soros on his podcast today. Ben brought up the fact that Soros is, to put it crudely, Jewish in name only. This brings up an interesting question, in what way does Soros represent Judaism in any way whatsoever?

Regardless, I do appreciate the willingness to engage in thoughtful conversation. It's important to examine one's ideas critically.
