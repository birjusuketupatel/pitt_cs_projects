 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-DaSqVB1l4 - Jonathan Haidt on Diversity and Morality 2.0 

(Watch the complete 30 min video if possible. Morality discussion starts around 14 min mark. you can start there as well). 

I think Jonathan is discussing about the fight between left and right-wing morals. Would like to know  your view on the diversity concepts discussed here from socio-politics perspective. ThanksI was listening to David's story today about how Italy's attempted coalition government would have an individual who is Euroskeptic be in charge. My question is, shouldn't we all be Euroskeptic. This is my understanding of the financial situation in Europe, if my facts are wrong please let me know, without further waiting

1: The Euro is an attempt at an all European Currency, however there is no official central bank for Europe. Every country within the Eurozone is allowed to retain their own national currency, see the current existence of the British Pound. What concerns me is that Europe is attempting to have a unified currency without a unified monetary and fiscal plan. Compare this to the US where all 50 states are united by a monetary and fiscal policy. We don't have California creating statewide currency compared to say Texas creating statewide currency all loosely following the US dollar. The system the Eurozone currently uses feels very prone to problems under this system.

Now there are some examples of Eurozone countries tying their currencies directly to the Euro, see Portugale, but I don't think it is enough for "some" of the countries involved to do this. IMO either every european country uses their own national currency with strict controls on their own monetary and fiscal policy or Europe unite as one single entity and agree on one national bank's monetary and fiscal policy. I don't see this middle ground option as stable.

Am I missing anything in this discussion? Please let me know in the comment section.  The hypocrisy &amp; double standards of left wing media &amp; progressive hacks like David Pakman is disgusting! Pakman, what you gotta say about this?Hey David....

These ICO people that you're inviting into your show are barely coherent.

"We're gonna try to have everything. And we're gonna be a platform where businesses can offer what they have and people can get what these businesses are offering. And we are the middlemen"

This guy talked for 20 minutes and said nothing at all. David, it's ok that you're making money off this. But you have to challenge these people on their complete nonsense. Otherwise you're gonna be known as the Dave Rubin of crypto: giving crooks a platform to spread their shit. So yes China is an issue and I think in the future that's going to be our biggest concern or it should be anyway. Their economy has evolved and expanded quicker than any other nation in history and their government and military easily rivals our own now so we definitely will have to be smart when it comes to dealing with them unfortunately we will have to wait until our next administration takes over because tariffs and making deals to only. benefit the Trump brand isn't going to accomplish jack shit so until then BLAH! 🤧💩 
NOW for the bigger point I want to make. Trump is not defending our country against our other or main rival or foe. Does anyone else think that we should be finally stepping up to Putin with ALL of our allies using our military in unison to intimidate but not provoke a full blown nuclear war against Russia?  I think what Putin has been doing to us and to the world is enough and frankly its becoming very upsetting and disturbing because it almost feels like nobody in the US is doing anything and I get that feeling from NATO as well as our other allies as well. We understand that sanctions do infact cause damage but Putin could honestly care less how it effects his people and economy because at the end of the day he will still have his billions and all of his stakes in whatever illegal stuff he has going on around the world. Putin himself is hasn't stopped killing his political opponents and is still have people executed around the globe (London) and right now he is meddling in our upcoming elections and will do so in the next presidential election as well messing with Europes elections (France especially) he has been getting away with too many things for to long and the world hasn't changed their strategy I think we should not be intimidated by his supposed nukes that can't be shot down and that the us and our allies should start considering a conflict that could lead to fighting but I don't think Russia would fight back with Nukes. Anyways just wanted to start a discussion to see what you awesome people from the left, right or any other side your on and hear what your opinions on this might be. David if you read this I am curious what your thoughts are. 😉I just took a few minutes to do a little counting on Ye Olde Fox News Youtube channel, to bring you this fun fact.

As of 4:50 p.m. Central Time, Friday June 1:

Out of the past 24 hours of Fox News video posts (95 posts):
 
12 segments about Roseanne/Samantha Bee

3 segments about tariffs on our frikkin ALLIES (and I'm guessing they're favorable coverage, though some amazing feats of acrobatic spinning).

And people wonder how Trumpsters stay SO devoted.﻿There are many other maladies that people face besides hard disease. This study strikes me as very narrow. Suggesting that the mentioned vitamins lack benefit because they may not help fight heart disease seems dismissive.Sorry wrong subreddit, ignore it. I cant seem to figure out how to delete this postWe must acknowledge that men, white men in particular have been avoiding responsibility and blaming fake racism for their grievances. They hate their fathers, they hate GOD, and are rebelling against him because Satan is their father! They rely off the government and have babies out of wedlock cause they hate their fathers! 

They have been tricked by the children of the lie to cheat, steal, and murder anyone that agrees with the great white hope! Donald Trump is a victim, and has been oppressed by the media ever since the media cried, fake racism, and now he's president cause Satan will never win! God has given us the great white hope! Bless his heart! 

Then the white liberals use the blacks as their property, for only a vote! The blacks are slaves on the plantation of the Democratic Party! If they weren't enslaved by the Democratic Party, why else would they vote for the Democrats? 

THAS AMAZING! SATAN WILL NEVER WIN! DONT BECOME A CHILD OF THE LIE! 
WE MUST NOT CAVE INTO THE FALLEN STATE! 
If he runs in 2020, it will most certainly be on the Democratic ticket. Therefore, he should join the party. Otherwise, it would be unfair of the party to give him its Presidential nomination. 

I know many of you will dislike this, but before you hit that downvote button, just take time and think about it. For a large portion of his career, he distanced himself from the Democratic Party - at least nominally. After the 2016 election, he went back to being an independent, thus again distancing himself from the party. Why should a political party, regardless of whatever you might think of that party, give its nomination to person who does not want to be affiliated with that party other than such affiliation is convenient? Besides, it would be a kick in the face to politicians who have stuck with the party through thick and thin; politicians like Liz Warren, Kamala Harris, and Ed Markey, et cetera. 

So, I think you (I say "you" because I live in Britain, so there isn't much I can do) should be petitioning him to join the Democratic Party, that way he has a better chance not only of securing the nominee, but of moving the party further to the left. And more importantly, longtime members of the  party will be less likely to have qualms about voting for him. Also, blocs which were not as enthusiastic about him in 2016 (i.e. minorities) will probably trust him more if they see that "(D)" next to his name. 

There. Go nuts!

P.S.: I know I don't really have a say in your elections, but if 2020 comes to a race for the nomination between Kamala Harris, Liz Warren and Bernie Sanders, I would absolutely urge you to go with Kamala Harris!Last year, I saw a video from The Young Turks that Trump will not get a second term. According to Cenk, there are the four horsemen: personal corruption, systemic corruption, incompetence, and hubris. A year after Trump got inaugurated, people are started to flip on him, especially after the tax cuts.

I like to hang out at a psychic's website and I was able to see the good things that will lead to Trump losing. From the read the future nights, I saw that this November the House will flip but not the Senate, crippling Trump. We did see a progressive movement. I see in 2020 that a moderate Democrat elected in office. Someone said that Adam Schiff will be the next president, possibly the moderate Democrat I predicted.

The next recession will be sooner than later. Someone said the next recession will happen next Fall. Another psychic on the site said that Trump will be something that pisses off voters, likely impacting their wallets.

Lately, we see progressives running locally and won. I see the seeds that Sanders sown are growing fast. Dear David,
I love your content and your program. However one thing I would like more clarification on is the Euro and the European Union. I'm highly skeptical of the Euro as a strong currency and am skeptical of the European Union as it is an awkward middle stage between completely independent nations who like each other and a full United States of Europe. IMO this middle ground leaves room for skepticism and doubt. Can you do a long form piece on this issue and maybe help me fill in the gaps of my knowledge of why I shouldn't be skeptical?

Edit: How do I put a picture in my reddit posts so when they are looked at from the main page people can see a picture of the EU to help this post stand out?Obama's accomplishments in the first 74 days, before the Democrats lost their filibuster proof Senate majority.
-Lily Ledbetter Act, which overturned the 5-4 Republican-appointed Supreme Court decision that formally legalized pay discrimination against women (which affects family incomes as well).
-Passed one of the largest tax cuts on the middle class in the history of the United States. The only middle class tax cut that was larger was the one signed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, which was proposed by JFK in 1963 (which also eliminated dividend withholding and other loopholes resulting in the corporate tax rate going from 37% to 43% as it was a tax hike on the wealthy)
-Saved Chrysler (this loan has been paid back with interest)
-Saved General Motors (this loan has been paid back with interest)
-Reversed 800,000 monthly job losses into monthly job gains, a situation they inherited from the Republican-controlled Congress and Republican president
-Increased federal education spending, which has a $5.60 tax revenue return on investment
-Cut the cost of student loans in half. To note, higher education spending has a near $7 tax revenue return on investment.
-Strengthened hate crime laws
-Expanded the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
-Reformed child labor laws
-Passed Wall Street reform, Dodd Frank
-Passed historic credit card reform along with the CFPB, which had a number of reforms, including capping late fees at $25 and capping interest rate hikes.
-Stopped predatory payday lending to our troops
-Reversed the Republican policy of ending payment to troops for stop-loss time and started compensating our troops for stop-loss time.
-Ended torture by law, which every study our government conducted found was counterproductive, as it actually created terrorism and gave false information to our military which cost lives, weakened our ability to successfully complete military objectives (including larger objectives of winning wars) and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars to investigate false information we received due to torture. If you think our cops here in America shouldn't use torture to get answers because it would lead to false confessions, which would lead to innocent civilians being convicted for the crimes of others, while the guilty would walk free more often as a result, then you're right. It's exactly the same with the military.
-Passed VA Reform which hired thousands of additional doctors, which is the entire problem with the VA (there is a labor shortage of doctors and as more troops come home, Republicans refuse to hire additional doctors)
-Passed a law to allow women to serve on submarines and with equal pay for equal work.
-Passed a historic nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia
-Passed a law which forced BP Oil to be responsible for their damages in the Gulf of Mexico, which cost BP over $20 billion, which saved taxpayers from taking the bill as the Republicans wanted.
-Strengthened the EPA, which studies have been found to have a positive economic impact. Every single study shows that EPA regulations CREATE jobs. The EPA has cost the economy roughly $50 billion over the last 10 years and created $900 billion over the last 10 years in GDP. It's an undeniable fact. Just think about it. If there's a new regulation for a smoke screen, someone has to manufacture it, design it, incorporate it in their business by hiring another employee etc. The EPA creates millions of high paying jobs. It's just that trump and his corporate oligarchs don't want to hire Americans.
-Broadened the powers of the FDA to crack down on the predatory food industrial complex. Studies also show that the FDA has an undeniable positive impact on the economy.
-Passed funding for the 9/11 responders which Republicans opposed and fought.
-Repealed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy
-All of that was in 74 days. After that, they did not have a filibuster proof Senate. They did not expect to lose their filibuster proof Senate majority as well, so in retrospect they could have done even more if they knew their days were numbered.They seem long like alien fingers, and I didn’t see a fifth digit.... While most in the news media are (perhaps rightfully) focusing on the content of the letters sent by Trump's attorneys to the DOJ in June '17 and January '18, what baffles me is they are barely mentioning the fact that Trump's tweet, obviously referencing these letters as leaked by the DOJ to the New York Times, was posted BEFORE the NYT actually published the story!  I haven't been able to find an exact minute count, but they all say his tweet came "minutes before," or "shortly before," and his tweet includes this phrase:

"Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media?"  
(note that he spelled 'counsel' right this time, but did not use an apostrophe for 'lawyers letters' --not GrammarNazi'ing but who knows anymore when Trump himself writes his tweets). 

So how could he possibly know about these letters?  There are only a few possibilities:
1. He was not talking about THESE letters (would be an insane coincidence but I suppose that's all the deniably this guy would need).
2. There is a pro-Trump leaker inside the NYT.
3. Trump and/or goon(s) leaked the letters themselves.  

I think #3 is the most likely, albeit most fucked-up, scenario.  Let's not forget, somebody leaked one of his tax returns, only one random year's return, and it just happened to be one that made him look great--he made lots of money, gave to charity, and technically paid the legal taxes, after using all available loopholes.  He also has a history of calling radio shows pretending to be someone else and talking about himself.  And I don't know what's happened to Melania but it was obviously him that wrote "her" tweet.  

Leaking these letters himself probably seemed like a great idea.  After all, it could accomplish two things
1. Bolster the claim that there is corruption in the DOJ and they're out to get him.
2. Get the many pages of arguments out to the public.  Of course few people will read every word, but I'm sure Trump and Hannity will have a bedtime chat about which parts to stress to the base, as "legitimate" legal arguments.  Of course, they won't SAY "So it doesn't matter if he broke laws; as President he is above the law." 

The only problem is, this person is too goddamned STUPID to consider timing his tweet AFTER the story went public.  Seriously, even one minute after would be marginally believable.  But no, he just could not wait to stir the turd.  By making this post

The Major Religions:
...promote right wing bigotry, bad ideas, create division and are not conducive to left wing movements.

Change my mind.

*Religion is the opium of the people: this saying of Marx is the cornerstone of the entire ideology of Marxism about religion. All modern religions and churches, all and of every kind of religious organizations are always considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class.*

*-Vladimir Lenin*

Lets see if I get banned from here as well.I've been watching the show for a few weeks now and have come to enjoy its smart take on progressive policy. But one aspect of the show that is turning me off is how it can be condescending to callers. I just watched [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u4BzClMpJ4) where the caller is obviously nervous and is making an effort to be respectful to David by calling him "Mr. Pakman," but David's first reaction is to question her about using speakerphone. Then when she says she doesn't think so, David looks away snidely and says "that's much better all of a sudden," when there was no discernible improvement to the audio.

This strikes me as behavior in which David is assuming bad faith from the callers before their interactions even begin. I would expect to see some sensitivity of the fact that these are inexperienced folks on radio who are ultimately creating content for TDPS, which is later being monetized. If the show is unable to screen these calls like other talk programs do, it is unreasonable to demand the kind of coherence from callers that seems to be expected here. Don't get me wrong. If a caller is trying to argue politics with bad logic and distorted facts, David is justified in attacking that clinically. But that is a different posture than the condescension I tend to see.https://youtu.be/oInAlTKlw64
The only thing to add is that it’s literally the same regulations as telephone service providers which are also under title II FCC regulations now. Which means they can’t block access or charge you more based on the content of what you use their service for. A telephone company can’t charge you $1000 an hour if they listen in and find you are talking to your dying mother in the hospital. They can charge you for the minutes you used for the call, but not the content. An internet service provider can’t charge you more or slow your speed for choosing a small business website over Walmart. They do charge you for internet speed. But with your internet speed, you are able to load any webpage and it takes longer for webpages with more content. Ben Shapiro commonly spreads this lie. He opposes any law against private discrimination and lies and says it isn’t necessary because businesses won’t discriminate unless forced to do so by the government. What he leaves out is that in Northern States before the Civil Rights Act, Private discrimination was rampant. After the civil rights act, we had to pass the fair housing act because private segregation in housing was also rampant. After the civil rights act was passed and public discrimination was outlawed, the justice department through today has to file lawsuits as well as private actors to prosecute businesses that violate the civil rights act. 

Dinesh D’Souza says you should have a right to discriminate and wants a full repeal of the Civil Rights Act.
“For example, Dinesh D'Souza, the author of The End of Racism, holds an Olin Foundation research fellowship at AEI. D'Souza has suggested that civil rights activists actually help perpetuate racial tensions and division in the United States, and has even called for the repeal of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. After his book was published, black conservatives Robert Woodson and Glenn Loury denounced it — Woodson released a statement saying it "fans the flames of racial animosity" — and broke their own ties with AEI.”

https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/mainstream?page=0%2C1#2For the purposes of this post, "SJW" (social justice warrior) means those on the left who hold illberal ideas (i.e. lack of respect for free speech) and generally think identity politics are a good political strategy.  

I think all of us on this subreddit, and David as well, *generally* agree the left has an "SJW" (social justice warrior) problem. We can have reasonable debates about the scale of the issue and whether or not it is relatively contained to college campuses, but most of us agree it is somewhat of a problem. At the very least, it is an image problem which subsequently turns into an electoral problem.

In engaging in debate or discussion with those who adhere to the "SJW" ideology, what do you guys think is the best approach? I see two options: one is practical and one is philosophical.

The practical option is essentially the thesis of Mark Lilla's book. Basically, Lilla argues that to have power in policymaking, you need to win elections. To win elections, you need to build a coalition broad enough to win. Hence, when you play a game of identity politics, you inherently shrink the scope of a potential coalition by pitting groups against each other. That makes the political situation much more difficult because you have unnecessarily curtailed a certain percentage of the electorate for no reason. 

The philosophical option is essentially explaining why the "SJW" ideology is a bad idea. For example, defending the values of free speech and why it is important to a liberal democracy. alternatively; explaining why identity politics leads to tribalism which leads to groups pitted against each other, also unstable for a democracy. 

To me, these are the two options I see for trying to curtail this ideology. I think it will be important in November and in the future to curtail this semi-radical portion of the left. Like I said, this may not be the biggest problem in the world, but it is nevertheless a problem. 

Would love to get other's thoughts on this.  

Edit: I should clarify a few things here. I also think the right uses identity politics as well. BUT I think it's wrong for them to do it just like it's wrong for the left to do it. I think certain social justice issues should be advanced and discussed (i.e. the very racist criminal justice system). Identity politics, [defined](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-conversation-with-mark-lilla-on-his-critique-of-identity-politics) as: "using identity as an appeal for other people to vote for your side," is bad for the left and for the country.

I also don't like using the term "SJW" because I think it's derogatory and ill-defined. It's just what most people are familiar with hence why I used it. For those of you that do not know who Jose Mujica is, Mujica was the 40th President of Uruguay, serving from 2010 to 2015. He has been described as "the world's humblest head of state" due to his austere lifestyle and his donation of around 90 percent of his $12,000 monthly salary to charities that benefit poor people and small entrepreneurs. 

However, Mujica was a *pragmatist* who, despite his philosophical musings on socialism, implemented pragmatic economic policies that favoured business and foreign investment. During Mujica's tenure Uruguay was ranked ninth out of 32 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean Basin for “ease of doing business,” by the World Bank. Indeed, Mujica said:

&gt;I believe we have to favor capitalism, so that its wheels keep turning. And then take our quota of resources to give to the weakest. But we should not paralyze it.

That is Rawls through and through. 

Mujica's government opted for a middle ground, favoring private sector projects to spur economic growth and modest interventions to distribute wealth. 

Mujica also gave the state control of marijuana production and sales, and legalized abortion and gay marriage. 

By the way, he was first elected to the presidency at the age of 75! 

Hey does anyone know were the Star Wars is SJW BS started? I have tried to find patient zero for this but I can’t. I keep getting caught in this loop of people referencing each other and I can’t find who first started this stupid argument. As a huge fan I don’t get it. Closest I got was the guy who made the movie cut removing all the women. It’s a personal quest help would be appreciated After listening to that callers question about how to solve the housing cost issue and David talking about looking into it but not finding any clear solutions, I went searching myself.

Preliminary results:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6XlcarjqAw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6XlcarjqAw)

Build higher, but not too high.  And build more efficient for space rectangular blocks and not triangle buildings or other exotic shapes.  Apparently building up is more efficient use of housing space and saves on cost... until you get to a certain height where it becomes more expensive.  Depending on the land value of a city, the range of optimal heights vary.  But in general, building higher than many cities allow in more places could help, as could prefab components.

Which brings me to this other theory on how to knock down barriers to allowing building at all.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcbjWGj3jBk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcbjWGj3jBk)

That guys point is simply.  Don't build ugly, built pretty.  If you are building things that look attractive, the locals are more likely to welcome it.

Problem.  Prefab may be cheaper, but it tends to be uglier, and rectangular building exteriors tend to look quite ugly, unless something more inspired is done to the exterior.

But if we can crack the problem of efficient building of attractive midrise housing stock, we may just be able to outrun the cost curve and bring housing prices down and meet demand.Watching shows like PBS, David Pakman, and  Reuters gives me the full picture of what's going on in the world. However, watching shows like Bill Maher doesn't give me the full picture and or dissection with guest doesn't add anything new to said issues. 

Ex, Bill Maher guests like Milo and Jared Peterson wasted airtime, because of either Bill lack of challenging them or letting that person talk about pointless stuff. 

When the right guest shows up like  Neil deGrasse Tyson or the survivors of a school shooting. Bill doesn't encourage the guests to express their ideas. Tyson defended GMOs to no scientist guest, Maher doesn't let Tyson break down the reason why GMOs is good. 

I'll end this post here because I don't want ramble on. What's your take on the subject? One of the biggest griefs libertarians have with the government is its supposed inefficiencies, as compared to market operating structures.

In my opinion, they just miss one thing: any structure, when gets big enough will suffer from the same problems as the government: bloated bureaucracy, slow reaction etc.

Here is one example: Apple, a company that used to be quite good with supporting their customers (when they were fighting for survival) is now a slow behemoth that quite often, doesn't care about their customers' problems.

Google seems to move in the same direction (with the happenings at YouTube)

Why do I care? Because I believe that these libertarian ideas of small government captured enough audience so that Trump, playing the stupid and counterproductive "let's remove the regulations" card managed to rally their support.

Yes, government has its problems, but it works (mostly) for the purpose it was created. Solving problems with your car engine by removing the control unit, will certainly get rid of the problems with your engine running poorly, but it will create a big major one.

We need solutions that will fix the issues and won't create new ones. But it is difficult, when there are 60 million convinced "experts" advocating for patently stupid policies.

What is your biggest pet peeve with libertarians? And my dear libertarians, I've thoroughly researched your ideology. Let's not rehash it here, just argue on point: markets won't solve problems with the inefficiencies in control structures, your thoughts.What am I talking about? 

In a recent video, Kyle slightly elaborated on the recent case about the undocumented teen who was seeking an abortion, and how the Supreme Court didn't review it: 

Watch here: https://youtu.be/zpAF3X2bSVc

In the video, Kyle is reacting to an article from the Washington Post about the Supreme Court dismissing the case I mentioned above. As someone who is pro choice, I don't think the Supreme Court dismissing this case has bad implications for women trying to seek an abortion. The Supreme Court only reviews cases in which they decided to overrule a lower court decision. The vast majority cases that go before the Supreme Court from lower courts are dismissed, only a few cases are ever reviewed. Dismissing a case doesn't necessarily mean women in similar circumstances won't receive access to an abortion. 

Am I analyzing this right? Did Kyle perceive this wrong, or am I misunderstanding what the Supreme Court actually does and what it means to dismiss a case? 

If they overruled Roe v Wade, I'd be worried, but if it's just a dismal, I don't think that has much power to stop women from getting abortions. I could be wrong, please someone help elaborate on my confusion The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the baker, 7 - 2. However, the court did not address the baker's free-speech claim. Instead, the case was decided on the Colorado Civil Rights Commission's treatment of the baker. The court held that the Commission's treatment of the baker showed elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs motivating the baker's objection to baking the cake. The records showed, in the court's opinion, that some of the commissioners at the formal public hearings endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial domain (i.e. leave your religion at home), disparaged the baker's faith as despicable and characterised it as merely rhetorical, and compared his invocation of his sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the Holocaust. None of the commissioners on the panel at the hearings objected to the comments. The comments thus cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the Commission's adjudication of the baker's case and therefore violated the State's duty under the First Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint. 

To be fair to the Commission, its suggestion that religion has been used as a basis for discrimination was a historical fact and thus there is an argument that the court was wrong to cast it as an attack on the baker's Christian identity. Nevertheless, what's the lesson here? Well, the lesson here is that it is all well and good to support secularism in the public sphere, but it is probably not a good idea to be a dick about it!

It's a very interesting case. I would recommend you read it - if you're into constitutional law. But, please note, this decision does not give businesses the right to refuse to serve gay people because of "muh free speech". That is not what this decision states. It isn't even a corollary of this decision. Little old video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrwmLH8QD7I . 

a) i think it's little click-bait title to get attention and votes

b) her criticism of Hillary may be partly true (i.e. pandering to get votes). This is probably one of the reasons she lost black voters in 2016. [edit:just a guess]

c) The third point about Obama - I don't even get it.

Share your thoughts/insights.

How come? Take Barack Obama's mother for example. She gave birth to a Black son. If the situatiom had been inversed - i.e. she was Black and his father White, Barack Obama would still have been regarded as Black. Why?We already do. Fact checking websites perform this function. 

Money is speech for now. I donate monthly to programs I support through Patreon, one of which should probably be a fact-checking organization. Politifact can have an ongoing average of claim validity and have a score posted for news organizations. Crowd-funding does the public good.

The problem isn't that the validity of news stories is in question, it's that people don't care. Conspiracy theories are in my blood and I know the drive to just ignore all the noisy bullshit that gets in the way of my worldview. I get it, I think. 

All major social media platforms should include hyperlinks to any particular news story as fact-checked. If someone isn't sure about the validity of the claim, having an option to look under the journalistic hood. Media awareness is a lesson we haven't learned yet. 

At the end of the day, people need to have a fundamental understanding on basic structure of news and red flags for fake news. 

"Trusting some arbitrary number is just part of the conspiracy. The government can influence those fact-checking websites." You're not going to win with these people. Getting people to read a paragraph about how a story was recorded and processed rather than just a number is absolutely necessary. That takes work from the public to educate themselves.

Bee Tee Dubs, if you want an excellent crash course on media literacy, I can't suggest this channel enough. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPwJ0obJya0&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtM6jSpzb5gMNsx9kdmqBfmY

Thoughts?Hello David. Have you ever considered making TDPS in Spanish? I feel that Latino-based news outlets/tv stations (ie Univision,  Telemundo) often times do not concentrate enough on American politics. Sometimes people suggest that David use his Spanish speaking ability to present a Spanish language show.

I want to ask something different: Is there another show comparable to TDPS in Spanish?My my my, who knew we'd ever get a president who wants to UNdo so many things?  Just the past week alone, he's wanted Sessons to UNrecuse himself, UNinvited the Eagles to the WH, and UNcancelled meeting with Kim (Jong UN, lol).  In addition to all the Obama accomplishments he has sought to UNdo, you know it burns him up that he can't UNkill Osama Bin Laden.  
Maybe we can't UNelect him, but if we get enough non-Republicans in office this midterm, the impeachment votes will be there and we can finally UNwedge him from the Oval Office. (if tl;dr, my main question is at the bottom)

*Amusing Ourselves to Death* by Niel Postman was published in 1985 in response to the election and subsequent administration of Ronald Reagan. In this work, Postman describes that the medium of television is suited only for entertainment due to the rapid and decontexualized manner in which it operates and competes for human attention, leading to what he terms the Age of Show Business. This age, different from the Typographic Age that preceded it, is characterized by a cultural lack of focus on significant and relevant issues in preference for a consistent stream of entertainment. Indeed, Postman takes aim at television news agencies, reality TV, and even Sesame Street as pertinent examples of the white\-noise filling the public sphere. Postman paraphrases Aldous Huxley towards the end of the book:  "For in the end he \[Huxley\] was trying to tell us that what afflicted the people in 'Brave New World' was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking."  


I do recommend reading it, it's not very long coming in at 179 pages and I don't feel I can do the entire book justice in this post. In the forward by Andrew Postman, he ominously describes his fathers work as being based in the premise that Huxley, not Orwell, was correct in that our culture has become a burlesque rather than a prison, with equally devastating results. Essentially, instead of "Big Brother" policing us, we police ourselves by failing to stand for our principles against the issues that face us, in turn for becoming numbed in the endless flow of entertainment.  


One of the central ideas that Postman describes is how the television news agencies turn news into entertainment, and entertainment into news, annihilating the contextual meaning in an endless torrent of images and sounds, leading to information glut. Indeed, he dedicates a whole chapter to the "Now... This!" phenomena of the televised media, and I couldn't stop thinking about how perfectly this describes the rise of Donald Trump as demagogue and president. Indeed, Niel Postman went as far as to say all American presidents since the advent of mass television availability in American households (1950s) are more akin to show\-people than they are politicians, in that their image and polish is more important than the policies they stand for. Of course, some presidents have been worse than others, and two presidents have been literal television/movie celebrities with no actual business acumen or political experience to justify their placement in the Oval Office (Reagan and Trump, coincidentally).  


So, my question is: What is the role of the internet in this phenomenon? Has it fundamentally undermined the Age of Show Business? Has it been amplified? Is some combination of these possibilities a more reasonable interpretation? Furthermore, what can be done about the mainstream media and the damage is has undeniably caused to the public discourse in North America at large?So, when I went to watch David's [video about the Trump lawyers' letter to Mueller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8ac7T5UJ-8&amp;t=49s), I got a three minute ad for Andrew Klavan's show on the Daily Wire. Needless to say, I was a bit taken aback.

I know David isn't a full-time YT creator like some others - it's more of a side thing for him, so I figured there was a possibility he might not know. Or maybe he does and is totally okay with it - no idea. I just thought it was something someone should bring to his attention in case he doesn't know.Imagine this. A female teacher goes into a bakery to buy a cake for a coworker who is also a female teacher. She wants the cake to read "Happy 10th Anniversary of Teaching Mrs. Anderson!". The baker informs the lady that he cannot use his artistic talent to make a cake for this teacher because it is against his religion. He states "Timothy 2: 12. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet."

You could find many verses in the bible that allow you to discriminate. Where is the line drawn? Couldn't this situation be hostile to the baker's religion and make it okay to decline service?

I guess the commercial inserted into the news story is a good place to start. I honestly don't think I've ever seen any pundit or news show insert a sponsored advertisement into a story that way (maybe Alex Jones does it, I don't know), and with good reason. If I weren't already familiar with Pakman and his show , that would have been a complete non-starter on the segment and the channel for me. I can't think of a much redder flag than that to indicate that the following news coverage may be influenced by the personal financial interests of the person delivering it.

Which brings me to the almost-disclaimer that was issued before the advertisement portion of the segment (that ad was truly wrapped up in a story... I can't get over it). There was no mention of Pakman's investment in Tesla. He confessed to being positive about Musk's endeavors in the past, which is better than nothing. If we can roundly criticize and question Hannity's ethics over failing to disclose being represented by an attorney that he was providing positive coverage to, I don't know why we should be ok with Pakman delivering the most flowery coverage of Musk's breakdown possible (short of cheering Pravda on) while failing to disclose his investment in Musk's flagship project. Yes, he's mentioned it on the show in the past. This was another time to mention it - right before handling Musk with kid gloves. 

Which, in turn, brings me to the coverage, and specifically what was not mentioned in this story. While we're reminded several times how good Musk's intentions are, it's never mentioned that the entire days-long temper tantrum was the result of Tesla getting negative news coverage over working conditions, production issues and the autopilot accident. It's also not mentioned that in his righteous and ignorant rage, he made an ass out of himself by tweeting a link to a supportive article without realizing that the site's credibility is wherever a site's credibility is after it you print actual fake news and are linked to an alleged sex cult. 

So how good are Elon Musk's intentions in this case? Here is an analogy: Elon Musk is the Republican politician who has been oppressing LGBT people his entire career and just discovered he had a gay son, and is now supporting of LGBT rights. Only Musk spent a few days trying to beat everyone over the head over how neglectful they are of the struggles that LGBT people face. I'm not sure that well-intentioned is the first characterization of the incident that I would choose. 

This is a guy whose made himself who he is in an entrepreneurial sense largely on the back of positive media coverage. When he's able to use the media effectively for his personal interests, he doesn't have much to say about things. I've never heard him chiming in on the Iraq War and the role news media played in public support of it. Maybe I've just never come across them, but I don't recall him ever ranting about how the media's quest for neutrality causes them to misrepresent the landscape of the climate change debate where qualified people are concerned. He gets some consistent bad coverage for the first time in the last decade (or however long it's been) since we've learned his name though, and all of the sudden he's foaming at the mouth on Twitter and lecturing the media about their role in electing Trump? *Where was his days-long Twitter rant on the topic in 2016?* I don't recall it.  I do recall him being part of Trump's business panel briefly though, presumably before the depths of Trump's incompetence became fully apparent. It seems his financial interests are more important than those things... and so everyone rally against the media!!!!! It was some ugly demagoguery. 

I can sympathize with not wanting to tarnish everything the man has done, is doing and will do over this. I don't think he deserves that or anything close to it. I also think it's possible to avoid that while reporting more thoroughly on the story. I have a lot of respect for him as well. Just less so in this one regard now.

Anyway, I was disappointed by this segment. Obviously.Under the current system once the federal government appoints a judge they are there FOR LIFE. I understand that judges need to know they can make hard choices without the fear of losing their jobs, but to have people being judges forever is problematic. They stay in power too long. While I don't think judges should change every election cycle like other jobs I propose a system similar to what the Federal Reserve uses

For those who don't know: the Federal Reserve board of governors consists of individuals who are appointed. Each governor sits in a designated seat. One seat is forced to retire every two years, with a governor getting to serve a single 14 year term without the fear of being fired. While I don't think the federal reserve should be run this way, I think this system can have merit in other areas of the country.  

My idea: spread out judges across the country in a staggered form to serve one 15 year term then be retired.

Judges on the supreme court will also be in a staggered form, one judge leaving every 2 years. Each judge would get to serve one 10 year term, and a pre requisite is that this person must have served a minimum of 10 years as a lower judge before moving up. 

What do you think of this idea? Let me know in the comment sectionJudge orders EPA to disclose any science backing up Pruitt’s climate claims

https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/judge-orders-epa-to-disclose-any-science-backing-up-pruitts-climate-claims/Trump's lawyers should take a moment to consider whether or not he even knows what 'obstruct' means, literally. 
Remember when Trump interrupted Clinton's debate point about his taking advantage of the housing crisis, to say "That's called business, by the way."?   That moment was just one of many examples when he has shown not only a willingness but a twisted sort of pride in advantageous unfairness, no different from saying he could shoot someone on 5th avenue and not lose supporters.  When *somebody* leaked a random and fairly old year's worth of his taxes (2005) to the NYT, it happened to be one that displayed him in a relatively good light; he gave to charity, made some money, also lost a lot of money despite being a supposed "business genius," but the genius part about that was he could use it to his advantage, enjoying a major tax break for it and thereby technically breaking no laws.  
Trump's whole career has been one of taking advantage of others' losses and other loopholes, from the moment his father's death gave him a windfall of cash, to all the times the law said he could fuck people over as if it couldn't be helped, laws surrounding the word 'bankruptcy.'  FOUR TIMES he took advantage of the ability to legally wipe others' ruin from his slate, and simply start over.  And then he was able to take advantage of an entire market of others' ruins, people becoming homeless and penniless in their old age. And then he got to have a whole television show about ending people's dreams, extinguishing their hopes. 
What he was never prepared for was laws without loopholes, most notably the law which stands as its' own separate prohibition of trying to 'loophole' your way out of other laws.  Like trying to lie about whether you violated them, or asking other people to lie, firing them if they show unwillingness to lie, and having a fully public tantrum (ha, I accidentally typed 'tantrump' --why isn't that a 'thing' yet?) when someone he hired refused to stay in a position where he could simply shut down the whole question of law-breaking.  
What Trump so clearly struggles to understand is that this is one of those things where governing is nothing like business, indeed nothing else in the legality of life is like business.  Unlike the world structured with endless scaffolds to success, where the bigger you are the harder it is to fail even if everyone smaller fails, the world of criminal justice says "Sorry, there are things you just CAN'T do."  
My hunch is that not only does Trump have trouble grasping this basic concept, he flails around in pretending to understand because it is stated in language he doesn't even possess.  
Trump's lawyers should take a moment to consider whether or not he even knows what 'obstruct' means, literally.  When he told Lester Holt and the world he fired James Comey because he had basically had enough of the investigation, when he keeps tweeting about how none of this would be happening if Sessions hadn't recused himself, when he says he COULD pardon himself, he's saying to the world, "I'm trying take whatever loophole I'm supposed to get to block/stop this nightmare!"  What he doesn't get is that block/stop (or attempt to) is the very meaning of obstruct, and there is no loophole for that. That's NOT called business, by the way. 
The answer as I see it as with most things Trump does is that there is no way to know considering Trump is both dumb and corrupt. Things that might seen like Trump is just making an ignorant mistake may be lying corruption on his part. Things that seem corrupt may be stupidity that Trump, or someone, has convinced him are smart choices.Hello u/Davidpakman, Big Fan. This is a copy of a comment I made towards you earlier but it might have been buried with all the other comments. For full disclosure I do enjoy a lot of what Jordan Peterson says but this is not a defense of Peterson, but it is a defense of the criticism of Post\-Modernism. 

I do not share the opinion that you're defending post\-modernists however, I am aware of your criticism of it's critics. I figured since You're doing a Pseudo\-Science/intellectual segment this week but have yet to slam probably one of the biggest anti\-science movement which is relativism/postmodernist.

A notion of truth, however fuzzy, is needed for everyday life. To have a belief is to be committed to its truth. To assert a sentence in speech is also to be committed to its truth.

To accept an explanation is to think the explanation is true, otherwise it does not explain anything. To give up on a commitment to truth is to abdicate not only the capacity to have beliefs but also personal morality (‘I have not slept with anyone else, honest luv’). Everyday examples also illustrate the intuition that truth is objective.

Relativism is the belief that different theories or beliefs can be equally true relative to different standards. Some degree of relativism is consistent with caring about truth (you may care about legal truths even though they are relative to culture), but the extreme relativism (Postmodernist) shown by some commentators on science is not.

Some of the extreme views are the following:

1. ‘Scientific knowledge is purely the product of social forces, power struggles, and politics. The natural world has no role in the construction of scientific knowledge’. The basis of the claim is the famous under\-determination of theory by data. No matter what the evidence is, there are always a number of possible theories to account for it. Thus, the argument goes, it is the use of rhetoric and power that means one theory is chosen over another. The argument is misguided. First, if evidence underdetermines theory choice, so surely does the social political context. Thus if one does not believe that the natural world influences our theories, why should one believe that the social world does? Second, under\-determination of theory by evidence is a logical claim, but its practical implications are often non\-existent. The theories that the blood circulates, that genes are composed of DNA, that matter is made of atoms and so on are based on evidence that could be accounted for in other ways, but that does not mean there is a single competing theory on or anywhere near the table. Finally, to believe that one’s knowledge is based only on social pressure, not on the facts, is to believe you have no good reasons for your beliefs. There would therefore be no good reason for believing that all knowledge is the product of social forces.
2. ‘There is no absolute truth; true or false is always relative to someone’s perspective, it’s just a preference to believe certain things’. Is the claim that truth is relative to each person true for every person or just for the post\-modernist who believes it? If the former, the claim is absolutely rather than relatively true and the claim contradicts itself; if the latter, then since the claim is not true for me, I rightly will never be convinced by it. Thus such personal relativism is self\-defeating (Lynch, 2005).
3. ‘Physical reality is a social and linguistic construct’. This is a confusion of a representation with the fact it refers to. Sokal and Bricmont (1998, pp. 101–102) present the following passage, sadly from training material for teachers: ‘For many centuries it was considered to be a fact that the Sun revolves around the Earth each day. The appearance of another theory, such as that of the diurnal rotation of the Earth, entailed the replacement of the fact just cited by another: The Earth rotates on its axis each day’. The quote confuses a fact with the representation of the fact. A fact is a situation in the external world that exists whether we know it or not; beliefs represent those facts. If you think your beliefs could be wrong, then you accept a distinction between your belief (the representation) and the fact it targets (the way the world actually is). In the example in the quote, the facts did not change, just their representation. In day\-to\-day life, the distinction between facts and their representations is important to us. If facts are just points of views, why bother with criminal investigations? Do you care whether it is the actual rapist that gets caught? Why not adopt the view one can fly and jump out of an airplane? Blurring the distinction between representations and facts is something few people sincerely wish to do.

Typically people who make such cynical claims about the physical world are naively realist about the social world. However, if there are no objective facts about the physical world, there are no objective facts about the social world. If one is skeptical about the physical world, one should be equally so about the social world. Welcome to the world of solipsists, population: you.

1. ‘The science of one society is no more valid than that of another’. It is true that medical practices in other cultures may have useful components which we should not arrogantly dismiss. Perhaps some herbs in Chinese, African or South American traditions can genuinely cure specific ailments. But there will be a culture\-independent fact as to whether any given herb does have a therapeutic action beyond the placebo effect. The way to find that out is by double\-blind trials. Different cultures may have valuable things to teach each other; but that does not mean that greater evidence for one cultural view (‘that mountain was caused by tectonic pressure’) rather than a competing one (‘that mountain was a giant white lion that fell asleep’) makes no difference. If you had a major heart attack, would you want your friend to call the witch doctor or the medical doctor??

Once again I am not defending Peterson here, I am worried that we might be giving post\-modernism a free pass in the realm of pseudo\-science/intellectualism because of the focus on the messenger. Would love to hear your thoughts.

My first objection is the title itself.  It seems almost deliberately phrased to pettifog.

race is not the **cause** of the iq gap?  obviously

race is also not the cause of differential skin tone, or greater or lesser susceptibility to different diseases, or lactose intolerance.  That is a terrible frame with which to couch the issue.  Because in these latter cases, it's clear that the causal factor is some combination of genes and environmental interactions.  Hold environment constant across all racial populations, you will still get variance based on the components that are based on differential genetics.  

Is this clear?

Now.  The claim is that iq, a proxy for general intelligence, is derived from a combination of the underlying genetics of an individual and their environmental interactions.  I include in the latter epigenetic factors we are unaware of in addition to all the standard sorts of nutrition and socioeconomic and societal influences.  How much of the variance between individuals is based on environment?  No idea.  But I am fairly certain it's not 100&amp;#37;.  If it is NOT 100&amp;#37;, then the portion that is genetic in nature, contributes to some of the differences we see.  This effects differences between individuals AND populations (of which "race" is merely a very broad fuzzily defined category of population).

So while RACE is not the CAUSE of any iq gaps, that DOES NOT IMPLY that the variance in genetics between races is part part of the cause of the differences in average iq we observe.

Is this clear?

Consoling the left:

How can you say that?  You are justifying racism and discrimination, dropping the argument for redistribution to help people, after all, if part of the difference is based on genetics, why bother trying to intervene environmentally and providing aide if it won't matter?

Sammael : Guys.  Calm the fuck down.  Seriously.  Calm down.  No one EVER said it was 100&amp;#37; genetic.  Even if it was found to be 75&amp;#37; genetic, and 25&amp;#37; environmental on average, does anyone think we've entirely exhausted the environmental interventions?  If no, then it still makes sense to put resources behind those.  And for the part that is not environmental?  Redistribution is the answer, and a clawing back on the back end of meritocracy being the ultimate driver for our current mix of outcomes.

One of the greatest confusions of people on both the left and the right, is the assumption that differences in ability leads to some sort of libertarian solution set of a free for all.  The ENTIRE legitimacy of a meritocracy is based on the assumption that people EARN what they produce, via how hard they study and work.  Now add in another variable.  Intelligence, a variable where more of it makes meritocratic endeavors easier to achieve, and less of it means it's harder to get grade X on a test, or perform Y skill compared to someone else that is smarter.  A person with lower intelligence in this model, could work HARDER and longer and be MORE diligent than his more intelligent peer, and still do worse because he was not as sharp and quick as another.  What is the solution to this unjust distribution of talents?  Our capitalistic society is BASED on a meritocracy.  In general, you produce more, you earn more.  You score higher on tests, you get better grades, you are more likely to get into med school, and law school, etc etc.  The solution is to MAINTAIN something closer to a clean meritocracy on the front end, so we still allocate labor and education and degrees and professional credentials to those who are more capable, but on the back end we redistribute.

That is the answer.   And the conservative/libertarian argument against redistribution now takes a monstrous turn.  It would be one thing to argue that differences outcomes based on how hard someone worked and studied is totally justified, and that those who did better and produces more ought to get higher rewards and not have almost any of their earnings go towards those who did not produce as much as they did.

But if PART of what everyone produces is based on their fucking intelligence, a state that NO ONE earns in this life, a stat is linked to ones fucking lineage and more of a genetic lottery, how is it justified to have a society where ALL of ones outcomes in life is based on what an individual produces?  What kind of MONSTROUS/VICIOUS people would look at some guy who had a low paying job, but worked harder than many of his smarter peers that went on to earn much more than he did and say fuck you to the guy with lower earnings if he could not afford healthcare?  What kind of moral monsters would those people be?  IQ differences between individuals and groups UNDERCUT the argument for a more pure meritocracy, at least on the back end.  It makes a society with out some redistribution to raise the floor immensely unjust.

So all the liberals and people on the left who fear the social consequence iq being genetic leading to some sort of libertarian hellscape, the exact opposite is true.  But I know that will not satisfy anyone.  It does not satisfy me.  I still want individuals AND different groups to have more equal aptitude, and if we confirm my assumptions that there are in fact differences linked to genetics then I want us to find a way to FIX those differences via human enhancement.

This is NOT a dead end liberals, but many of you have what I call an equality bias, that you anthropomorphize onto nature itself.  Because WE value equality, such a thing ought to be built into nature as well, so we are going to assume, a priori, that ALL populations/races on the earth have IDENTICAL average intelligence, because how could that not be the case?  That would be unjust, unequal.

Correct.  And here is a lesson lefties.  Nature does not give a flying fuck what any of us consider just or fair.  WE care.  And it is up to us to correct for the injustices of nature.  Turkheimer said we don't have any data linking genetics to intelligence, that's not quite true, there have been some genes linked statistically.  But we need much more data, then we can make predictions of expected iq based on the mix of gene mixes.  Some will likely produce wider ranges of performance based on environment, but others could just as easily provide straight up benefits based on having variant a vs variant b, c, or d.  This information WILL be discovered.  Do not be caught flat footed.  Do not run away from this because you MISTAKENLY think this will give some moral legitimacy to some alt right shit heads.  They are trash, and the world they want to construct does not follow from this.  IF you think it does, you are just as lost as pro choice people who are so worried about conceding a fetus is human life because that would give an edge to the pro life cause.

Spoiler alert:  A fetus is human, and alive.  It's human life.  But it is not a human BEING.  That last is what is special and worth extra protections, but some pro choice lefties are so afraid of conceding because they mistakenly think it will lead to dismantle their pro choice world view.  Stop being so fearful.Full article: https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/06/better-does-not-mean-good

An excerpt:

&gt;"[R]elative comparisons are so often used to draw absolute conclusions. This is particularly true in economics. If sweatshops are a bit more remunerative than agricultural labor, this means that “Actually, Sweatshops Are Good.” If laws against price gouging end up restricting supply, then “price gouging is good for the public.” If capitalism produces a higher standard of living than authoritarian “socialism,” then capitalism is good. If poor people in America today are better off than poor people were during the Great Depression, then poverty isn’t a moral outrage. Arguments of this variety are deployed throughout Steven Pinker’s *Enlightenment Now*, which downplays the complaints of leftists by showing that human beings now are better off than they were during, say, the Holocaust or the Great Irish Famine.

&gt;We can see why arguments of this type fail. If I say that sweatshops are “good,” and my evidence is that when sweatshops were introduced into a country, the wages of those who went to work in the sweatshops were higher than the country’s average wages, I may sound persuasive. But if the factories I am talking about are crowded, unsafe, abusive places in which people exhaust themselves, destroy their bodies, and have little control over their work, it’s perverse to describe this situation as good merely because it is marginally better than what came before. We have to have a notion of “good” independent of mere “better” and “worse.” Otherwise, if “better” means “good,” then a kidnapper who said they would either kill one of my children or both of them would be offering me a “good” choice. Instead, they are offering me two horrific options, one of which I may be stuck with, but which is only “better” in the narrowest sense of the word."

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, before you assume my motives for posting, just letting you know, I barely agree with Jesse on any issues. I support Illegal immigrants, I don't want our tax payer money wasted on some border Wall, pro choice, etc. 

This week, I decided to listen to Jesse's show. We've been talking a lot about racism/discrimination in general for my sociology class, and I thought "hey, I have never really gotten the perspective of a black conservative," so I've been watching a lot of Larry Elder/Jesse Lee Peterson, so I don't let myself become a bubble boy. 

While Jesse is rather hypocritical about racism, saying racism doesn't exist, unless it's against white conservatives, however, I don't think the reason why he has come to that conclusion is because of a lack of intelligence. If you watch videos of debates he's had, he's always defending his position, and has never stepped away from the claim that racism doesn't exist, and when he acts like it does, it's normally to "give someone a taste of their own medicine," which is something Jesse himself said. I think that he's come to this conclusion because of how he was treated by his family. According to Jesse, he hated his father and mother, yet through the "power of Christ," he's "learned" to live in "perfect peace," whatever that means! I think his opinions are the result of religious delusion and not stupidity. 

Despite his speech impediment, he is fairly intelligent. Of course he's not the most intelligent talk show host out there, but he's opened my eyes to perspectives I've never considered before. 

I wish David could be as funny as Jesse Lee Peterson. this entire week, I've supplemented by TDPS podcast listening with Jesse Lee Peterson's show, and I've never laughed as hard as I have at work! Jesse has a good sense of humor! "Children of the lie," "the great white hope" "not all not all NOT ALL, but most blacks,"  "rebuilding the family by rebuilding the man," his catch lines are endlessly hilarious. David needs his own obnoxious catch phrase! Maybe something like "rebuilding the country by rebuilding the economy," or something equally hilarious! with all the political persecutions and ICE practically is a gestapo, DHS keeping people locked up for profit and slave labor,  intimidation and fear, is it worth living like this? would it be better if we/I  just go back and assimilate in our homecountry? what can we do? dont hate me and don't get me wrong i am a daca recipient and i like living, i been thinking about saving a bunch of money and going back to mexico but im 
in a tight spot .

immigrants (we,us) are the scapegoats!
thoughts?




"we shall meet in the place where there is no darknessKeep them, David. Shit’s hilarious!https://soundcloud.com/madamemeow/conversation-with-kim-r-fordI think all the phone calls are hard to hear even the interviews. That coupled with the callers and interviewees not being used to talking on the radio makes me fast forward through those segments. I mostly just want unbiased news with low corruption. That is why I pay for the yearly membership. I know you want to add spice to the show and I appreciate that, but I could care less about the chess game, the hair without gel, the janga... I know you are looking for more money but I already paid without all the spice.

Bernie Sanders, An Actual Progressive, Is Running for President

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeGbKYTNHvc

Senator Bernie Sanders Set to Announce He's Running for President?

_____________________

**This is really self-defeating and may become self-fulfilling prophecy.** David Pakman and his co-host can perfectly say something like this, "Bernie Sanders' policies are popular among American people, and I believe his ideas are good for the country and better than Hillary Clinton's. He doesn't have the name recognition now among the general population; but by the time of primary election days, it may be a different story. He will certainly push Hillary Clinton and the debate to become more progressive, but we don't know if he can win the nomination, especially he's running against the Clinton machine, and Hillary Clinton is already the party favorite that this point.

For those who downvoted, please explain yourselves. If there is a factual error, please point it out.I personally think I that it MUST be the second option David played on the show. That song is outstanding!Hate speech should be distinguished from hate crimes. Hate crimes are forms of criminal misbehavior that are motivated by prejudice or bias, and bias-motivated sentence enhancements impose more severe penalties for crimes when they are motivated by bias, hate speech is expression that vilifies or harasses on the basis of the target’s race, gender, sexual orientation, or other forms of group membership. Hate speech employs discriminatory epithets to insult and stigmatize others on the basis of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or other forms of group membership. 

Debates over hate speech regulation seem to force one to give priority to equality or to liberty. On the one hand, egalitarian concerns may seem to require restricting freedom of expression. Hate speech is an expression of discriminatory attitudes that have a long, ugly, and sometimes violent history. As such, hate speech is deeply offensive to its victims and socially divisive. Though you might well be reluctant to restrict speech, it might seem that the correct response to hate speech, as with other forms of discrimination, is regulation. On the other hand, libertarian concerns may seem to constrain the pursuit of equality. Though you may abhor hate speech and its effects, the solution might seem at least as bad as the disease. Freedoms of expression are among our most fundamental liberties. Offensive ideas are part of the price we must pay to protect these constitutional rights. This being so, it might seem that the correct response to hate speech is more speech—presumably egalitarian speech condemning hate speech—not the restriction of speech.



Do you think  the US(and it's western allies eg. UK, france etc) have done enough to support UN peacekeeping operations?

Would you support larger contributions of troops to UN peacekeeping operations? Or are you satisfied with the current level of contributions? Or do you think contributions should be reduced?

What do you think the policy generally should be towards peacekeeping operations?This kinda relates with the Sam Seder/Jimmy Dore feud. During the 2016 election Jimmy Dore advocated voting based on your political beliefs in the general election. (voting for Jill Stein, writing in for Bernie even in a swing state) Sam Seder advocated for strategic voting which basically means "VOTE HILLARY TO STOP TRUMP". here's a clip of Sam that basically sums up the problem with strategic voting. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWPip\_i1PbE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWPip_i1PbE) here is Jimmy Dore reacting to Sam's take on this flawed logic.

To summarize: If were always going to vote for the lesser of two evils, eventually the two evils will get worse in time.    Is it me or were the callers better this Friday then in the past? I am the first to say that this section is usually pretty poor. This week however callers seemed to be much better as a whole.# In a recent video, David Pakman thought the candidate Alison Hartson was not going to win. I wonder if he can elaborate on the statement.

INSPIRATIONAL Speech From California's Next Senator Alison Hartson [the speech was OK.]



## Personal opinion on Alison Hartson. Cronyism!! 

I don't really like the choice due to the conflict of interests due to heavy endorsement of affiliated organizations: the former national director of Wolf-PAC was endorsed by the Young Turks and Justice Democrats, advised by Cenk Uygur. It all sounds like a case of cronyism, which may cause organizations to endorse a bad candidate. (Surprise?) 

Alison Hartson, despite having a good war chest, did not deliver the on votes. Incidentally, she has a large percentage of contributes from outside California (thanks to the Young Turk's promotion?). But seriously, where did the campaign contribution go??? I mean, she's barely better than other lesser known candidates.

# By the way...

## Gavin Newsom

it is true that **Gavin Newsom is the San Francisco mayor, who is the $10 million flashy socially liberal (on marijuana, death penalty, gay marriage, etc) Democratic Establishment candidate. However, He has many ethical issues, which don't inspire confidence**: from extramarital affairs, drinking problems, to accepting donations from many moneyed interests. 

# Top-X (pick a number) Blanket Primary is still a very terrible way to pick the best candidate

By the way, **the jungle primary is just another soft version of first-past-to-post electoral method, which is not a good voting system at all.** Instead of having one first-past-to-post, it's divided into two stages. Obviously, the spoiler effect, wasted votes and the consideration of tactical voting get accelerated as the number of candidates (including the number of similar candidates) increases. And June 5 Statewide primary in California exemplifies those effects. With so many candidates to choose from, the establishment candidate or candidate with the most recognition is likely to win, while the rest of the votes get diluted among lesser known candidates and thus their candidacies get eliminated. 

By the way, **the voter turnout is as abysmal as it usually is**: hovering around 30% range of eligible voters, and it's pretty bad even on county level (between 20% to 50% range).

Tips for becoming informed voters on ballot initiatives and political candidates: donor information, endorsement, organizations and people who support and oppose, statements, etc.Keep doing it, it's hilarious.Because you know they probably get stabby with knives. It's a tough call for me - Rosanne's got that style and swift grace, but Rosie's got skills like a sushi chef. Or so the word on the streets says, and all. 

Who do you think would dominate their obese opponent?It's fucked up, but it's going to happen. Nutpicking is the fallacious tactic of picking out and showcasing the nuttiest member(s) of a group as the best representative(s) of that group -- hence, "picking the nut". It's cherry picking a poor representative of the group – almost a straw man – to use as ad hominem against the group. For example, antifeminists frequently paint feminists as "feminazis" by highlighting examples of ridiculous or cringey feminist behavior, rather than by critiquing mainline feminist writings. In other words: every movement has crazies, but not every movement is crazy. The proper questions are: "Does this movement promote crazies?" and "Does this movement have proportionately more crazies?" 

In scholarly circles, "nutpicking" is called the weak-man fallacy.

Nutpicking combines elements of several other fallacies; it primarily relies on guilt by association by seeking to tarnish a movement's reputation by associating it with what the "nut" is saying or doing, knowing that these statements or actions are generally considered to be unacceptable, if not outright reprehensible. Secondly, it is a type of ad hominem as it attacks an opponent's character (via the negative association), rather than countering the opponent's actual views or arguments.

The advent of the Internet has made nutpicking far easier due to the massive expansion of recorded, publicly available and searchable material. Similar to Skarka's Law, it's practically always possible to find some random whack-job whose opinions can be associated with your opponent's school of thought, and it's certainly much easier than it would have been in ancient Greece.

It should go without saying that all groups have their extremists, and the Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory (i.e., Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total Fuckwad) still readily applies to sites like Tumblr and Reddit.

All criteria and all counting methods considered...Just a thought. Seriously, do it. She does not hold back.Obama saved our entire economy from a literal depression when he came into office! Obama did more than Trump/Republicans have under his first two years.
Obama's accomplishments in the first 74 days, before the Democrats lost their filibuster proof Senate majority.
-Lily Ledbetter Act, which overturned the 5-4 Republican-appointed Supreme Court decision that formally legalized pay discrimination against women (which affects family incomes as well).
-Passed one of the largest tax cuts on the middle class in the history of the United States. The only middle class tax cut that was larger was the one signed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, which was proposed by JFK in 1963 (which also eliminated dividend withholding and other loopholes resulting in the corporate tax rate going from 37% to 43% as it was a tax hike on the wealthy)
-Saved Chrysler (this loan has been paid back with interest)
-Saved General Motors (this loan has been paid back with interest)
-Reversed 800,000 monthly job losses into monthly job gains, a situation they inherited from the Republican-controlled Congress and Republican president
-Increased federal education spending, which has a $5.60 tax revenue return on investment
-Cut the cost of student loans in half. To note, higher education spending has a near $7 tax revenue return on investment.
-Strengthened hate crime laws
-Expanded the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
-Reformed child labor laws
-Passed Wall Street reform, Dodd Frank
-Passed historic credit card reform along with the CFPB, which had a number of reforms, including capping late fees at $25 and capping interest rate hikes.
-Stopped predatory payday lending to our troops
-Reversed the Republican policy of ending payment to troops for stop-loss time and started compensating our troops for stop-loss time.
-Ended torture by law, which every study our government conducted found was counterproductive, as it actually created terrorism and gave false information to our military which cost lives, weakened our ability to successfully complete military objectives (including larger objectives of winning wars) and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars to investigate false information we received due to torture. If you think our cops here in America shouldn't use torture to get answers because it would lead to false confessions, which would lead to innocent civilians being convicted for the crimes of others, while the guilty would walk free more often as a result, then you're right. It's exactly the same with the military.
-Passed VA Reform which hired thousands of additional doctors, which is the entire problem with the VA (there is a labor shortage of doctors and as more troops come home, Republicans refuse to hire additional doctors)
-Passed a law to allow women to serve on submarines and with equal pay for equal work.
-Passed a historic nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia
-Passed a law which forced BP Oil to be responsible for their damages in the Gulf of Mexico, which cost BP over $20 billion, which saved taxpayers from taking the bill as the Republicans wanted.
-Strengthened the EPA, which studies have been found to have a positive economic impact. Every single study shows that EPA regulations CREATE jobs. The EPA has cost the economy roughly $50 billion over the last 10 years and created $900 billion over the last 10 years in GDP. It's an undeniable fact. Just think about it. If there's a new regulation for a smoke screen, someone has to manufacture it, design it, incorporate it in their business by hiring another employee etc. The EPA creates millions of high paying jobs. It's just that trump and his corporate oligarchs don't want to hire Americans.
-Broadened the powers of the FDA to crack down on the predatory food industrial complex. Studies also show that the FDA has an undeniable positive impact on the economy.
-Passed funding for the 9/11 responders which Republicans opposed and fought.
-Repealed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy
-All of that was in 74 days. After that, they did not have a filibuster proof Senate. They did not expect to lose their filibuster proof Senate majority as well, so in retrospect they could have done even more if they knew their days were numbered.Good for DeNiro.

# Poll workers are very low paid ($150 to $200 per election), and are often first-timers. Thus, it's not surprise that the poll workers are in constant shortage and are generally incompetent. I would like to poll workers to be evaluated more carefully in the hiring process, too -- given that they are adequately paid in the first place.

#### Findings: 

It appears that... 

1) poll workers (even poll officials) are basically volunteer positions. They are paid with very little compensation for their work  ($150 to $200 per election). And...

2) Most of the poll workers are just first-timers. 

3) In terms of training, they attend short online courses, and then do in-person training. On the election day, if there are questions, they refer to the big procedural manual. If they can't find the answers, call a specific answer. If they make a mistake, that's too bad for the voters. I would like poll workers to be made of permanent members, not ad hoc members. 

#### Results: 

1) This make them rather incompetent, as they are clueless about many basic procedures and knowledge, and...

2) It appears that poll workers are in constant shortage (and it's not surprising why this is case given how little they are paid).  


#### Significance: 

1) This thankless, mundane positions in elections are rather critical in terms of protecting the integrity of the election. They basically need to make sure ballots are put in right place, and know how to resolve problems that may arise, and when to use provisional ballots and when not to, and what to do if the person's name is not on the roster.  

2) Like any other positions, workers need to be adequately paid as well as trained in order to be competent. 

# It appears that American voters are encouraged to vote, but they are not given a good guidance as to how to evaluate candidates. 

One particular thing that I find lacking is a centralized place to find all the necessary and important information about the candidate. This makes doing research much easier. For every candidate, the following information should have included: candidate statements, campaign contribution information, positions on the issues (and any conflicting positions), voting records and other decisions while in government (if any), endorsements from various organizations, scores or ratings from various political organizations, candidate interviews  and debates (video or audio formats preferred), past experience, and educational background. 

**Also, voters are not taught on how to evaluate candidates in the first place. This result in many voters make bad choices even when they vote.** This should go without saying, but a democracy to function properly, teaching voters on how to judge candidates is crucial. 

Just for your information:

Dore goes to a forum on brutal oppression and human rights violations by totalitarians and tries to make it about America. As if America is a comparable undemocratic human rights violator.

Dore lies here and says that Sanders 2016 lost was ELECTION FRAUD!  The man is lying and dividing the progressive left.

He had a vid the other day where him and his guest were accusing Sanders of being a sellout and no longer progressive enough and that progressive should not vote for Sanders in the future.

He also expresses support for the leftist dictatorial regime in Venezuela.

He is falsely accusing these people and Kasparov of being human rights scammers.   Kasparov has been doing this forever and at great risk from the typical reprisals from Vladimir Putin.  He had a long podcast with Sam Harris last year that I though was great.

I think Dore just wants to grow and capture an anti-Democrat leftist audience.  He is an anti-Democrat leftist entertainer.  He spends about 10 times as much time critiquing(often falsely so) Dems from the left then he does critiquing Trump/Republicans. Maybe he will be the Greens next presidential spoiler.

TYT should cuts ties with him.In post-Trump America, in which we have a normal president, could it be conceivable that our next president may talk of Trump as some odd sort of anomaly?  I almost get the sense that world leaders understand that Trump is the oddball out and that this isn't typical for the US.  And because of this, they hold back somewhat. I'm not saying the US are saints, but in the sense of the US having a degree of competence.  World leaders must understand this right?

Trumps behavior at the G-7 summit was very childish.  A weak leaders perception of a strong leader.  The memes circulating of Trump sitting down around the world leaders is very apt in describing his cognitive decline and childlike behavior.  Almost as though he's a trouble making brat and is ruining everyone's day.

I mean; We have Obama basically apologizing for Bush, but this is on a whole new level of incompetence. 

"Trump does not represent America, and I am very much interested in putting things back together with our allies". Correction: One of the two is a wannabe dictator.David, 

As a person who deals with well treated psychiatric conditions, and has students who have died from suicide, in my teaching career, thank you for taking the time out of the first break of your show today - it really is an important issue that you broke down very succinctly and clearly without oversimplifying it.

Thank you for promoting the national suicide prevention lifeline, it has helped me and many others.  

&lt;3In response to David Pakman show's recent video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbQKi1mwJNU

What Does David Admire About Conservatives?
In summary,

a) his main argument seems to be that 2015-net-neutrality regulations are adding too much regulation-cost to the small/rural vendors. 
So he is trying to remove the govt (communist govt :)) restrictions and enable free trade. 

** I still dont understand "how net-neutrality adds SO MUCH REGULATORY COST to small ISPs" **

b) He completely ignores/discredits the negative effects of the repeal as just "fear-mongering from the net-neutrality-supporters". he expects us to believe that for-profit ISPs will always be fair :) and FTC to regulate it in case of violations. Ill start this by saying I am a bit strange and do my best to listen to a few different sources for news. Some that are on the left others that are on the right. I enjoy Pakmans show and listen daily.

Today on their respective shows, Pakman and Dave agreed on almost everything. The G7, the tariffs and the North Korea summit. 

I do think that this speaks volumes as to what is going to come from the summit, and how terribly idiotic these tariffs are.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZm\_mpbKX5c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZm_mpbKX5c)I am new to the Chapo crew.  Who did the Chapo crew support voting for in Nov. 2016? Clinton? The Greens? Something else?According to [a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/poll-economic-satisfaction-under-trump-isn-t-helping-his-party-n880721), the youngest voters in the country, at least so far, aren't showing sufficient engagement in politics. Just 30 percent of voters under 35 rank their interest in the midterms at either a nine or a 10 out of 10. That's compared to 39 percent who said the same in October 2006, the last time a Democratic wave swept the nation in a midterm year. 

If you want the government to take notice of the issues you care about—safe schools, income inequality, the environment and climate change—nothing matters more than voting. Nothing matters if you don't vote. If you're someone who thinks "Well, if none of us vote, the powers-that-be will have no choice but to start listening", you're, with respect, delusional. Scam Artist in chief just gave the evil dictator a win for nothing. We both know N. Korea is going to drag out the deal and or cheat themselves. Before, I go any further. I'm just going to ramble a lot. So, don't mind me. 

This would explain why American leaders don't make deals with N. Korea. Kim aka Rocket Man is playing Trump like a violin. 

What makes this event so sad. Russia dictator Putin is just laughing at us like the rest of the world. Trump won't win trade wars with America's allies.

I have a bad feeling that Donny boy is going to get a big ego boost by the right. The hypocrite Lindsey Graham who knows N. Korea breaks away from US deals. Said third time's a charm for North Korea deal with America. 

Lastly, the deal is simply kicking America force out Asian territory like the  Korean peninsula. Kim won't throw away his country nuclear weapons or any weapons for that factor[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuOYA6Dhjb8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuOYA6Dhjb8)

It's an interview with Andrew Yang and he talks about UBI and employment and the record levels of people out of the workforce.From this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbQKi1mwJNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbQKi1mwJNU)

So Perhaps David was being facetious or maybe he was honestly asking, I thought a bit about what I find positive about conservatives despite not sharing almost any of their political conclusions. So this are some tenants about conservatives that I find admirable.

* It is important to teach young people about responsibilities. "I recommend that the Statue of Liberty be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the west coast." Viktor Frankl. That seems about right to me.
* The fundamental assumptions of Western civilization are valid.  
* People should be paid so that they are able and willing to perform socially useful and desirable duties.
* We should judge our political system in comparison to other actual political systems and not to hypothetical utopias.

There can be nuanced opinions on these tenant's that are rarely discussed honestly but I find these ideas largely valid.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LquIQisaZFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LquIQisaZFU)

]I've been kind of paying attention a little to what Andrew has been saying and I have to admit he is making a lot of sense to me. 

What do you guys think about his proposals? Am I nuts?

Has David Pakman mentioned him at all? The US essentially handed Kim Jong Un concrete consessions, while demanding or stipulating none in return. North Korea made a vague pledge to denuclearization, how will that happen? Will North Korea even partake in any internationally recognized verification? 

I suppose this is all premature, since Trump prefers to wing every large scale international policy change - and that the real work will commence in the following years. Either way, we are entering uncharted territory, with immense hurdles on the horizon and a pessimistic historical record.

Let us be perfectly clear, Trumps foreign policy (this included) is almost solely designed to increase domestic popularity and secure an eventual re-election. This major play for the midterm elections is paramount, since a Democratic victory could threaten impeachement or worse. 

This is nothing new of course, but the potential for self sabotage is surely unprecedented. Trump is willing to burn every bridge, alienate allies and endanger his country in order to promote his brittle gorilla image. His ego is **everything**. This could be his undoing, and ours.

That said, I'll be happy to cautiously praise movement on North Korea, ... While awaiting real and concrete progress.Just wondering I never saw the original video but I saw the one that was recently posted and David seemed unsure still.

Thanks reddit :-)On the show, in the ["Florida Didn't Do Gun Background Checks for 1 Year Because Employee Couldn't Log In"](
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uzTUNqin82c) segment, you referred to Hanlon's Razor without calling it by the name Hanlon's Razor, and but you couldn't remember who came up with it. 

Named after the writer Robert J. Hanlon, Hanlon's Razor states:-

"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."Just wanted to ask a light hearted sports related question; to break from the usual political stuff. Anyone else here love soccer? What teams are you going for during the World Cup?Why is it President Trump's responsibility to punish Russia for something that not only did not happen on his watch but for an issue that should be no concern of the United States? Liberals/Progressives/Democrats are not paying attention. 
There will be no Blue Wave. 
That is all based on wishful thinking. The same thinking that got Trump elected. The idea that the universe has a force for equality and that power sways between sides. 
The idea that no one on mass will keep making the same mistake. 
They aren't paying attention. 
Supreme Court allowed for voter purges. 
Corporate Democrats cleaned up in the primaries. 
We don't have any choices again. 
Michelle Lujan Grisham the Democratic Party candidate for governor of New Mexico is the owner of a private insurance firm that denied customers coverage leading to deaths.
She runs against Pearce. He agrees with Trump on all things. He will win.
Why? Because of what the Democratic Party doesn't understand. 
What Dems hate, Reps love. They smear Pearce by saying he is anti-DACA, Reps love that. 
Grisham is an active participant in the prevention of Americans getting healthcare. Dems hate that. 

Who do dems have to choose? No one. They don't show up. Reps win for the third time in a row. 

Dems need a Progressive party like Reps have an Anarcho Capitalist party. We need a real option. 

IT WILL NEVER BE THE DEMOCRATS!

They will not change. The Reps are correct when they say it's the same party as the OG KKK. 
Democrats are a conservative party and until we understand this and make a real alternative we will continue our slide into a Crypto Fascist Oligarchy. 


I'm noticing when Progressive media reports like David and TYT for example talk about North Korea, it seems like they *have* to make a disclaimer that even though they're going to critically analyze the North Korea situation, they don't WANT to "nuke Korea"...as if that fact wasn't already glaringly obvious.

Just months ago, when Trump threatened "fire and fury," his supporters on the right seemed like they were all in favor of wiping North Korea off the face of the earth. But NOW, when those on the left and the few moderate conservatives critically comment on the meeting saying that nothing has in fact happened and Kim Jong-Un is still a dangerous and brutal dictator, the same people who supported Trump's inflammatory rhetoric have made a total 180 and automatically jump to the immediate "conclusion," that anyone who is not convinced that the meeting yesterday at face value, was very effective — want to *nuke* North Korea.

Just today I was having another Reddit conversation where I stated that I think Kim Jong-Un is still an incredibly dangerous person and I think the country would be better off without him in control of it, and someone else immediately responded, "so you want to nuke North Korea?"

Where are they getting this idea?!One of the top things Russia has gotten out of Trump is the destabilization of the NATO and western alliances, shifting the rest of the world away from America which default makes them more likely to be friendly to Russia.Pretty interesting interview on Vox yesterday with political scientist David Faris. 

[https://www.vox.com/2018/5/1/17258866/democratic\-party\-republicans\-trump\-election](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/1/17258866/democratic-party-republicans-trump-election)

  
Well worth a read. In brief he argues that policy is not particularly important. We are making a mistake in thinking that by having better policies on offer than the Republicans, that Democrats will be rewarded by voters. When so many people are low information/single issue voters they may benefit from a policy but have no idea who was actually responsible for it. As an egregious example, we've all seen the stories of impoverished Trumpists in Appalachia using the Affordable Care Act but didn't know the ACA and Obamacare were the same thing and didn't make the connection between the continuity of their health care and who they voted for. As depressing as it is, many voters just don't connect dots like this. They know the national debt is going up, but if asked who or what is to blame for it, most people couldn't began to tell you.   


What Faris argues is that we need to stop trying to win the policy war and start trying build in structural advantages that will elect more Democrats. That is what the Republican party has methodically done over the last decade(google Project Red Map and the Powell Memo). And it is paying off big time for them. They have taken advantage of ambiguities in the Constitution to play dirty build structural advantages for their party. Mitch McConnell denying Merrick Garland a hearing is an example, as their plan to put an immigration question on the census. They have built so many structural advantages for themselves that Democrats can get more congressional votes but still lose congress. Faris gives some examples of things Democrats can do to start stacking the deck in their favor. For example breaking large liberal states into smaller states to give more Senate votes. It's pretty crazy that California and Rhode Island have the same number of Senators.

And frustratingly, I hear very little public discussion of what it would take to dismantle the Republican structural advantages which is really what is winning them elections. Republican presidents have only won the popular vote twice since the end of the cold war while Democrats have won it 6 times.  Yet Republicans have been president 50&amp;#37; of the post\-Reagan years. I hereby coin the term temporal relativism to describe the tendency of some to resort to the refrain "We can't/shouldn't judge X person or X people by today's standards". 

I find temporal relativism ironic because many who engage in it are the same sort who deplore cultural relativism. It could even be argued that temporal relativism is cultural relativism, or a form of cultural relativism, given the ever-changing nature of culture. 

More to come. 

Background: Einstein's diaries reveal he may have been xenophobic towards Chinese people. (Google it. Google "Einstein's diaries racism").I wonder what the country would be like today if men like congressman Thaddeus Stevens had gotten their way after the Civil War. He was a radical republican abolitionist that wanted to treat the defeated South like conquered territories, confiscate slave owners land for former slaves and occupy it with federal troops to protect them. I really think we'd be in a much better world today. I would have also redivided former confedirate states into new states not readmitted them as they were. Also I'd have tried at the very least all persons who took up official government post within the Confederate States.How the hell is that going to work with Trump alienating and insulting our closest Allie's and neighbors?He will not be happy. Putin and the King of SA doing casual handshakes. 

Give it a few days... trump will be in Russia supporting the team he thinks will win.
[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/744clu/cant_unsubscribe_to_david_pakman_show/) to which David himself replied, suggesting I contact through the website, which I promptly did and never got a reply. I have emailed, left voicemails, and posted here. I have been trying to cancel this subscription for 2 years. It was a direct credit card subscription, not Paypal. Last week, I was charged yet again.

The website will not allow me to log in to cancel, says no account exists for my email.

I receive no replies to inquiries.

I respect the show but this customer mishandling is absurd. Short of cancelling my credit card, how can this be put to rest?Per the FT:

According to the 568-page report from Michael Horowitz, the justice department’s inspector-general, Former FBI director James Comey acted improperly in his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation but was not politically motivated in his actions. 

The 18-month review of the agency’s investigation into Mrs Clinton’s email server criticised senior officials for errors in judgment and said private texts sent by FBI officials had damaged the bureau’s reputation. However, the report did not find evidence that politics drove the decisions made in the Clinton investigation or the determination not to prosecute Mrs Clinton.

The inspector-general faulted Mr Comey for his announcement in July 2016 that he would not recommend charges be brought against Mrs Clinton for sending classified information through a private email server, and said he had “made a serious error of judgment” in revealing shortly before the 2016 election that he had reopened the investigation.

Mr Horowitz also found that Mr Comey used a personal email account for some unclassified FBI business.

Mrs Clinton, for her part, mocked Mr Comey’s use of a personal email account. “But my emails,” she said on Twitter. (lol)

My personal opinion: Comey is a son of bitch and must not be forgiven for his conduct during the 2016 election. The following has had about the same chance of happening for almost every day since 1953: Korean war 2 could start tomorrow.

Same thing about WW3 since 2014.

It is not about chances of making sense. It would never make sense. It is about chances of Putin or Kim-jong Un wanting a really bad and dumb thing.

School shooters tend to write manifestos or make videos about the reasons. The 2011 Norway mass shooter Brevik wrote a whole book. Putin gave dumb reasons about his Ukraine invasion. If he decides to start WW3, he will give just slightly more dumb reasons. 

Method of violence matters: Like school shooters probably would not like to kill with timed bombs or poison gas, Putin probably would not like using nukes anywhere or chemical weapons on frontline battles. Kim-jong Un also would try to invade and conquer, which means using artillery shells on defensive positions, not on civilian population in Soul...

Korean war 2 could be part of WW3. 

Korean war 2 could have more casualties than WW3 without new Korean war, assuming no nukes and same duration. Border between EU+Ukraine+Norway and Russia is more sparsely populated than Korea.Specifically, how will this negatively impact the DP show? DP is on youtube which is owned by google, a big player in cyberspace. So I can't see how I won't be able to watch his show anymore.It goes without saying that by partner, I presuming your partner is the biological parent of your kid(s).David, do you think Kyle Kulinski and Jimmy Dore are just useful idiots criticizing Rachel Maddow, or do you think there's something more to their motives?I think prisoners should be able to form unions and have the minimum wage etc. It depresses everyone’s wage to have slave labor. Trump’s immigration plans are really just to enslave Mexicans in private prisons and hire them there for a cheaper rate.
On the other side, a minimum wage worker has to get welfare assistance to survive. They never have any leftover money. A prisoner gets room and board for free. They cost the state on average $31,286 per year. If they work $1/hr for 2000 hours that’s free room and board plus $2,000 to spend or get stolen from you. If they paid them minimum wage and then deducted the cost of living of each inmate giving them an income of zero or negative, would that really be more humane?[Jordan Peterson Dangerous People Are Teaching Your Kids](https://youtu.be/LquIQisaZFU)

1. They don’t want to undermine western civilization, they want to emphasize it. Just as the enlightenment moved us away from patriarchy, oppression, religion etc. they are just continuing the movement. The only ones trying to destroy western civilization are the ones trying to destroy and attack our colleges at any angle possible (people like you) which will lead China to leading the world.
2. You aren’t funding it. Public Colleges pay for themselves by increasing salaries of those who attend. It’s a $7:$1 investment.
3. No one argues those absolutes. You are strawmanning their argument because their argument is factual and correct. Some sex differences are social constructs, for example crying is not feminine by nature. Men can be nurses, etc. No one said western imperialism is the sole source of all third world problems, it’s simply a source and you can’t refute that so you strawman the argument.
4. Colleges do not teach mobs to shut down speakers in any way or fashion. Protesting is an embracement of free speech. Not wanting to pay for someone else’s speech is not violating their free speech. I do not have a right to speak at Harvard. Violence is condemned by colleges. It’s a crime done by individuals, but you now conveniently see collective groups when it fits your narrative.
5. There is no language police. There is not a single law mandating a single gender pronoun. This is a lie. If you’re referring to anti-bullying policies that have expanded from not being able to say the n-word to now not being able to call someone a fa**ot then you don’t understand that the Supreme Court has ruled that schools can have rules on speech if it interrupts the process of the school. This is universal. I couldn’t say god damn in elementary or high school or fuck. In fact, the origins of the speech codes are from the religious right who got the FCC to ban curse words on television during daytime hours.
6. If you’re referring to diversity policies, they are proven to increase the quality of the education experience. African Americans who get placed in higher colleges by affirmative action have been proven to perform equal to white students who don’t have their scores changed, indicating that on average African Americans test scores when entering colleges are deflated due to various socioeconomic and cultural disadvantages.
7. The radical left did not become the professors of today. This is a conspiracy theory.
8. Students learn to think critically, write clearly, and speak properly in college and do so today more than ever. Studies prove that college has this effect if you don’t believe it. College educated citizens are the most knowledgeable, have the most critical thinking capacity etc. and this is compared to other people who are equal other than not attending a college.
9. Completing an English degree and not encountering Shakespeare is an anecdote. Almost everyone does learn about him. I have no idea if your anecdote is true. If it is, I have no idea if it is because a specific English degree specializes where knowledge of Shakespeare is not needed. Possibly due to Republican budget cuts to public universities because they listen to you.
10. Yes, diversity is not by opinion. Opinions are not protected classes of individuals. You must not understand the basics of civil rights.
11. Equality of opportunity requires equality of outcome in certain aspects, such as free education, healthcare, access to nutrition and clean water etc. No college teaches the type of equality of outcome that you are referring to, where all incomes are the same.
12. Inclusion is proven to account for deflated test scores that specific protected classes have. Martin Luther King believed in quotas and affirmative action.
13. There is no attack on free speech. You have no right to get paid to speak at a college. Students have a right to protest. Colleges teach and embrace free speech.
14. Colleges do admit that capitalism has raised millions out of poverty. But there has never been a free market. In America, the founders gave free land and free college, as well as providing free mail, police, courts, currency and property rights protections. Colleges still teach to embrace regulated markets because they are proven to be more efficient. America has had seven depressions and the Great Recession. Additionally, the middle class is a creation of the government. Real wages tripled under FDR. Alternatively, real wages dropped under Ronald Reagan.
15. China’s public sector is roughly 70% of its GDP. Venezuela is 40% for reference. China has lifted people out of poverty faster than any country in the history of the world. Do you advocate adopting their system?
16. In Venezuela, median incomes more than doubled when adjusted for inflation, poverty and deep poverty dropped in more than half under Hugo Chavez. It’s a complicated picture and their main economic problems are due to monetary policies of their government (not tying the value of their dollar to the market) Venezuela is a case against corruption, incompetence, printing of currency, and authoritarianism. It is also a case that proves that social programs enhance the lives of the people. 
17. Post-modernists do believe in individuals. You are an individual that is part of a collective. That’s how a military works. Group sacrifice.
18. There are victims and oppressors. Especially without unions, employers have more leverage than employees. This is proven by the fact that wages do not match productivity. That is stolen wages by the employer class.
19. Class struggle did not originate with Karl Marx. It originated back in ancient times even with the Bible and in modern times with the enlightenment and the American and French Revolutions which were class and collectivist struggles.
20. Communism did not fail. Not everywhere Marx’s ideas were implemented were authoritarian. Revolutionary Catalonia or the Paris Communes were decentralized, democratic communist countries. The Soviet Union’s median income went from less than 500 USD per year in 1919 to over 10,000 USD per year by the time they collapsed. This put them ahead of Mexico and officially as a high-income country by the World Bank. That is not a complete failure by any metric even if you are very critical of their horrific regime which I am. China’s economy grew at 5% annually in real GDP under Mao and their economy is roughly 70% public sector/centrally planned and they are the most successful economy in the history of the world.
21. Marxism has nothing to do with identity politics. Marxism saw the economy as the root of all problems including social issues. Identity politics rejects core Marxist beliefs. Identity politics simply uses identity to address issues that specific groups face alone. For example, if a Republican politician talks about losing your job as a coal miner and the attack on traditional values, he is using identity politics and speaking to white people. If a Democratic politician speaks about environmental racism where pollutants are released specifically in minority communities for racist intent, which Obama addressed through the EPA and Trump is ending, that is also identity politics.
22. Post-modernists are not neo-Marxists. That is a smear, an ad hominem attack, and a conspiracy theory.
23. It has enhanced our universities. Our universities now produce the most productive and educated workers in the world. We have the best public universities in the world in America and they are one of the highlights that America still has.

Note: Many that read this post think that I defended communism. I did not. JFK and Nixon when debating in the 1960 Presidential race talked openly about the fact that the Soviet Union had faster GDP growth and rising wages than America during the 1950s. That they only were poorer because America started off with a 150 year lead. China and Russia before communism were some of the poorest countries in the world, similar to Ethiopia or Afghanistan today. The fact is that their economies grew rapidly, especially China and that incomes increased while poverty decreased. This doesn’t change the evil of their regimes. It just means that when Peterson says that communism “caused starvation” or that Venezuela’s socialism “failed” that those points are false. There are many reasons to critique those regimes and I do, but those are not factual critiques.This is an interesting and instructional question in my view. I'm curious if anyone has any structural critique along these lines that would explain limitations on electoral success for Progressive and Liberals alike. I personally think there's a strong favorability toward more Conservative politics, especially within the context of the European political development in the last 30-40 years - there is an almost undeniable slow deconstruction of Social Democracy occurring. How come? What are the major themes or events behind this process? Does anyone recognize any particular qualities about how our society or economy functions that would make Conservatism dominant or successful electorally?David missed another very real possibility with the Cohen situation. The evidence against Cohen could be indisputable and he is refusing his lawyer’s advice to flip and mitigate the damage. He is possibly holding out loyalty hoping the president will pardon him. Check out the comments under this china tariff article on fox news

The article talked about some retaliatory tariffs, but if you read the comments it's quite clear the most liked comments are those propping up the presidents anti free trade policy.

Even if you think that is a better tack to take, it just shows even more how full of shit their base always was.  Even now, the reason they seem animated in favor circles around us vs them rhetoric, not wanting "other countries" to take advantage of us and get handouts via trade deficits.

Everything is couched as them being oppressed and taken advantage of to pay for some other.  And it's policy independent.Slight correction: Only the wealthy can be called philanthropists";" moderate income people who donate to charities are not called so. And sounds unfair.

**And I would like to add that by doing so, the media make it seem like the wealthy are more charitable than average people (relative to their income), even though the opposite is actually true.** 

_Wealthy Americans Are Giving Less Of Their Incomes To Charity, While Poor Are Donating More_

### Also, on the motivations of charitable givings among the wealthy and other socioeconomic groups during economic downturn.

&gt; “Lower and middle-income people know people who lost their jobs or are homeless, and they worry that they themselves are a day away from losing their jobs. They’re very sensitive to the needs of other people and recognize that these years have been hard,” Palmer says.

&gt; Higher-income people tend to give proportionately less during tough economic times, says Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy.

&gt; “The downturn was a shock to so many of them, and they’ve been nervous and cautious,” she says.

### Also, the wealthy and average people give charitable donations to very different organizations. 

The shift has likely meant less money flowing into universities, hospitals and cultural institutions, which the wealthy tend to patronize. Lower- and middle-income donors often give to social service organizations, Palmer says. In part because these groups have had fewer dollars to give, those organizations have still faced a squeeze.

## Why the Rich Don't Give to Charity

The wealthiest Americans donate 1.3 percent of their income; the poorest, 3.2 percent. What's up with that?

https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/04/why-the-rich-dont-give/309254/


&gt;If you scanned the press releases, or drove past the many university buildings, symphony halls, institutes, and stadiums named for their benefactors, or for that matter read the histories of grand giving by the Rockefellers, Carnegies, Stanfords, and Dukes, you would be forgiven for thinking that the story of charity in this country is a story of epic generosity on the part of the American rich.

&gt; The relative generosity of lower-income Americans is accentuated by the fact that, unlike middle-class and wealthy donors, most of them cannot take advantage of the charitable tax deduction, because they do not itemize deductions on their income-tax returns.

# charitable donations are no substitutes for progressive income taxation and government welfare programs

&gt; Underlying our charity system—and our tax code—is the premise that individuals will make better decisions regarding social investments than will our representative government. Other developed countries have a very different arrangement, with significantly higher individual tax rates and stronger social safety nets, and significantly lower charitable-contribution rates. That strange trailer-like propaganda film was ok to try. Actually, it may have been the best reason for the summit, better reason than Trump talking, because diplomacy happens anyway in other ways, like it has happened for decades without any summit. Was Trump meeting necessary excuse to show it? South Korean leader could have done the same, probably...I firmly believe that all of the reporters who are employed by a media outlet based in the United States of America, when asked by #45 "Who do you work for?" should proudly answer "I work for the people of the United States!"  They keep on feeding him his lines like a straight man in a comedy duo.  Stating the company name is only giving him one opportunity after another to disparage their employers and discredit their work.

To me this is akin to David's idea of the reporters showing solidarity by asking the same question as the previous reporter when it was evaded or shut down by someone representing the false narrative peddling adMenstration.

The reporters could be more powerful if they banded together over how to be treated with respect, even while differing over their various takes on what just happened and how they will present it to their respective audiences.This was an astoundingly stupid comment to make &amp; I’m disturbed how Sam Harris is quick to call bad faith &amp; dishonesty on others but then makes insanely hyperbolic &amp; over the top equivalences.

I don't particularly have an issue with Joe Rogan giving the alt-right a platform for discussion in regards to their views but I don't think there's a fair balance of view points on his show. Generally, the only people who tend to be guests on his show and identify on the left are comedians and those shows aren't particularly politically driven. I would love to see an open discussion between David and Joe as I think David has an extremely reasonable left-leaning viewpoint on a lot of issues that would be very beneficial to heard on a (somewhat) neautral platform such as that.

Discuss?Economic Policy after the Financial Crisis: John Maynard Keynes, 2009
by Kai Burmeister and Till von Treeck

http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2009/08/393490.shtml

Keynes saw political control of markets and a distribution and social policy in favor of lower income groups as essential prerequisites for a stable long-term macro-economic development..Three-hour workdays or a 15-hour week would be enough. The current crisis offers the chance to redefine goals like economic growth, reducing working hours and environmental protection. I seriously don’t know how Greg Abbott enjoys a high approval rating, as someone who lives in Texas, he deserves an approval rating as low as Trump’s.

The chilling truth is: they probably work in a low paid job and produce some of your material neccessities. The shittiness of their life makes your products so nicely affordable. Everyone who reads this is in an insane position of privilege pretty much by birth right. If you accept this reality and really take it seriously by imagining it, you can´t like capitalism anymore. Not if you have any empathy at all.I listen to the podcast and love it, but I don't have time to tune into every episode - in fact I miss most. Some of my favorite videos/podcasts with David are when he's interacting with someone else. I imagine his podcast must be filled with some interviews/debates. If so, can anyone point me to those episodes (the dates, I suppose)?Ok, I'm a bit high right nowand thinking weird shit, but follow me for a moment. 

Elon Musk has said many times that Mars is the only hope for our survival and we need to get there asap. Let's assume that he's going to make it: who will own the place? It's probably going to be his private property. And then, when Earth will be screwed (and it will be, unless the youth of the world will start organizing and fight for its future) with no authority in the universe - literally - above him, what will the place look like? Welcome to libertarian dystopia. All the place will be owned by fucking Tesla. Obviously the rich ones will buy shares while the working class will go back to XIX century living conditions. 

Try to look as far as he does. Am I going crazy?I've noticed when using language to describe a concept, many academics end sentences within their explanations with the filler word "right". 

For example, "When the stoplight turns yellow, you're supposed to apply the brakes, right(?/!)"

David does this constantly and I would like to explain why I think his speaking would be more effective if, instead, he replaced that word with another word or silence. 

Taken literally, the filler word is asking the listener the question: "is the claim I just made correct?" But an answer to this question is unwanted by the speaker. 

The real reason it's being used is to force the listener into agreeing that they have understood what was just said by the speaker regardless if they have actually understood it. Since this happens extremely quickly, this "forced agreement" by the listener might be all the listener takes away from the claim. This potentially could leave the listener after the conversation with the feeling "I don't know what was said, but I agreed with everything that was said". 

As a speaker, you want to listener to actually think about the content of what you're saying. When you finish with the word "right" usually you are making the listener search for a reason to agree without internal justification. Why put the listener through this type of thinking when you really want the listener to think about what you're saying?

For this reason, maybe the following

"When the stoplight turns yellow, you're supposed to apply the brakes - think about that!"

is more effective, right?  
 Hello fellow humans,

Before I begin I would like to apologize for the length of the post and if my writing contains errors, English is my fifth language and I am not a journalist nor a reporter, so please, grammar and spelling nazis, go easy on me, I know I'll miss a ton of details since the whole story is very big but will reply if asked for specific details I've missed.

I am a Moroccan citizen, I was hesitant to share a post about the matter, especially in this subreddit, but I grew desperate, I feel like all I can do is share the story in hope that reports in the West of any kind on the matter would put some sort of pressure on the government to pump the breaks a little bit on its brazen corruption, while at the same time hope to hear advice of any kind from anyone who has any to offer. And since I believe David and most people in this community are "smart guys with high IQs and good memory so y'all don't need to take notes), seriously though, you probably have more grasp on politics than I, and I think you can offer me some good advice.
There have been many protests in Morocco since the failure of the so called Arab spring, many cities rose in protest against the corruption of their supposed representatives, and the leaders of the movements all have been arrested, multiple of which are in jail even though they haven't been trialed, and the shocking matter is in most cases the investigations that were initiated by the government proved the corruption allegations true, and by the way in some cases those people who were arrested are only kids. The result of the whole thing has been the government's success of making an "example out of them". But instead of giving up new movement was started about 2 months ago or so, that took inspiration from a boycott in our neighbor country Algeria. And while the protests were local, which made suppressing them easier, the new boycotting movement found a national support. the entire population rose in support of boycotting 3 companies that mainly had monopoly in all of the nation's market and didn't allow any competition; one is a milk company, another is a bottled water company and lastly a gas/petroleum company. While all of them have raised the prices over the past years to, in the people's eyes, unbelievably high price; mentioned bottled water is from local source but is more expensive than oil which is imported, the milk is more expensive here than in Europe, the US and Canada while it's an undisputed fact that Moroccans don't make the money the people make in said places, and lastly said gas company's owner is one of the closest people to the monarch, he has always took charge of the most profitable ministry in the government (the rough translation of its title is the ministry of agriculture, fisheries, rural development, waters and forests). this guy's political party doesn't participate in elections, yet he has always had a seat in the Parliament, the guy is a billionaire and here is his profile on Forbes https://www.forbes.com/profile/aziz-akhannouch/. The previous government went right wing and fucked the people over; after using the "February 20th movement" (the movement that led the uprising in Morocco at the time of the "Arab Spring") to get to power; removed the regulations on gas so the said gas company had no problem keeping on raising their profits by jacking up the prices, until now when the population has had enough. Which resulted in massive support of the boycotting movement has had, the corrupt politicians tries shaming the people and they got blazed, the reaction of one specific politician was comical, he was video taped feeding words to "protestors" who rallied in front of the Parliament to protest against the government's handling of the boycotting movement (that was the first time a protest in front of the Parliament had police protection instead of them beating the politicians down). when the it resulted in massively negative feedback he asked to be dismissed instead of resigning (so that he'd still get the massive undeserved retirement pay) the whole story was a joke. The people have been so upset that they chanted "Akhnnouch, leave" when he was at a public ceremony with the monarch (who is considered "a sacred character" in the Constitution). And at this point people had a little hope that maybe the monarch would get involved to solve the problem, there might be light at the end of the tunnel, the people might win one for a change, but guess what happened, since the people didn't show a sign of falling back but in fact starting expanding the list of boycotted brands, the politicians who were supposed to represent the people passed a bill while everyone was busy celebrating the end of Ramadan that would make up for the loss of the milk company by paying it 1 millions MADs a day... now ain't that a bitch... What the fuck is someone supposed to do once your own government says fuck you, you ain't worth shit, we're fucking you over and you can do nothing about it. I personally had hope after discovering that a couple left leaning secular politicians were trying to push bills that would improve the situation if the average Moroccan, but I'm done, I don't know what to do anymoreThe conservative elite is trying to put forth this argument that Robert Mueller investigation is unconstitutional.  Bill maher just had to listen rather than push-back (probably because he admires George Will). The unconstitutional argument is already creeping in tweets. So the FOX media will keep pushing this propaganda..

We both know it's a straight up lie. Just for kicks, I'll post the link to 1997 laws. 

Furthermore, Trump thinks he's smart by using the kids to get what he wants. Yes, Trump wants approval to have the stupid wall to be built. I hate saying this, but Trump is making Bush look good.

The scam artist doesn't have any idea of how politics nor cares about the people he hurts. The only way to stop this madness any further is by voting Trump and  the people who side with him out of office. 

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/was-law-separate-families-passed-1997/  One thing the is on my mind is how our beloved independant shows will operate after the downfall of Donny dumb dumb. We all know hes going down and seem addicted to speculation on "how" at this point not "if". However, as political junkies see a sea of the orange faced buffoon thumbnails in our feeds on youtube/twitter and other platforms, we have become addicted to clicking on his idiocracy and the community spirit fighting his and the GOPS ignorance, evil and good vs bad - almost 'holy war' that's taken a grip with our shows like TDPS. BUT when hes gone, with so much orange hitler as their core - how will they adjust to a post Trump world? They too seem just as addicted to the story and with so much else going on in the world will viewer retention be able to adjust or are we doomed as an audience to continue the Anti-trump movement in a post trump world for many years to come? What will be the unwinding process and transition for media companies that are almost 90% Trump moronic news going to do without him as their money maker and click bait? (harsh words I know but pretty much sums it up). Will viewers stay for variety again? and can shows survive a hit to their viewership in non trump news? We like to think yes but have they put all their eggs in the clown show of the DoTard and not seeding out important news going unreported that would sway them back from the tabloid style headlines we are now sadly accustomed to?

We were supposed to read this as part of the TDPS discord book club. I've been reading it since. It's a very enlightening book. 

Side note: This is the kind of thing we really should be talking about. Mass automation is just around the corner. We should be discussing issues like this. Not spending countless hours on this silly culture war. So I was thinking about what David was saying yesterday about holding law enforcement to a higher standard.  I am on board with it, but I just don't think that we have a realistic way moving forward.

There are citizen advisory boards and such, and internal affairs, but there is a lot of resistance from police unions over any sort of oversight, even in places where there is a lot of police misconduct such as Baltimore.  If a fellow cop speaks up, he gets labeled as a rat, and get ostracized from the community.  

For a prosecutor to bring a case against a cop, it has to be such a high bar because of the relationship between prosecutors and the police.  It seems like an intractable problem.His opinion have gone to crap, as he advocates for nationalism and protectionism. He's avoiding talking about tRump at the G7, and the trade war with Canada. Because he probably secretly supports what he is doing, and doesn't want to lose half his subscribers. He almost certainly supports trump over the "globalist puppet" Trudeau.
And he really just sounds like a broken record in every video. Always finding a way to bring up the same talking points. "we need a new new deal!" "Bernie sanders or a dictator!"

David Pakman basically described him in his video about the trade war with Canada. Anyone talented enough would be willing to make a mix/mashup of David's common phrases?  I think it would be good for a laugh.Keeping it simple for now - no offense intended:

1. A bit too grating, especially with the voiceovers (which may not sustain well over time). A theme song needs to be comfortable enough to replay as background music, like a soundtrack for a game. Not a great fit.
2. Sounds like a porno.... hahaha. Good song, but wrong genre. Sorry Pat!
3. The dub/reggae vibe isn't quite right... Just not David's or the show's style. It would be better for a celeb talk show or fashion show or something.
4. Best option. Groovy, easygoing, and comfortable to the ears for replayability. Catchy.

Just my thoughts, take or leave as you see fit. What do y'all think?Just saw Pakmans video about the children in these detainment camps. How can I help individually. I know nothing about politics. This broke my heart. I’m in Texas, is my voice even useful? 
 
How’s this allowed to happen. WTF.
In the last year I've heard several disturbing news stories. These range from major cities in Africa no longer having access to clean fresh water to countries losing land due to rising sea levels, linked to climate change. Certain island countries, such as Kiribati, now know in a matter of time their country will be under water. I propose the following plan of action to reverse the effects of rising sea levels.

 An international agreement be reached where human beings can not use fresh water for showering, bathing, or recreational purposes. Fresh water would be reserved only for drinking. As a replacement every country would create infrastructure so that humans would shower, bathe, or fill recreational water parks with sea water. I understand this plan would require a drastic shift in human behavior, new international bureaucracy to be formed, and a large slew of other considerations I surely can't imagine at this time. However, I'm convinced that not responding to the climate change crisis, which will make fresh water more scarce in certain regions will be even more disastrous and bring a slew of negative reforms. Here are my thoughts on how we achieve this plan.

1: There is reform on the issue of public housing. Every country would be mandated to create reasonable public housing that can hold 100&amp;#37; of their citizens regardless of who they are or their legal standing. This new housing initiative would have the new infrastructure to separate drinking water sources from sea water purposed activities. 

2: There is an international agency tasked with collecting and dividing up the sea water. The division will be based proportionally on population size. 

3: Calculate how much sea water you need to drain. My idea would involve using satellite photos of Pacific Islands from 1980, before the erosion problem began, and compare them to modern day. We calculate how much water we need to drain in order for these islands to be safely inhabitable again. 

This is an idea I wanted to share, please let me know what you think in the comment section. The song was You Can't Always Get What You Want, and it was the chorus part of the song, played briefly at the end of Trump's speech for the National Federation of Independent Business. Who picks the music for this lol? This is obviously unimportant, I just thought it was a strange song to pick, and given the lyrics, almost made it feel as though it was meant to be a jab? Anyone notice and get the same feeling?I tell you what, this media including David Pakman really is something just trying to emotionally shock people rather than talking facts.  What we're in is a sad state of affairs regarding the fact checking of our media and the manipulation that is being attempted of the people.  So let's go over some facts.

No border agent goes across the border to rip parents from children.  Separation only happens when illegals sneak into the country between ports of entry.  Additional separation ONLY happens when, while in custody, an illegal files an asylum claim with the court, which drags on the proceedings and children are transported to holding facilities to watch over them while the claim is being processed.  

If parents go to a port of entry and file an asylum claim, they are not arrested.  They are treated like normal immigrants attempting to enter the country.  They don't get separated if they do things the legal way.  

When you enter the country illegally, nobody knows who you are.  You neither have a name, nor a reason for being in the country, so taking into custody is absolutely not an option, even if you argue that it is just a civil offense.  Law REQUIRES THAT children cannot be held with adults.  The separation is 100% required by a 2007 ruling that stated specifically that this is true for all crimes.  

This isn't a debate about separation, because under current law the separation is unavoidable.  The ONLY MATTER of debate is whether to hold the children in government facilities or release them to temporary foster care.  The problem with temporary foster care is that these kids always end up missing and the feds can't find them.  How can we protect kids and ensure that they can reunite with their parents if we can't find the kid?  We can't.  

The centers are there to protect children until the parents' asylum claims can be settled, and again, that's the decision of parents to file the asylum claim while in custody.

Of course,  Liberals know all of this and play coy with the facts.  The reason why they are misrepresenting the situation is because they personally benefit from it.  Much of the cheap goods that are bought such as avocados are only as cheap as they are because illegals work under the table on the farms tending to and picking the fruits that liberals consume in states like CA.  If it were not for illegals, certain fruits would be much more expensive because the labor costs would be far higher as Americans would demand much higher pay for the demanding work.  Instead, illegals come here and bust their butts for next to nothing.  

In essence, they trade a little bit of safety to become slave workers for big agriculture and then dependent on them.  Those are the people I feel terrible for.  Working on a farm in 100 degree weather is brutal and I've done it.  It is some of the most gritty and tough work that exists on the continent and I wouldn't be caught dead working for what they work.  

It's painful that liberals are motivated by slave labor.  I thought we learned from the Roman Empire that a society that relies on slave labor can never last.  Knew too much. 
Posted too little. 

You will always live in our hearts friend. 
Peace and God be with you. 

*Doves fly into the sky*I think he should debate Shapiro, even though they’re both zionists Who is the artist *presently* doing the Theme Song? Thought i heard David say it was 'Curtly J' but my iTunes search came up empty. How do you spell the name?

thanks, I've been trying to find more by him/her/them.I've been trying to reach them for months and months about a billing issue and no matter how I contact them, I am getting no response. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBeYvcl3B-M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBeYvcl3B-M)Anyone else's head spinning? Again. And will Trump next authorize a nuke attack somewhere, then claim he doesn't like what devastation it caused so won't do it again?What underhanded nonsense is this administration pulling off while the world is up in arms about their abhorrent treatment of migrant families?I really don't know how to write this mess. I hope like a madman this idea was just KFC dream of Trump. The idea alone doesn't make any real sense. Two different departments with two different types of systems. America doesn't have time, the tools, and a legal leg to stand on. I don't know anymore.

I know most people only think of genocide as mass killing so then trump did not since no child was killed.  But in the in Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, article 2 &amp; 3 the definition of genocide includes that the act has to be intention, and can be done in the 5 following ways. [convention on genocide](http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/convention/text.htm)

1 Killing members of the group;

2 Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

3 Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;

4 Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;

**5 Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.**

The convention also allows for the following to be punished as part of an act of genocide.

1 Genocide

**2 Conspiracy to commit genocid**e

**3 Direct and public incitement to commit genocide**

**4 Attempt to commit genocide**

5 Complicity in genocide.

So did trump and the department of justice commit either conspiracy or attempted genocide.  It seems yes what trump did with the family separation policy  was an attempt to remove the child from a ethnic to another group.

It clear that the trump administration is trying to go through with it, why else would they be following the pattern that leads to it.  it goes like this you can't live amongst us as group X, to you can live amongst us at all , to finally to you can not live.  It just looks like the trump admin push a little to fast and did not want to deal with the lack of support from evangelicals.  So yes I say they did attempt genocide and they will try again.  give it a few months and suddenly we won't have the means to not seperate them.  After all the executive order only says we will stop separation of family when we have means and it is appropriate, and leave leaves no part reuniting the children with their families.It is illegal in every liberal democracy that I can think of to have sex in public. But why? I'm sure many of you have heard of John Stuart Mill. I'm sure many of you have heard of his "harm principle". Mill, for those who have not heard of him, presents perhaps the most famous liberal defence of free speech. According to Mill, any limitation on free expression, any limitation of any liberty for that matter, rests on "one very simple principle": the harm principle. The harm principle, in Mill's own words, states that:

&gt;the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. (1978, 9)

Now, if you subscribe to Mill's harm principle \*and\* you agree that "speech" encapsulates many different activities - speaking, writing, singing, burning flags, yelling on the street corner, advertising, threats, libel, slander and sexual acts, then what argument is there for people not being allowed to have sex in public? What is the harm?

Side note: I love the new reddit format!It was annoying seeing all these people act surprised that they woukd do something like they done with immigrant kids, when they've been allied with religious extremists that have been sending kids to vile camps for decades.

if you've got a strong stomach go and read about people who have been sent to these camps experiences. The GOP is a child abuse supporting party
The following link is to a very partisan and very conservative pro-Trump blog and can be unhinged at times. Normally I wouldn't trust it for much of anything beside maybe intra-right conflicts. But this on the SPLC is interesting and a follow up to the settlement with Nawaz.

The SPLC has a long history of doing great good for America and I hope they can turn it around and reform back to their better selves. The fact that they settled without going to litigation and were generous with Nawaz is a very good sign for them and us all.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkn5\_gCvtC0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkn5_gCvtC0)I would be shocked if Trump didn't have something to do with this beyond-blunder wardrobe choice. 

 Ask yourself why the wife who pleaded with her husband to stop his recent cruelty would wear such a vulgar phrase across her back in front of cameras while boarding the plane for her trip to meet detained children, let alone why an elite former model with untold wealth would wear such a cheap and frumpy thing (looks like a homeless person got tagged in their sleep)?

The image of a lady married to a tyrant, going alone to meet his victims for whom she pleaded his mercy, her hair covering her face and her body a display of crudeness and shame, it reminded me of something. Maybe she really (really) doesn't care, I don't know. But what if she cared so much she would bear the burden of spectacle in exchange for her husband's first ever acquiescence. 

In Lady Godiva's time, nudity was the ultimate offense; now it's nothing.  A nude Melania is a mouse click away, and it's just Melania without clothes on. Words have replaced skin as the measure of righteousness.  Flippant is the new naked.  Note how quick Trump was to tweet a favorite barb as the meaning of the jacket.  And he is known to take gleeful pride in humiliating even those closest to him, so riling the country against the woman who is said to have influenced his executive order...well that would be a win-win for him.  We know Trump and his family is benefiting from his presidency because they want to cozy up to him, but Trump's not making any friends around the world, and I imagine many people book his hotel to curry favor with him, even if they dislike him. Wouldn't his brand face a backlash after there's no longer reason to bribe him?Medical and educational benefits are among the most prominent reasons people join the US military. If they couldn't hold that as some amazing gift they are giving service members, almost no one would volunteer to join the military, and the country would end up instituting the draft again.

Just something I've been thinking about one of the most significant welfare programs in the world (US Military).&gt; It would literally take me all day if I had to type out all the details of what the Left has done to despise them extremely hard, so here's essentially an abridged version of all the various shit done by the Left.
&gt; 
&gt; * GamerGate. The media essentially lying and conspiring with each other to turn an issue about journalistic ethics into "HARASSMENT AGAINST WOMYN!" Funny thing is, a majority of people who support GG are Liberal, yet they get labeled "Alt-Right" and "Nazis" by the Left-leaning news websites. This shit is STILL continuing today by censoring games and constantly condemming gamers.
&gt; 
&gt; * Black Lives Matter hypocrisy. They're just an excuse to continue hating on cops, and they were responsible for the Dallas Sniper attacks that killed 5 cops. They also attended a rally to pay tribute to the victims of the Pulse Victims to make it about themselves, and ban gay cops from marching in pride parades. They don't care about Black Lives; they only care about bashing cops and White people.
&gt; 
&gt; * Antifa. The people who fight Facism with Facism tactics get away with attacking random people and setting buildings on fire by the media, claiming their violent riots are "Peaceful Protests."
&gt; 
&gt; * The NFL protests. Kaepernick did more than just take a knee; he also portrayed cops as pigs on his socks and praised a Communist dictator. The NFL claimed to be for social justice and morals, yet they still have murderers and wife beaters play, and they were not for free speech when the Dallas Cowboys couldn't pay tribute to the cops murdered by that sniper. Also, the NFL players are "slaves" when they get paid 8 figures to work 16 days a year at least? Fuck off.
&gt; 
&gt; * The constant bigotry against Straight White Men where videos and lists about "What White People Ruined" and "Dear White People" are considered socially acceptable.
&gt; 
&gt; * They also keep lowering the standards of racism so that EVERYTHING is racist, from Math to BBQs to Kayaking. Even saying "I'm not racist" or "I don't see color" or "I hire the most qualified person for the job" is now considered racist.
&gt; 
&gt; * Condemming Roseanne and Milo for the stuff they've said on social media, while excusing behavior by Kathy Griffin, Samantha Bee and Peter Fonda. Between this and calling black people who don't tow the line Uncle Tom's, coons, and niggers (CNN literally said it's okay to call these people that), the Left have become a party of "Do as we say, not as we do."
&gt; 
&gt; * Social Media has essentially censored and purged anyone with conservative views. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit have been proven guilty of this multiple times.
&gt; 
&gt; * A Liberal LITERALLY tried to shoot Republicans at a congressional softball game.
&gt; 
&gt; * SJWs forcing "diversity" into everything, from pop culture to business. The SJW form of "diversity" is basically giving non-hetero colored people positions they haven't earned because "merit" is also now racist.
&gt; 
&gt; * Claiming to be the "Party of Science" because of how they view Climate Change (in which they constantly inflate statistics to scare people) and Gender (claiming gender is a "spectrum" without any scientific backing outside of "My Feelings!"). They're only the "Party of Science" so they can constantly bash Christians who believe strongly in God as backwards hicks.
&gt; 
&gt; * They are also the party that constantly tries to do away with the 1st and 2nd Amendments, claiming to know what the founding fathers (who they all hate anyway for being White Men) intended those Amendments to be.
&gt; 
&gt; * Constantly condemming Christians for being the racist/misogynist/homophobes when Islam is far worse (they throw gays off roofs FFS but we're evil because we don't want to bake them cakes?) but nobody on the left will call Islam out on it because that would be considered Islamophobic.
&gt; 
&gt; * Speaking of Islam, any time they commit a terrorist attack (which happens nearly every other month now), what's the Left excuse? "Not All Muslims." This is the same party that bashes the Right for using "Not All Men" as an excuse for the "Rape Culture" in the West.
&gt; 
&gt; * Oh yeah, Rape Culture, aka "Anything that mildly offends a womyn is now considered rape or sexual assault." They also now consider regretting having consentual sex much later after the fact rape, and also equate not understanding "non-verbal" cues as rape/sexual assault. Combine that with inflating rape statistics on college campuses and how Title IX is being used to ruin Men's lives even when they're found innocent, and the Left has basically murdered romance under the guise of Feminism. Then they wonder why "Incels" and "MGTOW" have become more prominent.
&gt; 
&gt; * And of course, Fake News. I know the Left is sick of hearing it, but when they CONSTANTLY lie about Trump and Israel, it just keeps proving Trump's point.
&gt; 
&gt; * And I don't buy the whole "Well that's just the crazy fringe part of our group!" excuse because it's quickly becoming the majority opinion of the group when it gets broadcasted by the mainstream media and no major figure on the Left or any leftist news organization (which at this point is nearly everyone that isn't Fox News) will call them out for it else they get ostracized as being a Nazi.
&gt; 
&gt; The Left has given me no reason to ever vote or be a Democrat again, and their constant bashing of my race, gender, and sexuality keeps pushing me to the Right to the point where I'll stand by Trump for 99.9% of everything he does just to spite the Left.

Here is a reply I received from an interaction with a Trump supporter. I thought it might be instructional to share this particular reply because it gives such a clear presentation of the development of some portion of Trump supporters. I watch David for the Political commentary but like I get it, he doesn't like Peterson. Feel like the message was received 10 videos later he still making more.  

It's smart though, he'll get more views if he jumps on the Peterson Bandwagon, either one works anti or for. That's one way to get views.  

Considering he always talks about he doesn't care about his views, he sure has adopted the popular trend though. As I posted before I'm beginning to not really care much for Peterson (especially after he went to PraguerU) but not gonna lie, seeing him on literally every YouTube channel is kind annoying. Like I don't want to follow Peterson but I am not interested in the anti-Peterson shit either.

I am just annoyed at Pakman's personal vendetta (if it's even real, probably just a scheme to get views) rather see more relevant content. I was thinking about some of the ways David could raise money:

1)Rail on about feminists:  Pick a fringe feminist and claim all feminists share her position.

2) Rail on about Muslims:  Same as above, only pick jihadist/wahabi clerics

3) Moan about the fall of western civ to the encroaching hordes

4) Critique movies by focusing on how they "minimize men and empower women"

5) Explain the "Truth" about past historical events that the professoriat are too scared to tell us common people.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX8Pd4aJPOY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX8Pd4aJPOY)I was interested in promoting the show where I live, or at least cover up the info wars stickers. However, on your page, it is unclear how many stickers you get for the purchase. The title of the product implies it is just a single one, but the product description implies there are several.

If there is only a single bumper sticker, then I dont think it is worth the price. I acknowledge that it is an good price if you only want one. If you could sell multiple bumper stickers for a (preferably significantly) reduced price, I would highly appreciate it.“Almost immediately, it became clear that the idealized grand bargain, in which every welfare recipient would get a subsidized job if needed, along with child care and transportation assistance and everything else they might need to thrive in the workforce, wasn't going to fly. The costs were too much for Congress to stomach, even more so after Republicans regained power in 1995.

"By just mailing checks, the government spent an average of about $5,000 per family each year," DeParle notes. "A work slot (with child care for just one child) would cost about $11,700. The bill for 2 million of them would raise welfare's annual costs by more than $13 billion, nearly 50 percent. Nothing like that seemed remotely possible."

[The legacy of the 1996 welfare reform](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/20/11789988/clintons-welfare-reform#clintonsigning)I found this question interesting and very under explored. I could off of my head during the question of a few scenarios that could ultimately be effective or succeed. Not that I advocate them and for that reason I have kept details as light as possible.

1st Would be armed teams would raid multiple detention centers simultaneously. Eliminate (leathal or non)the staff and release the detainees into the US. Escape would be hard but impossible.
2nd would be to attack and seize the centers and fortify and hold them until policy change. Surrendering at the end or forceing a tactical assault by federal authorities drawing national and international attention.
3rd would be to hit low to mid level staff targets and regional offices. Basically you would run a terror campaign making the cost to enact this policy high.

Please keep in mind I am not advocating these actions. I do not think they are the right answer. It’s just that caller was clearly unprepared to answer the follow up questions. I also feel the right underestimated the lefts willingness and ability to use violence. It’s not the long ago the the Weathermen, SLA and others were active. [Per](https://globalnews.ca/news/4287272/jordan-peterson-sues-wilfrid-laurier-for-defamation-following-ta-case/) Global News:

Jordan Peterson filed a defamation lawsuit worth $1.5 million against Wilfred Laurier University and three faculty members after a T.A. was criticized for showing a YouTube clip of him during a class tutorial.

The claims say comments made in a closed meeting were defamatory and intended to discredit Peterson.

Shepherd’s case came to light after she came forward with a recording of a meeting between her and three faculty members, who said playing the Peterson clip created a toxic environment in the classroom.

Shepherd secretly recorded the meeting, and has since made the recording public.

Comments in the meeting included a comparison of Peterson’s speech to Hitler, and a comparison of his opinion to that of an anti-trans, anti-gay, anti-women white supremacist. They also called him “academically suspect” and said he exhibited “charlatanism,” according to the unproven Statement of Claim.

Despite the fact that the meeting was private, Peterson and his lawyers allege the faculty should have known the content of the meeting could have lasting consequences.

“Although the individual Defendants did not personally disseminate and broadcast it further… they could have reasonably anticipated that … [Shepherd] would inform others of what had occurred,” the statement reads.

Yeah, I notice that David is always writing something during the phone calls and I was just wondering what is it. I guess it's just basic info about the caller but I'd like to have some more information why is that and so on. I was just thinking, some repulicans are really great liars, some are just stupid. I saw The ring of fire- video where Farron Cousins said that Paul Ryan is one of the stupidest politicians is US (something like that), but I disagree. I think Paul Ryan is not stupid, he's quite smart but very dishonest. 

I guess my overall guestion is: which republicans are just stupid and which ones are dishonest?

A week or couple of weeks back...in bill maher, he was kinda hinting that Mueller investigation could be unconstitutional. The whole shenaniganism of border crisis....has caused the GOP elite (with rationality &amp; empathy) to leave party. Hope Democrats run sensible candidates (rather than SJW type politicians) and take these votes !! Do we just have better morals and don’t go there?He's a cutie and should get more airtime. If they don't they should not be nominated. I am a single issue voter now.just a thought, but the MRA's and, to a lesser extent, jordan petersen-esque "self-improvement" rhetoric reminds me of a complete misunderstanding of chuck palahniuk's 'Fight Club'- particularly the film.

particularly [scenes like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBSvlTYfUrs)

[a little of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWRTqMGvdpc)

[and while this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDpENE6yPV4) may seem counter-intuitive, the whole film we see project mayhem improve the house, like the stereotypical "i watched jordan petersen and then i cleaned my room" quip.

did they miss the point of how quickly the group became anarchists and fascists, and there was definitely a feeling of sarcasm throughout the whole film? and the obvious homosexual undertones? or am i overhinking thisIn the Obama presidency, so many right wingers were pushing the conspiracy that Fema was making camps to enslave Americans. They were either building them or converting old Walmart into prisons. 
Now today we have JUST that.  But with immigrants....but yet, these camps and prisons aren't even acknowledged by those same conspiracy theorists OR they don't care because "They are illegal" Antiquity seems to be all I can see, and perhaps being stressed as of late, has narrowed my eyes, and seized my mind. 

But, I wonder if I am not alone - Pakman has said many times he's become desensitized. I, being me, am to a faulty level, empathetic. 

When you hurt, I hurt. 

A few days ago, I was out soaking up some sun, heard a loud bang, and ran towards the sound. I found a car with tattered repair, smashed into the front yard of a house, and a young man bleeding from his head, an airbag deployed, and him bleeding. I telephoned for EMS, and ran back to my car, grabbed my first aid kit, and gloves for universal precaution and checked his pupils for dilation. He had a seizure, and fortunately, EMS arrived. I rode with him to the hospital, and he noted he had no insurance, and the accident was caused by a blackout from which he has suffered many times before, and he stated he'd likely lose his job as a server, and the MRI, bloodwork, and stiches -- which I'd tried to stop bleeding as best I could. 

He needed a referral to a neurologist, and, I had to say goodbye after a while. 

It sickens and saddens me, that we -- as a society -- think that this is acceptable. 

Lately, these thoughts have been gracing, of a grander scale, and a specific incident, the walls of my mind. And I've yet to find something that can take my mind of a worsening view, save the guy I love, and hope to build a life with. 

Sorry to ramble. 

I am so frustrated with the situation politically here; Maybe, I should take a break from the news. 

Anyone else feel overwhelmed by the events that have been taking place as of late? Is this a weakness - or, as even evergreens get sick, you see, is this not unlike you. 

Or me?

 
Its an interesting question Im sure many of us have on our minds especially those well informed of the US "electoral" process: At what point does a peoples uprising start when the politicians failed and continue to do so in a 2 party duopoly to the country on both sides? the corruption at the ballot box (GOP gerrymandering and DNC super delegates) , pulling out of the UN human rights council, child internment camps, dictatorial behavior with admiration and collusion with enemies of democracy, 8 wars (not including the trade wars) and the executive branch unwilling to return the power of declaration of war back to congress .. I mean what is the breaking point when people take matters into their own hands when ALL else has failed and being docile and hiding from it is not a solution? Its written into the constitution about ownership of firearms and an oppressive government killing, stealing from the poor to give to the rich, militarizing its police force, snatching people from the streets (ICE) . Forefathers saw this happening, its here, and they emboldened the people to act - so what is that line? have they not crossed it already? No one condones violence (and this is NOT a call for it but a thought experiment) but when the alternative is subjugation to a dictator, is there no other choice? Are people awaiting that spark that sets it off like history has shown over and over again?﻿ The US is at ignition point and horrifically well armed to do it, if the people get jibbed at the vote again will/could it really happen? would we want it too and what would the consequences be?Hello everyone! New to TDPS reddit!

This is an honest question coming from someone who's opinion of US foreign policy are quite negative. I detest the war on terror, the drone strikes on civilians and the regime change we have taken part in, and I also believe the US budget is astronomically inflated and needs to be cut big time, but as much as I detest our policy of offensive aggression and imperialist tendencies, I do wonder if in some way it is still good for the US to be have the most powerful military. 

I started thinking about this after watching Kyle from Secular Talk say that we could cut our budget by almost half and still be have the most powerful military on Earth, but I genuinely wonder if it is the best option for us to be the sole super power or if I'm just being a selfish American haha.

Open question here, what are your thoughts on this? I've been reading into this subject of the Crypto ecosystem. I'm still lost in some areas of cyber money. However, my interest for the matter came about with Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) crisis. 

To make a long story short. GPU crisis stems from the fact that manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD. A GPU price tags run from $100 to $500 up to a whopping $1,000 a piece. There are three factors at work here.

The three factors are the following. Data mining like cryptocracy for the rich. Then business firm's like cloud storage just to name few things. Furthermore, these two factors I just named off buy GPU from  Nvidia and AMD in bulk every other month. So, the third factor is manufacturers can't meet Supply &amp; Demand.

Another factor is that the manufacturers would give out discounts or scalp the prices to make it lower for other businesses to buy more of their GPUs. Which leads average consumer fitting the bill. Also,  Nvidia is also in the business of AI computing and Super Computers. So that alone will drive up the cost.

Lastly, I have a bad feeling that this issues might become economic bubble just like Chinas housing market, America's student loan debt, and now GPU crisis. 



For more on the subject. Digital Trend has an interesting article on the matter.

Since GOP prefers using terms like "illegal" immigrants (which may soon evolve to "criminal" immigrants)..

.Can we start using the term "Illegal" or "Unlawful" POTUS...because he did violate "law" in his Trump University scam ([https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/trump-university-scam/](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/trump-university-scam/))

Open to suggestion - would appreciate any other label/tag that can go viral via social-media as wellfirst of all i just want to mention that i rarely watch his podcats, but i do regularly watch the "juicy" clips like the dave rubin one the other day and the what's-her-face one about climate change the other day where he just destroys her "beliefs."

conversely, i often hear people (on here and other places of discourse) consistently tear into him for a multitude of reasons- a) he gives right-wing "intellectul dark web" guys a voice and/or a platform to espouse their beliefs. i also often hear the complaint that he consistently embraces conspiracy theories, but then also see him recant most of them and said he no longer believes, for example, 9/11 truther nonsense.

so my question is- is he contrarian, centrist, etc?

on a side note, i had a friend talking about "government" the other day- and i quote, 

&gt; "June 20 at 5:26 PM ·

&gt; Well look at that, the government saved us from the government. Our government even saved young people from another government. Man I really love the government. If only they created as many problems as they fixed.....or is it the other way around? P.S. I have no problem deleting this, not looking for a battle!" 

i asked him if he was then espousing an anarchist or some sort of libertarian system, and he replied "labels are for soup cans," which i said "andy warhol would be proud, but how else would we describe X?" or anything, for that matter? where is joe rogan on any of this?I see this quite often on the internet, and frequently in this sub.  Poor, uniformed souls declaring "social science is not a science" and any evidence resulting from social science related investigation is worthless.  Ironically enough, these people are often in subs like this discussing social science issues, but in their minds whatever biases determine their perspective is good enough, and there's no need for scientific inquiry.  Assuredly, these people's idea of social science often consists of interviews and "soft" work not dominated by numbers.

Well, let's get a few things straight.   Most social science inquiry is highly dominated by "numbers".  Economics is a social science.  In fact, the techniques developed in economics are the back bone of most social science related inquiry.  The reason social science can seem "soft", is because, well, it's hard.  It's difficult to demonstrate absolute causation when there are so many variables at play, and the results of one study can be contradicted by another study simply by including a few more variables in an analysis.  For example, if you're attempting to show a causal relationship between IQ and race, you may include a variable such as "average income of zip code" a subject grew up in.... while another analysis may simply omit that variable and thus discover a contradictory result.  In addition, the statistics themselves in these analyses are VERY complicated, most times much more sophisticated than those used in hard sciences.  For example, if you're attempting to find out whether a gene causes a certain disease, in the hard sciences, you can often run an experiment with mice comparing a group with that gene to those without.  In the social sciences, and the real world, it's much more difficult to run a similar experiment analyzing something like IQ and race, mostly because f the high number of variables involved in such an analysis and interactions between those variables.

So one thing is true, you should be highly suspicious of social science related studies that find surprising results and are not replicated.   Those studies need to repeated, many times, to verify some type of causal relationship.  Where Sam Harris goes wrong in his discussion of Murray's IQ results regarding race is that he simply treats Murray's results as immutable fact, and Harris seems very ignorant on how social science related studies, such as those examining IQ, are run.

And yes, social science often uses interviews as well.  But the knowledge gained from those interviews is often much more valuable than anything you can obtain from simply examining numbers.

Anyway, the next time you read a comment where a user asserts social science is for idiots.... well, you know that user has very limited knowledge of social science.This will be the moment, I believe, that decides whether some liberal celebrities have principles of any sort. We already know many politicians don't have principles. Case in point Ted Cruz. How can you telephone-bank for a man that insulted your wife and your father? Where's your sense of dignity, man?

Anyway, after his four or eight years, do y'all think liberal celebrities will get chummy with Trump again? Will they put him in their movies (Home Alone), or their tv shows (Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Sex in the City). If he buys a production company (which he might), will they work for him?The right generally does a good job explaining/bitching about their journeys from the left to the right, and how they were able to see the light as it were.  Part of this impetus is that many of these people are being paid by big moneyed interests like the kochs to spread conservative ideas and propaganda.  I know prager u solicits donations from his talk radio audience to fund his agitprop propaganda youtube channel, and that is another way of getting the old and the dying to fund one sided and misleading arguments in favor of conservative ideas.

I think the left needs more of tat.  We have less liberals paying people to do it, but it still needs to be done.  And this is where the deficiency lies.  We need to incorporate more theoretical analysis into our arguments and not just practical ones.

I'd love for Standard modern liberals making videos on why they are not "classical liberals."  It would be interesting to hear it spelled out why the over focus on negative freedoms to the exclusion of all else is not the kind of balance modern liberals want to strike.

Modern liberals still care about freedom FROM some government intervention, but they also care More about freedom TO for a broader section of the population.  Freedom TO get treated if one has a medical issue, even IF a person has no ability to pay.  And why focusing on negative freedoms from government are insufficient to building the kind of balanced and more broadly prosperous world we want to live in.

I want more liberals to dive into the psychology of why modern liberals are more tolerant of universal policies like social security and medicare, even though they are of course aware that some people will not work and may be less "deserving" of aide.  I suspect that is why so many conservatives are so much more hostile to such programs.  They bring up charity to help those in need, but note, charity tends to allow more personal inspection of individual cases, more areas to judge the "worthiness" of a potential target of aid.  

Liberals are more likely to tolerate the free riders to better help the decent.  Conservatives are more likely to be intolerant to free riders to better punish the wicked.

Liberal circle of concern = wider

conservative circles of concern = smaller

Using that lens, consider the following charge you hear on foxnews  by tucker carlson:

[https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/06/19/tucker\_carlson\_ruling\_class\_care\_far\_more\_about\_foreigners\_than\_about\_their\_own\_people.html](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/06/19/tucker_carlson_ruling_class_care_far_more_about_foreigners_than_about_their_own_people.html)

Modern Liberals still care more about their own children than a strangers children, still care more about the children of their relatives or friends than someone elses they do not know.  

The difference between the liberal and conservative populations, is that there are fewer liberals that care NOTHING about foreigners, because their circle of concern is WIDER, it takes longer for human concern to drop off a fucking CLIFF like it does for so many conservatives.   And if you dive into the nativist wing, the concern often seems to go below zero, where the mere presence of any illegal immigrants is seen as an actual infestation and invasion.

There are so many directions one could go to highlight and explain why modern liberals choose their path vs others, and I think it's past time we started defending the psychological and attitudinal underpinnings of why we chose our path vs conservatism or classical liberalism.*We have a sugar (and fat) problem.* Healthcare systems around the world are being put under increasing pressure from the rise of diabetes (and a whole swath of other heal), in Britain type 2 diabetes accounts for almost [10% of the NHS budget](https://www.nhs.uk/news/diabetes/diabetes-cases-and-costs-predicted-to-rise/) (£13.750 billion) and is projected to reach 17% by 2035/36. With over 26,000 primary school kids brought to hospital for multiple tooth extraction every year. The national clinical director for obesity and diabetes at NHS England Professor Jonathan Valabhji said: “We need to stem the tide otherwise we could see [a] crisis and there are issues of sustainability for the NHS if we do nothing differently.” “So it’s really important policymakers think about ways costs can be mitigated over next few years because there won’t be enough to go round.” 

Meanwhile, in the United States the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2017 is $327 billion, including $237 billion in direct medical costs and $90 billion in reduced productivity. For the cost categories analyzed, care for people with diagnosed diabetes accounts for 1 in 4 health care dollars in the U.S., and more than half of that expenditure is directly attributable to diabetes. People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical expenditures of ∼$16,750 per year, of which ∼$9,600 is attributed to diabetes. People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have medical expenditures ∼2.3 times higher than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes. Indirect costs include increased absenteeism ($3.3 billion) and reduced productivity while at work ($26.9 billion) for the employed population, reduced productivity for those not in the labor force ($2.3 billion), inability to work because of disease-related disability ($37.5 billion), and lost productivity due to 277,000 premature deaths attributed to diabetes ($19.9 billion). 

After adjusting for inflation, economic costs of diabetes increased by 26% from 2012 to 2017 due to the increased prevalence of diabetes and the increased cost per person with diabetes. The growth in diabetes prevalence and medical costs is primarily among the population aged 65 years and older, contributing to a growing economic cost to the Medicare program. The estimates in [this article](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2018/03/20/dci18-0007) highlight the substantial financial burden that diabetes imposes on society, in addition to intangible costs from pain and suffering, resources from care provided by nonpaid caregivers, and costs associated with undiagnosed diabetes. 

This is a problem with capitalism that even Social Democratic countries in Europe have been unable to handle, in Norway we have implemented strict sugar taxes to curve or fund some of the costs of diabetes, but on the whole it remains wholly insufficient. I'll put it forward that this is one example among many that we need to form a deep structural solution to hyperconsumerism, which is putting our social institutions under threat. This revolt against big industry should occur both on the local state, and national level, establishing communal food centers that promote healthy food, communal gardening and so on. In fairness to David, the guy was talking quickly but he said at the start of his spiel:

"Animal agriculture industry is the #1 cause of global climate change..."

This is a lie promoted by the documentary cowspiracy. This is in no way true. The #1 cause is the burning of fossil fuels. It seems that the investigations into the Trump family are heating up. Left and right, people in the inner circle are falling like domino's. And the man himself seems to be slowly losing his shit and doing his best to avert your eyes by any means necessary. With the documentation that the investigation just got access to, one begins to wonder if nuking Australia or Britain would be sufficient enough distraction to contain the potential fallout.

Trump has an obvious friend (or extortioner) in Russia. Anyone want to place bets on him &amp; family picking up and moving out there in the dead of night sometime in the next 4 to 8 years?[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4kRh50B1YM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4kRh50B1YM)Not for the reason that I find him offensive, mind you, but simply that I think he simply isn't very intelligent. Every time I hear him speak, it is obvious he possesses no nuanced understanding of the issues he is discussing. Seriously, I could think of ten random people that I know personally who could discourse circles around him on almost any topic.

 Am I missing something as to why he is so popular? Is it simply the fact that he was once a "lefty," as he puts it, who has turned increasingly more to the libertarian right side of the political spectrum? 

While I don't agree with the likes of Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson, I do see their appeal to conservatives, as they are clearly educated and skilled at public speaking. Rubin just reminds me of some ding dong you would meet at a bar who, upon overhearing you and a friend discussing politics, decides to interject their own asinine opinions into the conversation.I feel that there are several variables affecting the midterm outcome. I cannot discount meddling, hacking, gerrymandering and voter suppression. After putting everything into consideration, I see Dems retaking the House with a simple majority of 4 or 5 seats.

A psychic said that she see the GOP still having power and the situation getting worse before becoming better. Another, who used divination, see that there will be a "President Ford" president. The GOP looks like wining, but very close, leading to a gridlock. The modGOPs will depose Trump.

Trump made a tweet to a red wave. I feel that it's his hubris kicking in. It's more likely the blue wave is a weak one as people are tired of fighting. I asked my father about it and he said that it's doesn't have any effect to the midterms. I sense that the collective will help each other out on election day.

Any thoughts?I know it would take an incredible amount of whispered, secret wrangling to pull off a conspiracy like this, but how wonderful would this scene be?: --Sarah starts a briefing like usual, rattles off the typical North Korea/1984-esque "great success" brag monologue, finishes with a sickeningly playful flourish (like today's "Go Hogs" sports announcement), and then opens the floor to questions......and all 49 correspondents of the White House Press Corps simply stare at her, not a single hand raised, the microphones maybe picking up a cough or sniff or two, magnifying the defiant silence.   What message could be louder and clearer than that?

I think it's worth pointing out that Sarah doesn't simply lie, as Michelle Wolf suggested; she *spins* more than she lies, and often she simply refuses to give direct answers, both of which are ultimately more destructive than actual lying. --Trump supporters love the technically-not-lies, especially with all the bashing of Democrats, protestors and others (like desperate immigrants with their babies) that she inserts into her answers.  Not only does Sarah not uniquely lie, she isn't uniquely disgusting or troubling in all that she does; she is just *officially* disgusting and troubling.  She simply does the job her boss expects her to do, and yes that willingness to do it makes her personally disgusting, but the fact is, if/when she quits (if rumors are true, at the end of this year), someone else will take the job and how long they last will depend solely on how good they are at being disgusting.  I'm really curious to know if Trump has ever tried to tap Kelly Anne Conway's skills for the position, as she really presents a much more prepared and agile 'spinaptitude.'

That said, why does the Press Corps keep enabling the joke that the role of Press Secretary has become, under Trump?  Whether it's Sean, Raj, Sarah or anyone else making a spectacle of never delivering anything NEW AND TRUE at press briefings, why has it had to reach the point where a restaurant owner would risk her business (or more) to reject an administration by proxy (rejecting a woman and her family from eating there)?  

Why can't the press summon the relatively easy courage it would take to simply stop asking official questions of this White House?  Literally all we get from the briefings is quotes for pundit panels to dissect, for ratings-boosting divisiveness that already abounds, thanks to Twitter and other unofficial information such as leaks.  How are White House correspondents fulfilling a duty to Americans, knowing the answers will be less useful than other means of communication, and in effect be worse than useless, harmful in fact?

Process of reunification 'incredibly frustrating' for immigrant families

* **HARI SREENIVASAN:**  
For more on the reunification of children and families and what’s happening at the border Kevin Sieff, Latin America correspondent for The Washington Post joins us now via Skype from Brownsville Texas. First of all you’ve been out there today, what have you seen?

**KEVIN SIEFF:**  
Yeah. I mean, today is another day in which attorneys across, really across south Texas are trying desperately to find the children of their clients — hundreds of parents who remain detained in this region who don’t know where their children are. **Can’t even begin to locate them.** So, this is sort of the early stages of reunification and so far they’re incredibly frustrating for both parents and for attorneys who are getting any help from the government in trying to figure out where where and how families are going to be reunified.

* **HARI SREENIVASAN:**  
There seem to be two competing narratives here. On the one hand you have the government saying that they are going to be and are reuniting families and on the other hand the lawyers that you’ve spoken with, who represent dozens, if not hundreds of clients, who are still having trouble finding the children.

* **KEVIN SIEFF:**  
Right. I mean, I think part of the issue is the total lack of transparency when parents were detained after they crossed the border, after they were separated from their children, **they were theoretically supposed to be given a piece of paper with a toll free number, email address and this was the only way they were able ostensibly able to find information about about their children. First of all, these flyers for the most part, were not actually distributed.** 
* **The lawyers were able to get a hold of them are able to get these phone numbers, of these e-mail addresses** and so have desperately been calling this number and emailing these addresses. 
* And I was actually with a lawyer yesterday when she called this number, trying to get information about a particular case, **you’re on hold for, often, for over an hour. And then when you finally get something on the line, there’s absolutely no information.** 
* So the sort of only avenues that exist are **total dead ends. And so,what’s happened is, attorneys have tried to find their own routes through other legal organizations who are representing children to find information. But all of these, the organizations are wildly overworked and overwhelmed.**

* **HARI SREENIVASAN:**  
**How much more difficult now is it for some of these lawyers to find children, considering that they have been moved to several different parts of the country that they’re not all on the Texas border within a few miles of one of them?**

* **KEVIN SIEFF:**  
That’s exactly right. I mean, I think that’s one of the biggest issues that you know there may have known where a child was during the first few days but now that child could be in any number of states, could be thousands of miles away from not from the parent. So, I mean, what happens is that the child and the parent end up on parallel, parallel tracks in our immigration system. And so it what’s happening increasingly, is that parents are being deported and children remain lost in a system somewhere. I mean, as hard as this is to do when you’ve got a parent and a child both in the United State can be a lot harder when when the parent is back in Central America.

* **HARI SREENIVASAN:**  
Kevin, is there any indication from the folks you’ve talked to and what you’ve seen that this is acting as a deterrent that there are fewer people trying to get in or seek asylum?

* **KEVIN SIEFF:**  
**I think families that are fleeing things that pose imminent threats to their lives, I don’t think they’ll be deterred. I think they will continue onwards. I mean, I think, what I’ve seen is people constantly sort of reassessing the right moment to cross the border, the right way to cross the border. I think that’s not going to stop. I think we might see a few weeks of a sort of downturn but ultimately, you know, this flow will continue.**

Call A 1-800 Number And Wait: Migrant Parents Search For Their Children[https://www.dailywire.com/news/32278/listen-sarah-sanders-family-harassed-much-worse-amanda-prestigiacomo](https://www.dailywire.com/news/32278/listen-sarah-sanders-family-harassed-much-worse-amanda-prestigiacomo)

Assuming this story is TRUE, here is my thought

a) red-hen owner asking sarah to leave - i think it's civil enough

b) but harassing her in-laws - i think the resistance is boiling out of control and could be become violent/dangerous

Note: i really hope this is NOT true.David, you're incorrect. Obama did in fact suspend the rule of law by signing the 2011 NDAA, which codified into law powers assumed under the 2001 AUMF, which allows for the indefinite detention of American citizens with no due process if they are accused of being terrorists, or materailly supporting terrorists. I raised this issue a year ago and it went ignored. So again, I'm raising this issue because you are incorrect. 

In 2001 congress passed the Authorization of Use of Military Force (AUMF), and in 2011 Barack Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which codified into law powers assumed under the 2001 AUMF, which grants the federal government the authority to indefinitely detain anyone, including American citizens, with no due process or legal counsel (shut up, you don't get a Lawyer - L. Graham), and charge them in military tribunals, if they are suspected of terrorism.

&gt;The bill does more than authorize billions in military spending, $662 billion to be exact. It also, as Buttar explains, provides the executive branch with potentially far-reaching powers to detain Americans suspected of terrorism-related activities. In signing the bill, Obama maintained he would never authorize indefinite military detention of Americans citizens, and that he would not feel compelled to try all suspects in military tribunals, as the law authorizes.

&gt;On Friday the 28-year-old activist will appear for sentencing in the Southern District Court of New York in Manhattan. After having made a plea agreement, he faces the possibility of a 10-year sentence for hacking into the Texas-based private security firm Strategic Forecasting Inc., or Stratfor, which does work for the Homeland Security Department, the Marine Corps, the Defense Intelligence Agency and numerous corporations including Dow Chemical and Raytheon. ....

&gt;Hammond turned the pilfered information over to the website WikiLeaks and Rolling Stone and other publications. The 3 million email exchanges, once made public, exposed the private security firm’s infiltration, monitoring and surveillance of protesters and dissidents, especially in the Occupy movement, on behalf of corporations and the national security state. And, perhaps most important, the information provided chilling evidence that anti-terrorism laws are being routinely used by the federal government to criminalize nonviolent, democratic dissent and falsely link dissidents to international terrorist organizations. Hammond sought no financial gain. He got none.

&gt;The email exchanges Hammond made public were entered as evidence in my lawsuit against President Barack Obama over Section 1021 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Section 1021 permits the military to seize citizens who are deemed by the state to be terrorists, strip them of due process and hold them indefinitely in military facilities. Alexa O’Brien, a content strategist and journalist who co-founded US Day of Rage, an organization created to reform the election process, was one of my co-plaintiffs. Stratfor officials attempted, we know because of the Hammond leaks, to falsely link her and her organization to Islamic radicals and websites as well as to jihadist ideology, putting her at risk of detention under the new law. Judge Katherine B. Forrest ruled, in part because of the leak, that we plaintiffs had a credible fear, and she nullified the law, a decision that an appellate court overturned when the Obama administration appealed it.

Can you please address this, Dave? You ignored it a year ago, and you continue to state misinformation about Obama's presidency. The fact of the matter is that Obama did indeed suspend the rule of law with the 2011 NDAA. 

You're incorrect, you continue to be incorrect, and I don't understand why you don't address this. (I hope no one mistakes this post as support for Trump.)

I guess I've uploaded the picture in vain.With TDPS segment on the sinclair group doing conservative narratives again about the current snowlake right wing outrage talking point of Huckabee sanders eviction of a restaurant: Isnt the bigger question of how did the news become this way in the US? After the centrist devastation of the Clinton era privatizing the telecommunications act in a right wing policy that saw 50+ media groups turn to 6 and the duopolies manipulation of it - where are the policies to undo it from the progressive end spectrum? Can it be undone? is the first question, should it? is another or amendments to the current laws to right the horror show of the state of media in the US? We know healthcare and education reform is a big point of the progressive wave but how about media reform and re-regulations the people so sorely need to protect them from nefarious groups representing the oligarchy and authoritarian groups currently attacking democracy from both sides?Would the implementation of a journalistic hippocratic oath right the ship of a wayward, corrupt and tabloid Media? 

Could it work like this: To hold the title of "Journalist" you must undertake an oath "to tell no lie or represent a 3rd parties interest in the release of factual information to the public" And to hold and use the title "News" (or variations of) that they must only employ "Journalists" and have a 95% clear run of news released - If either "Journalist" or "News" outlet goes below the 95% mark of accuracy, even after arbitration, they lose that title and are suspended until elements within are removed from those positions. Commonsense or authoritarian to think is a solution to the dystopian world we live in with narrative now being controlled and filtered by 3rd parties interests? 

This would be to inform the viewer of content that without the mark of "news" in the organization or the title "Journalist" that they can mostly rely what they are seeing is factual, other groups can operate as is but not allowed by law to use the title News or the reporters "journalist" to differentiate the two, much like the title Dr and Hospital has to hit its marks for trust.Is the brave little toaster Male or Female, or other?

Elections have consequences, my dudes!

I'm currently reading the opinion and I'll try and give a summary, if I can be bothered.

Here's the Supreme Court, via Chief Justice Roberts, throwing some shade in Trump's direction (in my opinion):

&gt;The President of the United States possesses an extraordinary power to speak to his fellow citizens and on their behalf. Our Presidents have frequently used that power to espouse the principles of religious freedom and tolerance on which this Nation was founded. In 1790 George Washington reassured the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, Rhode Island that “happily the Government of the United States . . . gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance \[and\] requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens.” 6 Papers of George Washington 285 (D. Twohig ed. 1996). President Eisenhower, at the opening of the Islamic Center of Washington, similarly pledged to a Muslim audience that “America would fight with her whole strength for your right to have here your own church,” declaring that “\[t\]his concept is indeed a part of America.” Public Papers of the Presidents, Dwight D. Eisenhower, June 28, 1957, p. 509 (1957). And just days after the attacks of September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush returned to the same Islamic Center to implore his fellow Americans—Muslims and non-Muslims alike— to remember during their time of grief that “\[t\]he face of terror is not the true faith of Islam,” and that America is “a great country because we share the same values of respect and dignity and human worth.” Public Papers of the Presidents, George W. Bush, Vol. 2, Sept. 17, 2001, p. 1121 (2001).

Turning to the *ratio decidendi* (i.e. the rationale for the decision), SCOTUS held that the ban was constitutional because it was facially neutral towards religion and there was no evidence of animus towards Muslims on the Trump admin's part:

1. the ban is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing the entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices. The text says nothing about religion. That five of the seven nations currently included in the ban have Muslim-majority populations does not support an inference of religious hostility because the policy covers just 8&amp;#37; of the world's Muslim population and us limited to countries that were previously designated by Congress or prior administrations as posing national security risks.

**NB: I will break away here and say that Roberts is wrong to say "The text (of the ban) says nothing about religion. It patently does:**

&gt;s5(b) EO-1:  
&gt;  
&gt;(b) Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality. Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.

2. Roberts also relied on the fact that Iraq was later removed from the ban as further evidence that there was no animus towards Muslims on the POTUS's part:

&gt;As for Iraq, the Secretary of Homeland Security determined that entry restrictions were not warranted in light of the close cooperative relationshipbetween the U. S. and Iraqi Governments and the country’s key role in combating terrorism in the region. §1(g).It is, in any event, difficult to see how exempting one of the largest predominantly Muslim countries in the region from coverage under the Proclamation can be cited as evidence of animus toward Muslims.

3. Three additional features of the ban support the government's claim that the ban was not motivated by religious animus, according to Roberts:

* First, the ban was not intended to be permanent;
* Second, there are significant exceptions for various categories of nationals in nearly all of the countries listed on the ban, including Muslim; and
* Third, the ban creates a waiver program open to all covered nationals from the listed countries that apply for entry into the US as immigrants or non-immigrants, including Muslims.

TLDR: Travel ban is not unconstitutional because it is facially neutral, there is no evidence of anti-Muslim animus and there is a legitimate reason behind it, namely national security.

Edit: Did someone down-vote the thread? Lol. Why?David has been told several times that he has only four fingers in each hand, which is incorrect of course.  I submit, however, that he gives the appearance of having only four fingers because his pinky fingers and thumbs are extremely long.  If Pat objected to Sarah Sanders being put out of a restaurant, I can only attribute that to his youth and inexperience. Where's the Pat who stood up to the guy who attempted to pickpocket him?I've never heard of this woman until about 4 hours ago, and now I hear that she's unseated a top ranking democrat in a primary.  Completely out of the blue for me, and I spend about 3 hours a day buried in the news.  I did some digging and found that outfits like TYT, Secular Talk, and Jimmy Dore have  been on her trail for 6 months or more.  They have even gotten interviews with her.   I've cut them out of my alt-media diet because they were getting just a bit too wacky and sensational for me, but I appreciate their fight.  But Dave.... this story is very VERY exciting.  Lets pick up the ball on this girl, and others, alright?

2 year memberAs someone who couldn't be more staunchly opposed to the Bernie Sanders platform, I am extremely happy that Cortez won despite thinking it was never going to happen in reality.  This proves a lot of things, and it even proves me wrong.

1.  This proves that money does not win elections.  People who say "the candidate who outraises the other almost always wins," are committing a classic false cause fallacy.  This is yet another case of that.

2.  The establishment operates with seething arrogance.  Crowley didn't show up to all (or any?) of the debates.  He and the media supporting him ran a campaign dismissing Cortez rather than challenging her.  

3.  Democratic Socialists can win.  This is where I get to eat my words.  I laughed at Bernie folks and spat on them, and now is my day to say I was wrong.  Well, I was wrong.  These kinds of economically ignorant people can indeed win elections by shattering polling models.  This is why we MUST be diligent in challenging these people, not dismissing them.

4.  People are tired of "Anti Trump" as someone's entire campaign, and Anti-Trumpers are in grave danger of losing their base to others (even to Republicans!).  Agree with Cortez or not, she had a platform.  Crowley didn't.  This is a habit among Democrats that they run merely to oppose the sitting president rather than a core set of ideas.  Bernie folks have their own awful motivations as well, but at least they have a platform of being more than just Anti-Trump.  

5.  People don't trust the media.  This is a known with Republicans.  Where you didn't see this kind of result is with Democrats.  Crowley, like most establishment Democrats, was seen as the frontrunner and as said above, Cortez was just dismissed as a young radical socialist (see Vox).  Normally people will be tugged in the direction of the media.  Not this time, at least here.  

6.  People are angry with the state of the Democratic party.  Kind of goes along with #4, but this extends to the entire party.  Progressives have incited lots of anger at Wall Street and corporate America and those who take money from them within the DNC.  People are simply tired of the status quo and want the party to change.  This has been seen in other races as well, including where Democrats are more receptive to Trump than others (i.e. more conservative areas).  

I think this is a sign of things to come.  The Democratic party is going to split into at least three different pieces:  Conservative Democrats, Liberal Democrats, and old world, establishment, "corporate" Democrats.   It remains to be seen who wins or if there aren't even more fragments.I know, I know. I once called for a moratorium on Peterson thread, but I came across this Twitter page and I CANNOT NOT share it: https://twitter.com/jbporcleric?lang=en

Example:

Who said it? Peterson or Islamist cleric:

"If women weren't so choosy, then rape wouldn't be necessary" 

 Many many bonus points for not using violence. [https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/27/anthony-kennedy-to-retire-from-supreme-court-679635](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/27/anthony-kennedy-to-retire-from-supreme-court-679635)

As I said in another post, to all the Bernie or bust types like Jimmy Dore.   FUCK YOU !!!!!!!Chief Justice Roberts has not expressed any doubts as to the soundness of that decision. And indeed in his confirmation hearing when asked if he would overturn it, he said:

&gt;Roe v. Wade is the settled law of the land. ... There is nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying that precedent, as well as Casey." 

Of course, he could have been lying. But I think y'all should be more concerned about attempts to end gerrymandering, union rights, and single-payer. Yes, single-payer! Do not underestimate the ability of a judge to interpret the constitution so as to strike down just about any law. 

If you think I'm kidding, look up the case of Lochner, in which SCOTUS held limits to working time violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The victim was in a car with another man who was involved in a drive-by shooting minutes prior to the police catching up with the fleeing car. Cameras caught both events from different angles. Apparently the 15 year old exited the car, showed his empty hands in the air, then ran and was shot in the back. D.A. asserts that another man was the drive-by shooter. Days of street protest followed. Will justice be served?Looking for progressive shows like the D.Pakman show but in Spanish. Hopefully David P. will be able to put out like weekly segments in Spanish in the future. Every time I see some dumb fuck selfish Boomer I have to contain my power level, any interaction with them is like accidentally stapling your finger or hitting it with a hammer.


Dumb fucking old Boomers are stupidly proud of how technologically illiterate they are. They wear their ignorance about societal progression on their bolo ties as if it's charming instead of an unfunny and cringy reminder of what race relations used to look like.


Not only do they constantly bring up their antiquated advice from when life was so easy you could support an entire fucking family off of one factory workers wage they all act as if they got to where they are off of hard work.


It's as if they somehow think that all the millennials with four year degrees in compex fields that can't get a job somehow lack the charisma retired to walk into the job they want, look the manager in the eyes and give them a firm handshake.


Sorry retard grey hair fuck head Boomer but any job that will give you healthcare, a decent roof over your head and future prospects is now INSANELY hard to get! Every job now requires specialisation. We can't all be dumb fucks like how you were and basically get a BA and walk into a decent job.


Also thanks for continuing to fuck up the environment because of "muh investments". It's not as if we haven't known about climate change for close to 40 years now - j hope you end up in a home and your kids don't visit you.

Comment below to tell boomers like David how sick of them you areI am not sure how to put this. It seems that the American Left has been voting to spite the right and at times for pragmatism for far too long. This has cost the American people Bigly! With Trump, it's clear that we have to vote pragmatically, but what about afterwards? It seems like there is always a trainwreck on the right and the Democrats are still working to stifle progressive candidates despite recent victories. What is the line for telling the Democratic party to fuck off even if it leads to a Republican win?I have spent the past week, and this evening a bit upset - and feeling frustrated, and helpless, and as of recently, consoling my fiancee, a youthful, ambitious, beautiful man with whom I seek to - and will - spend the rest of my life with, regardless of what may become of the laws and this nation. In the conversation we had, and emboldened by the comforting of others, I wanted to post here to combat some of the sadness and frustration I know many here will join myself in expressing. 

But I have doubled down on my comittment to my community, my friends, my family, and the LGBTQ community, the work for my students, and advocacy, with a simple, strong message: We will not yield to bigotry, violence, hatred - we may be frustrated. Angry. Furious. Hopeless. Disturbed. 

But, I, and I should hope we - are not afraid. 

We have seen progress in the expression of ideas, and more people running for office on progressive ideals winning hearts, and minds. 

And while we have seen ever still, those who seek to gather in the swamps and depths of the internet, gathering with glee, talking about and celebrating in either ignorance, malice, or in vile celebration, in the prospect of what may be something that will challenge our Republic and the rule of law to its very essence, I think it is important to remember:

If we quit now - they win. Took 2 minutes online.  Register, get your friends to register, and let's get a blue wave rollin'I have seen a bunch of people on the right wing claim that David is a feminist and on the left people have claimed that David is not a feminist.


I think we can all find quotes by people proclaiming what they believe in but for me I'm more interested in an individuals actions.


I'm sure that it is no secret that David is a person whose sole motivator is self interest. I don't think that he has ever actually given to charity or ever actually had a substantial giveaway.

Sure - you could claim that giving free merch or free access to the show is "charity" but then you'd also have to assume the same of a billboard on the side of the road.


Enter Rachael Gordon, a brilliant co-host who was added to the show around the same time as the new producer. Was David being a feminist when he hired her? No - of course not. He was using his audiences male gaze to increase his views and prop up interest as his new producer was flailing.


Well, what about in his family life? Well actually Davids father has remarried. He has a stepmother who is a fair deal younger than his father (no comment).


Well, what about his personal life? This, I feel is the most damning evidence regarding whether David is or isn't a feminist. David has had the same girlfriend for a few years now, around half a decade. David is in his mid 30's and she is slightly younger. David has said that currently he has no plans to have children but may in the future.


Why bring this up? Well, dear reader: David is fully content with burning up the best years of this woman's reproductive life with nary a guarantee. If he wanted he could pack up her things tomorrow and tell her to leave and she would have no recourse.


They aren't married (David conveniently doesn't believe in it) and he barely even speaks about her. I think anyone even barely squinting at the facts can tell how one sided this relationship is and I think we all know what will happen in ten years when David finally is ready for kids he will most likely have dropped this poor woman and found a willing receptacle for his seed.


A real feminist understands the sacrifices women must make and doesn't take their company lightly. David Pakman is not a feminist, he doesn't actively campaign against female interests but he is not interested in indulging others regarding their needs within his own life.
**Darker timeline**: McConnell, with pressure from Republican senators like Susan Collins and Lisa Mukowski, postpone Supreme Court justice nomination till after November elections.

**Darkest timeline**: Collins and Mukowski vote with the GOP and confirm Trump's conservative pick, putting progressive wins in the past four decades at risk.

In the darker timeline, Trump might still get his pick, but at least it has the veneer of reason. Either way, it's depressing to think about.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW7rG\_FTr7Y&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW7rG_FTr7Y&amp;t=0s)[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/youtube-tested-trump-approved-how-candace-owens-suddenly-became-loudest-n885166](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/youtube-tested-trump-approved-how-candace-owens-suddenly-became-loudest-n885166)

It covered it name sake - by  Laura Ingram's OPINION against it !!No regulations. Right?

I've seen self-proclaimed anarchists call the no regulation views from libertarians retarded, yet don't they want the same thing?  They both seem kind of wishful thinking in my view.

aren't anarchist in agreement on regulation with the libertarians?

Edit:

I'm just curious and mostly ignorant. Lets talk!a) As David requested feedback from audience..here is my feedback

I think we all agree that non-violent protests are OK. How do we do these non-violent protests? IMHO

a) Asking politely to leave restaurants are OK. Yes it's a slippery slope. Some pro-life business owners are gonna push back service based on morality reasons

b) Going to home or harassing outside home is NOT OK.  Agree with Pat that this can potentially take the #civility debate to dangerous consequences

**c****) But whatever way we PROTEST, "right" is always going to say "it's uncivil".**

Looks like most good protests are always labelled 'bad' by \`other\` side..

I really think he needs to be cheered up, and that is why we need to pool our collective intelligence to figure out how.

I vote for him getting a pet snake or falcon.  The latter would be especially nice because Pakman could have dreams where he trains it to fly out and attack his enemies.1. pointing out he's **pathological liar** in order to discredit him (as we should). No voters want to be lied to, especially by politicians. And Trump likes CONSTANTLY. **Destroying the credibility of Trump: o\*\*\*\*nce voters become distrusted of him, people won't believe what he says.** Whatever "great" policies he proposes or "accomplishments" he touts on daily basis, people won't believe him.
2. attacking his **gross incompetence** throughout his life, from bankruptcies, and countless failed business adventures to ignorance just about everything.
3. attacking Trump on **bad policies.** Many of his policies are unsound, from building the wall that's just too expensive, to reducing necessary regulations and crippling government agencies, to allowing authoritarian governments having nuclear weapons, just to name a few.
4. pointing out Trump **constantly tries to scam people and** **doesn't keep** **promises**, from trying to scam students for their money, to refusing to pay lawyers the fees that he should have paid.
5. pointing out Trump is **utterly ignorant** just about everything, including the things that Trump needs to know to become an effective president. There are many examples. And his inability to learn. He was asked the same question about nuclear triad weeks earlier, but he still couldn't answer the same question in the debate.
6. pointing out Trump **frequently breaks the law**. Point out the government and civil lawsuits that he and his companies have faced. And he makes business dealings with and is **associated with criminals or organized crimes.**
7. pointing out Trump is utterly **corrupt**. Trump brags that he knows the inside game of money in politics, but does he have the guts to fix it? Or does he perpetuate the same game? By pointing out his corruption (for example, donating money to local government in order to get tax breaks for his real estate), people will become more distrustful of his claim of "draining the swamp".
8. he's just a **horrible human being in general.** How he treats people like pawns for his own gain.

# Of course, all of this hinges on the fact that people trust the media that report on these things. And Trump's constant attack on the media for this very reason: if people don't trust the media, they won't believe the reports on the horrible things things that Trump has done. The distrust of the media is actually a more thorny problem than attacking Trump himself.

Note that I leave out his support for tariffs, personal improprieties, racism, narcissism, misogyny, xenophobia, authoritarianism, being petty, impulsivity, and ill-temper.  These things are what his voters either don't care about or actually like about a political candidate. Attacking these points may not be as effective as you would like, and they may be even counter-productive.

TYT: The Best Way To Attack Donald TrumpThis is a question I've pondered and with some deliberation I've decided to present my quandry to you, humble readers of this subreddit.


It seems like almost every second or third clip uploaded onto YouTube David is professing something to the effect of "support independent media". I swallowed these statements for a while because it seemed like David was one of the little guys, we'd have silly and niche stories. Sometimes we'd be treated to personal anecdotes and interviews with fringe personalities with strange personal struggles although lately it seems David has stopped being David and has become more of the same.


The turning point for David as a commentator and this show in general was the election of Trump. It stopped being The David Pakman Show and David has become obsessed with Trump, he's even become the type of person to send random tweets to the President.

I began to notice that I wasn't necessarily learning anything new from watching this show a huge chunk of the time, it was merely other news sources regurgitated with nothing new added - David had simply become a middleman, a news broker of sorts. Basically a left leaning Drudge Report in video form.


If we follow the star of Davids contemporaries we can see how they've evolved and found their niche whereas David has squandered his fame:

- Kyle Kulinski become entrenched within trying to reform the Democrat Party from within via the Justice Democrats. Kyle has decided to get angry and try to motivate people to get out to the polls and hold the democrats to a higher standard.

- Cenk Uygur has continued to build his enormous network and has been in debates with right wing celebrities like Ben Shapiro.

- Jimmy Dore has become a hilarious conspiracy theorist/crackpot who was so sick of the corporatist DNC that he became a Bernie or Buster who started fighting with other lefitst internet pundits.

- Sam Seder of The Majority Report livestreams his shows on YouTube and really drills down into the stories and has a huge amount of audience engagement. Compare and contrast Sams natural charisma and willingness to engage with audience members with Davids robotic conceitedness, it is night and day.

- Dave Rubin (love him or love to hate him) has latched onto conservative and alt-right/lite personalities and has become a force of nature that seems to be loved by the fans of Sam Harris, Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson.


But what has David done? Well, he's continued making the show but he's spent a disproportionate amount of his time being a university lecturer. Why? I don't have the answer for that personally. It seems that the most logical choice would be to throw yourself 100% into your show but it seems that has not been the case.

What are your thoughts?
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dN5SKLxBo4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dN5SKLxBo4)Couldn't he just achieve the same effect with two Green Screens?To quote:

Friend 1: "Well you know, concentration camps are a really important thing that just got  a bad reputation because someone used them to kill a bunch of Jews. They're actually really important things you know."

Friend 2: "Yeah, they're good for countering guerilla warfare."

Friend 1: "Exactly. You see, when you keep every one of them in one place, you can keep an eye on them. Concentration camps mean that these people get food, shelter medical stuff, everything before they get sent back."

Cognative dissonance at it's finest people.I'm so sick of every comments section of articles about solar &amp; wind on reddit and news sites I read having *that guy* who just *has* to bring up nuclear energy.


There are very valid reasons as to why nuclear energy isn't being pursued.

Nuclear energy is NOT clean and it requires an enormous initial investment to get running, once it is running it has a finite life span and to make matters worse dismantling the facility is often incredibly expensive too!

https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/12/georgia-regulators-say-dramatically-over-budget-nuclear-plant-can-move-forward/

https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/dismantling-of-cumbria-nuclear-plant-runs-900m-over-budget/10032248.article


Not only is it costly, it also isn't as clean as people would like you to think. Aside from the gargantuan costs, associated labor and logistical frustrations associated with this source of energy it also creates radioactive waste that must be disposed of and kept safe from contaminating the surrounding area and ground water for thousands of years.


Nuclear waste stays dangerous for so long that people have begun seriously discussing how to make sure that the radioactive, poisonous and dangerous symbols we use today will make sense to humans 100,000 years in the future. DUMB.


Nuclear also is nowhere near as safe as wind or solar. Nuclear facilities requires a huge security team to guard it 24/7 as it is a high profile target for terrorists, the facilities also can cause incredible damage to the local environment and people if there are natural disasters like what happened in 2012 in Fukushima.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant

Face it: Nuclear energy is impractical, it sucks and nowadays it mostly seems to be lobbed into discussions online by Trump supporters to derail discussions in support of renewable energy sources.Democratic socialists want workers to take over everything (the means of production), not the government. Democratic socialism wants to overthrow capitalism with worker owned enterprises. That’s a fact. Bernie is a social democrat, not a democratic socialist. Alexandria Cortez is a democratic socialist and wants to eliminate employers and capitalism and have workers run the workplaces. Jeremy Corbyn is also a democratic socialist. But Bernie is not. He only says he is. It would be TYT’s employees going further than forming a union and taking over the entire enterprise, replacing Cenk. All decisions would be made by votes by the workers. Denmark is a social democracy, a capitalist country. It’s not democratic socialism. Democratic socialism is a form of Marxism. Look at TYT fail to understand democratic socialism. [TYT doesn’t know what Democratic Socialism is ](https://youtu.be/ZRxV6pYRVeE)I don't get why no one mentions Justice Stephen Breyer when talking about the future of the [Supreme Court](https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/SupremeCourt?src=hashtag_click) . He is 79, he is only 2 years younger than Anthony Kennedy, The guy who's retiring. He will be about A.K.'s age by 2020 and the average age of mortality is 79 in the us. He might retire, who knows he might not want to be working for the rest of his life. I understand justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is more likely to be gone in about 2 years but that's still a scary detail. It is VERY possible the Trump get's four picks though. Two of them replacing Clinton picks.Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdqraQ11dCE

I very much lean conservative but I watch David Pakman far more than any other liberal talk show host on YouTube (including Secular Talk) because he presents arguments that I generally disagree with, but in an objective manner that makes me think about why I hold certain positions and question whether or not I'm right. He strayed as far away from that description as can be with this clip.

David's argument at around the 1:30 mark is that using, what I will call "dirty political tactics" (such as kicking Trump administration officials out of restaurants or heckling them at their private home)for lack of a better term, is justified because Trump will pick a supreme court nominee who might tip the scales and overturn Roe V. Wade. I am both pro-choice and an atheist, so I'm actually on David's side here, but this is by far the most absurd position I've ever heard him take. 

I understand that David passionately believes that women should have access to abortion, which is fine, but the people on the pro-life side are just as passionate, if not more so, than David. Now I don't agree with those people, but they believe that an abortion is the literal murder of a child, and there is a significant, and very respectable, philosophical argument that goes along with that position. 

David,
If you believe resorting to peaceful, but dirty political tactics is justified here, then how can you possibly say it wouldn't be justified on the other end of the spectrum? Like I already said, their conviction is just as strong as yours and has a very strong philosophical basis (not just a religious basis). Do you realize you are arguing for the end of civil disagreement to be replaced with a sort of mob rule? That if an individual determines their cause to be significantly moral then they can resort to peaceful, yet immoral means to force their view on others. 

I can think of two very relevant examples outside of abortion to illustrate my point. Conservatives believe that a business owner should not be forced by threat of gun to bake a cake for a gay wedding. That it is ultimately the bakers choice to choose who he serves and that is especially true when it goes against a persons sincere convictions, religious or otherwise. It is an act of tyranny to force someone to provide a service against their will. Just like it would be an act of tyranny to force a gay baker to bake a MAGA cake (btw political affiliation is a protected class in a couple cities, including DC).

Conservatives are also extraordinarily protective over their guns. They believe that the combination of the first and second amendment are the best vanguards against tyranny, both foreign and domestic. Furthermore, they believe it is their right to to have weapons in their homes and on their person to ensure their family's preservation in the event of a crime and that the police are minutes away when seconds matter. 

So if a liberal supreme court severely limits the rights I've outlined above, would you defend any conservatives  that show up to Ruth Bader Ginsburg's home and harassed her and her family for instance? Can you not see the precedent your advocating for? Do you also not see how this precedent can only stay peaceful for so long? 

I've disagreed with you a lot on a number of issues, but those are ultimately just differences of opinion and perspective. You are now advocating for something that is wholly immoral, even if you denounce physical harm (Richard Spencer's "Peaceful Ethnic Cleansing" position seems very similar to yours to be honest). You've completely failed to look at the merits of the abortion debate from the other side and arrogantly declared your position to be objectively superior, so much so that you justify dirty political tactics to ensure your position comes out on top. It's only one step away from the "punch a Nazi" meme that was going around after Charlottesville. 

The Trump administration is well within its rights to elect a conservative justice to the supreme court and is in no way an act of tyranny, corruption, fascism, or anything else of the sort. I sincerely hope you rethink your position on this because that type of thinking is tearing the country apart. 

Here are a couple pieces that I think corroborate my position.

https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/06/22/the_lefts_most_dangerous_game_137332.html
http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/june_2018/31_think_u_s_civil_war_likely_soonMy basic understanding of the Great Depression is that the Hawley/Smoot tariffs, followed by tariffs from France, the UK, etc. contributed significantly to the global meltdown in the 1930's. With Trump going tariff crazy and launching these trade wars which are already hurting US industry, how likely is it that history could repeat itself, or are there measures in place to prevent it from happening?It's no secret that David is not the most masculine man going around, this isn't an issue and I don't want to engage in a conversation shaming men, women or trans people for how well they fit into gender stereotypes.


However, there are a few things that have caused me to believe that David may be suffering from a low level of testosterone. The initial event that caused me to form this hypothesis is that David consistently uploads selfies to his Instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/david.pakman/


A strange behavior that I have witnessed David participating in is that he will often take his selfies in a way that is typical to female instagrammers. This is best summed up by this meme here: https://imgur.com/gallery/IPFrK7A and for comparison this is how David takes his selfies: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bkl_PVEHEvE/?taken-by=david.pakman notice the similarity?

Another solid piece of evidence that I have collected is that David freely admits on his show that he has a rigorous hair maintenance routine - he buys premium products and will not leave the house without following his hair regimen. This is actually a very common female trait: http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-women-makeup-attractiveness-income-20160520-story.html

Even more signs that David may be suffering from low testosterone is that he never has much facial hair and when he does have it the growth looks quite thin. Perhaps the facial hair thinness is linked to a decrease in male vigor caused by low testosterone?

It has also been noted by other journalists that figures within the liberal media tend to suffer from low levels of testosterone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=504&amp;v=ku4YwXDkUw8

David is often characterized as being quite a risk averse fellow, unsurprisingly high testosterone correlates with increased risk taking behavior. David has stated that he has never taken any drugs outside of alcohol. Here is the study: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3100645We have made so much progress in the last 50 years regarding race relations, gender equality and LGBT issues. This is undeniable, but it cannot be denied that we still have a long way to go before we have fully shredded the last vestiges of bigotry.


Nowadays Elvis is a controversial figure because it has become public knowledge that he wholesale stole the culture, musical stylings and spotlight from African American musicians that were undoubtedly far more talented than he was.

You could simply write this phenomenon off if it was a mere isolated case occurring half a century ago however as you will see that simply is not the case.


Fast forward 40 years from the debut of Elvis' first album and you'll see the meteoric rise of Eminem. Eminem did much the same as Elvis, he culturally appropriated historically African American culture, music and stylings.


I think you see what I'm getting at here: White people and males are not blind to race and gender. They much prefer to hear messages when it is coming from someone who they share a component of their identity with.


When the keys to all the wealth all around the world are possessed by white men is it any wonder that in the domain of sports a typical male star athlete will make millions whereas the average female athlete must have a day job and a backup plan in order to stay financially solvent?


I'm not saying any of this to pretend that I am superior to anyone reading this, I admit that I have my own blind spots and biases. However, I feel as if I can attempt to rectify this in a powerful way.

I have decided that instead of obtaining my news and information from someone who shares components of my identity like David I have decided to instead diversify my news intake with people of color like Benjamin Dixon and what I found was shocking.


Benjamin Dixons show (link here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMCioqY4zblWt7Uw0E0VTGA) is criminally underrated and he is a prolific public speaker. I don't know if it is because of his dialect of AAVE (African-American Vernacular English) or because I often do not listen to African Americans as they speak truth to power but I feel as if you could lay down a sick rap beat as he talks, put it on spotify and the views would just pour in. Benjamin is often a lot more invested when he talks about issues pertaining to race, racism and the African American experience.


I implore you, do as I did. Diversify your media consumption and include diverse people and people from backgrounds whom you do not share - maybe you will learn to understand a different perspective, maybe you will find someone interesting and different or maybe you'll think I'm just being silly. Either way, it is an interesting experiment to consider.Roe v Wade is safe for now. Obergefell v Hodges was a 5 - 4 decision and it was only three years ago (2015), which is not long enough for someone like Roberts CJ, who is now likely to be the swing vote, to afford it stare decisis deference. Also, Roberts wrote a scathing dissent in Obergefell, which actually swung me in the opposite direction of that decision.That's right. I think Obergefell was wrongly decided, but that's neither here nor there.

So, here's what is going to happen. The State of Alabama is probably going to pass a law which outright states that it will no longer issue marriage licenses to gay couples and it would no longer recognise gay marriages from outside the state. That will then require a lawsuit to block that law and that lawsuit will then go all the way to SCOTUS who will then decide whether or not such a law is constitutional. With Roberts being your swing vote, I'll give you one guess as to how that decision will turn out.

Fisher v Texas (2016), the last major affirmative action case is also massively at risk.

Elections have consequences.

The Lochner era, in which the Supreme Court kept knocking down New Deal legislation designed to promote working better conditions lasted 40 years! 40 YEARS! For those of you hoping your decision not to vote for Hillary and the Democrats and even worse to encourage people not to vote for Hillary and the Democrats in hopes that it will teach them a lesson and/or provoke "the revolution", think about all the people that will suffer because of your ego and before your revolution comes, *if* it comes. This is on you! You are partly to blame for this. Yes, as David said, the first order of blame goes to Trump supporters. However, the second order of blame belongs to you!I've noticed that as of late Patrick Ford has seemingly been a bit blue. Gone are his rambunctious and often humorous interjections, his sly quips and coy grins - I think that he is trapped within the belly of the beast.


Patrick, before you begin on your ambitious journey to improve your life and spark up your internal flame you have to hone your flint first, begin by cleaning your bedroom (I assume you live with your parents still).

Jordan Peterson says that productivity begins with a cleaned bedroom and that you cannot make effective change without first cleaning your room.

You should also work on your posture, I have noticed in some of the videos posted to the YouTube channel that you have been slouching... Dr Peterson is very clear on this that you should stand up straight with your shoulders back!


Alright, now that we have your room and posture in order I want you to go to this website https://www.understandmyself.com/ and complete a personality test. Upon the completion of this test you will be given the chance to practice some self authoring.

Self Authoring is an exercise in which you reflectively write about yourself, your life, how you are feeling, your ambitions and your struggle. Reading what you have written can help you truly internalize your feelings and understand your mindset.


I think that the advice of Professor Peterson will help you improve your life.. You have been at this intern position for a while now and I think it is time for you to move on. Somehow I doubt David is paying you a decent living wage - don't you know that career advancement in this day and age is punctuated by changing positions and companies frequently, otherwise you'll experience stagnant wages.


Anyway Pat, I wish you all the best in your endeavors and I hope you are successful in finding courage to change your life with the teachings of Jordan Peterson.[Trump Supreme Court Will Lower Your Income](https://www.epi.org/blog/so-called-right-to-work-laws-will-lower-wages-for-union-and-nonunion-workers-in-missouri/)whenever there is a discussion about Russia for example(but this is true generally aswell) they seem to want to always turn the convo back to the US in every instance, and act as if the people talking about russia are somehow defending US policy, they also act as if these people never talk about the US even though they have no evidence of that.

they just seem very ignorant of any non US allied countries activities, crimes etc and seem to want it to never be talked about, they act as if bringing it up is somehow unacceptable and always want to quash the discussion. 

I'm interested in War, foriegn policy, Intelligence, international relations etc and like learing about and talking about world politics and geopolitics, but it's basically impossible to have these kind of  conversations with these people cause they hate when the convo isn't about the US. like the with russia for example, I find Russia, their intelligence activities and foriegn policy very interesting to learn about and talk about, so why shouldn't I? these people just demand we don't talk about, and in many cases perceive talking about it as a defence of US foriegn policy

anyone else find this annoying?I'm sure this topic has come up before, but I didn't notice it and would like to know what the views on it are.

Can I and 100000 other people make a 10+ dollar "conditional" donation to a majority member of the Senate for a NO vote on (insert next awful policy change)?

The "condition" is: we the people do not want (awful thing/bill/confirmation) to be passed. So we the people make a "political donation" to a member of the GOP. This donation is stored in a kickstarter-like fund. After the vote, this fund will evenly distribute the money to all GOP members who voted NO (say for extra safety AND the bill did not pass). There could be variations on this idea, but the main point is to bribe the GOP not to ruin the county.

Can "We The People" become "We The People Inc." to compete in this unfair game?



Months back, multiple Progressive pundits (maybe including David, can't remember) were attributing Congressional Trump loyalty to the pending tax cuts.  They said once those get passed they'll turn on him, having nothing left to gain from him and only harm to the Party's image, maybe even to the country as a whole.  Well, the tax cuts got passed and the harms have ensued as predicted.  Just the most recent examples: Trump pledging to the NK dictator to end joint military exercises with SK, without even notifying anyone in US military leadership, and no reason to trust Kim to denuclearize.  Starting a trade war that will harm our economy AND alienate allies.  Trying with no real plan or preparation to implement an immigration scare tactic that has only served to horrify the majority of the citizens.  And then of course there's the whole looming issue of illegal behaviors involved in getting Trump elected in the first place.

I guess I can understand the tactical-albeit-immoral *silence* of most GOP Congresspersons. --Best to have no record of either supporting or not supporting Trump, with midterms and future Congressional elections to consider.  Hell, even the number of Democrat officials willing to publicly condemn Trump is relatively small.  I and fellow Alabamans who just barely elected Doug Jones over a child predator know damn well he can't hammer Trump without obvious consequences (even if we wish he and all of Congress would care enough about America to face those consequences).  

Even if we accept job security as the reason for elected officials to stay 'hands-off' Trump, what explains those who are pounding their fists on the table to try to end the Mueller investigation?  Why are THOSE guys so freaked out about the prospect of losing Trump?  Why wouldn't they prefer Pence, who would appear to offer everything the GOP likes, without the bad and unpredictable side effects of Trump?  Pence would rein in uteruses and brown people, and unbridle corporations to gobble up all the wealth and shit out pollution, while not doing wackadoodle stuff to eliminate all the disguises successfully used by the GOP up to this point (e.g. the meanings of terms like "strong economy," "global power" and "border security").  
The Trump spectacle is stirring consciousness and enlightenment like nothing in recent history; people are sitting up and Googling to comprehend the terms, titles, and histories they've never heard of or maybe learned in school but weren't motivated to REALLY understand until now.  Maybe +/- 40% are still okay with the disguises, but that number is just a (highly likely) stock market crash away from plummeting and staying low forever.  And like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez points out, demographics with historically low voter turnout are now getting with the program. Yes she busted her ass to accomplish a victory that was shocking in every way, but let's face it, Trump is doing the work of knocking on millions of doors every day. Consider that the most socially Conservative voters are white and old, dying off every day, and being replaced by minorities and white people who are fine with minorities as well as abortion, gay people, the scientific method, etc. So the only thing the GOP has to hold onto is military strength, the economy and the remaining number of social Conservatives who just haven't died yet, and Trump actively threatens all those things, bungling everything 'foreign' including trade, and saying the stuff about minorities and women you're not supposed to say out loud.  
Pence could stop the bleeding or at least slow it.  Pence could uphold the disguises for at least the length of his presidency, if not some time thereafter.  So why are some GOP elected officials so averse to letting nature take its course, letting Trump get impeached and replaced by steadier hands?    That's my own question, not explicit and maybe not even implicit in her text, but here are some select excerpts from an article by Pavlina R. Tcherneva, who [has been interviewed at least](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUFv6IDAnts) [twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92KY7iTcNLY) by David Pakman:

&gt;  
&gt;**Fiscal Policy Effectiveness: Lessons from the Great Recession**  
&gt;  
&gt;by Pavlina R. Tcherneva  
&gt;  
&gt;Levy Economics Institute of Bard College  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, what is considered to be Keynesian policy today is largely a misinterpretation of the Keynesian prescriptions, which largely stems from a fundamental misidentification of Keynes’s theory of effective demand with the theory of aggregate demand (Tcherneva 2011). In the General Theory, Keynes carefully articulated that employment determination depended not on the volume of aggregate demand but on the point of effective demand which was very hard to stabilize and fix at full employment. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Keynes also stressed that both consumption and investment are determined by certain subjective and independent factors, such as the marginal propensity to consume (mpc), the marginal efficiency of capital (mec), and the marginal efficiency of money (mem), that are not under the direct control of government policy. Thus, to bring the economy to its full employment equilibrium, he argued, government action was required, but not in the form of indiscriminate government spending. This is because boosting aggregate demand alone does not change the independent factors quickly enough in recessions to generate strong job growth. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;In other words when liquidity preference is high, “people want the moon” (Keynes 1964 \[1936\]: 231) and it is thus unclear how large an injection through aggregate demand is needed to induce the private sector to stop hoarding net financial assets and start vigorous consumption and investment. But even when economic activity is buoyant, firms find it unprofitable to hire all who are ready, willing,and able to work. The liquidity preference of some private agents dictates that it is more profitable to invest their savings in money form than in production.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\] By contrast, in expansions, boosting aggregate demand does not create full employment even when the economy is strong because it will produce an incrementally smaller employment-creation effect the closer the economy gets to full employment. This is because part of the increase in aggregate demand is captured by price increases and not entirely by employment increases. In other words, even when the mpc or mec are very high, the structure of the economy ensures that priming the pump simply produces inflationary pressures in certain overheating sectors where the mpc is high, thus producing more unequal income distribution.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is because, as Keynes cautioned in the General Theory, when “the increase in demand is directed to products with a relatively low elasticity of employment, a larger proportion of it will go to swell the incomes of entrepreneurs and a smaller proportion to swell the incomes of wage earners and other price cost factors” (Keynes 1964 \[1936\]: 287). This kind of inflationary and income distribution distortions prompt policymakers to abandon aggregate demand policies and leave the economy below full employment or at, what they have subsequently dubbed, the “natural rate” of unemployment.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\] It is well-known that Keynes considered attempts to reduce the supply price of output by lowering wages to be counterproductive: because employers will likely be unable to sell the additional output, even if it could be produced at lower cost, they will reduce overall employment in the face of falling demand from falling incomes. Thus, Keynes considered reducing wages to be a“method \[that\] is socially disastrous in the process and socially unjust in the result” (Keynes1981: 426).  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\] Because expectations, liquidity preference, and portfolio decisions are subjective and beyond the direct control of policy, Keynes did not believe that policy should attempt to try and stabilize them in order to generate full employment. Instead, for Keynes, the only way to fix the point of effective demand at full employment was for the government to target the unemployed directly.There is considerable evidence to suggest that Keynes had in mind a public policy that would make an unconditional job offer in the public sector to all individuals who are willing and able to work but unable to find private employment (Tcherneva 2011). This job offer would be available to the jobless both in recessions and in expansions. It would be a long-term program for attaining and maintaining true full employment.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, this approach has a direct method for dealing with structural unemployment, which is generally neglected by traditional aggregate demand management policies (indeed, many economists consider structural unemployment to be part of the “natural unemployment” rate). By contrast, the direct job-creation approach would target its employment efforts to regions that may have experienced massive job losses due to restructuring and to individuals who may be deemed unemployable by those private industries that are employing. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Secondly, the goal of this program is to provide decent jobs to its participants. These are jobs that use the available idle resources to meet some unfilled need in the community and which establish a basic but decent wage-benefit package as a standard for the economy as a whole.These jobs do not compete with private sector pay, but simply set a universal floor to wages in the public and private sectors. They do not compete with private sector output either, as they are jobs that provide public goods and services, which the private sector does not supply.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thirdly, job support to the poor and unemployed is a more effective stabilization method than providing income alone. This is because this policy would maintain and enhance human capital and would simultaneously increase both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. By contrast, income support for the unemployed and the poor is a policy that leaves many willing and able to work individuals in idleness and (often) for long periods of time—it is a policy that wastes human potential.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fourth, this is a policy that does not rely on boosting aggregate demand to produce full employment. Even in severe recessions, when a great fiscal push is needed, this push must nevertheless be targeted. Today, for example, we need both more and better distributed demand—that is, more spending that is targeted to hiring the unemployed. Once a program of this kind is in place, not more demand, but better distributed demand, will be required to maintain full employment over the long run. Keynes himself argued during the buoyant interwar period that “we are in more need today of a rightly distributed demand than of a greater aggregate demand” (Skidelsky 2001: 21). As the economy expands and public sector workers find employment in the private sector, such a program will shrink and full employment will be consistent with lower public sector demand.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fifth, the first aim of this program is to provide jobs for all, but once the unemployed have been hired, “there can be only one object in the economy, namely to substitute some other, better, and wiser piece of expenditure” for individual projects (Keynes 1982: 146), i.e., to redesign those public works to address the specific challenges of specific communities as the need arises. Thus, contrary to common myth, Keynes did not advocate the creation of useless project for the sake of job creation but strongly advocated a carefully planned long-term full employment program—a program that was flexible, spontaneous, and experimental enough to accommodate any new unemployment that might quickly develop, but that was also carefully thought out and designed to address the key strategic objectives of a nation, while maintaining full employment over the long run.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sixth, such a program could be executed through public or semi public bodies. Job creation is done by the community as a whole, including both the private and public sectors. But as Keynes pointed out, it really wasn’t the business of the private sector to guarantee full employment “any more than it is their business to provide for the unemployed by private charity” (Keynes 1982: 151). It was the responsibility of the public sector to figure out how to employ those who were left behind. And employing them could be done in cooperation with the private sector in public-private partnerships that would manage this long-term program. Seventh, this very policy would have the exact same income, cash-flow, and balance sheet effects that traditional aggregate demand management has, except that spending by the program would be targeted directly to households.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is a genuine bottom-up approach to economic recovery. It is a program that stabilizes the incomes and purchasing power of individuals at the bottom of the income distribution that trickles up and stabilizes the rest of economic activity. Strong and stable demand means strong and stable profit expectations. A program that stabilizes employment and purchasing power is a program that stabilizes cash flows and earnings. Stable incomes through employment also mean stable repayments of debts and greater overall balance sheet stability.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, Keynes firmly objected to using unemployment as an inflation-fighting measure. If inflationary pressures developed near full employment, the public sector should retard new projects where possible and redirect its job creation efforts to particularly distressed areas in the periphery of economic activity. But by no means should it discontinue public works, because that is precisely the time when “private enterprise is stopping from overcapacity and is therefore not in a position to expand” (Keynes 1982: 150). Inflation, for Keynes, was to be addressed through various programs that would either defer payments or encourage thrift, but would not slash jobs.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The question of useful projects is perhaps the most frequently evoked. One way to answer this question is to note that even in the wealthiest and most prosperous nations one can always find rural or urban regions that are continually plagued by poverty and unemployment. In the case of the United States, there are whole cities and states which have suffered from deindustrialization or natural disasters and have seen little new economic activity to replace long-gone industry (think of Detroit or New Orleans). The revitalization of inner cities and rural areas alone will take years of strong job creation and dedicated work in order to rebuild those communities. The unemployed themselves will deliver that revitalization through a public employment program similar to the New Deal of the 1930s.  
&gt;  
&gt;But wealthier communities too have unfilled needs and unemployed individuals who can fulfill them. These may include upgrades to infrastructure, the construction of more public spaces, and the provision of public services. In the United States, many public programs and government services have been underfunded and understaffed for decades—at least since Nixon’s devolution of federal government programs. A once-strong public education system is on the brink of collapse, environmental standards have been eroded, the public health system is unfit to meet the needs of the US population—these are the challenges that can be met by fully utilizing labor resources. There are jobs to be done at every level of government and there are unemployed individuals with different levels of skill sand education to do them.  
&gt;  
&gt;The examples provided here primarily include the regular maintenance and operation of public service jobs for which the government is already responsible. Other such examples would include an ongoing program of reforestation, water purification, and soil erosion improvements, which will provide steady but flexible public sector employment for many semi skilled and unskilled workers over the long run. The wholesale upgrade of US roads, rails,levies, and bridges can also be accomplished with a bold program of direct job creation. At the same time, child- and elderly-care services are wholly inadequate in this country. Homeless shelters are bursting at the seams and a staggering 12 percent of Americans rely on food banks for food assistance (Hunger Report 2010). There are many jobs to be done and there are many unemployed people to do them.But the government can also undertake novel strategic initiatives that can be accomplished expediently only through a big-push policy of public works. The comprehensive weatherization of all public buildings and the complete transformation of current energy production grids to ones relying on alternative energy require the kind of massive infrastructure investment that only government can undertake. There are many more useful jobs one could create if the will to implement such a program was there.

10. [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) 22.4 (2013) 19.9 (2014)I wanna call David, and ask him a question, particularly about sobriety. since he's a proponent of single payer healthcare, an ally of LGBTQ issues, I assume he would be sympathetic to distigmatizing sobriety, and more regulation of the alcohol industry. Big alcohol is out of control! 

Just cause you drink doesn't mean you can't fight the stigma of sobriety just like you don't have to be gay/black/a woman/etc to fight for equal rights. 

If anyone knows, please tell me, I'd love to talk to David on his show about sobriety. This is in regards to the most recent supreme court ruling. The plaintiff claimed that being forced to pay union dues was a violation of his free speech because they engaged in political activity he disagreed with. Though not all union activities are explicitly political in nature, it was claimed that it is effectively impossible to separate what funding goes toward political agendas vs. what doesn't, so having to pay a even partial fee is still a violation of free speech. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, with Kennedy being the deciding vote 5 to 4 - his final ruling as a supreme court justice. Critics claim that this essentially turns the entire country into a "right to work" state.

So what exactly is the argument in favor of mandatory union fees, even for non-members? Is it that all workers benefit from the union's advocacy regardless of their membership status? 

I've seen a lot of people claim that this decision will diminish union membership and lead to the decline of union strength - but that's just a description of a possible outcome, not an actual defense of mandatory union fees. There needs to be a reason besides "it will hurt unions." There is also the possibility that it won't be all bad for unions - teacher's unions in West Virginia, for example, have been especially vigilant recently in fighting for pay raises. One could make the argument that without mandatory fees, unions actually have to work harder to earn the loyalty of the workforce and can't just count on collecting fees automatically.

Anyway, I'd like to hear what you guys think about this issue, and if anyone can clarify the argument in defense of mandatory fees.If not, then I would think a good response to the Justice Kennedy situation would be to not show up. Highly unlikely I know l, just a thought.David has said in the past that he doesn't like the idea of primarying corporate Democrats because he thinks it takes away time/money from fighting Republicans. 

Meanwhile you have other progressive news people like Kyle Kulinski and Cenk setting up ways to help progressives win like with Justice Democrats and also giving them a platform on their show. It was the Justice Democrats who discovered Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and has been with her since day 1 while people like David stayed in the dark and simply wrote off people like her saying it was a waste of time and effort. 

Don't be like that David! Spend at least one segment a week (better yet one segment a show) promoting a progresive candidate! It's the least you can do especially with mid terms around the corner! 

Hi Pat!Yes, David is the head of the show and usually the main person speaking. But, I don't see why Pat isn't at the same desk facing the same camera if he is often contributing to the conversation. If he were to contribute to the conversation more, would it be appropriate for him to be at the same table as David?#An alliance of cuckolds is making an end run around the mainstream conversation. Should we be listening?

Here are some things that you will hear when you sit down to dinner with the vanguard of the Intellectual Cuck Web: There are fundamental biological differences between men and women. Free speech is irrelevant. Identity politics is a winning ideology that is repairing American society. And we’re in a dangerous place if these ideas are considered “cucked.”


I was meeting with David Pakman, an Argentinian Jew; Kyle Kulinski, a guy who screams and rants about Justice democrats; the disgraced Turk Cenk Uygur; and their spouses in a Los Angeles restaurant to talk about how they were turned into cucks. A decade in the future, they argued, in an alternate timeline when Bernie Sanders won none of these observations would have been considered taboo.


Today, people like them who dare venture into this “There Be Fagons” territory on the intellectual map have met with outrage and derision — even, or perhaps especially, from people who pride themselves on openness.


It’s a pattern that has become common in our new era of That Which Cannot Be Said. And it is the reason the Intellectual Cuck Web, a term coined half-jokingly by Mr. Kulinksi, came to exist.


What is the I.C.W. and who is a member of it? It’s hard to explain, which is both its beauty and its danger.


Most simply, it is a collection of predictable thinkers, academic teetotallers and youtube personalities who are having a rolling conversation — on podcasts, YouTube and Twitter, and in underwhelming subreddits — that sound unlike anything else happening, at least publicly, in the culture right now. Feeling largely locked out of legacy outlets, they are rapidly building their own mass media channels.









We've all heard the snarl term "SJW". But what does social justice even mean? Do the people who deride "SJW-sm" even know what social justice means? Do they care?

What does social justice mean to you?

Context: I guess I want to know because I've never seen the term "SJW" as an insult. I know it is intended as such, but hey, guess what, so is "socialist", "communist", "conservative" (in some circles). I guess I don't see how being a "warrior" for "social justice", if you think social justice is a good thing, is meant to be insulting. If I had any kind of authority on the internet I would be encouraging "SJWs" to claim "SJW" - to consider it a badge of honour. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhTLRa_yPrM

I was a little surprised to see the near universally negative reaction this video had and quickly realized it's a bit suspicious. David's videos usually average around 600 likes, which as you can see even with this video, that number holds. The massive amount of dislikes outdoes both the positive and negative reactions nearly all of his videos usually get, which seems to suggest an outside audience went after this video. Even the comments are suspicious. Under normal circumstances, at best there will be one or two comments managing around 90 likes per video, and the usual right-wing troll comments barely get an any attention or likes. With this video there are a lot of comments reaching around 300 likes, and almost all of them are negative ones to the point that David's regular audience has been completely drowned out. I even went and checked a few other left-wing Youtubers coverage of the same topic, and all of them retain their usual amount of likes and dislikes, so for whatever reason it seems like this video got hit particularly hard by some outside influence.  Stalin is one the most evil dictators ever. Putin has demonstrated some evil so far. It is like school shooters being fans of previous school shooters.

For those who don't know, Trump has used "enemy of the people" about journalists. I made a video about Peterson discussing how homosexual parents are inferior at raising kids, and I’m getting  BLASTED by his fan boys spewing off
Anti science . How do these people even function in the world ? This is why I’ll never be a right winger -_-Protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites

How a Dutch intelligence agency secretly hacked into the Kremlin’s most notorious hacking group

Reports claim Netherlands alerted Washington of influence in 2016 presidential elections after officials watched Russian group bypass Democratic National Committee and other operations

# Personal comment: 

I wonder why the Obama administration hadn't warned us earlier about hacking during the presidential election and didn't do much to thwart ongoing attacks and prevent future attacks when they were warned back in 2014. 
In economics, an externality is the cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit.[1] Economists often urge governments to adopt policies that "internalize" an externality, so that costs and benefits will affect mainly parties who choose to incur them.[2]


# Negative externalities and examples 

A negative externality (also called "external cost" or "external diseconomy") is an economic activity that imposes a negative effect on an unrelated third party.

Examples: 

+ Pollution (including sound pollution) and their effects on the environment and health, 

+ causing systematic risk to the economy, 

+ over-fishing and over-hunting that endangers the wild population for recovering (Tragedy of the commons), 

+ causing antibiotic resistance, 

+ second-hand smoking and its health effects. 

# Positive externalities and examples

Positive externalities: is the positive effect an activity imposes on an unrelated third party.

Examples: 

+ building infrastructure and other public projects, 

+ providing internet access to rural areas, 

+ vaccination that collectively offers hard immunity to the general public by decreasing the risk of other people from becoming sick for communicable diseases. 

+ providing affordable housing and education

+ recycling 

+ investigative journalism (sounds weird, but I hope you understand)

+ measures that decrease pollution 

+ academic research and discoveries that private sectors can make use of

+ protecting environment



I know Trump and Chavez are on opposite ends of the political spectrum, but temperamentally, they remind me of one another. The populism, the bombast, demagoguery, attacks on the media and establishment institutions, inflammatory rhetoric that incited polarization. I'm not trying to compare their policies, but their manner.https://youtu.be/87Tb_ZL8Zrk?t=114

"USA!" Chant - Trump's SOTU

For your information, **the person who walked out at the end of the clip is a member of House Representative Luis Gutierrez** after hearing the "USA" chant. Born in Chicago, Gutierrez also speaks fluent Spanish, a language he learned after he moved to Puerto Rico with his family. I think he's progressive on many issues, including the immigration, and tried but failed to broker an immigration reform with the Republicans.

Trump's state of union speech has become a propaganda piece for himself. The state of union is supposed to be a report (especially economic report) to Congress and an outline for president's future agenda, which he rallies support for -- it is not a campaign rally speech, where people chant slogans.

STATE OF THE UNION 2018: Gorsuch The Grouch Introduced

**I know the supreme court justices are supposed to stay impartial during the state of Union speech (e.g., they are not supposed applause or give a standing ovation). But Neil Gorsuch's face was as tense and serious as ever during the speech, almost angry** when Trump mentioned nomination of his justices (including Gorsuch himself), while other justices' face seem neutral and smiley and normal. 

Also, only 4 supreme court justices attended Trump's speech, which is not usual. Some justices do not attend because they think the State of the Union has become a political spectacle. Others cite "conflict of schedule".

## What happened to "You lied!"  when we need it?

I am very disappointed that no one yelled "You lied!" during Trump's speech of the Union -- because it's true! 

In case you don't remember, representative Joe Wilson yelled "You lied!" at Obama during Obama's 2009 state of Union address.

I'm looking forward to his promised series which seems a long time in the making.I was watching a clip of David's show on Youtube where he was discussing the fact that Trump wants to try and fire Mueller because he's seen by Trump as "getting too close", and was wondering what the fallout of this would be if the firing were to occur.
Would it, as it would be expected, signal the beginning of the end of Trump's presidency, and have Republicans beginning to distance themselves from him, or would they tow the party line and get fully behind Trump's action?https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/02/01/582370199/whats-the-real-story-about-the-milkmaid-and-the-smallpox-vaccine

What's The Real Story About The Milkmaid And The Smallpox Vaccine?


# A Likelier Scenario

Because there is another storyline, backed by letters, diaries and research notes that Boylston uncovered in the course of his research. It involves **a country doctor named John Fewster**, whose story unfolded in 1768, exactly the same time the young Jenner was supposedly listening to the milkmaid's speculation about her immunity. Like other medical practitioners of the time, Fewster inoculated people with smallpox virus, offering them bed, board and medical care in a large house he obtained for that purpose. They would stay until what was usually a mild case of the disease passed. He treated a group of farmers in Thornbury, not far from where the young Jenner was an apprentice. **Some of the farmers whom Fewster had deliberately exposed to smallpox were already immune to the disease. Fewster could tell because they had no reaction to inoculation. "Typically, people would get a big sore on their arm and a very mild case of smallpox. If they already had had smallpox, they wouldn't respond," says Boylston.**

**But there was something unusual about these farmers who were inoculated but didn't get the typical sore: They insisted they had never had smallpox. Then, according to a letter Fewster wrote, one farmer said, "I have had the cowpox lately to a violent degree, if that's any odds." Fewster inquired further. He found that all the farmers who were not responding to the smallpox inoculation never had smallpox but did previously have cowpox. His conclusion: They were immune to smallpox from exposure to cowpox.**

Fewster's inquiry was a sound clinical observation that today would have led to a larger study and publication of results; but that wasn't the way medicine worked in the 18th century. **"In those days, there were no medical journals," says Boylston. "Doctors communicated by having little dinner parties and drinking themselves silly." Those meetings, says Fissell, are an important part of the smallpox story. "Myths can encapsulate a beautiful story," she says. "But an important part of the smallpox story was that medical people were starting to get together to communicate in ways they hadn't before."**

One such meeting of what then were considered informal medical societies took place at an inn called The Ship, Boylston found. He also found that two men, the Ludlow brothers, were at the meeting; and Edward Jenner, though not at the meeting, was apprenticed to the Ludlow brothers in 1768. At the meeting, Fewster presented his story of the farmers who never had smallpox but did have cowpox. Boylston believes that the brothers went home and told their young apprentice of Fewster's observations.

Jenner was only 13 when he almost certainly heard of Fewster's observation. He eventually became a member of the medical society that met at The Ship, and records show he became known as "the cowpox bore" for his obsession with the topic in the members' debates. He had nearly 30 years to ponder cowpox and smallpox before testing his theory in 1796 by vaccinating young James Phipps.

"The idea that cowpox could prevent smallpox infection came from Fewster's observations in 1768," says Boylston. "There was no milkmaid."

# Who Made The Myth?

So how did the milkmaid myth get started? At the time, **the first and only mention of the milkmaid story was by Jenner's friend and first biographer, John Baron, several years after Jenner's death. According to Boylston's research, other doctors were then criticizing Jenner, questioning how he ever made the connection between cowpox and smallpox immunity. Jenner himself never explained how he developed the theory that led to his 1796 experiment. "After Jenner died, his biographer was trying to protect Jenner's reputation," says Boylston. John Baron probably made up the milkmaid story as a way to show how Jenner had come across the idea of a cowpox/smallpox connection, Boylston says.**So, I posted here a few weeks ago about having a problem cancelling my subscription to TDPS and after months of fighting and thinking it was cancelled, I got a renewal fee. David responded on the post and told me to email him, which I did, but I never got a response. I emailed again, and again, messaged here on Reddit, and no response. I don't know what to do, I feel I am being ignored on purpose at this point.It is a statement of the fact After her interview with Fallon, it's clear that she has an NDA contract. Why not break that contract? What's Trump going to do? If he sues her for breach of contract then it's an obvious admission of guilt. He cannot sue her without exposing himself.What do you think this will mean for upcoming elections...? Is this normal?

[US &amp; Russian Planes Have Terrifying Encounter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXZBoahHhmg)

I agree with Kyle that this should be on the media more.

Now, when I ask "Why isn't David talking about this?" I realize that time is finite and David has to prioritize. But it seems to me that this should have higher priority than about half of the stuff David puts on his show. He talks about. Examples:

[Caller Demands David's List of Political Positions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNl31q4GwXI)

[Hatriot Mail: Hand Over the Jew Gold, David!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrenBpVz99Y)

[Net Neutrality is Bad Because the Internet Is Bad?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv6tk27yFFg)

To be clear: I don't agree with Kyle that this says anything about existence of collusion. But he's absolutely right to ask: why are our planes in Russia's border?Thinking of how we could improve the country I think we can make a great influence through taxation.

1: Tax reductions are only valid for one fiscal year and need to be re voted on annually. This helps us recover more easily from insane tax plans. Every year if the tax code will default back to the first tax code pre tax cut.

2: Political Tax. The first $5,000 dollars donated to a political party by a single person are tax deductible. After $5,000 per person the taxes kick in. For every additional dollar a person wants to donate to a politician they must be prepared to pay 20 dollars in taxes to the Clean Elections Fund. Corporations must be prepared to pay 100 dollars for every dollar they spend on political donations. 

Tax Rate: The bottom rate for all citizens is 30% of their annual income. The top rate is 99% of all income or profit after $250,000

Deficit Rule: The government can only see a 1% decrease in taxes each year. If there is a deficit in a year automatic tax raises go into effect. 50% of the remaining deficit will be payed by the top 30% income earners

Free filing taxes: The IRS agrees to free file everyone's taxes. Everything connected to him is complete bullshit.  Someone asked me if I was going to watch the state of the union address... I replied with "why"?  I already knew the speech would be filled with exaggeration and lies and the press would fall over themselves discussing his "presidentialness"  because he simply reads from a teleprompter (sorry David, I think he can read).

Take this "Nunes Memo" that is dominating the press right now.  A Republican, who was on Trump's transition team, writes a memo accusing the FBI of being unfair to Trump, and that supposedly exonerates Trump of everything?  The facts of what actually did or didn't happen don't matter to these people.  Even if everything in the memo was not exaggerated... what does it matter?  Just because information comes from a source funded by Democrats (but also funded by Republicans as well), that eliminates its veracity and importance?  What fucking retarded logic is that?

Politics has always had eliminates of ridiculousness, but Trump has taken it so far over the top right now I simply can't take it right now.So me and my dad got into a debate last night about the Nunes Memo. I took the position that the memo doesn’t clear Trump of potential wrong doing and that the FBI is just doing its job. He took the position that the FBI is corrupted and members of the Bureau are going after Trump for politically motivated reasons.

He focused his argument on McCabe’s resignation, the Strzok-Page text messages, and the Steele Dossier’s validity. I argued that FBI isn’t biased because of it’s investigation into Clinton’s emails, the Nunes Memo lack of examples of conspiracy against Trump, and reasoning that even if the Steele dossier was the only piece of evidence used to get the FISA warrant, the FBI need to corroborate the information in the dossier.

He’s response was to again point to the FBI as corrupt, this point that there was a couple, the husband who worked in the FBI and the wife who worked for Fusion GPS, who fabricated the dossier for political reasons and then got buzzfeed to verify it, he brought up the Russians calling Carter Page an idiot, and the Clinton campaign paid for dossier and colluded with the Russian through Steele. The only real response that I had to this was that the FBI would have to verify their sources and wouldn’t let a politically motivated dossier be the only proof unless there was evidence to back it up. But he was dismissive of these claims.

It’s very clear to me that my dad is only relying on GOP and Fox News talking points and I’m curious if there is any good debunking of the claims that he made throughout the debate? I’ll admit that I haven’t been following this issues that closely, but it’s clear, from what I’ve read, that there’s something there when it comes to the FISA warrant. I’m just looking for better rebuttals based in fact than just based on thought experiments.I argue with people on multiple platforms and on some disqus thread the issue of the devastation of immigration on wages in both construction and certain IT fields that this guy was in came up.  The guy resented that companies  could so easily push pay down due to an influx of labor via the illegal immigrant route with construction and the legal side with the abuses of companies importing cheaper tech workers to the US.


I thought this was hopelessly reductionist as it focused on some of the worst abuses and sectors and completely ignored any of the gains, but I don't have the numbers at hand to assure people with those thoughts that we would not be better off by shutting off the flow.

Are there more effective strategies to combat wage depression than just cutting immigration?  Or do they have a point that we need to deal with?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcwJt4bcnXs

keywords: subsidy, tax break, sweetheart deal, corruption, government debt, The volume dynamics on David’s microphone needs adjustment. The quieter words and moments gets lost due to what I’m guessing is an expander or a soft knee gate. If an expander is in use, I would recommend removing it completely, if a gate is in use please adjust the threshold. I’d even go as far as to recommend a compressor be used if room noise isn’t an issue. If there is no expander or gate, whatever it is it’s having the same effect and is causing quieter moments to be “swallowed” and become even quieter. Pat’s mic doesn’t seem to be having the same issue.I can't believe I haven't thought of this before considering I've read all of Sam Harris's books, but as we all know, the higher church attendance is, the more conservative an electorate is, on average. Of corse there's progressive-liberals who attend church every Sunday, and vice versa, but on average the more one attends church, the more conservative some are. 

Anyway, my religious family and friends have been debating abortion a lot this week, and I was wondering what does it take for me to change their mind? Can I find a creationist 'biologist' that is pro choice that can appeal to them? I'm having a hard time finding one.

What is some good literature to read up on abortion? Any good suggestions? DO ASMR IN YOUR UNDERSHIRT INSTEAD. The Nunes memo is one of the greatest political self-owns of my lifetime. It's sparked the hilarious #YoMemoJokes. So, I thought it'd be fun to share the funniest ones we've all seen or come up with.

GOP Rep. to Obama: 'You Lie!'

http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/09/09/joe.wilson/

On September 9, 2009, Wilson shouted at President Barack Obama while Obama addressed a joint session of Congress to outline his proposal for reforming health care.[33] During his address, Obama said: "There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false – the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally."[34] In a breach of decorum,[35] Wilson pointed at Obama and shouted, "You lie!" (twice? I'm not sure)

For the record, Joe Wilson was wrong that the proposed healthcare bill (later became Obamacare) would provide healthcare insurance to illegal immigrants. In short, **Wilson lied that Obama lied when Obama was trying to correct a lie. (talk about the irony)** 

&gt; Obama was correct when he said his plan wouldn’t insure illegal immigrants; the House bill expressly forbids giving subsidies to those who are in the country illegally. Conservative critics complain that the bill lacks an enforcement mechanism, but that hardly makes the president a liar.

We fact-check the president's address to Congress and the nation.

**It's rather sad to see that no one yelled "you lie" at Donald Trump, as Donald Trump spewed out countless lies during the State of Union address. Someone should have yelled it at him because it was true!** -- even though it was a breach of decorum. On the other hand, since when Donald Trump respects decorum? He interrupts his opponents on the debate stage all the time with impunity. ## **it's not that the public is incapable of thought it's that the kind of material that's being shoveled in our direction is designed to bypass thought**

Freud's Nephew and the Origins of Public Relations

http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/08/16/specials/bernays-obit.html

Edward Bernays, 'Father of Public Relations' And Leader in Opinion Making, Dies at 103

# his ideas are highly undemocratic and controlling

"**The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.** This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...**In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.**”

― Edward L. Bernays, Propaganda

# Unknown to most people and yet highly influential (and successful I would say)

Bernays was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century by Life magazine.[3] 

His best-known campaigns include a 1929 effort to...

+ promote female smoking by branding cigarettes as feminist "Torches of Freedom" and

+ his work for the United Fruit Company connected with the overthrow of the Guatemalan government in 1954. 

+ He worked for dozens of major American corporations including Procter &amp; Gamble and General Electric, and for government agencies, politicians, and non-profit organizations.

# father of public relations 

**Of his many books, Crystallizing Public Opinion (1923) and Propaganda (1928) gained special attention as early efforts to define and theorize the field of public relations.** Citing works of writers such as Gustave Le Bon, Wilfred Trotter, Walter Lippmann, and his own double uncle Sigmund Freud, **he described the masses as irrational and subject to herd instinct—and outlined how skilled practitioners could use crowd psychology and psychoanalysis to control them in desirable ways.**
______________

# Personal comments: 

If you're wondering why advertising, public relations and political advertising constantly try to appeal our emotions rather than rational thoughts and have become so manipulative. Well, you can thank Edward Bernays for that. 




# some of his works (other than ones mentioned above) 

+ The Engineering of Consent

+ The Marketing of National Policies: A Study of War Propaganda

+ Public Relations (1945)

+ Future of Private Enterprise in the Post-War World (1942)

this story of Sigmund Freud begins at  the Florida Avenue Grill in Washington, DC. now it might seem a little strange to start a story about the father of psychoanalysis. in a soul food restaurant but it turns out that if you look closely there's a trace of for its influence even here eggs cheese and eggs bacon and eggs the all-american
breakfast is the most popular dish at the grill according to waitress catherine Leach no other meal even comes close well 60 percent I will say making amazed but bacon and eggs wasn't always America's first choice for breakfast the idea that this was the best way to start your day like so many other things in American life was actually systematically engineered by a public relations agent in this case a public relations agent who was greatly influenced by and intimately connected to Sigmund Freud his nephew Edward Bernays Bernays grew
 up in America but spent each summer walking the hills of Austria with his famous uncle and during those outings he absorbed many lessons about the inner workings of human psychology including says Stuart Yuen history professor at Hunter College the conviction that one of Western civilization's most basic assumptions about human nature was deeply flawed up until the early 1900s one of the sort of fundamental assumptions was this kind of Enlightenment idea that people are rational beings and that if you present a well-orchestrated case you can persuade people that's the basic logic of the Declaration of Independence Freud however had a different vision of the human animal he believed that people weren't rational at all despite their apparently civilized exterior underneath it is this sort of turmoil of instincts and of unconscious desires and those kinds of things although repressed still exert an enormous power over the way people act sex aggression security self-preservation when Freud looked out at the world he saw these drives motivating even the most ordinary activity a concept says an Bernays daughter of Edward grand Nisa Freud her father quickly absorbed he ingested it early and just used it that is if you want to make somebody do what you want them to you don't hook into what they say they want you try to find out what they really want which brings us back to breakfast to the mid 1920s when as a young publicist Bernays was asked by the Beechnut packing company to improve sales of its primary product bacon author Larry Tye has written a book on Bernays called the father of spin he was basically hired by them to help restore sales that had sagged in a country that was on the run and was trimming its morning meal to juice toast and coffee now the average PR guy back then would have told them Oh put your bacon on sale and that's the way to sell more of it or go out and advertise take out expensive ads and newspapers but Bernays clearly wasn't your average PR guy taking his cue from freud Bernays constructed a campaign intended to speak to a value much more basic than thrift physical security food is about more than something just to nourish you it's something to create a sense of well-being about what you're putting into your body to connect bacon and wellbeing bearnays distributed a survey to doctors he asked one simple question do you support a hearty breakfast or a light one the doctors responded that hearty was best so Bernays came up with his own definition of hearty bacon and eggs with a weight of medical authority behind him he then initiated an educational campaign and the all-american breakfast was born before Eddie Bernays we never thought of bacon and eggs as the all-american breakfast so he was not just redefining a particular product he was redefining the whole way America thought about the way they ate breakfast in a way that persists today of course Freud's insight into unconscious motivations had a profound impact in a variety of intellectual arenas in mental health generations of Americans became archeologists of the mind the concept also influenced economic thought and countless graduate students in English with thesis material but the way this idea transformed public relations is a lesson in unintended consequences prior to Freud and his nephew publicity was all about emulating journalism but after Freud and Bearnaise the goal shifted from rational appeals to the stimulation of visceral impulse Bernays wrote extensively about precisely how to apply for its complex theories and his techniques were broadly adopted used to sell everything from soap to presidents cigarettes to foreign policy and possibly even genocide a reporter from UPI once came back after a visit with Adolf Hitler's PR chief joseph gurbles and told Eddie Bernays that in gurbles library where they were doing the interview one or two of Eddie Bernays books were on those shelves and it was clear that propaganda people for better or for worse used his theories and his ideas all around the world although Freud and Bearnaise correspondent regularly until Freud's death in 1939 apparently Freud never had a very clear understanding of how his ideas were being applied and often recoiled with his nephew proposed to some new plan to popularize his work Eddie Bernays was perpetually suggesting to Sigmund Freud in these letters ways of commercializing his complex psychodynamic theories he offered at one point to help Sigmund Freud make a whole lot of money if he could sort of put him into quick Diddy's that housewives and that busy people could sort of remember these take-home messages Freud quickly declined Bernice's offer his biographer larry tai freud saw this as consummately american and just vulgar and that's probably the way he would have seen if he had understood all the real ramifications of public relations and the way the career developed I think Freud would have been shocked and outraged by a lot of what happened but he also would have thought that was America and that was his nephew although Bernays was tremendously proud of his work in time he too found himself disturbed by how his ideas and techniques were employed by people with whom he disagreed and Bern he thought it was going to be used well this kind of manipulative power he thought or hoped that it was going to be
used only for the good of everybody which i think is unrealistic today focus groups and opinion polls are used
throughout the world to mine the subterranean desires of the consumer marketers use MRI machines to peer
inside the brain there are instruments that track eye movements pulse skin temperature all in an effort to better
understand emotional response and despite the fact that we live in the so-called Information Age much of the material that bombards us that tells us what to eat who to vote for what to wear how to feel about war is not says professor Yuen intended to appeal to our minds it's not that the public is incapable of thought it's that the kind of material that's being shoveled in our direction is designed to bypass thought and for that we can thank at least in part Sigmund Freud for NPR news I'm Elise Spiegel in Washington. "Taxes" I feel are an antiquated term. In reality, every year on April 15th, we all pay $$ for public investments in healthcare, social security, scientific research, public health, public housing, roads, environmental protection etc. 

Once we call taxes what they really are, i.e. public investments, I think it can encourage people to want to invest more not less in our common future as Americans. 

It also makes it clear which public investments are complete scams, like how we apparently are investing public money in oil companies and wealthy corporations that are already flush w/ cash, while we can't afford medicare for all. 

Thoughts? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D_UvZb30jQ

he agrees that white people shouldn't say the n word then literally right after acts like him saying faggot is no big deal, and using gay as an insult and casually calling people fags is ok. so tone deaf and clownish. fuck himOf all the issues that polarized voters for the past decade or so before Trump, I can't think of a single one that would take precedent in my mind over even our *single most recent issue* of maintaining the historic sanctity of the justice department. Let alone the many other things that are being fiercely faught for or have already gradually become the norm, somewhat subtlely un-neutralizing traditional American political pillars into tools to be partisanly abused, as if they have no concern for the precident it sets for the future when the pendulum swings back and the democrats are in place with a great excuse to do the same thing. I guess that's what it comes down to: all these radical new precidents are being set in a way that it's like the benefactors have no mind for fair and equal rules. Like they don't plan around what would happen if they lose their majority, or maybe are even banking on the fact that the left could take the principled high ground and not act the same shitty way. But if they do, like we saw with the shutdown, the right will have absolutely no qualms berating them incessantly for *taking advantage of the precedent they argued for and set*. 

An example would be how trumpists are screaming about bias from anti-trump investigators and that they need to be removed, yet they certainly would not be happy if that rule was applied across the board and resulted in a purge of all trump supporters as well-- even though that would make *more* sense considering a "loyal" criminal mole feeding confidential information to the suspect is infinitely more damaging than a... i guess a "biased" investigator who wants *more* justice after learning how shitty the suspect is?

Do you see what I'm saying? Am I off base here? I'd concede all my comparitively petty views on social issues if I knew my vote would secure a return to a stable and hopefully less suicidially aggressive political atmosphere. One that would allow my social ideas a chance to be meaningfully represented in the first place, regardless of majority party. If a presidential candidate based his run around the idea of renewing respect for our system and respect for fair debate, he'd have my vote immediately. And he'd have the easiest campaign in the world, considering all the hateful and aggressive bile he could reflect into proving just how ridiculous it has gotten. 

Too bad we're still far too many years away from even the chance.

I too,think pence will be far worse and learning from Trump what not to do,,all his sinister deeds will be hidden from view. Thanks David and company,, keep up the good work.update: 

sorry, I was partially wrong. Yes, there was a big drop in the beginning. But stock market in the US hasn't crashed and burned like yesterday or last Friday. It's just flat lining. But the overall trend since Jan. 26, 2018 is down regardless of the indexes. 

And it's been known for a while that the stocks are overvalued for some years. How do we know that? Using Shiller PE Ratio (Cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio). the higher the ratio, the more likely the stock market is overvalued, and more likely the stocks are going to go down. I'm using SP 500 as an example: http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/ The medium ratio is 16, it's currently at 30-ish.

In finance, a futures contract (more colloquially, futures) is a standardized forward contract, a legal agreement to buy or sell something at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. 
Looks like there is a plunge happening. Where do you think this is going, David?

I am posting here because I know David talks a lot about economics and he is one of the few people I am aware of with a degree in the field. Does he just google up their username, lolI've been watching The David Pakman Show a lot since the 2016 election, and it's clear that David cares deeply for the idea of critical thinking. I enjoy his analysis of the facts at hand and his assessment of situations in clear, calm, and rational statements.

I've been having an extended conversation with a friend of mine at work. He got me to check out some past Ben Shapiro videos, conversations, and interviews. Now, let me state first of all that I don't agree with a lot of what Ben has to say. I know he's no longer with *Breitbart*, but he used to be, so I have to take that into account. However, that being said, I have to say that while I disagree with him on a lot of issues, I admire his ability to have a intelligent dialogue when people will afford him the opportunity to express his viewpoints without interrupting him and letting him finish his statements before they make their rebuttals. As a prime example, I would encourage everyone to check out a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbTwoLah2VY) he did with a transgender woman named Blaire White. It's civil, it's rational, there's a give-and-take on both sides, and no one gets offended and loses their temper. 

I think my main objection with Ben Shapiro is that he does seem to adopt this "factual/moral highground" persona that makes him appear cold and callous to people who are clearly much more passionate on the subject being discussed. One might say he's just being objective and doesn't let emotion cloud his judgement, and that's a fair point. I just think he could adjust his approach a little bit to appear a little more friendly/empathetic to the people he speaks to.

I wanted to get people's opinions and thoughts on Ben Shapiro and people like him who while you may disagree with their stance on the issues, perhaps you can concede that they can at least have a debate/civil discourse with others without it devolving into a shit-fight. I would like people to consider that while many facts may be uncomfortable and even inconvenient to talk about, that facts are facts regardless of your feelings toward them.

What are people's thoughts on these ideas/concepts? I'm really quite curious.http://www.businessinsider.com/house-passing-shutdown-bill-senate-2018-2

I know I'm largely preaching to the choir here, but this is just so aggravating. I'm ready to start taking bets on if/when this government is going to pass a damn 2018 budget instead of more stop-gaps/CRs or whatever they're calling it this time, this one unlikely to pass the Senate. Also Trump pretty much called for a government shutdown over immigration today.

Let's review the immigration issue in terms of public opinion: https://www.npr.org/2018/02/06/583402634/npr-poll-2-in-3-support-legal-status-for-dreamers-majority-oppose-building-a-wal.

If that's not enough, we can also use Trump's logic on not implementing widely supported Russian sanctions that the mere threat is acting as a deterrent (my ass!). http://abcnews.go.com/US/immigration-arrests-spiked-illegal-border-crossings-dropped-2017/story?id=51599510. Since Trump being in office is actually acting as a deterrent to illegal immigration based on 2017 data, why do we even need a wall? It's not a popular idea, and even John Kelly knows it's not feasible. It's time to make like Elsa and let it go.title correction [sorry for the sloppiness]:

FBI Investigating Possible Leaks To Rudy Giuliani About Hillary Clinton Email Investigation


FBI Director James Comey told senators Wednesday that the agency is looking into whether employees leaked information about the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails to members of Donald Trump’s team, including Rudy Giuliani. 

Shortly before the election, Comey announced that he was reopening the probe into Clinton’s private server after more emails were found on the computer of former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), who was married to a top Clinton aide. 

A few days later, Giuliani went on Fox News and bragged that he knew in advance about the new emails. 

“Did I hear about it? You’re darn right I heard about it,” said Giuliani, a prominent Trump surrogate and former New York City mayor. He added that he had expected the news to come out weeks before.

So I got a few questions One is what is considered junk/ fake news, how inaccurate is what they reported on, why is it considered inaccurate/ fake? 
What is considered right wing?
Some of what they consider fake/junk seems a little off like Pastebin an open site people tend to use to list things.

Also, this seems to be a weird catch-all just to label anything junk (This is one of the criteria for being labeled junk) Counterfeit: These outlets mimic professional news media. They counterfeit fonts, branding and stylistic content strategies. Commentary and junk content is stylistically disguised as news, with references to news agencies, and credible sources, and headlines written in a news tone, with bylines, date, time and location stamps.

I'm just curious if there might be any possible bias.

Also, it weirdly confirms the right's biases against the mainstream media.

Oh, by the way, 

## another thing that frustrated me and irritated me is that political commentators, pundits and Trump's political opponents keep underestimating Trump's chance to win the presidency. 

1) Before he ran for president, he asked Obama's birth certificate -- implying that Obama did not born in the US. **And political pundits believed that his candidacy was over because of this ridiculous notion. Well, it was nlasot over.**

2) **When Obama made his birth certificate available, pundits thought Trump's candidacy was over, because that's what Trump's candidacy hinged on.** It wasn't.

3) Then, **pundits thought he wouldn't run for the president.** He did. 

4) **When he ran, pundits say his campaign wouldn't last for a few months, and his campaign would implode and he would self-destruct,** his campaign lasted until the very end and he won, even though he made numerous controversial remarks and were subjected to countless controversies and scandals. 

5) **When he was competing against other Republican candidates, pundits say Trump would be crushed in debates -- he had no political experience after all.** Guess what? With his bully behavior, he beat down fellow Republicans, who seem to be fighting for number 2 seat, rather than number 1.

6) And when he became the Republican frontrunner, **pundits said he wouldn't be the frontrunner for long, he would self-destruct**. Although Trump did plenty of unimaginable things that would have ended a candidate's campaigns (or more frequently the candidate simply prematurely ends his/her campaign), he refused to quit and managed to stay as the Republican frontrunner. 

7) **Pundits said he wouldn't win the Republican nominee**, he did.

8) **When the Hollywood tape came out, pundits thought that would definitely be the end of Trump's campaign**. Even though he was under pressure, Trump refused to end his campaign and stayed on. 

9) **Pundits said he wouldn't win the presidency.** Well, guess what? He did, although barely. And Hillary and her campaign thought they had it in the bag and was preparing for a big celebration before the election was over. On the other hand, Trump thought he wouldn't win and was thinking about making a career out of Trump TV.

10) People thought Trump was never serious about wanting to be the president; **he was not a serious candidate. Maybe, maybe not, but that's an irrelevant question. The fact that he had a realistic chance to win should be concerning.** He certainly didn't concede the presidency to others when he won (and no one should expect him to concede).

11) and **even after Trump won, the pundits expected him to moderate his policies**, based on the fact that every previous president had done so. However, they  by then should have realized that Trump is a very different person. Or am I just a cynic? I mean, you have a piece of shit that won the presidency after starting his campaign with "Mexicans are Rapists", but he mentioned jobs enough times so he is the goddamned president. This piece of shit just wants a seat on the senate! He is relatively restraint. 

Voters are going to say "Well, you know, I don't like what he said about the Jews but he said jobs so he has my vote."

Or, "Can you believe the PC outrage over Arthur Jones!? He says that he wants tro bring back Jobs, and all people can hear is that he denies the holocaust. Fucking SJWs!"

I mean, let's be honest people, the racist sexual assaulter won, and the pedophile he endorsed lost by a small margin. This Nazi has a chance. 
https://www.politico.com/amp/story/2018/02/08/government-shutdown-dumbest-ever-400988?__twitter_impression=trueI saw on The Last Leg (UK comedy show) a suggestion that Melania is trolling Trump. She apparently favourited a Tweet saying "the only wall Trump has managed to build is the one between him and Melania", chose online bullying as her adopted charity/cause and as of last Friday out of 5 people she follows on Twitter one of them is Barack Obama.

With things like the hand slap last year and how sad she normally looks when out with Trump (thinking about the inaugeration and State of the Union in particular). Could it be true that Melania is actively undermining Trump in subtle ways?Does anyone understand the link between Trump's tax bill, inflation and the global stock crash over the last week?

I've seen some stories to say Trump's tax bill will cause inflation and that is what is scaring investors into dumping stocks. I don't fully understand how stock markets work though, so I'm not sure if this is correct. Shouldn't stocks be going up as companies get more money (profits?) from the tax breaks?I was wondering about Carter Page. Here’s this guy with no obvious experience or connections in Washington, whose only merits seems to be weird Russian stuff ... how did he get on the foreign policy team? We know that they did zero vetting of candidates, for anything, and if they had, the FBI investigation would have kept him out of it. Well, probably. But how did he get through the door for a job interview in the first place? Who thought ”I know this really sharp guy, let’s give him a call, his name is Page, Carter Page”? Who thought that would be a good idea?
And then I thought, that goes for Papadopoulos too, right? And kinda Manafort. Flynn... Half the secretaries...
Now I’m wondering: how did *anyone* get on the Trump team? Especially the transition team. I’ve read that it was ” chaotic” or ”disorganized”, but how did it actually work?A few months ago David described on the show how he eats a burger upside down.

So, here's an idea: At 2300 Patreon supporters, David will eat a burger like this on the show.

It can (and actually should) be a vegan burger.

It's silly, but not much sillier than the crazy hair and the Jenga.The Democrats achieved exactly what they hoped to achieve with this deal which is happy donors. They work for their donors,  not Dreamers. Today's Democrats are Republicans. Today's Republicans are anti American criminals. https://www.cnbc.com/2014/12/15/the-pros-and-cons-of-donor-advised-funds.html

The pros and cons of donor-advised funds

https://www.nptrust.org/what-is-a-donor-advised-fund

What is a Donor-Advised Fund (DAF)?

**One of the hottest methods for giving right now is through donor-advised funds, funds that donors create by depositing cash, appreciated securities or other assets, and then distributing the money to charities over time.** Contributions to donor-advised funds grew 23.5 percent, or $17.3 billion, in 2013, bringing their assets to $53.7 billion, according to the National Philanthropic Trust. That growth handily outpaced all other giving vehicles, like private foundations and charitable trusts, as well as the 4.4 percent growth in overall giving. Contributions to donor-advised funds now represent 7 percent of all individual charitable donations.

# Immediate and hefty Tax deduction without no immediate plan to make charitable contributions [red flag!]

**One reason for their appeal: Individuals can take an immediate tax deduction against the full amount they contribute to a donor-advised fund, but there are no rules or regulations about how quickly the money actually has to be distributed.** "Why wouldn't a donor like donor-advised funds? They're the best thing in the world for donors," said Ray D. Madoff, a professor at Boston College Law School and an expert on trusts and estates.

But the rapid growth in contributions to donor-advised funds has not been matched by grants to charities from those funds. At $9.66 billion, grants increased 12.6 percent — hardly shabby, but only slightly more than half the growth rate of the contributions coming into donor-advised funds.

Kim Laughton, president of Schwab Charitable, said the ease of donating non-cash assets encourages people to give more generously to charity than they might otherwise because they get the benefit of a hefty tax deduction without a lot of hassle.

# lax regulation

Current U.S. tax law allows the donor of appreciated securities or other assets to get a tax deduction for the market value of the donation and avoid capital gains taxes. This double tax advantage can make donating appreciated assets to a charitable organization more attractive than selling the assets and donating cash. By donating appreciated assets to a donor-advised fund and then advising the fund to make donations to several charities, one can reap these tax advantages without the hassle and paperwork of transferring non-cash assets to several organizations. This combination of convenience and full tax advantage is one reason that donor-advised funds are used.

While private foundations in the United States are heavily regulated by the Internal Revenue Service, including rules on oversight and minimum annual payouts, donor-advised funds housed in public charities are not subject to the same tax restrictions.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor-advised_fund#Regulation

# Hidden fees of Donor-advised funds
**Critics charge that companies offering these funds also manage to profit from them, in the form of fees assessed on the donor-advised fund accounts.** Fidelity charges donors 0.6 percent of the first $500,000 in a donor-advised fund account, for example, and donors with assets invested in mutual funds also pay the fees associated with those funds. 

In virtually all the donor-advised funds, though, it is hard for investors to get information on all the fees involved, said Madoff.

**"Just as there are hidden fees in the 401(k) world, there are all these hidden fees here too," she said, so by the time a donor distributes money to a charity from a donor-advised fund, some assets inevitably will have been chipped away by all those fees. Donors giving directly to a charitable foundation would not face that erosion.**

**The biggest criticism of donor-advised funds, though, is that they serve as financial holding pens for the assets of people who want to grab a tax deduction but have no immediate plans for any actual charitable giving.** The overall distribution rate from donor-advised funds in 2013 was 21.5 percent, down from a high of 24.7 percent in 2010. That's well above the 5 percent distribution required of foundations, but assets in foundations increased just 5.7 percent, compared with 19.8 percent for donor-advised funds.

# Charitable donations in general 

**Individuals (mostly from wealthy individuals) donate far more money than corporations (81% vs. 5%)**

http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/almanac/statistics/

**Democrats are more likely than Independents, who are more likely than Republicans to make donations. Republicans are more likely to give large donations than Democrats. (Maybe there are more wealthy Republicans than wealthy Democrats. It is also interesting considering that Republican candidates emphasize charitable donations over government interventions in solving social problems.)**

# trends of targeted giving 

Causes that increase:

Education, art. healthcare

Causes that declines:

soup kitchen, homeless, international causes, religion, 
Something I've been curious about. When Donald Trump is found to be compromised by the Russians (and others?), how much doubt will that cast on the legislation and executive orders he has signed?

Robert Reich: What Should Be the Purpose of Corporations?

Private equity firms (corporate raiders) --&gt; Shareholders --&gt; board of directors --&gt; executives 


Publicly traded companies are expected to beat stock analysts' expectation of quarterly returns. Corporate CEOs needs the approval of the Board of Directors, who have the responsibility for maximizing shareholder profits and boost share prices. The shareholders will sell off their shares to others if the profit margins do not beat Wall Street expectations. Private equity firms may even take over publicly traded companies by buying enough shares from current shareholders to change the management of the company in order to make companies more profitable ("hostile takeover"). Thus, when private equity firms sell off the company to others, they can make handsome profits.David, 

I previously suggested a contest for a free hoodie involving people who purchased new annual memberships, and people who would be elligible would be those who signed up for a yearly membership, incluing existing monthly subscribers who signed up for a yearly membership, during the month of January, and got no response. 

So I'll ask this:

When will we see contests return to the David Pakman show? I know it seems petty but many of us (obviously myself included) like contests and it incentivizes many people to join who might need that extra push and incentive. 

I am the type of person who always calls in to win stuff at our local radio station and I also call in to win things on XM radio. 

The Art contests were some of the greatest contests and I really wish there were more contests on your show to spice it up. Like a spicy enchilada, or a spicy burrito. 

Or a spicy curry. 

You could include a hoodie and a bumper sticker and a call it a prize-pak. I'm only tagging you in this because I didn't get a response from my last question about a contest, and I apologize if I'm bugging you. 

&lt;3 Your biggest trumpet playing fan, 

Brody There have been many posts, viewer questions etc on whether Trump Presidency will open gates for really racist predisents or will it normalise nonsense and crackdown on press. 

However, there is another thing that Trump Presidency has shown (till now) - that you could be a complete idiot and still get to be the POTUS. The country has not actually fallen apart overnight because of Trump (I know the regulations are slowly taking the country int dark ages but it is not an overnight apocalypse). So the country still seems to be just running along on some cruise control despite the Dump-in-chief and a complete dysfunctional administration.

So, will this then lower the perceived requirements for becoming POTUS? Will this cause more uneducated and inept candidates to run because this is now more of a "who gets more likes on Instagram" than "who can pass better regulation" contest?

I know a lot of people would say that hey, people do wisen up and ultimately place trust in hands of a competent person. But here's the thing - in a lot of countries around the world, people still elect reps on the basis of PR. Most of the people have vague reasons for selecting a candidate as their choice and many times it does not have anything to do with their legislative capabilities but their stand on XYZ or something else that appealed to them. Considering that a lot of people don't trust education and colleges, is it too unlikely to assume that they wouldn't trust the products of those either? That they would much rather support uneducated pseudo know it alls instead of people who actually know something? Elections in a lot of countries around the world are just PR, mud throwing and snarky comments (jus like Trump's). And they have been for decades. Could US have more of such idiotic candidates in the future?

(PS - I know that there is a chance that people will get awakened and activated and instead try and elect competent candidates with a gusto and I do understand it is an inflexion point, however, I merely want to know whether this is one of the possible routes for US after the inflexion point?)https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/government-employees-conservative-media-236321

Two [Republican] senators opposed to the Gang of Eight immigration bill are telling only half the story with their claims that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned the bill would be bad for wages and unemployment. That may be true over the next decade, but the CBO’s conclusion was just the opposite for the long term. Moreover, the CBO said it is not clear whether the bill would negatively impact most current American workers even in the short term.

The Republican Establishment’s Overthrow Project
I'm not sure where they get this idea, I've said multiple times that I'd vote for Bernie given the opportunity. I'm about as far left as most young liberals are these days. Does anyone else ever hear this from people on the right?Why, even before 2014, Russia seems to talk like it is on different "team" than some other countries, but, for example, Ukraine or Romania does not seem to think so. Russia seems to care so much about fairness between these arbitrary teams, but Ukraine or Romania do not: Russia calls it in-effect / basically "unfair" that troops from nato countries come closer to Russia borders but Romania and Ukraine do not care that those troops come closer to their borders. Somehow Canada does not care how much US troops are on it's border, but for some reason Russia seems to care so damn much, even before 2014. Also, Poland does not care how much Ukrainian troops are on it's border.

There was a treaty between Russia and nato about troop locations, but why Russia wanted that so much? That treaty got null and void after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014.

Who decided or who's analysis it was that Russia was on different "team" than, for example, Holland, Canada and Romania?

Likely explanation is that Putin wants to perpetuate and keep alive this idea of different teams for internal political reasons, so that he can lie that his political competitors are working for the other team.

Maybe also corruption from weapons manufacturers, from Russian military-industrial complex, if one exists? We know that suits US military-industrial complex.

The military-industrial complex corruption potential depends among other things on percentages of civilian products. For example, Boeing does airliners and space rockets too. What is this situation in Russia? Or in France or Britain?

Relating to this show, David could ask some of these things from a guest.
When many people talk about the problems of our society(the society of the United States) they mention things like money in politics, wealth inequality, poor education, decaying infrastructure, impending environmental collapse, etc. etc and on and on.

And these are certainly serious problems that need to be discussed and addressed; but are these causes of our problems or are these just symptoms?

There is always a deeper answer; a more root cause. Even that root cause itself probably has an even deeper answer and a more root cause.

For example, consider "**money in politics**". Many people consider this problem in and of itself the root cause of all of our other problems. But let's take it one step deeper: what about our society allows money to corrupt our political system? Is there some value that we hold or some idea that we have that prevents us from electing leaders who are honest and will pass laws in the interests of society. Is there some reason we can't have these honest leaders instead of the corrupt politicians who are bought and paid for by the interests of a few wealthy people.

Or as another example, take Russia. If you ask me what is the cause of all of Russia's many problems(much worse than the United States obviously), on first thought, I would say it is Vladimir Putin. In an instant he could have free and open elections - he could stop fighting with the West. He could stop persecuting Russians who want Democracy. He could even join NATO eventually. If he is a "benign" dictator then why doesn't he just do these things? The answer I feel lies somewhere in the fear of his own people. Even dictators depend on the complicity of their subjects. Putin is afraid of the people he "rules" over and in turn they are afraid of the West. They worry that the culture of the West will erode their own culture. Putin's grip on power in Russia is just a symptom of that fear and there is no such thing as a "benign" dictator because the first thing a truly "benign" dictator would do is give up their power.

So if you give me some more time to think about it, I would say that the cause of Russia's problems is fear. Or more specifically, unreasonable fear. 

Or in the words of a great person: "the only thing we have to fear is...fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."

I don't want to cloud your responses with my own opinions on this subject but, my point is, that we should always be willing to look for a deeper answer; a better understanding of our universe and our own human condition.

In that spirit, I would like to ask you if you think that there is a more root cause for all of our problems in American society. Or if you want to talk about your country of origin instead, feel free to do so.

If you **really** feel comfortable talking about it: have you experienced something that has made you recognize some kind of unnamed fear in your/our society?I've been watching parts of the winter olympics tryouts and events. I can confidently say that what NBC does that makes the Olympics almost no fun to watch.

1: Their high quality cameras make the game feel boring. They have expensive cameras which can cover the athletes without any trouble. Ironically this makes the olympic feat look boring and common place. Try watching someone ski or bob sled, they athletes look as if they are moving so slow it's not entertaining to watch.

2: NBC's coverage takes way too long. There's lots of wasted time between pundits and waiting for the athlete to perform. As an anecdote, yesterday I listened to two pundits argue about whether a jumping skier should wait 10 minutes or go now and I saw the athlete sitting on a bench for several minutes. To add insult to injury, the cameras show us things the coaches or staff are doing before the event. I'm not saying what they're doing isn't important for the athlete, I'm saying it's not important for the audience to have to watch while the studio attempts to buy time while nothing is happening. 

3: COMMERCIALS! In the age of 5-30 seconds of YouTube ads inbetween multiple videos having to suffer through, or even fast forward through minutes of commercials is infuriating. 

4: There isn't a VOD Reddit page that I can easily find. 

How would I handle the olympics. 
1: Hire better analysts and color commentators
2: Use camera techniques that make the events look more profound. Strap Go PROs to the athletes if you want, or have a skier follow the athletes if need be.

If I were NBC I would air ONLY highlights on TV. I would organize the olympics like this

https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLeventVoDs/comments/7qqswa/lck_2018/

That is a page organizing League of Legends games played in South Korea 

This is how the highlight videos should look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6c2oUwUfS8&amp;t=10s

side note, I didn't watch the opening ceremony but heard they Fed it up, just like they F3d up the opening ceremony of the London olympics

EDIT: the title should say NBC not NGC# The runaway capitalism at its early stage


After the industrial revolution, many countries have tried capitalism in its early form. The runaway capitalism heavily exploited/ignored the lower socioeconomic class. 

# experimentation: socialism vs social democracy

To solve this problem, some countries experimented with various forms of socialism/communism, which failed fantastically (sarcastically). (Ironically, although introduced to some form of capitalist economy, the countries going through the socialist route had serious social problems of inequality that were probably not caused by capitalism.) Fascism were also briefly experimented, which ended at the military defeat in WWII. At the same time, other countries with more robust democratic institutions decided to use democracy to regulate and control the adverse effects of capitalism. 

# the collapse of socialist states: a messy democratic and capitalist reforms lead to the failure of both 

After the collapse of socialist states, many of former socialist or authoritarian regimes decided to change it to democracy as the political structure and capitalism as the economic system. **Unfortunately, during that transition, political leaders in many former authoritarian regimes/dictatorship took control of the supposedly democratic institutions either politically or economically. Examples include Russia, and many former Soviet countries, and some African countries. In these countries, capitalism hijacked democratic government.** By contrast, democratic countries (e.g, Germany, Nordic countries) has successfully regulated the capitalistic economic system with a functioning democratic government. 

After the failure of democratic/capitalistic reform, many countries have switched to various forms of authoritarian regimes, such as the state-own enterprise with authoritarian regime (China and Russia), state socialism in some Latin America countries (e.g., Venezuela. In those countries, socialism did not take roots until the 21th century).

Of course, a lot of countries have gone different paths and have different economic/political history. The collapse of the soviet union and other socialist governments is due to their horrible economic and political systems. Fast forward to now, because many democratic/capitalistic reforms have failed, they are moving away from democratic/capitalistic reforms, believing that western democracy and western-style capitalism don't work. 

# Authoritarianism in the US and the wave of authoritarianism across Europe 

The rise of Donald Trump and authoritarianism can be easily explained by the fact that the supposed democratic process in the US elections have been co-opted by super-wealthy class and big corporations for a very long time. Because ordinary people have very little influence over policy, they have felt to be ignored by the electoral process, and they have been hurt economically as the result. They have known that voting for the establishment party or establishment candidates will keep on delivering the same bad results. Therefore, many voters have decided to try something new. The irony is ,of course, voting for the fake populist authoritarian candidate can only make the problem worse and produce more damaging results once the candidate is in office. 

The rise of far-right and authoritarianism across Europe (e.g., France and Germany), especially in Eastern Europe have similar causes. But the differences are in degree. The economic stagnation, wealthy inequality, wage stagnation, the decline of political power of unions is much less severe than the European counterparts. However, political discourse has shifted to right as well but to lesser extend compared to the US, and the anti-establishment sentiment is strong in many European countries. 

**US is the weakest democracy in western democratic countries. And unsurprisingly, it's the first chip to fall.** In other western countries, such as in Western and Northern Europe, the election season is short, campaign donations and political ads are heavily regulated and restricted, media companies are heavily regulated to serve the public interest and maintain impartiality, small parties are allowed to coexist with major parties, and in many countries, their voting systems are not strictly first-past-the-post systems. Thus, western and Northern European countries also have stronger democratic institutions and better regulations. 

# a responsive political system is the key to a successful society in a long run 

One important point I want to make: **regardless of the economic system, it is very important to form a responsive, responsible democratic political system. In this way, whatever the mistakes in the economic system (or political system) can be quickly corrected after the people have realized the existence of mistakes. This feedback loop between realizing the mistakes and learning mistakes in the political process is very important for the well-being of a society in the a long run.** Many governments have failed due to its lack of correct response to its mistakes. This self-correcting feedback loop obviously cannot happen in an authoritarian/dictatorial government, because they resist change no matter how wrong the decisions that they make are. 
First and foremost, I do belief Russiagate is a thing.  However, I don't think there with be direct evidence of collusion mainly because there didn't have to be.  Trump has been neck deep in Russian dirty money for years, so it only made sense they'd support him over Clinton.
Anyway, my point is why does the left have to continue to fracture itself over this? There are plenty of progressive voices out there, some focus on Russia, some focus on Trump, some focus on both.  Why do we have to constantly fight eachother of this Russia thing when the end goal is getting rid of Trump one way or the other?Personally I stopped following them during the election as their content started to get tabloidy (a lot of clickbait on sex related topics), but there seems to be a whole heap of loathing towards them which may very well be justified, but that I don't know the origin of.
I don't need an explanation as to why the anti-SJW crowd don't like them, but is there some larger reason for the general animosity I now see regarding them even in leftist circles?Here’s the link to the video below. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ndK4xP7L71Q

It is heartening to see more &amp; more people waking up to Dave Rubin’s bullshit (apart from Sam Harris that is). David Doel is a former fan of Dave Rubin but, like many of us, has caught on to Dave Rubin’s blatant right wing pandering. In this video, David calmly dismantles Rubin &amp; exposes Rubin’s fake commitment to being a free speech absolutist.

I strongly urge people to check this out and share it around social media. Let’s see how long it takes the right wing/alt-lite douchebag Rubin to complain about this &amp; smear David Doel as some sort of postmodern Marxist. Nearly every popular right-wing and “classical liberal” YouTube host I’ve listened to in the last two years is always up in arms with SJWs. I understand their concerns with free speech on college campuses and SJWs trying to force 10’s of gender pronouns on to us; but it seems like 90% of the time, this is all that’s ever discussed/talked about on their podcasts. 

There are a million other important issues they could be discussing that matter in the lives of the average individual; but they tend to keep the conversation largely around SJWs. 

Why do you believe this is?I was thinking about watching it live, but I can't seem to find any mention of an air time on David's website or social media.Today I went to see my grandmother on my mother's side. I refer to her as Nana. My Nana is in her 80s, I think she's low to mid 80s. She was a stay at home mom helping raise 4 children. My Grandpa, to be honest I don't know much about him. He didn't come visit often and whenever we visited him he was usually watching Baseball games. Based on financial discussions it doesn't look like he left her much money or any kind of pension, etc. Nana had to move out of her house several years ago and now she's run out of money due to the expenses of her retirement home. If she were left on her own right now, she would be homeless. Luckily my family can step in a little bit and help her, working out the details. I learned that not only would my Nana be homeless without our intervention but apparently Medicare isn't enough to cover her medical issues so for years she got supplemental care through a private health insurer. She can no longer afford this so my Mom is trying to see if Nana can get Medicaid to supplement her Medicare. 

As someone who loves my Nana it's painful to watch her at this stage of her life be at the mercy of loving children. If they weren't here, she would be homeless and without proper healthcare. I know fully well that this type of situation is not unique to millions of Americans, which is even more depressing. As someone who was raised Republican, if I weren't already convinced to become a Liberal today would have been a political realigning day for me. Hoping that Democratic Socialist economic policies and human policies such as 100% public housing option, single payer healthcare, and strengthened social security come through before I get her age. Just saw this "[The Rise of "Classical Liberalism" is a Scam](https://youtu.be/ZbK57cBlyzc)" video.

First off: I grew up in a place that was a religious nut hellhole and Peterson is the antithesis of that BS.

[Climate change](https://youtu.be/OD-VCRNIp-U?t=24m9s) -&gt; 25:49.

He has spoken [in favor of the Canadian healthcare system](https://youtu.be/lxHglXh99SI). I've been meaning to ask him to debate someone like Ben Shapiro on that, I suspect it would be highly entertaining.

Everyone is obsessed with his Patreon feed. He didn't get that money because of the anti-SJW stuff, he didn't get it by saying he's a classical liberal, he got that money because of his [Maps of Meaning series](https://youtu.be/I8Xc2_FtpHI) and other lecture material.

And the caller's assertion that they didn't look at what Dr. Peterson's works in his neuroscience program is an utterly vacuous statement. If you're going to criticize someone then you should at least pick up their damn work! It's not even a criticism, that of all the scientists in the world they didn't happen to look at his work? So? There are thousands of other scientists whose works they didn't look at. Are those all irrelevant people, too?

The man has over 9,000 citations, you know.. the metric we used to judge scientists (especially young earth "Christian scholars") by. And for his areas of expertise, listed, that's extremely high.

Here's a really entertaining video, if you don't believe what he's saying about: https://youtu.be/aMcjxSThD54

The problem he's fighting has been seen in its full form at [Evergreen State College](https://youtu.be/OQ8WQnsm14Y).I think he might be the best person to reveal what sort of issues US universities are having and I'd enjoy seeing him being questioned by David who doesn't seem to see it the same way.I just saw this appear on my newsfeed, and part of me finds it hilarious while the rest of me is just annoyed.

What is it with these random meaningless holidays? There's a national holiday for nearly every food in the common American diet. We even have a freaking National Deviled Egg Day! It's not limited to food, but those are the ones that I tend to remember. Anyone else feel this way?

What is the weirdest national or state holiday/recognition day you've ever heard of?Please check out this article here. It’s very interesting &amp; perfectly encapsulates my problems with him.

https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/how-dangerous-is-jordan-b-peterson-the-rightwing-professor-who-hit-a-hornets-nest

Yes, while it’s true that Peterson’s rise into fame/infamy has been meteoric &amp; granted that he makes a couple of valid points about traditional family values; I think his overall contribution to the public discourse is pretty toxic. Peterson rails against cultural Marxism, campus SJWs &amp; engages in far-right conspiracy theories that there is a secret leftist plot to bring down Western civilisation. 

Unsurprisingly, he is a climate change denier (https://mobile.twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/920415141358845952?lang=en); &amp; notoriously slippery when it comes to defining simple concepts such as ‘truth’ for basically self-serving purposes. Really Peterson is not so different than conservative Islamists (people who rail against Western culture, modernity &amp; praise faith based fundamentalism); Peterson is a danger to the very enlightenment values that Sam Harris talks about. Believe it or not, Peterson has also described Trump as a ‘liberal’ &amp; a ‘moderate’; he really is a stupid persons idea of a smart person. What do you folks think?
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5387031/amp/PIERS-MORGAN-did-Trump-hire-Rob-Porter-Omarosa.html?__twitter_impression=trueWhat do you think of this? It's clear that these two really really really really really want to run for president. 

I'm still fairly skeptical since I had bones to pick with these two (Booker for blocking drugs import, Gillibrand for Al Franken).  However, I can only hope that this is a step toward the right direction. I think I know why  Joe Rogan hasn't had Dave on his podcast, and why I don't think he ever will. 

Joe Rogan is an intelligent person, and often has very good nuggets of wisdom or life advice or perspectives on things, but he has some glaring flaws, one of which is his critical thinking skills, and his susceptibility to believing in nonsense Alex Jones type conspiracy theories. He still entertains the idea that the moon landing was faked, and he thinks Hillary Clinton is having people murdered and Seth Rich was killed by the DNC. 

David Pakman is even more intelligent, and has a lot better critical thinking skills, and is an excellent debater, so I think that Joe Rogan is well aware of David Pakman, as he's had Jimmy Dore on, Ben Shapiro, Sargon of Akkad, etc., but I think he thinks David would make him look like a fool regarding stuff like Trump/Russia or Seth Rich, so he doesn't want to have him on the show. 

Simply put, imo Joe Rogan thinks David Pakman would own him and is just scared to have him on and debate him.  Please see this twitter thread below.

https://mobile.twitter.com/joerogan/status/959872264626778112?lang=en

Kyle from secular talk is ok but Jimmy Dore is an absolute cancer of the left with his pushing of conspiracy theories, Russian denial. He’s a total buffoon &amp; in some ways the Alex Jones of the left!

David is infinitely smarter than Dore &amp; much more objective. Also, he has more YouTube subscribers than Dore. David should have got the nod here! Come on guys, let’s bug Rogan till he gets David on the show!At the present time, the majority of US governors are GOP. Out of fifty states, thirty-three of them are under a Republican. The damage done by them have been immense, pushing and passing legislation that suppressed voters, restricted abortion rights, enriched corporations and punished workers. However, depending on the state you live in, not every Democrat can be trusted. Some potential candidates are quite progressive and support a Bernie or Bernie-esque platform for their state. But others are "bluedogs", or Republicans in a blue suit. Depending on where you live, please choose wisely in who you vote for. Never forget that there's always more than two parties on your ballot in every election, so vote according to your conscience. Disrupt the status quo, but choose wisely. Take to the airwaves, cyberspace, and the streets to promote your candidate and party of choice, especially if it's third party. It's time to shuffle, to make things interesting. Vote, and vote third party, or vote progressive Democrats/BernieCrats!Reasons that Why competitive sports (especially commercialized) are bad for the players and a waste of time and money for the audience but a financial windfall for organizers and corporate sponsors: 

1. **In competitive (and especially commercialized) sports, athletes are pushed to physical limits often as the expense of their health -- short term and long term -- and are incentized to ignore health advice**, this is especially true if money is on the line. In noncompetitive sports, athletes and players do not have the incentive to push their bodies to the extreme; they know that doing so will not good for their health, so they stop, rest and recuperate and follow health advice. 

2. **Performance enhancing drugs and blood doping** are just another side of the same coin. Performance enhancing drugs and blood doping give unfair advantage to those do not use them. Despite health risks, athletes keep using them. Despite regulations, athletes keep inventing new ways to get around them and avoid detection. 

3. **Organizers** such as NFL (National Football League), NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) and FIFA (International Federation of Association Football; its initialism come from its french name) **claim to be non profit organizations are in fact highly profitable. And their executives are highly paid.** 

4. **competitive commercialized sports have nothing to do with promoting health, which are what sports are supposed to do; if anything, it tends to do the opposite.** However, it does promote cutthroat competitions that break records, getting medals, and generate huge profits from advertisers and the audience. 

5. **It's a waste of time for the audience**, because the audience has nothing to gain from watching spectator sports (other than emotional outpouring). **It's a waste of money for the people who buy the tickets to watch the events and buy memorabilia**, because they are literally spending money to watch the athletes who actually make money to compete against each other.

This March, the nation will once again go "mad," as more than 140 million people tune in to watch one of the biggest sporting events on earth -- the NCAA men's basketball tournament. But "March Madness" isn't just a basketball tournament. It's become big business, with television rights alone worth $10.8 billion over 14 years.

In Money and March Madness, FRONTLINE correspondent Lowell Bergman takes a hard look at the economics of the annual NCAA tournament -- a cash cow for amateur athletics that generates enormous dollars for everyone except the players themselves, raising basic questions of fairness that are now leading a handful of influential figures to challenge the way the NCAA operates.

Episode 417: Lance Armstrong and The Business of Doping
In this episode, we consider a world in which everybody is cheating, a world where it has become impossible to succeed unless you can game the regulators: Professional cycling.

Under the leadership of Lance Armstrong, the U.S. Postal Service cycling team was wildly successful, winning the Tour de France for seven consecutive years—from 1999 to 2005.

Then, in 2012, after years of speculation, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency filed this report. It announced that the team had been running a secret, high-tech doping operation during those years. It also showed that operation was run a lot like a business, complete with an infrastructure, employees, and a leader. According to the report and a number of professional cyclists competing at the time, that leader was Lance Armstrong.

________________________________







Hi all!  o/

I'm a massive fan of David and what he stands for.  I wanted to float a policy idea with the community.

In a recent episode, it was brought up that Bernie Sanders wanted to allocate $75 billion for free public college for Americans by taxing wall street speculation.  GoP votes hear this and go bananas.  However, Trump adds $100 billion to the military budget and cuts taxes on the wealthy.  You cant ask why, or your unpatriotic and don't want the country to succeed.  

David is absolutely right. 

I'm best friends with a candidate running as a Democrat for Congress in a purple district.  We're constantly talking about policies that will be palatable to more conservative voters.  

This is an idea we've been talking about and I'm proud of.

Essentially it would be an optional buy in for a federal paid public college tuition.  In return for tuition paid, the student would pay a very small percent increase to income tax indefinitely that would go back into the federal fund for future generations. That percent would be locked in for life and never increase.  It would essentially be an college buy-in that would act like a social security system for education.   

After an initial investment to jump start this program, non-participants wouldn't pay a dime of taxes into this system.  

I've floated the idea to libertarians/deeply conservative people, and they don't instantly recoil at the thought of this.  Some even like it.  I see that as fertile ground for policy.

Thoughts?As a professional orchestral player, part of my work -- the best part -- is teaching trumpet and music theory at our city college, and a public high school, and middle school. 

In many cases, I'm the last to leave if there's a late rehearsal with my students, as late as 8:00, even 9:00pm. Sometimes, as early as before 6:00 in the morning. 

I won't ever have kids of my own - and my students are in a lot of ways, my world. I love them very much. The lengths that I would and do go through for them extend beyond what I am able to express with words.

___________

Should a school shooting occur, to get my students to safety, and try to prevent harm that could come upon them - hear me, when I say this: I'm willing, without hesitation, to die. 

And to be honest - Among my fellow educators, I've no doubt in the core of their being, as they do what they were called to do in this life, they would just as such give their own life. 

I have a concealed carry permit. And I practice. The law allows me, now, to keep my handgun in my car, even on school property in gun free zones. 

In general, from the band hall, and practice facilities, where I teach, to where my vehicle is parked outside the band hall back door, running as fast as I can - it would take less than a minute to grab it, and be back inside. And then, what? Do I hide with my students and hope I don't need to discharge a compression based firearm with the reality that it would result in the loss of human life? Do I lock the door where they'd stay, and go try and help other teachers during our lockdown? 

It's always in the back of my mind. 

These thoughts grace the walls of my mind as I see a notification of yet another school shooting news alert on my phone or ipad. 

But, too often, while just in fleeting thought, is now a regular part of my life, as a music instructor in a public school, in the United States. 

And then that moment is gone, as I make sure I'm ready to queue the second violins on their entrance. 

And on, and on, and on it goes. 

______

I'm sorry if this is a rambling, or irrelevant. I just wanted to share it with the Pak-Pack. I know there are many teachers on here, parents, and students. As progressives, we see to build a society in which people are safe. 

I know I am not alone in that I'm so fucking angry that as a society, we think this is acceptable. Kids getting killed in our public schools. And knowing this is not theoretical. It can be prevented. 

I'd respect the constitution, but I will ask this: Is the reality here, that in terms of constitutional debate...we're no longer there. We're miles beyond. 

This isn't about the right to own a gun anymore. It's about a students' right to live. 

Can we do anything - and would it even matter?

We need energy in order to survive. Energy is the basis of life. Life cannot survive without energy. Any institutions that are created in order to privatize energy in any form are unconstitutional institutions because we as human beings have an unalienable right to life.

Edit: I am not saying I support one thing or another thing, I am simply making a claim based off of the writings of our American forefathers and the ones who inspired them.I have been wondering, is the South against it because of the civil war such as Sherman's march to the sea. It does kinda explain the whole anti-federal government arguments politicians in the South use.Exact words from the show, "It's not even clear his voters care about it because they voted for him despite those dozen allegations. If they cared about this Trump wouldn't be president in the first place."  

In a two party system this is a bad thing to say for many reasons.  But to sum it up in a few words: We don't accept everything a candidate, or elected official does, just because we voted for them or support them.  I am not in support of extra marital affairs but I would vote for Bill Clinton over the alternative that election cycle (Bob Dole I think).  This is exactly how Republicans tried to portray Democratic voters.

Now to be clear, some voters are complicit in the extreme moral short comings of a candidate; the best example of this would be Roy Moore.  However, in Trumps case, I believe many voters saw allegations the way we would hope a jury would against us.  Until something is proven, the accused remains innocent.  If all it took was ten allegations to ruin a candidate, it would be easy for a large PAC to use its money to pay ten people to accuse you of a crime and eliminate you from a political race.  I am not saying that is what is happening here, but we need to be careful of allowing that to happen by giving allegations too much weight.

So in the end, we need to stereotype voters less if we want to understand them, and in a perfect world sway them.With the movie tracking for a record breaking opening, and the fact that it's a superhero movie with an all-black cast, this seems to be the type of event that would attract psycho white supremacists or something. Don't get me wrong. I'm going to see this movie this weekend.David has spoken a few times about being against soda taxes from the position (if I am understanding correctly) that they are effectively regressive and disproportionately effecting the poor. I just finished ‘Nation on the Take’ by Wendell Potter which discusses the impact of Big Sugar/Soda lobbying to halt such taxes but it also discusses the potential health implications of such a tax and according to their findings estimates from the University of California a “one cent per ounce tax would reduce soda consumption by 10-15%, a significant reduction in diabetes, 95,000 fewer instances of heart disease, 8,000 fewer strokes”, etc, you get the picture. I don’t advocate for unnecessary heavy-handedness or “the Nanny State” but if we are going to agree that the obesity epidemic is just that, is it reasonable to suggest such legislation to at least attempt to control a phenomenon that society as a whole deals with one way or another? Perhaps there is another, more rational solution? During the press conferences, she begins every answer with “again...”

“Again, that’s something that is between the president and his lawyer”

“Again, those people were dead when we showed up”

As if she is answering these questions clearly and everyone else isn’t paying attention. 

That’s all pretty much. 


She holds some pretty fringe views, but she’s smart and I’d like to see David challenge her ideas like he’s done with many other figures. She’s working on a documentary right now about South African farm murders which could be interesting.A lot of conservative media has been covering this new study lately, I was wondering what you all make of it. It seems a little bit too perfect to me that this study is released around the same time that all this debate about DACA is happening, what are your thoughts?

Here's the study: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3099992The story about Pat's Jehovah's Witness teacher on the bonus show was amazing!

There should be more stories like this!

Now I wonder how did it go. Did she tell the class something like "you do it, but I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses, so I won't do it"?David have you interviewed Timothy Snyder, author of On Tyranny? Thanks.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOjJtEkKMX4Do you guys support legalization of all drugs?

Taxed and sales done by a license and drug issues treated as health problems not criminal.Let's just say that there was a remote control that you could buy at Wal-Mart, or any place that will sell guns, that had the ability to stop people's hearts. It is kind of cool looking, you can get a belt clip for it like your phone holster, and all you need to do is point it at someone and press the power button and as long as you pointed it at a person, you could stop their heart. A remote-control heart stopper. 

Do you think that would be legal? Should this device be regulated in some fashion?

On a different note, I don't know why the thought isn't brought up that the NRA wants guns to just be another accessory that people wear, like watches, jewelry, or I don't know, hats. They aren't toys, but when you get in an argument about it, they react like you are talking bad about their favorite toy. It's like telling a little girl that you are going to take Santa away or something. I'm asking because in yesterday's episode David mentioned that there are not very many angry gun control activists seen on television.Last time, in June 2017, it was Comey's testimony. This week (has it only been a week) has likely been worse.typo: familiar

The intelligence community's annual threat assessment, also out Tuesday, warns that Russia in particular will use social media "to try to exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States." The report predicts those attacks are likely to target the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.  


# Schafer says that the Russian accounts his organization tracks now follow a well-worn path. 

+ First, he says, they tweet out news and breaking developments. This helps them to gain attention and attract new followers.

+ Then they begin tweeting highly inflammatory material to fan the flames of partisanship.  

+ Finally, Schafer says, the accounts shift to conspiracy theories. "They build this narrative of, 'You are being lied to by the government, by the media, by everyone else, so don't trust anyone or anything,' " he says. "It's not just divisive, there's an erosion quality to it as well — of eroding trust."

# Exhibit A: The florida school shooting, and Russian twitter bots sow political discord online 

Many had been tweeting about places like Syria and Ukraine — countries where Russia is seeking to strengthen its influence. Suddenly the accounts shifted to hashtags like #guncontrol, #guncontrolnow and #gunreformnow. Tweets mentioning Nikolas Cruz, the name of the shooting suspect, spiked.

"The Kremlin doesn't care about gun control in America, they have no skin in this game," Schafer says. 

Accordingly, some accounts tracked by Hamilton 68 spew extreme, pro-gun rhetoric. Others attack the National Rifle Association. "By taking an extreme hyper-partisan position, it just serves to further rip us apart," Schafer says.

By Friday morning, new hashtags surged on the network tracked by Hamilton 68. They included #fbicorrpution and #falseflag.

https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/florida-shooting-white-nationalists-415672

White nationalists pulled an ISIS-style trick by claiming the shooter as one of their own. There isn't any existing evidence to show that the claim is true

Even if the shooter were linked to white nationalists, it likely was not a factor, or tertiary at most, in the massacre given everything else that has been uncovered about his background since Wednesday.

##Update

I need to clarify some things, because based on some responses I'm getting people are getting a false impression of what I am trying to say. I am not sympathizing with the bastard at all.

To be clear, I am well aware of his white supremacy, as it has been very well documented and captured by social media activity, and I haven't ruled out the possibility that it was one factor in the incident. I'm saying that right now so many different incidents and factors have been reported that it's not clear what the primary inspiration for it was. The fact that he as an individual is a white supremacist doesn't mean we should assume he actually belongs to a white supremacist organization, even if someone from such an organization says so. This article shows that we can't trust such an assertion on its face.

Now, it's being reported that he was also abusive to one of his ex-girlfriend and threatening/violent toward her friend who convinced her to break up and the boy she started dating after they broke up. Given that domestic abuse and sexual frustration have been the most common threads connecting mass shooters, this revelation is one of the least surprising aspects of his background. We also know that his mother passed away recently, he was obsessed with guns and violence, and he was expelled from the school. According to his attorney, he is feeling remorse over this as well.

We still don't know what, if any, of these factors are the primary motives for what he did. The simplified logic of "He is a white supremacist and shot up a school, therefore the shooting was a terrorist attack" just isn't valid right now and misses the forest for the trees in dealing with how we are going to move forward from this massacre. Paying attention to the entire background of mass shooters is what will drive more effective policy to prevent tragedies like this in the future if Congress is willing to act, not that we should count on that given their history of inaction from the last 5 years.[A caller on the friday show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSN5cZnDb6g) asked about a social libertarian ideology mixed with a more progressive economic one... I guess - I'm not sure if I understood the question. But it reminded me of something.

For the German election last year, the German equivalent to the Libertarian Party, the "Freie Demokratische Partei" (FDP; *Free Democratic Party*), included a basic income in their campaign promises. They out-progressived the more left-leaning parties on that issue. The logic behind their attempt to create such a basic income is rather simple: Government is already paying for many programs (wasn't there something about 47% receiving help from the government in 2012?) and the bureaucracy is overwhelming; maybe it would be simpler - and therefore cheaper - to install a basic income that would replace most other programs.

In a way it's less government and more individual freedom. As a citizen you don't have to prove that you're eligible for a variety of programs, you just need to be below a certain income or whatever qualifies you (could be living in the USA) - and that could be managed by just one agency.

Of course it would likely not be a *universal* or *unconditional* basic income at first and it would have to start out with a relatively small dollar amount, so that the math adds up and libertarians could be brought on board - and I have not the slightest idea what that would look like. But the program could be raised and broadened later and it might be something libertarians could be interested in, don't you think? If you could sell it as "less government", maybe it could reach allies which would otherwise never be for a progressive plan.

Just a thought. What's yours?

EDIT: As promised, I linked to the video after it was uploaded to YouTube.On the heels of Florida's mass shooting I've been thinking a lot about gun control and one aspect came into my mind. I recently, within the last year, learned that cops in Britain don't carry firearms. I have multiple cops in my family friend and family circle and this idea blows my mind. While I'm in favor of a central gun purchase database, a limit on gun quantity per year, a limit on ammo per year, banning AR-15's and similar weapons, forcing people into gun safety classes and insurance similar to driving tests and drivers insurance can anyone run me the logic of cops not having guns? If I had to take a guess, the answer would be so that cops don't abuse weapons, see half the stories about cops in America, but how do good cops defend themselves when things get rough? Thirteen Russians,
Indited for disruptions.
Thirteen Russians,
Disrupting elections.
Thirteen spies, I see.

Thirteen spies, I see.
Ring McCarthy!With the Mueller news that has come out today following fast on the heels of the school shooting, if you are someone who believes in such conspiracies, then this should point towards people in the "Trump Deep State" trying to distract our attention from the Russia investigation. But I still see some among the MAGAists saying it is another false flag with Alex Jones even suggesting it was done to punish Trump for not releasing the Dems memo. As if this wasn't utterly ridiculous already, the fact that the Mueller charges have come out now only increases the idiocy as it would make no sense for the (((globalists))) to conduct a false flag when the bombshell Mueller news was about to be released. I am posting this here as Pakman has made a similar point in the past about false flag logic. It actually makes me sad that even such obvious bad logic does not deter quite a large number of people from believing that these shootings are false flags. I can only see it getting worse too.

Edit: GrammarI follow the news constantly, but have discovered recently by watching DP that I really can't speak about policy in-depth, cite figures, etc. I have a guiding philosophy of progressivism and can cite moral arguments like most people, but it ends there.

You all seem like an especially educated group, so I was curious if you have any advice.You're getting off the tram to head to work, or maybe your getting out of your car to get the groceries from the trunk. Stretching to go for a jog. Forced to go to the post office at midnight because you've procrastinated, and you don't want to deal with those IRS penalties. 

And then it happens - for whatever reason, and however so, you run into Pakman.

What would you do? What would you say? Would you just let him chill and then be like OMG. 

...or would your eyes narrow, as you wonder what he's doing...and can he be trusted? 

_______

I would be like 

'PAKMAN! Dude I watch your show and you've talked about some of my posts on the segment where you highlight some reddit threads and promote the show subreddit. It's awesome to meet you."

I would then proceed to berate him for not playing on his practice pad, or drumming for the fans that interact with the show. &gt; The Trilateral Commission is a non-governmental, policy-oriented forum that brings together leaders in their individual capacity from the worlds of business, government, academia, press and media, as well as civil society.... 

&gt; The Trilateral Commission was formed in 1973 by private citizens of Japan, Europe (European Union countries), and North America (United States and Canada) to foster closer cooperation among these core industrialized areas of the world with shared leadership responsibilities in the wider international system. 

http://trilateral.org/page/3/about-trilateral

In other words, it's a think tank.

According to investopedia, 

&gt; If you look at a list of past and present Trilateralists, it reads like the who's who of the business world. Some of the notable members include former U.S. Presidents and diplomats before they entered their public positions. This commission has garnered much controversy over its existence.



Read more: Trilateral Commission https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trilateralcommission.asp#ixzz57LIzQv8V
 

The Trilateral Commission’s principles of representation are economic weight and political influence. More exclusive than the World Economic Forum, which meets annually in Davos, Switzerland, it is sometimes derided as a “rich men’s club” that includes few women members. The Trilateral Commission reflects powerful commercial and political interests committed to private enterprise, economic freedom, and stronger collective management of global problems. Its members (some 350 in the early 21st century) are influential politicians; banking and business executives; media, civic, and intellectual leaders; and a few trade union chiefs.

The Trilateral Commission’s agendas anticipate those of the Group of 8 (G8) summits between the leaders of the world’s largest economies (plus Russia). Members have held key positions in U.S. administrations and in the governments of other member countries. In the late 1970s, for example, many Trilateral Commission members held senior positions in the cabinet of U.S. President Jimmy Carter.

But I've never heard of it. I wonder if other people can chime in. Please don't give me debunked or unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. I want facts.I ask because I often want to use a descriptive word to describe the scale of indifference of conservatives often have towards people outside their own circles.

We have a strong word to describe people who want to actively harm others, sadists.  What is a sadist class classification of the word indifferent?

Case in point, take any number of recent illegal immigrant raids by ICE where some guy who has been in the US for 30/40 years and scooped up and put on a path for deportation.

Saying people who have no problems with that are indifferent is technically accurate... but it does not capture that immensity of the indifference to the suffering of others.

I feel like language is failing us here, unless one of you can help me.  Is there a better way to describe what I often observe?We pour all this money into the military, and everyone says we should use it for more productive things, but where does it go? That’s over half the US budget. How much goes to maintaining bases, paying soldiers, making weapons? Nuclear capability? David was exemplary when he had his last discussion with Ben on the issue. He was calm and very respectful, but still managed to outwit Shapiro with intelligent, superior arguments.
I'm really optimistic after seeing the very overt protests made by those young survivors in Florida. They want change, and I believe that could help motivate the American people to make this incident different. This time we won't just talk about reforms until enough time passes that the news cycle moves on. This time we've got to keep speaking up until congress capitulates.

If Pakman debated Shapiro again and truly proved how weak the conservative gun argument is, he could really provide a huge benefit to the liberal cause right now.My 'moderate' friend argued that Trump's bellicosity toward N. Korea represents a changed approach that the US needs to try, since previous administrations' approaches failed, and Trump is facing a situation no previous president faced - the realistic ability of N. Korea to hit the US with nuclear missiles.

I said Obama was prevented by Republicans from negotiating a lid on N. Korean nuclear ambitions, and the North was acting in its own rational interests, considering what happens to unarmed countries that end up on the US' wrong side. But those arguments, even if true, don't make what Trump is doing wrong.

Is it possible Trump is right?https://www.marchforourlives.com/

This mass shooting feels different, and I think that we're at a turning point in this epidemic thanks to the vocal survivors taking the lead.

*Side note: Man! That's a lot of uses of the word "March".*This may have already been covered here, but I'm curious. Certain words have been so frequently and often incorrectly used that they've become downright annoying. My list:

- tremendous
- snowflake
- collusion
- huge
- "big league" (comes out bigly)
- all superlative adjectives
- sadBy the way....

**Trump's 2020 slogan: 'Keep America Great!'** [that is, before he made it great. The slogan was revealed in Jan. 17, 2017, before he sworn in as the president on Jan. 20]

# addendum: 

one important aspect of campaigning and governing at the same time (hence **permanent campaign) is that Trump can set the policies that benefit his donors, who can concurrently (at the same time) donate to his campaign -- without the traditional waiting period (or time gap).**

Again breaking ground, Trump takes the permanent campaign to new heights

Under Trump, ‘permanent campaign’ takes on a whole new meaning


__________________________________________

[I mashed the two articles into one at my own liberty and cut off extraneous information, with titles for easier reading] 

# filing for reelection: a comparison with previous presidents 

Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama didn’t file paperwork to run for reelection until April and May of their third year in office. Trump filed the day he was sworn in. Neither Bush nor Obama aired television ads until the election year. Trump’s super PAC has already aired a few of them [in March, 2017]. 

# Where the permanent campaign all began 

It all started when President Carter's pollster, Patrick Caddell, delivered a 62-page memo soon after winning the election, telling the president-elect that "governing with public approval requires a continuing political campaign." [I actually agree with that in order to push for policy changes.] 

That memo is largely credited with creating the permanent campaign. Ever since, presidents have consistently traveled the country, raising campaign money for their political parties and building public support for legislative efforts.

Brendan Doherty, a professor at the US Naval Academy and the author of “The Rise of the President’s Permanent Campaign,” says every president since Carter has pushed the envelope, becoming ever more overtly more political.

Successive presidents — Democrat and Republican alike — have refined the practice, raising ever-greater sums of money, beginning earlier in their terms. 

Throughout, occupants of the Oval Office have gone to great, sometimes absurd lengths to insist that reelection is the furthest thing from their minds. "The political season will come in its own time," George W. Bush liked to tell audiences during his first term. "For me, now is not the time for politics.… I've got a job to do."

It is a line he delivered on 18 different occasions, at political fundraisers held well over a year before the 2004 election.

“But Trump isn’t just adding to the natural progression. This is a quantum leap,” Doherty said. [a quantum leap is infinitesimally small, but I digress...] 

Consider it the way that Donald Trump has changed American politics: The once-subtle art of the so-called permanent campaign practiced by the past six US presidents is dead. There is nothing subtle about the ways Trump has campaigned since winning the White House in November. **He never stopped campaigning, never stopped raising money, and never stopped attacking his opponents.**

Where his predecessors tried to walk a careful line, suggesting that the presidency was above politics, Trump might be the one finally calling a spade a spade.

# turning nonpolitical events into political ones 

Trump has trampled protocol and turned explicitly nonpolitical events, like the Boy Scouts' national jamboree, into replicas of his boisterous campaign stops.

# the show that never ends. more campaign, less governance; more politicalization, less policy. Fueling Trump’s own ego and partisan divide, and reinforcing the enthusiasm of those who already support him

Being so overtly a candidate, he is forcing voters to their partisan roots. 

Trump has transformed the bully pulpit — the president's ability to rally the country in pursuit of his goals — into a sort of vanity project, staging events not to advance any substantive agenda but to vent and, as aides admit, bask in the adulation of supportive audiences.

"He obviously loves the thrill of the crowd," said Julian Zelizer, a political historian and presidential expert at Princeton University. "But it's not connected to some bigger agenda or ideological worldview that he's espousing. It's about the act of campaigning, which gives him juice."

"He doesn't sustain an argument about any particular policy," said Edwards George C. Edwards, a Texas A&amp;M presidential scholar, "He makes some highly generalized comments and then drifts off onto something else. There's no strategy.… **His rallies are apparently to make himself feel good, or reinforce the enthusiasm of those who already support him.**" said George C. Edwards, a Texas A&amp;M presidential scholar. 

“Trump may personally need to hear crowds chant his name for his own reasons, but campaigning like this sets up an us-versus-them dynamic." said Norman Ornstein, a political expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. 

Obama’s chief strategist, David Axelrod, sees a difference with Trump as well.

“We did have President Obama on the road, selling his initiatives in order to pass them,” Axelrod said. “The difference with President Trump is that at these large rallies, the policies seem almost secondary.”

Indeed, when Trump talks about the size of his Electoral College win or hits Obama as if he is an opponent, the president is still in campaign mode.

## an example 

Trump's tempestuous appearance at a Tuesday night rally in Phoenix was illustrative, offering a one-man oratorio of anger and indulgence.

Spitting venom, he attacked Democrats, “the very dishonest media,” Arizona’s two Republican senators, the Washington Post, the New York Times, the rules governing the U.S. Senate, the protesters outside, the North American Free Trade Agreement and, again for good measure, the news media.

He did not, until 58 minutes into his speech, mention Afghanistan, the subject of a prime-time speech to the nation just the night before. Tax reform, supposedly the top item on his legislative to-do list, did not come up until 70 minutes into Trump's 76-minute speech, and even then he provided no details.

Indeed, he spent far more time discussing CNN, a perennial target of the president's wrath. "They put on these lightweights around the table that nobody ever heard of," he scoffed, "and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings."

The crowd of several hundred cheered and jeered, some turning on the assembled press corps with middle fingers raised.

That’s different from other recent presidents who traveled America to boost their political prospects but also, in the case of Bill Clinton, to remake the Democratic Party in his more centrist image; or George W. Bush, to promote the post-9/11 “war on terror”; or Barack Obama, to pitch his economic stimulus plan and, later, his healthcare overhaul.


# Not reimbursing the federal government for campaign travel cost

There might be consequences in just logistics: **By being so explicit, Trump’s campaign may have to reimburse the federal government more for travel. In the past, a president would schedule an official government event at a school or a business and then attend a fundraiser or campaign with a local candidate. Trump, so far, hasn’t done that.**


The NRA seems to have buckets of money to buy politicians - does the amount of money it spends reconcile to the number of members it claims to have? I know they must get a lot from gun manufacturers. I tried Googling to find how many members they have and there seems to be a lot of conflicting accounts. Also, the stories seemed to suggest that the percentage of people who are NRA members found in random surveys seems not to agree with NRA's claimed membership. Is Russia funneling cash to the NRA? Is the NRA inflating it's member numbers to explain how much cash it has?I think this is something people on the right do better, and much more often.  They love cross promotion and talking to each other and not just to an audience.  

This is partly due to more people on the left having more news coverage formats where they state the facts and give their take rather than a more "shoot the shit" style show.  There are often guests that show up on left leaning sites, but it's usually fairly structured in the topics covered, similar to a guest showing up on a cable news show.

Contrast that with the more free form discussion David Pakman had with Kyle after that article talking about how youtube was dominated by the right, or Davids talk with Destiny.  That kind of discussion is interesting to listen to and ought to happen more often.  

I think this is an area where the mutual discussion and cross pollination lifts up more boats at once, not a zero sum game.So there are billionaires thinking about solving world problems by giving up half or more of their wealth. 

The best way to do it would be to buy the Republicans. 

Republicans are extremely efficient in getting their unpopular policies through. 

If they are motivated to solve global warming or income / social inequality we will have results in a month.

#patentpendingThis post has nothing to do with the Israel-Palestinian conflict. There is a worthy time and a place for that, but this concerns civilian gun policy in America versus in Israel, and there are false misconceptions that the right has taken as a talking point.

There is mention of a photo in the OP. The photo is of a young Israeli woman wearing a sun dress and carrying a rifle at a bar. She is an off-duty soldier in basic training.

&gt;I've noticed several people in my feed mention Israel concerning armed citizens and guns, quoting BS put out by the NRA, so let me set a few things straight. If you want to own a gun in Israel you must consider the following: 

&gt;1. 40% of applications for firearms permits are rejected. There are only 170,000 active permits currently (population 8.5 million)
2. Only a small group of people are eligible for firearms licenses. Primarily licenses go to high ranking retired military personnel, police officers, prison guards, security guards, and animal control officers. There are a small number of licences for settlers in the West Bank and hunters. 
3. You must be at least 21 years old for those who completed military service otherwise you have to wait till you are 27 or 45 for non-citizen residents. 
4. Applicants must be a resident of Israel for at least three consecutive years. 
5. You must pass an extensive background check (including criminal check, national security check, health exam, and mental health evaluation)
6. You must establish a genuine reason for possessing a firearm. I like guns is not an option. If you say you need a gun for self-defence, you can only have one gun, and you are limited to an annual supply of 50 bullets 
7. You have to justify every gun you possess separately. Owning more than two guns is extremely rare. 
8. You must pass a multi-week weapons-training course. 
9. You have to renew your license and pass a shooting course every three years.
10. You have to undergo a psychological assessment every six years. 
11. You must have a safe at your residence in which to keep the firearm. 
12. There is 100% VAT on firearms, and you will pay thousands of shekels to qualify for your license and hundreds of shekels each year to keep it.
13. There are enormous legal repercussions should your gun be miss-handled, miss-fire, injure anyone unjustly, or be used in a crime. Even if you are not the one that committed these acts.
14. You are not allowed to sell your gun to anyone but a registered dealer or the police. 

&gt;In Israel, gun ownership is a privilege, not a right. It is illegal to own an assault rifle. The photo below is not an open carry gun enthusiast. It's an off-duty soldier that has to carry her weapon while in basic training. Know that when you see young Israelis carrying assault rifles, those are soldiers. I have yet to meet a single Israeli that liked doing this. It is basically a punishment. Don't believe what the NRA says. Gun violence and gun death in Israel is low, not because we all have to carry guns in our youth, but because of gun regulation, enforcement, and not breeding a culture of fear around personal protection.

That said, I agree. We should have a policy more like Israel's. It's a pipe dream in America, unfortunately, but it is what I would consider ideal.https://www.npr.org/2018/02/19/566731477/chart-how-have-your-members-of-congress-voted-on-gun-bills

Since Trump has been elected I've got a bigger tax refund.  Bigger than all 4 years of Obama.  Not only that, but I got something that I never got in all 8 years of Obama, I got a raise.  

Is the Trump hate cosmetic?  As of right now, my life is improving faster than it did under Obama.  Now I work a blue collar job so I'm curious how you guys are doing now compared to the Obama years.Title correction: ...that is, before he **could** possibly make it great.]

# This concurrent pri pro quo... 
was neglected by the two newspapers which I posted earlier. And it didn't occur to me then. 

Traditionally, presidents usually wait for at least 2 years before officially kicking off his campaign. This means, the president sets his policies that benefit his potential future or past donors first before a few years later reaping the benefits in the form of campaign funds. With Trump's permanent campaign, he doesn't need to wait for the funds flowing in. He can literally set the policies as the funds are flowing in -- the funds (and, of course, his campaign staff) can utilize to enjoy for Trump's instant gratification and for his re-election effort. 

### This is a new level of political corruption. 

The closest analogy I can think of is that then minority leader **John Boehner handed out tobacco lobby campaign checks on House floor to Republican house of representative in 1995 as they vote on a  bill that would repeal tobacco subsidy.**

Trump takes the permanent campaign to a new level (he filed his campaign on the inauguration day and has already started fundraising, holding rallies and airing ads, which is unusually early): politicalization, lack of policy, ego boost, and not reinbursing government for campaign travel costHe plays it all the time, but then again he's been president for over a year and he's not very good at that either.https://twitter.com/GunDeaths/status/959181455220867072?ref_src=twcamp%5Eshare%7Ctwsrc%5Em5%7Ctwgr%5Eemail%7Ctwcon%5E7046%7Ctwterm%5E1Anyone have any suggestions for books about social democracy? Google is pushing "The Third Way" by Giddens but I'm not sold based on some reviews. "The Theory of Social Democracy" by Meyer seems interesting.

I think I am maybe more interested in a book that talks more about the specific policies and rationales than I am about a Marx-like book that speaks more in theoretical terms. Thanks!

'No Words Will Do Justice': Onslaught On Syrian Suburb Kills Some 200 Civilians

https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/21/587516317/syrian-barrage-buries-civilian-areas-what-have-we-done-to-deserve-this

Syrian Barrage Buries Civilian Areas: 'What Have We Done To Deserve This?'


An onslaught by the Syrian government and its allies has killed about 200 civilians since Sunday in the suburbs of the country's capital, Damascus, according to a U.K.-based monitoring group and a consortium of aid groups. The groups say the aerial bombardment has targeted a rebel-held region known as eastern Gouta, smashing parts of at least five hospitals and leaving hundreds of people wounded.

## medical supplies are not allowed to get in

"Medicine and medical supplies have not been allowed into the city for months now, and there is virtually no medical care available for these people as they suffer severe trauma wounds. **To systematically target and kill civilians amounts to a war crime and the international community must act to stop it**."

## one of the last enclaves controlled by rebels 

The Damascus suburb — which the United Nations says is home to roughly 400,000 people — is among the few remaining regions in Syria controlled by rebels. 


As evening settled over eastern Ghouta on Tuesday, the suburb just outside Damascus lay battered by 48 hours of sustained airstrikes. And the approaching night promised still more horror for one hospital.

## the Syrian regime specifically targets medical facilities

By 5 p.m. local time, the Syrian American Medical Society says, barrel bombs had begun to fall in a downpour about the medical facility.

"The hospital's entry points, as well as the pharmacy, were directly hit. These airstrikes continued to relentlessly target the vicinity of the hospital for five hours, also directly hitting ambulances," SAMS said in a statement released Tuesday.

The medical relief organization said at least 300 patients and staff found themselves trapped and seeking safety in the building's inner recesses during the hours-long attack — until finally the drone of the aircraft faded with the attackers' departure.

## killing more than 100 civilians in a day

On Tuesday alone, bombardment by pro-regime forces killed at least 107 civilians in rebel-held eastern Ghouta, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The U.K.-based monitoring group said Wednesday that brings the death toll in the area to more than 250 civilians, including at least 58 children, since fighting escalated Sunday night.

"The word 'catastrophe' can't describe what's happening in East Ghouta. Why do we continue to let children die before our eyes? What have we done to deserve this?"

## heavy airstrikes before ground troops moving in 

As NPR's Ruth Sherlock reports, the forces supporting President Bashar Assad's regime are "pummeling the area from the air before troops, which are believed to be amassing on the edges, then try to move in." A ground offensive would aim to clear eastern Ghouta of its rebel groups, which is a threat from their perch just outside the capital.

## the regime has far superior weapons and firepower than rebels 

But there has been a vast disparity in the scale of firepower between the two factions, as pro-regime forces conduct their campaign on the district of some 400,000 people with airstrikes and barrel bombs.

"They targeted everything: shops, markets, hospitals, schools, mosques, everything," he added. "I will treat someone — and after a day or two they come again, injured again."

## targeting civilians and medical facilities = war crimes. Civilians are trying to stay alive as long as they can. 
Panos Moumtzis, the United Nations' regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, said Tuesday at least six hospitals in eastern Ghouta have been hit. Of those medical facilities, he said at least three were rendered inoperable. The attacks, he said, "may amount to war crimes."

"It's beyond imagination what is happening in East Ghouta today," Moumtzis said, calling for a humanitarian cease-fire. "The untold suffering is intolerable and residents have no idea whether they will live or die. This nightmare in East Ghouta must end and must end now."

For now, civilians in the area have little option but to survive in whatever way they can. Faiz Orabi, a local doctor, told Ruth he had treated one pregnant woman who lost limbs in an airstrike and lost her baby after a piece of shrapnel pierced her stomach.

"It's a very, very sad situation for us as doctors, for the patients, for all the families," he said. "People are underground now, trying to stay alive as long as they can."


Choose issues where liberals might easily disagree, if not with the end goal, the method of achieving that goal.  Do the same at conservative clusters like evangelical churches.


In particular I am thinking of liberal commentators going on road trips to a local college or specific colleges and copying what that insufferable Crowder does, but with a liberal bent.  Set up a table with an issue posted, and invite anyone that walks by to disagree and discuss.

I think the topics focused on should be ones where there are clear schisms on the left.  And in some cases, we could even talk about an issue where agreed with overall, but disagree with specific arguments made.

Case in point, in Contrast to Crowders table setup about abortion with him being pro life and talking to pro choicers, if I was doing one of those events, I might have a table with a sign that said pro choice is a terrible argument for abortion...


Then I would focus my fellow liberals into arenas where I think the discussion would be more productive in highlighting where we are actually different from pro lifers.  A fetus is alive, and it's human life.  You can think that and still be OK with legal abortions, but many people on the left seem to think it hinges on those things and get bogged down by conservatives when they attack those flanks.

The gun issue is where I think it would be interesting for a liberal to set up shop outside a gun buying event or some NRA event with a sign that said they were pro gun control.  And here, it is HYPER important to have whoever does this know their fucking shit, know their stats, have listened and heard and digested the counter arguments made by conservatives a dozen times over BEFORE they act as an ambassador for another viewpoint.  

Then we could get into the differences in opinions on the relative trade off of the freedom to own almost any gun anyone wants vs the increased likelihood in loss of life.



You all probably have better topic ideas, but this is a useful format to post online, it is engaging, people like seeing conflict, and this is the kind of format where liberals can work through their own ideas and arguments to persuade others.


It would push back against the LIE that liberals and the LEFT more generally are afraid or intolerant of non left leaning ideas being expressed.  It would expose the lie that we were unwilling to discuss things openly.  

The right is doing this, we can do it better, and expand it into territory where we clearly have the higher ground by lazy arguments win the day.


David said something interesting and useful in his talk with Destiny.  It's easier to make conservative arguments on many issues because there are more nuances and contingencies and moving parts involved in many liberal counter arguments.  Guess what kind of format is IDEAL to going through those kinds of nuances?

Open discussions.  @David_Pakman, it's time the left started waging our own open war of ideas on more fronts!I don't here liberals directly discussing this but yet I here people on the right who are against democracy. What are the roots of this anti-democracy ideology? Rightwing people claim the Constitution only talks about democracy in a negative way and that the constitution clearly states that the United States of America is not a democracy but a republic. But when I read a little bit about the United States being more specifically a Federal Republic it did not sound at all completely undemocratic like some on the right claim.  So what the hell are people talking about when they say America is not a democracy? Granted I am not an expert on this topic and I have never heard liberals address this particular issue at its core. So I have no idea how to effectively defend democracy when my boyfriend watches these jackasses on YouTube who don't believe in democracy. My boyfriend claims that democracy leads to communism and anarchy.Ryan Grim also reports for TYT (the Young Turks)

THE DEAD ENDERS: Candidates Who Signed Up to Battle Donald Trump Must Get Past the Democratic Party First

Today, I spotted a DP bumper stick in my local parking garage. I thought it was pretty cool because I live in Knoxville, Tn, which is a very conservative place. https://agingmillennialengineer.com/2018/02/15/fuck-you-i-like-guns-2/

**Disclaimer**: *I did not write this article, nor am I an army veteran or gun owner. I got it from a retweet by veteran and TV actor Jim Beaver.*So, I'm a teacher working in a school district that can't afford much, it's called Most School Districts. This Republic plan to arm teachers is something I totally agree with and here are some of the better points of it and what it tells us about the opiate crisis.

1. If they want to pay for weapons and training for teachers, they want to increase funding for public schools.
Great! We clearly don't receive what we need and this represents a real and substantial heel turn for the GOP, clearly they aim to sign a huge chunk of money over to us because who would propose such a costly ludicrous measure without willingness to fund it? Jackasses, you say? Surely they aren't.

2. They don't care about mandates any more.
 "Sure it's insuring millions of Americans and sure it's saving lives and lowering premiums more than they would have risen without the health insurance marketplace, but my core conservative beliefs tell me that mandates are wrong!" Well, you clearly don't anymore. Great, I'm so proud Republicans are willing to admit they've been wrong about limited government and mandates because why else would they want to force teachers to willingly shoot people unless they've taken a different stance? I can admit that not a single teacher at the school I work at would be willing to keep a gun at school (and we're in West Texas) but we'll bite the bullet (proverbially, [ok, fucking literally,too]). If we bring back the mandate and put those millions of Americans back on the ACA. The English teachers won't even point out the irony of whining about a mandate that saves lives and enforcing a mandate that would surely end more lives.

3. It shows a path forward for the opiate crisis.
The logic goes like this (and hear them out till the end, they heard those students out till the end and even agreed to maybe do something about bump stocks which didn't have anything to do with Parkland), guns are killing people so we need more guns. Nobody's called it yet, but I'm gonna guess that the GOP will soon be sharing a similar plan for the opiate crisis: heroin and fentanyl are killing people, so we need more heroin and fentanyl. This must be the plan; I've been waiting for a response to the opiate crisis for a while because Trump promised that he would, "solve it the most best, believe me, nobody cares more about heroin than I do". This is leading by example; now that he's shown us the sound logic of fighting gunfire with gunfire, we can apply it everywhere. Once we're all hooked on heroin and od'ing daily we won't have the faculties to worry about anybody else who's doing the same. Always remember, heroin doesn't kill people, people kill people.Such a brilliant leader we have.What about discussing Bayes Theorem as the sort of "generalization" as to why Alex Jones type conspiracies should be rejected.  If there isn't already similar material this could even be included in the critical thinking mini series.  

For example, let C be "Crisis actors were used" and let E be "Evidence used in support of this conclusion (yearbook, multiple locations, etc)" also let nC be the negation of C.  Here P(F) is probability of an event F and P(F|M) is probability of event F given M. Then by Bayes Theorem:

P(C|E)=(P(E|C)*P(C))/(P(E|C)*P(C)+P(E|nC)*P(nC)).

The improbability depends not only on P(C) being low, but also on the low probability of sloppiness P(E|C) in a false flagging group, as David mentioned.   I know it sounds extremely chaotic, but think about it; Would they be happy if everyone starts getting military grade weaponry such as; RPGs, M134 ATF, Miniguns, M249, etc. 

Would they be happy about it? Or they'll have the common sense to realise it'd be chaotic? At the top of today's show David was asking for input on what to do in regards to the conspiracy theories about the Florida school shooting. Dave asked if we think he should do an expose style video addressing the theories, or just briefly mention them, or ignore them. 

I think it would be incredibly irresponsible to ignore them, and you should go full out in debunking the conspiracy theories. Not only that, but I think you should point out the fact that Alex Jones is extremely dangerous, because he starts and perpetuates these insane conspiracy theories, and he is radicalizing people who then become a danger to society. 

Why are we letting Alex Jones radicalize people in this country like this? Under Obama the U.S. government killed Anwar al-Awalki in a drone strike because he was radicalizing people in his videos. Alex Jones does the exact same thing. He's radicalizing white American men who are at risk of becoming domestic terrorists. The guy that went to the pizza place in D.C. because of the pizza gate conspiracy theory could have easily killed multiple people, all because of Alex Jones. 

Alex Jones is not a journalist, Info Wars is not news. He's not an entertainer, and it's not entertainment. He is a figurehead responsible for creating domestic terrorism, and David Pakman should go to great lengths to shed light on this, beacuse if only one person who was on the fence were to be better educated and informed about Alex Jones and his conspiracy theories, then that would be worth the effort. That is basically what he admitted to on national televisionSo I got attacked for saying I have benefitted from Trump's tax cut.  David Pakman admitted on his own show he is making more money and the employees are getting more money.

So what do you guys have to say now?...how long before we see a video of a frustrated teacher aiming his/her gun at a student for disrupting the class. i went to watch the Rational National's latest video and was surprised to see the ad that ran was the NRA. 

who do we write to to complain about this? i tried finding a link to contact youtube but no luck. Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31

I saw David's recent video, titled "No, the 2nd amendment doesn't protect Assault Weapons," where he argues that assault rifles should be illegal to possess, says there is no debate here and vaguely cites four court cases. 

Watch his video: https://youtu.beyKNU2UsRoIY 
 
I couldn't find the court cases he referenced on google or the description on his video, so if someone can find an article or something on what David is referencing, please do.

Despite Davids claim that there is no reason to debate this, there is legal precedent on owning a fully automatic rifle which are definitely more dangerous and regulated than just semi automatics. Yes, that is right. You can (possibly) own a fully automatic weapon in the United States, but you have to be licensed which are extremely restricted to begin with, and full autos costs tens of thousands of dollars. https://goneoutdoors.com/fully-automatic-gun-license-6742869.html

Doubt the people that will harp away about how these weapons should be illegal to posses, and how I am a Russian Troll for saying something that doesn't fit into their rigid ideological hoo rah rah will read this far to get to the nuance, but I think they should be illegal to possess/sell after the date of a ban so they become more collectable and harder to obtain. If you bought an AR15 for instance before the ban took place, no one should take that away from you if you're obeying the law of corse. Let me bring other legal precedent as well can could be used to make the case that making the possession of assault weapons illegal has repercussions for unsuspecting law abiding citizens. 

Stanley v. Georgia 

In Stanley, the Court held that a state cannot prohibit citizens from possessing obscene material for personal use.

In this case, sexually explicit films were discovered in defendant Eli Stanley's house by police, in the course of an unrelated investigation into his alleged bookmaking activities. He was convicted of "knowingly hav[ing] possession of ... obscene matter," in violation of Georgia's obscenity law. The Court overturned the conviction, holding that "the mere private possession of obscene matter cannot constitutionally be made a crime."

_______________

I guess Trump has to believe that he will win the second term in order to make it happen. # the most serious offender has largely avoided the spotlight of being accused of flip flopping, even though flip flopping is heavily frown upon. 

Trump's supporters often claim that Trump is a straight talker, "telling like it is", maybe he is, maybe he isn't (depending on your definition). But Trump's mercurial (fast-changing) nature of policymaking and  contradicting statements should have caused most traditional politicians being accused of flip flopping (and thus being disingenuous, which would damage his candidacy.)

**What's striking to me is that while most politicians equivocate or being ambiguous to avoid being accused of flip flopping, Trump has no qualm of changing his positions, which he makes sound so resolute and unequivocal.** While his flip flopping should be obvious to most people, his political opponents had not hammered it home to make it clear that Trump would say anything to get elected (far more so than Hillary Clinton and John Kerry). And the mainstream media should have done a better job exposing his many shifting positions and contradicting statements. 

In 2004, John Kerry's campaign was damaged by his flip flopping on the Iraq war and free trade among other issues. I think sometimes the criticism is unfair.

David Zucker- John Kerry Flip Flop Ad


When being accused of flip-flopping, other politicians try to explain away their change of positions or clarify positions or less frequently apologize that they were wrong. However, Trump simply denies that he ever flip-flopped in the first place. 

Just to be clear, I don't have a problem with genuine evolving positions of any politician or anyone. However, far too often politicians change their positions based on flimsy excuses and unconvincing stories to hide their true intentions. 


### I think Trump changes his positions for the following reasons:

1) to specifically appeal certain audience

2) to make up his mind on the go; he probably doesn't even know what position he should take 

3) to make politically expedient stances to the American public (in other words, to be duplicitous; to lie)

This came from a panel with Van Jones a year ago, listen to this section first 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9gUr0_8oE&amp;t=4404s

It provides a couple of fantastic points about the general argument people like Thomas Frank and even myself make about conservatives voting against their own interests.

The key point?  Rich liberal whites vote against their self interests, and do so happily because of their values.  And... so do many of the conservatives who have this moral sense that they do not want to be bailed out by someone elses money because they failed or made bad choices, or their kids did, etc. etc.


So knowing that discrepancy in core values, how do we as liberals break through that deep sentiment that conservatives don't want to have themselves or others bailed out?  Because that seems to be one of the core psychological barriers that needs to be dealt with to break through to a portion of them.https://youtu.be/LLGnsRRgeIg

Russia Is Far From the Only Country Influencing U.S. Elections (with David Sirota) 

**I just want to point out that the methods that other foreign countries' influence on the US election are very different from the Russian government.** Their methods that other foreign countries use is through lobbying, bundling campaign donations for candidates, and donations to think tanks. These think tanks' members are then hired by the administration and whose publications are used to advocate certain policies. 

Although the Russian government does hire lobbyists to influence foreign policies, their main focus is through Political warfare, which is much more malicious (e.g., public opinion influence campaign, spreading conspiracy theories and rumors, compromising political leaders, digging dirt on foreign leaders, and trying to hacking into voter registration system, etc) http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-bannon-oprah-women-take-charge-of-society-2018-2


 In the article it says he's concerned. My concern is this a way to lull left leaning people into a false sense of confidence. Making people think winning the midterms and 2020 is a slam dunk. 4D chess? Real fear? A combination? Am I reading to much into it?I’ve struggled greatly with this question. I guess if there was a perfect answer, there wouldn’t be so much controversy over this. My mind isn’t made up on this issue. I currently lean pro-choice up until 20 weeks (which is usually when a fetus can begin to feel pain); however, I’m aware that abortions can be made painless for the fetus with anesthesia. Premature babies are delivered before 37 weeks of a pregnancy, and extremely preterm infants are born 23-28 weeks.

I’m just not sure where to draw the line.. I’d love to hear someone else’s opinion.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-officer-scot-peterson-defends-response-parkland-shooting-n851281

There are several conflicting narratives on the law enforcement response to this shooting. As I understand it, there are currently two open IA investigations related to the shooting and Gov. Rick Scott has (rightly, IMO) called for another probe into it. I suggest we wait for the verified findings of what exactly happened from those investigations before we make conclusions about what went wrong, because clearly mistakes were made.

This doesn't mean we shouldn't continue to push for gun reforms. We definitely should because this should have been stopped long before this monster reached the school grounds with an AR-15. But there is so much anger around conflicting narratives that need to be cleared up.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4FbNH4UnMM

Another fun fact about me. The rally at the 1:02 mark happened in my home town, literally around the corner from my high school. Rumor had it that the protester was trying to "pants" Trump. But I repeat: *it was just a rumor*. Trump spent the next week trying to claim the kid was from ISIS.Sometimes it gets so depressing and so many piles of manure are around I just need to take a break from it all.  What do you all do?

Can Algorithms Fix Gerrymandering &amp; Biased Redistricting?

The redistricting algorithm the caller was referring to is this:

However, there is a serious flaw: it works with only two political parties. (I don't understand why people assume there will always be two parties in this country.) And it doesn't work if two parties collude with each other, which is not difficult to do.

Also, a word about range voting method: 

______________________________


# score voting (also called range voting): just give a score or rating on a candidate/option. (I wonder why this method hasn't caught up with in elections or referendums) 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting 

Range voting or score voting[1][2] is an electoral system for single-seat elections, in which voters give each candidate a score, the scores are added (or, equivalently, averaged),[3][4] and the candidate with the highest total is elected. It has been described by various other names including evaluative voting,[5] utilitarian voting,[5] the point system, ratings summation, 0-99 voting, average voting, and utility voting. It is a type of cardinal voting electoral system.

How We Should Vote (Range Voting)

http://rangevoting.org/RangeVoting.html

# the benefits of score voting: 

1) the voting methods allows for **more information to be put into the ballot (expressive)**. Score voting not only ranks choices, but also **give them favorability rating (quantitative) regardless of other choices**. Hence, **independence of irrelevant alternatives**. 

2) The winner is overall favorable. 

# some shortcomings:

1) the winner is not necessarily the majority favorite. But it's overall favorable. Hence, It doesn't satisfy a "majority rule". 

2) it doesn't satisfy concordore winner criteria. It means, the candidate wins in every one to one matchup against any of the other candidates. But again, most voting methods (including Ranked choice voting system) we're using today in politics don't satisfy it either.  And implementing a voting method that satisfy this criteria in large scale is more time consuming than most methods. 

&gt; The 2009 mayoral election in Burlington, Vermont provides an example in which strategy theoretically could have worked but would have been unlikely in practice. In that election, most supporters of the candidate who came in second (a Republican who led in first choices) preferred the Condorcet winner, a Democrat, to the IRV winner, the Progressive Party nominee. If 371 (12.6%) out of the 2951 backers of the Republican candidate (those who also preferred the Democrat over the Progressive candidate for mayor) had insincerely raised the Democrat from their second choice to their first (not changing their rankings relative to their least favorite candidate, the IRV winner), the Democrat would then advance to the final round (instead of their favorite), defeated any opponent, and have won the IRV election.[50] This is an example of potential voter regret in that these voters who sincerely ranked their favorite candidate as first, find out after the fact that they caused the election of their least favorite candidate, which can lead to the voting tactic of compromising. Yet because the Republican led in first choices and only narrowly lost the final instant runoff, his backers would have been highly unlikely to pursue such a strategy.

# Score then automatic runoff (STAR) voting method: combining score voting with ranking. 

In STAR Voting, the winner is determined in two simple steps. First, all the scores for all the candidates are added up. The second step is an automatic runoff between the two highest scoring candidates. In the runoff, your full vote is automatically assigned to whichever of the top two you rated higher.

So I listened to the Ben Shapiro show recently (I know I'm a fucking idiot) to hear the conservative side of the gun control argument.

Firstly, he said that gun control didn't work in Australia which is blatantly false. He seemed pretty misinformed about what occurred here on the legislative side of things - not sure if this is by design or genuine ignorance.

And secondly he always falls back on some variant if you can't prove that this piece of legislation will stop any gun deaths then why should I support it?

Of course, he spends a lot of time attacking studies that say that very thing. He always says "facts don't agree with your feelings" but if you look all around the world it's plain to see that gun control (not the strawman of banning all guns) has been quite effective in reducing deaths/suicides.


*Puts tinfoil hat on* I also think that he has sinister motivations for trying to pin the blame on gun deaths on "culture". To conservatives like him entrenched poverty is a moral failing. The winners and losers are there because of moral reasons.

[He's even gone so far as to candy coat the genocide committed by the Spanish in South America.](http://thehill.com/homenews/media/354781-ben-shapiro-apologizes-for-racist-columbus-day-video)http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/375784-nsa-director-says-he-hasnt-receive-orders-from-trump-to-disrupt-russian

Shocker. Right?I'm reposting this, cause the last time I posted this, I was rightfully criticized for unfairly attacking a specific Reddit User on this forum for calling me a Russian Troll just for disagreeing with them about gun confiscation. Then they were crapping on me for being excited about Sanders possibly running 2020. So that's when I had enough of this persons crap. Very immature on my part and should have blocked them ASAP but fallacious arguments should be critized, no ifs and or buts about it. They constantly use ad hominems, and the "I know you are but what I am," BS, so I wanted to express why these ad hominems alienate progressives. When I hear, "you're a Russian Troll," I think back to what my grandma would say about the poor living conditions in the Soviet Union was like, and how our family immigrated to the US. I am the 3rd generation of my family born in America, but that doesn't stop xenophobic idiots from rambling. Even if I was a Russian immigrant,  SO FUCKING WHAT?!

When I hear "you're a Russian Troll," what it really sounds like to me is "go back to your country!" If I called someone a Ugandan Troll, I would be called racist and xenophobic by 1000 people, and rightfully so! Why are the Russians any different?! 

All this "you're a Russian Troll" ad hominem attack says to me is that: 
1) they harbor some amount of xenophobia 
2) they are not interested in having a fruitful debate
3) you're not welcome in this country
4) go back to your country
5) if you hold an unreasonable opinion, then they are just going to call you stupid instead of addressing your criticisms of the position they take.
6)they spend more time insulting people than to look up fallacies
7) they aren't the kind of people you want as co workers. 

The moral of this post is using ad hominems against fellow progressives only alienates people, so some progressives want to ditch the progressive movement because of the constant rigid "you must agree with me 100% of the time or else you're a terrible person!"

I've seen this crap thrown at me and others like 10 times this month since the Mueller indictments, especially on the TYT YouTube comment section. It's xenophobic, and shouldn't be left not criticized. 

Here are a couple antidotal examples I've seen:

Person 1: personally, I think the Russian investigation is a which hunt. 
Person 2: RUSSIAN TROLL! 

Person 1: I don't think it's reasonable to confiscate guns, especially if they are as dangerous as AR15's 
Person 2: RUSSIAN TROLL!

You can say that the sky is blue, and they will call you stupid, then accuse you of being a Russian Troll. That's a really good way to alienate progressives. 

It's funny, when I criticize their ad hominems for being counter productive they accuse me of being stupid. How ironic! David, I've heard you mention on your show before that you don't have a particularly strong preference for one over the other when it comes to implementation. Although a UBI and a negative income tax *functionally* have the same effect (i.e., provide a minimum, livable income for all), I believe there are compelling social reasons why a UBI should be preferable to a negative income tax.


My reasons are twofold. First, any system in which one group of people receives some kind of preferential treatment over another group provides a breeding ground for feelings of resentment. We see this a lot, for example, when it comes to our discussions of affirmative action policies in the United States. Many conservatives today feel that since everyone nowadays (at least on paper) is supposedly subject to equal treatment under the law, there should be no need for affirmative action policies in higher education or in the workplace. And the use of such policies are often perceived as a kind of reverse discrimination. These kinds of attitudes (whether well-grounded or not) are not a good way to promote civility and social cohesion among people in a country (and a planet for that matter) that seems so divided along cultural and other dividing lines. And undoubtedly, a negative income tax could easily pave the way for more social unrest by giving people who don't receive a negative income tax more reason to discriminate against people of low income backgrounds.


The second reason is more eloquently described by Wilkinson's and Pickett's book [The Sprit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6304389-the-spirit-level?ac=1&amp;from_search=true). As suggested in the title, the basic premise of their work is to show that countries with lower levels of income inequality inevitably outperform those with greater income inequality on a number of metrics. The more unequal a society is the worse their outcomes are when it comes to mental and physical health, obesity rates, educational performance, teenage pregnancies, violent crime rates, imprisonment rates, and social mobility, just to name a few of the big culprits of bad societal health.


So, after having written it all out, I feel less convinced that the second reason is as much of an argument for a UBI over a negative income tax, but my first point stands nonetheless. Given these considerations, would it not be preferable to implement a UBI instead of a negative income tax if given the choice?David in his video says the main pillars of the liberalist movement is right to life and right to property, but in order to have a right to life you need to sacrifice some rights to property in the form of taxes. But as I can remember when setting up the core principles and ideals of the liberalist movement Sargon and his friends specifically said the state plays an important role in insuring protection of individual rights and with the state comes taxes. 

I am pretty confused, because I know David would NEVER use a strawman or any other fallacy but I also am pretty confident on what the liberalist ideals and principles are. So if I am missing something please inform me.

Also some people would see David using Carl instead of Sargon and not naming the liberalist movement as a way to prop up a straw man and make it harder for people to fact check, but I know David and his audience are much better then this.

Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwty5-hKufoYou mentioned in one of your videos that Trump would probably not charge any school shooters given the opportunity. I put together a short clip that might back up you claim. 

I'm not the best at video editing. 

https://twitter.com/DylanKeahi/status/968721195167375363
According to some recent reports I have come to understand that US has deployed some ships in the black sea near Ukraine.

Then I watched Kyle's video on this and got the idea that he thinks that this is mere aggression. (Among other things).

Now I agree that there is a continuous repurposing of NATO into a more and more aggressive body to serve US's nefarious intentions.

I also agree that US has been trying to fuel a coup in Ukraine and now arming rebels.

However, are we to understand that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine even if the US had not done that? Russia has also done a show of force navy drills in the Baltic seas as recently as November 2017, has it not? 

Now I am neither defending Russia here nor am I absolving the US of all the mess they keep creating. My point is both US and Russia are going to try and jostle for influence on the world stage. Both the countries have staged coups and meddled in elections. These things have fallouts - some more direct than others. In that scenario, is it justified for the US ships to be there considering the danger of a Russia-Ukraine war breaking out.

I have long stated, I remember as far back as December - that Russian elections are coming up in March and hence they are going to escalate something somewhere as they always do during every election. 
Since then I have found the following reports :

On Jan 21st - https://consortiumnews.com/2018/01/21/a-coming-russia-ukraine-war/

Here it is mentioned that a certain decision by Ukraine to label Russia as an aggressor -  The mission in Donbass is no longer described as an “anti-terrorist operation.” Rather, the mission now is to send armed forces against “military formations of the Russian Federation” in Donbass.

Russia seems to have interpreted this as a declaration of war. Now one could argue that there may be US influence behind this law and I am not denying it. However, that is a different debate.

The article is trying to argue that Ukraine has various reasons to start a war for political reasons and I agree. The article also says that Russia does not. With which I disagree because I believe that a war rhetoric works very well for Putin in his elections. So technically, even though Russia may not stand to gain anything, Putin still may. 

Now, after this, I have noted a constant escalation of events in the mentioned region and other border areas. There have been constant firing by Russian proxies from Weapons banned in the Minsk accords because apparently, it stands null and void as Ukraine changed it first. There has been a steady increase in attacks and violations since mid-January, the latest being -

27th Feb : A convoy of military Russian military hardware has been spotted moving along the Russian town of Novocherkask, Rostov region. The relevant footage was posted by blogger Daniel Rodriguez on Facebook. "Russia, Novocherkask, 45 km to the border of Ukraine and the Russian-occupied areas, a convoy of military equipment. Let me remind the headquarters of terrorist enclaves is located in this very town," he wrote.

28th Feb - Russian-led forces attack civilian areas in Luhanske where terrorist HQ is supposed to be in.

Also on 28th Feb - OSCE reports 143 explosions in Donbas in 24 hours with multiple cease fire violations near Horlivka, the Donetsk Filtration Station, Shyrokyne, Yasynuvata, Lomakyne, Kalynove-Borshchuvate, and Molodizhne.

So basically, the two are at everything but formally declared war, right in line with my predictions regarding Russian election timeline.

Now taking these facts into consideration, do you think US should be interfering in the matters on Ukranian border? In light of all this are US ships justified or they should still stay out of Russia's backyard?

Even if US started the coup or helped the rebels (as it should seriously stop doing), is an almost imminent war a reason strong enough to justify US presence or should US just keep their noses out of this?

First of all, Trump owes Judge Curiel a big fat apology...not that we should expect that or anything.

Second, Congress has yet to authorize the funds to build. Given the Supreme Court's decision earlier this week to not hear the administration's appeal on Trump's DACA order, there is no real incentive for Democrats or Republicans who are unenthusiastic about a wall (Flake, Collins, Graham, Kinzinger, Paul, etc.) to support $25 billion or more in such funding.

This is a disappointing ruling, but that's just how the courts work. Curiel should be commended for his professionalism on this.First reported on [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/us/politics/hope-hicks-resign-communications-director.html). 
He then describes digging himself out of this low place in part by reading emails from viewers who have benefited from and praised the show. Had Trump come into power when David was younger and just starting might he have thrown in the towel lacking the experience to see that as bad as things might seem, time can bring positive change in unexpected ways? This perspective often only comes with the maturity that one achieves  by putting on a few years. One also can learn with age that fighting the good fight can be a worthwhile end in itself even when  battles are lost. Its not easy maintaining motivation in one's chosen profession. Its good to see David is doing the necessary soul searching and intends to continue to put the truth out there through the show in the midst of a quagmire of lies. Thanks, Pakman. Kudos to you too Pat for providing back-up.Peter briefly mentioned a few points that I think should be expanded on. What if the world or the US "went social democratic?" Peter said that the people would continue to socialism anyway. Thinking about it: to make the reforms that socialists and social democrats both want (this is a lot), a strong people's movement would have to impose: fair taxation of the super rich, an end to the military-industrial complex, an end to the prison-industrial complex, an end to foreign imperialist wars (Iraq), significant public ownership of significant industries (health, education, power, communications, etc.), banning speculation (the mortgage crisis), ending corporate welfare, publicly owned banks, breaking up monopolies, replacing the carbon industries, etc. This would take away trillions of dollars that make up the super profits that the corporate oligarchy uses to make capitalists the ruling class and capitalism the system under which we live.  It would return their effective power to pre-New Deal levels, and the capitalist economic system would collapse world wide. The people would have to impose their solution (some form of socialism) or support the restoration of the top level of their own capitalist class as the ruling class at great expense....

This is hypothetical, though. In fact, capitalism has its own economic crises every 5-7 years, some of which have moved it to collapse, world war, fascism, etc., in the past, and will do so again in the future. This is the nature of capitalism. It is not practical to say that we want nice capitalism. The question is: can we do better? whichunt, noun. What you call it when authorities investigate you and find mountains of evidence against you, indict your cronies on felony charges, and have you so frightened you will say and do literally anything to obstruct the investigation, yet you still want to portray yourself as an innocent victim. Not be confused with the term "witch hunt" which is almost the exact opposite.In my opinion this blurs the discussion. Totalitarianism is something different than plain authoritarianism. At least in my opinion it is about an ideology, that wants to take subject an entire state and society to its apocalyptic and violent ideology. You should be very carefull with analogies with totalitarianism. 

\- GreetingsFrom what I understand, I read about some case where some computer programmer wrote a book about making strong security algorithms and the court sided with him in releasing the book to bypass the US export laws regarding weapons exports. 

He is only releasing the blueprints for the guns and there is already federal law that prohibits the use of fully plastic guns. What are your thoughts?First off, I’d just like to make it clear that I’m only halfway through the podcast. However, there are a few points I’d like to go ahead and point out. This initial (minor) point is the statement made by the guest host referring to Sam Harris being “right wing.” I’m not aware of the work Ben Dixon has done, but this seems to fall in line with the opinion of the “intellectual dark web” being conservative. When, in actuality, Ben Shapiro would be the only individual that fits that description. I’m aware this is persnickety, and I don’t take the group that seriously, but this attitude from fellow people on the left is a little annoying at times.

The second thing I’d like to bring to attention is Ben Dixon’s comments on the Facebook fiasco. Prior to listening to this podcast, I listened to NPR’s take on the situation via their political podcast. According to their analysts, it was found that most of these left-wing resistance pages had Russian ties. Especially the one which organized and reached out to other (real) pages with the same message regarding the scheduled event. My point is this: Yes, removing them swings in the administration’s favor. Yet, if we want to be truly objective on the matter, we need to recognize and stop this sort of thing even if it’s helping our cause. It’s important to note that I could be wrong in my understanding and am very open to clarification.PROVEN: US president has nearly unlimited power to pardon.  So, Trump can even pardon himself for crimes, provided he has already committed them. An acceptance of a pardon necessitates it's an admission of guilt. You don't need a trial if someone admits guilt, although an acceptance of the confession is necessary since crazy people might confess to anything. 

ARGUMENT: If Trump accepts his own pardon, he would necessarily be admitting high crimes or misdemeanors (and be a matter of impeachment as well), making him ineligible to be president (or pardon himself). BY HIS LOGIC, Senate would no longer need to convict (because he confessed) and he himself, accepted his own confession. By other logic, my first argument is that he should not be able to issue a pardon to himself since it would inherently be a matter of impeachment.

**BRIEFLY: Would an acceptance of his own pardon be both conviction and removal of himself from office (like resigning), since neither House nor Senate would have to act?** 

Any logicians in the house...?


MY THOUGHTS: Sorry about the strange logic, but it's insanity that Trump would be criminal, judge, jury, executioner, and pardoner.... all in his own trial. That is where we find ourselves if Trump is above the law, by his own logic. Trump seems determined to break any rules he can get away with, including being judge in his own trial.... which may need to be decided at Supreme Court: he himself nominated! I ask because WHEN this goes down, Supreme Court is going to need infallible, ambidextrous logic (a la Marbury v. Madison) to accept the argument Trump is proposing: HE ALONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. 

If Trump wins, he just broke the Constitution with his corruption, and the inevitable corruption to come when other presidents run the USA like a criminal organization above the law entirely because THEIR guy is in office. 

If I am wrong, then why didn't Nixon pardon himself in advance of resigning, since he wasn't impeached (YET), the pardon could still stand by Trump's logic. If a president could just break law with impunity, pardon himself for the crime only he knew he committed, before they had a chance to impeach, he would ALWAYS get away with it. Constitution is very clear: a CRIME must have been alleged before impeachment can begin. 

I do not believe impeachment is a legal act, it is a political one, which is why conviction does NOT lead to criminal charges, a sentence (other than removal, which is political). Indeed, criminal charges come LATER, after removal from office. The framers never conceived of the abuses Trump is toying with and may realize he possesses. There are no laws or rulings which can stop him if he acts fast enough to pardon himself... NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, not even president and NO ONE CAN BE A JUDGE IN THEIR OWN TRIAL... but... WHERE IS THAT A LAW?? Where has the Supreme Court ruled that is a thing? It is presumed, but Trump will argue he is breaking no law, and he may very well be ruled right if he picks his people to Supreme Court. Trump will break any law or rule if he is not prevented from doing so. If either of those rules were established, I am pretty sure Trump could be charged like any other criminal: by any law enforcement official. 

Just because the chief of police commits a crime and is the boss, a law enforcement officers FIRST duty is to the Constitution (which is where all laws must conform), THEN to the law they are sworn to uphold, and much later to their boss as an (as a suddenly insubordinate employee). If a traffic cop witnesses a crime, it is their DUTY to the LAW to arrest their boss under threat of law (perjury I believe, since they swear an oath). They do not need permission or authority to do their job ON their boss: they already have it. Mueller can arrest Trump if he witnessed or has evidence to believe Trump committed a crime. 

Presidents are PRESUMED to be of good character, and would not break the law, nor does Constitution require you not to be a felon to be president, though some states have disagreed for other office holders. Trump is not a good character, and the pardon power CANNOT be absolute, or Trump and those who follow after, would be entirely above the law and evade Constitution protections by pardoning himself and others before charges can be brought against him. 

We HAVE to come up with rock solid logic that the Supreme Court will not be able to ignore... because Congress refuses to do their job and impeach, even if democrats take over in November and seat in January 2019. Imagine all the damage and pardons Trump could issue, preemptive of charges, if he knows he is in trouble after November, but before January...

Trump cannot stop state charges, but Supremes have ruled that state charges can wait until President is out of office. Mueller seems to be playing this game, handing off prosecutions to state investigators who cannot be appointed by, coerced by, or removed from the case as Mueller possibly can. 

Guaranteed, Trump will kick this to Supreme Court. He has already said he will if indicted, even though Clinton was indicted already, and precedent set. Relying on Dems to grow a spine and get some votes, or Republicans to grow a patriotic spine in January 2019 isn't going to happen and will be too late. VOTING ISN'T ENOUGH. We NEED to have a good argument that a skilled lawyer can give to the Supreme Court (quickly), regardless of the tilt at that time, which they cannot ignore. Best I can tell, there is no precedent that says: no one is above the law. 

# Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co. says:   judges must recuse themselves when the risk that they will be biased “is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.” 

If Trump is allowed to exercise his Constitutionally protected right to pardon, and is protected by case law preventing him from being sued for exercising his right to pardon. Only, MAYBE this case would prevent him from pardoning him and his family in that a President would be ACTING like a judge by pardoning family members or himself. That is a LONG stretch to think Supremes would agree with that. A LONGER stretch to say President cannot obstruct justice by premptively pardoning before Mueller brings charges against him and his family, since Burdick v USA allows pardons before, during, after conviction.... though it requires the crime must have already been committed, thank flying spaghetti monster. 

I don't care if Pence is worse. I am certain he isn't a criminal. Isn't in Putin's pocket. Certain he is not itching for war to distract from his legal woes. I hate Pence worse than W Bush, and I think W should have faced war crimes trial. But I am certain he isn't a traitor hell bent on breaking every rule and convention he can get away with to cover his own families criminal dealings. Trump is a criminal, many times over. Trump is a traitor. He has to go, ASAP. So according to evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller, polyamory is increasingly gaining in popularity amongst the millennial generation. Is this true? What are your &amp; Pat’s personal views on this? And would you ever consider an open sexual relationship with your girlfriend? (Where you are free to date &amp; have sex with other men/women)I realize this investigation is different from that of regular citizens and regular law and order, but I haven't yet heard any explanation for why Mueller would need to question Trump before the Grand Jury trial. --Couldn't the questions just come then?  Antifa has shut down white supremacist rallies by fighting them. Yet Democrats seem to still be using the same losing game-plan, which is to try to appeal to moderate conservatives and throw liberals and progressives under the bus. This strategy started with Bill Clinton, which is why Democrats lost control of Congress during the '90s, and they've been losing ever since.

Democrats need to adapt liberal and progressive policies and moderates will jump on board.This is just an idea but I think that if I were an oppressed minority I would like to get away from the oppressor majority. One futuristic idea that could be accomplished with the help of Elon Musk would be to create space colonies or space stations where oppressed minorities could flourish.


Some of the places I thought of:

HIVenus space station for homosexual and Africans who suffer from the AIDS/HIV


INeptune space station for the those who are inept and struggle with chronic unemployment.


Mercuretard space station for those who suffer from mental retardation.


I have a friend who fully supports Trump and he is willing to answer questions about why he supports him, how he sees society and so on. GO ahead I had it queued in watch later but now it's been deleted.Sure, we could all nitpick over which media outlets (and which media formats) do or don't report on Yemen or net neutrality.  And technically Sarah Sanders is accurate when she repeatedly accuses members of the Press Corps of not saying "the economy is booming and ISIS is on the run."  But the only news Trump really cares about is that which sheds a positive or negative light on him.  The 3 cable news channels do have their obvious general slants with regard to Trump, and there are millions of TV's in America that stay tuned to one of those channels 24/7 in bars, restaurants, gyms and workplaces alone, not to mention the first channel people turn on when they get home and are curious about what's going on.  

Is it not fairly interesting that 1/3 of those channels is the one that routinely favors Trump, and 1/3 of the people do too?  Our judicial system is better. Our election finance system is better. Our healthcare system is better. Our welfare state is better. Our healthcare system is better. Our criminal justice system is better. Our attitude towards atheism is better. And NOW even how churches are better! 

What's so great about America again? Oh yeah.  "Muh freedom!"

On Friday Christian Aid, the charity, announced that more than 5,500 churches of various denominations across the UK were using renewable energy. Churches have also come together to use their financial and moral heft to influence fossil fuel companies.

The Church Investors Group, an institutional investor representing 60 churches and Christian charities with close to £20bn in assets, is using engagement with fossil fuel companies to drive change, holding behind-the-scenes discussions on climate change with company boards and attempting to influence them by voting for greater climate change disclosure at annual meetings.

Churches are also shunning the most polluting fossil fuels in their investment portfolios, which are typically used to fund the retirement of clergy and upkeep of church buildings.
The Quakers in Britain, which has a £25.9m investment portfolio, committed to full divestment from fossil fuels in 2013. The Church of Ireland, which includes the Anglican Church in Northern Ireland, has also moved towards divestment, as has the United Reformed Church Synod of Scotland.

Today was another example of just how terrible this portion of the show is.  I really wish it would simply go an be replaced with something else.  Voicemails are way better than call in. 

Anyway my idea for replacing this portion of the show would involve this subreddit.  

David should host a AMA thread on this sub every week.  People can post questions to David and this community can then answer them throughout the week.  David can then look at that particular thread and pick a few of the top questions and answer them himself or share some of his favorite responses.  

But the call in portion... it just attracts the dumbest people that are so ill-equipped to even articulate the topic they want to discuss let alone dig deep into it. [Have You Heard of Single, Transferable Vote?](https://youtu.be/R_OCbzH-bPg)

I love that David is now getting more open to some alternative voting methods in order to increase representation and proportionality. These tenets are vital in growing and increasing democracy, and even voter participation. However I find it odd. 

I called into the show a few months ago asking about David's opinion on proportional representation voting systems, and he argued that they are flawed due to the possibility of them giving rise to more power to extremist politics in government. 

That being known, and being aware that STV is a  type of proportional representation voting system, how can David reconcile these two opposing sides. Again, props to David if he has come around on the PR voting issue as that is fantastic, but can both of those viewpoints be held?Every time David is gone and we get a guest host I can't make it through the episode.  This weeks show was no exception.  Its so obvious that David's B-Team severely lacks the basic critical thinking and intellectual honesty that David at least attempts.  

With the B-Team the show simply becomes a caricature of itself which I think is counter to everything David is trying to do.   It partially legitimatizes a lot of the hatriots complaints. 

Is David simply trying out different subs and hasn't arrive at one that he likes?  If that is the case I am fine with what has been happening.  But most of these guys seem to already be established in the industry and it would be pretty easy to jump over to their show and see its nothing like Davids before David invites them as a replacement.  

I would much prefer that David invite inexperienced guest hosts that are tying out for a permanent slot, rather than simply allowing a fellow progressive talking head to occupy the space that David is leaving temporarily vacant.   If that is not an option then I would prefer a repeat of an old show.  Or let producer Pat give it a college try. 

Have you liked anyone on the B-Team yet?  I can't remember liking anyone of them so far but I might be rewriting my memories right now. Is it me or is David so good looking!

I'm not a huge fan of his politics, but I can't stop watching his videos because of how hot he is. Anyone else...? Wrong sub..?Recently the Seattle city council tried passing a bill that would tax business making over 20 mill a year to help out with the homeless situation in Seattle, and as I’m sure your aware. Mr.Bezos basically told the city he was going to pull the plug on any new construction in the downtown area if the bill were to pass. And low and behold the spineless democrats of this “liberal bastion” of this city folded. Given that the definition of economic terrorism is the act of disparaging and disenfranchising mass numbers of individuals in an economy through deceptive, unethical and illegitimate practices while in a position of public confidence or trust, for greed and personal gain.....does that make Bezos a terrorist?I'm not too impressed with this plan if the costs being touted in the media accurate. On one hand if we are pretty much going to spend the same money anyway but have an opportunity to cover everyone that's an improvement at least. But at the same time, our health care system is still **massively** expensive compared to the rest of the world. And that's the problem we're not talking about. It looks like we'd still be spending roughly the same percentage of our GDP(around 18% now) on healthcare. Meanwhile most advanced nations are spending almost half what we do(typically 10% of GDP). Why isn't Medicare for all going to slash health care expenditures down to that level? The savings I'm seeing are a joke compared to what you see in other nations. So I'm not too impressed with this plan. Yes, I'll take this over what we have now since at least it's universal, but still, where are the savings that we see in other countries? Nobody is even talking about this.https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/site/handlers/icalfeed.ashx?MIID=30

I wanted to see what the building's occupancy capacity was, to see if it would align with the crowd-size claim after the event. 
I was unable to find the information.

What I did find was a calendar of events for the school that doesn't mention today's rally.

Kind of funny.Why is it bad for the candidate who is no one's first choice to be elected?

I am against any voting system that can't be put into effect with paper and human volunteer counters, so I probably don't want any form of ranked choice or instant runoff.

That said, why is it bad for the candidate who is no one's first choice to be elected?

If everyone wants a different candidate as their first choice, but the same one as their second, is it undemocratic to elect that second choice?

Candidate   % of first vote    % of second vote

A..................... 0.5  ..................... 90

B.....................19. 9  ..................... 2

C.....................19. 9  ..................... 2

D.....................19. 9  ..................... 2

E.....................19. 9   ..................... 2

F......................19. 9  ..................... 2I see a major problem with this approach: How do we make sure the funds are actually spent on projects that reduce carbon in the atmosphere? Time and again, we see that the funds from special purpose taxes like this get reallocated to unrelated purposes and eventually just become another source of income for the government to spend on whatever.Our founding fathers lived in a different world from ours, so I see no problem with keeping the name Faneuil Hall. The question was asked on the bonus show Friday, "where do we draw the line?" I draw the line at insurrection (against the US). If you want to memorialize an insurrectionist, you are intrinsically rejecting the ideals of our union. Removing confederate statues, etc. from public areas that shove them into the faces of citizens despise that ideology and putting them into museums is a good thing. History gets preserved but not publicly glorified.

Now regarding Crispus Attucks, I believe that this brave man should be memorialized and glorified. I am totally in favor of his likeness being on display.The 1965 immigration act was one of the worst policies in US history. Since the time the immigration act was passed wages had no real increase, crime in almost all areas went up.  

Housing would also be much cheaper and new construction would be cheaper since available land and building costs would be cheaper.

The 1965 Act resulted in the addition of approximately 70–80 million people to the population of the United States from the passing of the act to about 2010/2015, and unfortunately many of those people have been of limited means, low education, etc. Mass immigration, particularly accepting in waves of people arriving by boat or walking in, has been destructive to the nation. As a basic threshold issue, if somebody doesn’t have the money to fly into the USA, we probably don’t want them here because they are going to become an immediate public charge.

Crime started dropping only in the 90' after Bill Clintons justice reforms, when we basically became an pseudo-Orwellian militarized-police state and still the crime levels of today had not dropped below 65' crime levels.

CPG Grey has some good videos on how IRV ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE)) and STV([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI)) works.

I think the best system though would be to have a top two primary like in CA, but use approval voting to get the top two instead of plurality.  Approval voting is just voting for all the candidates you like with equal weight votes instead of just one. This would stop the vote splitting in the top two primary and the two that run off would be the actual best two candidates instead of whoever survives the vote splitting. Under this system it would be so much easier to form voting blocs based on issues.  
I think the NRA is going to shut down because of whatever they got up to with the Russians, namely accepting their money and funneling it to support Trump. 

Oliver North got away with a huge amount of treasonous activity, he'd be a pretty savy pick if you expect the NRA to be facing accusations of treason and political money laundering. The guy's an expert, he was totally acquitted. Are there any other Caribbean David Pakman fans here? I'm from Trinidad and Tobago. I've been following David and the show for about 3-4 years now.I am not sure where I should post this, but I guess most of the David Pakman fans tend to quite familiar with the IDW and have strong opinions about their individual members one way or another, I guess it is somewhat relevant to this subreddit. If anyone has any suggestion which subreddit is more suitable for this post please let me know, and I am more than happy to move it there.

I have been following many the works of many of the members of the IDW for the past years, and I have always find many of them fascinating. I would consider my politics mostly left of the center, and I always like to see my believes challenged, and the IDW did plenty of that.

Among the IDW members, some I genuinely sympathize with for being actual victims of the far left (**Brett Weinstein** and **James Damore**, who just stood by their honestly held believes and got themselves fired), some I absolutely don't (**Dave Rubin** and **Candance Owens**, who are just money chasing charlatans and script reading monkeys, with no original thoughts nor journalistic integrity);

Some I agree with almost 100% (**Steven Pinker** and **Christina Hoff Sommers**, who I am still surprised are counted as  members of IDW at all. I don't consider any of their views that controversial), Some the other way around (**Ben Shapiro**, even though I still respect him for being quite philosophically consistent and never water down his own views to try to win an argument);

Some I respect their intellect thoroughly (**Eric Weinstein**, who is one of the few people who had great achievements in both the academic and the business world, and is truly inspiring in many of his insights among many topics), Some not so much (**Joe Rogan**, who really doesn't offer many original insights, and tend to be easily swayed by whoever he was talking to. However, I do think he has real intellectual curiosity about the topics he talked about, and is generally an honest actor without too many ulterior motives).

So who in the IDW do I think is the most problematic? Some might say the most extreme members such as **Stefan Molyneux** or **Milo Yiannopoulos**, but I am not too worried about these guys as I think they are too extreme to effectively influence the mainstream anyway.

To me, if you asked me a while back, the most problematic figure would have been **Sam Harris.**

I have always found Sam Harris unique among the new atheist figureheads to be not just content in bringing down the old organized religions, but to establish a new belief. He frequently talked about the importance of the spirituality, and talked at length about his experience in meditation and encouraged others to do the same. While I agree with him that religions should not have the monopoly over morality, he then turned around and asked us to believe that science would be able to answer all moral questions eventually (notice that by "science" he excludes philosophy, which would have made this claim much less controversial).

Sam Harris frequently claimed that he is only attacking Islam as an idea, but then quoted statistics in a questionable way to justify discrimination against the vast majority of the Muslim population (Him lumping the % of Muslims supporting Islamist movements with the Jihadist movements together was especially a problematic sleight of hand). He would find ways to justify torture, racial profiling and nuclear first strike, and then sheepishly argued he was only supporting a much weaker and less controversial version of what he proposed. He says he values civil discussions, but would go on ad hominem attacks immediately when he faces real critics (Such as Glenn Greenwald, Reza Aslan, Cenk Uyger etc).

To me, all these are signs of an attempted cult building, and Harris has been relatively successful in it. This is what makes him dangerous in my opinions.

However, notice that I said my answer would have been Sam Harris only "if you asked me a while back". So who do I think is the most problematic figure in the IDW now?

I would unequivocally say it has to be **Jordan Peterson**.

Despite the fact that their religious positions are on the opposite ends of the spectrum, both Peterson and Harris employ eerily similar techniques: They would both make seemingly outrageous claims, and then retreat to a much watered down version and insisted they were misinterpreted in the first place. They are both trying to provide a spiritual home to those who might have rejected the traditional religions but don't know where to go. They both claim frequently that they are victims of ad hominem attacks while employing such strategy often.

And Peterson has shown signs that he is willing to go even further than Harris in terms of stretching his hypocrisy (Can anyone explain how one can justify being a free-speech absolutist and launch [a libel lawsuit](https://globalnews.ca/news/4287272/jordan-peterson-sues-wilfrid-laurier-for-defamation-following-ta-case/) at the same time?)

Peterson has long been heavily critical of the New Atheists, even before he gained widespread prominence due to the Bill C-16 saga. Judging from his [new year message on his blog for 2017](https://jordanbpeterson.com/new-years-message-world/), where he said he was "preparing his arguments, carefully (although I have been doing so for years...)" ahead of his first podcast with Sam Harris, this talk was a big event for him. I think it was important to Peterson because they are going after the same thing. They were both trying to build a cult, and Peterson is targeting Harris' followers to try to convert them.

We can see further proof of it from [an article by Bernard Schiff](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/2018/05/25/i-was-jordan-petersons-strongest-supporter-now-i-think-hes-dangerous.html), a long time friend and colleague of Peterson. In the article, Schiff said Peterson has wanted to buy a church, where he would deliver sermons every Sunday.

Why would I think that Jordan Peterson is more problematic than Sam Harris then? Because in the battle between them two, I think Peterson will win. I think Harris has always struggled to reconcile the contradiction between preaching rationality and preaching loyalty towards himself as a thought leader, but Peterson's religious approach make that jump much easier. I also think Peterson is so much more familiar with the brainwashing techniques used by all the dictators in the 20th century, and it is becoming clearer that he is not afraid to use those same techniques.

What are your thoughts? Do you think I have exaggerated the danger posed by **Jordan Peterson**? Or have I underestimated the others in the IDW?

Edit: typosPersonally I think that being anti-cannibalism is just colonialist mind programming. As an environmentalist and someone who is against colonialism and capitalism I think that eating people as a form of capital punishment (maybe they are bigots or child molesters) is a much more efficient way to deal with people than life imprisonment.


Tribes in Africa and in the Phillipines/Fiji used to practice cannibalism until whitey came along and forced his colonialist mindset, capitalist power structures, white supremacy and patriarchal values upon these peoples. 


I think it's time to give cannibalism another look, decolonise your mind people!David was right, he looked like a total vampire when he was on, they had this pale lighting to make him look more sickly.  To counteract this effect David may need to have his team paint him to have a Trump like skin tone for his appearance, then when the vampire death light combine with the Trump paint, he just looks normal.Lol. I visited this website as recently as this very Saturday just gone by. I tried to visit [it](https://www.theknifemedia.com/) this morning and I got a blank page with the simple message " The Knife has ceased publishing. Thank you for your interest and support."

I wonder if this has to do with its connection to alleged sex-cult NXIVM. The Knife Media had become quite popular with rightists, centrists, conspiracy theorists, enemies of the media (particular media that isn't of a conservative bent). Some members of the IDW (Eric Weinstein and Dave Rubin) sang praises about it. What would you think of an educational requirement for becoming President of the United States? I was thinking of a special degree that would demand a PhD level of understanding in a variety of relevant subjects, a presidential degree let's say. I'm no expert and was curious what the pros and cons would be&gt;[https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/02/right-wing-conspiracy-theories-from-the-1960s-to-today.html](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/02/right-wing-conspiracy-theories-from-the-1960s-to-today.html)  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;After the new John Birch Society picked up the McCarthyist baton in the early 1960s, it started getting huge national media attention. The organization recruited tens of thousands of members in chapters in dozens of states. **The federal government, the deep state, was “50–70 percent” Communist** and was “under operational control of the Communist party,” it’s founder claimed in 1961. **Obviously academia and the news media were infiltrated, but the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also consisted of fellow travelers, and former Republican President Dwight Eisenhower had been an agent of the Kremlin, Birchers said**. During the ’60s, the conspiracy came to be understood as extending well beyond commies—**communism, according to the Birchers’ new line, was just one piece of a master conspiracy, a tool of a plot that stretched back to the 18th-century European Illuminati.** For simplicity’s sake, Birch co-founder Robert W. Welch Jr., wrote in 1966, “let’s call this ruling clique simply the Insiders.”  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Newly politicized Christian fundamentalists brought their own end-times conspiracism into the party. In the ’70s, a knock-around Texas evangelical named Hal Lindsey published *The Late, Great Planet Earth*, which purported to reveal the details of the evil über*-*conspiracy—how **Satan and the Antichrist and false prophet and their minions in all their respectable disguises were taking over the world. For instance, the “beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns” in the Bible was the new European Economic Community**. The Late, Great Planet Earth was the best-selling nonfiction book of the entire decade.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;When Pat Robertson ran for the Republican nomination in 1988, he won four states. His politics were his theology and vice versa. His best-selling 1991 book The New World Order is essentially Behold a Pale Horse with more Christianity and no aliens: according to Robertson, t**he familiar conspiracy, running from the Illuminati to the Federal Reserve, was creating the satanic pre-Armageddon one-world government that Revelation predicted. Like Cooper (and probably not unlike Vladimir Putin), Robertson argued that the Illuminati contrived to make Russia communist so that 75 years later it would fail and thus become dependent on the Illuminati-run global financial system.**  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;But then the right discovered it—exposed it!—and refashioned Agenda 21 as a secret key to the globalist conspiracy. By 2012, Americans on the right knew to be scared, very scared, of this vague, 20-year-old international environmental plan. When the Obama administration created the White House Rural Council to promote economic development in places like Appalachia, a **Fox News anchor warned that it was “eerily similar to a U.N. plan called Agenda 21, where a centralized planning agency would be responsible for oversight into all areas of our lives. A one-world order.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The right had two generations to steep in this kind of conspiracism. Its exciting taboo vapors wafted more and more into the main chambers of conservatism, becoming familiar, seeming less outlandish. **Do you believe that “a secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government”? Yes,** [said](https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PPP_Release_National_ConspiracyTheories_040213.pdf) **34 percent of the people who voted Republican in 2012.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;There are loons on the left, too, of course, but the liberal establishment has simply never given its imprimatur to preposterous conspiracy theories, and research about belief in dubious conspiracies confirms that there are many more fervid American conspiracists on the right. And take a look around today’s John Birch Society website: Its concerns and spin—leaving the U.N., Agenda 21 alarmism, fighting “amnesty” for undocumented immigrants—are now unremarkably Republican.  
&gt;

[New Rule: Conspiracy Weary | Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV7VuPtveVs)Now, I do agree that the Alex Jones controversy does have free speech element to it. I think that is more nuanced than people think but that's not what I'm focusing on right now. While everyone is talking about "deplatforming" Alex Jones they never seem to address the underlining issue of corporate consolidation on the internet. How is it that when one company makes a decision that someone's free speech is being violated? It happens when they have so much influence on the internet it is effectively shutting down their speech. If the internet was a true free market then Alex Jones would simply go to YT's competitor and there wouldn't be a problem. The problem is that these tech giants (Youtube, Facebook, Google, Amazon) have so much power that their "competitor" is non existent. So we've gotten to the point where the "public square" isn't on the internet but on these sites because they own so much of the real estate.Anyone familiar with the company?   Any good examples of things they have done in the past?  Anything really cool they are raising funds for now? I was wondering what all your thoughts were on geo-politics, and more specifically what kind of sources to use to learn about it. I'm trying to become more informed about world politics but I have no idea where to start as far as reliable sources go. It seems like every source of information has a narrative/agenda that informs their outlook and keeps them from objectively conveying the information. So how exactly should I go about this? What sources to you all trust to keep you informed about global politics? I promise, this is tangentially on topic with this sub reddit.  I intend to use this as a response to how I see many conservatives reacting to some proposed change in society, to link them to a way of being that no one ought to want to mimic in life.

Here is a basic example.

But I am hoping by opening this up someone can find something much better.  Something that shows such a ridiculous fear of the unknown, of change, that it is so over the top it might slap someone out of their conservative mindset.

Change of success?  Probably less than 5%, but that's still better than zero.As fans of the show we are basically paying Pakmans welfare check every month so that he can larp online as a progressive commentator. You have to admit it's pretty cushy, he hires a few interns and pays them peanuts - they edit all his stuff.


All David has to do the night before is read a bunch of news articles. He wakes up in the morning in his overpriced Boston apartment, steps over Producer Pat who is curled up in a ball on the floor still passed out from all the video editing he did the night prior (probably only lets Pat get a few hours of sleep each night) and walks downstairs.


David presses the button on the expensive coffee machine he bought for the lulz with one months patreon money, he imported it from Italy with no cost spared. He likes to pretend he's cultured. He makes a soy cappucino and he froths up the soy so and draws little dicks and stars of david in the froth. "Wow David you could have been a barrista" he thinks to himself.


David notices that Pat is still asleep which upsets David so he turns on the legacy media (the guys who give his entire show content) on his 85" OLED Samsung Smart TV™. David can hear Pat stumbling around upstairs, clearly running up a huge sleep debt. The TV is blaring at max volume out of the premium limited edition Bang and Olufsen speakers David had imported from Denmark.



"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America may win" the TV is blaring in the background, the premium Bang and Olufsen speakers causing the entire room to shake.


"Shit - if my benefactors see the US improving they might stop buying my doom and gloom narrative every month for only six shekels!!!!!" David thinks to himself. David gets a little upset, he really enjoys his 5 holidays a year and all the Tesla shares (NASDAQ: TSLA) he's bought. David was even thinking of getting some foreskin restoration surgery soon and hitting the dating scene again (Pat would be relocated to a kennel out the back).

Alex Jones got pulled because he used other companies websites (YouTube, Facebook etc.) to knowingly spread false information about Sandy Hook victims. Why Kyle thinks this is something to defend is beyond me. 

What has happened to this dude?

When Kyle LITERALLY said on his show that he "does not care" that the Russians hacked the DNC because "the leaks were important"... I mean, that was a new level of insanity.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXrLrjT8N2gEzra Klein's podcast episode.

&gt;[https://pca.st/mRbu](https://pca.st/mRbu)  
&gt;  
&gt;America is changing. A majority of infants are, for the first time in US history, nonwhite — and the rest of the population is expected to follow suit in the coming decades. The number of religiously affiliated Americans is at a record low, and the share of foreign-born residents is at a historically high level.  
&gt;  
&gt;What happens to a country amid this kind of demographic change and strain? What does it do to our politics, to our identities, to our worldview?  
&gt;  
&gt;I’ve come to believe that you can’t understand politics in America right now without understanding these changes and how they act on us psychologically. And to understand these changes, you need to talk to Yale psychologist Jennifer Richeson, who has done pioneering work on the way perceptions of demographic threat and change affect people’s political opinions, voting behavior, and ideas about themselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;I believe this is one of the most important conversations I’ve had on this podcast for understanding America today — and I also know it’s just the start of trying to understand these questions. Enjoy.So if the federal government is under federal court order to reunite the border families, what's the penalty for failure and who imposes it?  I know they already missed the deadline given, so is there already something undesirable happening to "the government" as a result?  I've listened and read closely to many sources' new stories about the court order but never heard the 'or else' part.  The Koch bros recently funded a study to find out what costs more; private insurance or Medicare for all. 

Their results were shocking- Medicare would save something like 17 trillion over 10 years. 

But why would they release this info? Why even bother looking into it ? The results around the world are clear about which healthcare is better. 

This feels like the beginning of the rich eating the rich. 

They just got a huge tax cut and are set to get another soon. The Koch bros know that the people on the bottom have almost nothing left and they play the long game. 

So why keep paying these private insurance companies billions to insure your employees? Why not move toward Medicare for all, that’s what the people want. 

Then, they can put another Paul Ryan(s) in Congress and immediately start cutting services and “making tough choices”. 

The health insurance industry is one of the largest in the country and it would make sense to starve them out and then take all that money left on the table. 

What are your thoughts? Was the study leaked?

TLDR; cut out health insurance companies, pretend to be for Medicare for all, get it, 
immediately start cutting services. 

Thanks. I was curious about this so I ran some experiments with a sample size of one (myself). I wanted to see if the rumours were true about the power of the n word, I was at the line at the bank waiting to withdraw a hefty sum and under my breath in a room **FILLED** with people I whispered "*censored*" - IMMEDIATELY I felt a rush of adrenaline. In 2018 getting labelled as a racist can be life ruining and now that we live in a surveillance state where the citizens themselves report on each other via their cell phone cameras I knew that I had flirted with the idea of metaphorically jumping off of a building.


If you're running late to work and you don't have time to consume your morning coffee whisper the N word under your breath, if you need to concentrate or improve your reflexes whisper the N word under your breath before you try to do the task. It only works if there are people around and there is at least SOME chance that you will be overheard.

There is an anti medicare for all anti jobs guarantee anti free public college hit piece in Vox where the Manhattan institute conservative guy argues that the bill will be so massive it's untenable.

I think it's finally time to sketch out the actual costs, and how they would be paid for in full.  He tried to hand wave away the savings from private people not coming out of pocket for healthcare costs, and waved away notions that we'd be up for the kind of re distributive need.Again, this only proves how blinded Jimmy is by the DNC hate, to the point were he is unable to intellectually distinguish between what Alex Jones does and what a regular Left/right political talk show does.

Is he doing it deliberately, or does he simply not understand that this has nothing to do with free speech? 

Again, Alex Jones knowingly spreads lies about dead children, victims of massacres. Innocent Americans who are now being stalked and harassed as a direct result of his actions. 

Alex Jones is also directly responsible for the lies about the pizzagate conspiracy, which again resulted in a guy walking into the pizza restaurant with a rifle and put three bullets into the wall. 

This is not about politics. This is not about free speech. 


And Facebook and Youtube is not a right. 



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_LlMmL6YlkLet’s be clear on what lead to Alex Jones being removed from YouTube. YouTube would have wanted his viewers and kept him if it wasn’t for these actions and events.
1. Advertisers around the 2016 elections found out that they were running ads on North Korea communist channels, neo-Nazi and white supremacist channels, conspiracy theorist channels, xenophobic channels, fake news channels, and channels promoting or inciting violence and hate towards groups of people.
2. Due to public backlash, some advertisers threatened to leave YouTube if they could not be disassociated with these groups, because of the free market actions known as boycotts towards them (the advertisers) and the effects that news of their ads running on these channels had on their businesses (from lowering stock values and resulting in consumer boycotts, or the fear of these actions happening to them).
3. YouTube increasing the rules required to follow when agreeing to the terms of service for YouTube broadcasters to stop advertisers from fleeing.
4. Alex Jones agreed to the terms of service on YouTube.
5. His videos violated the terms of service and he got three strikes. The rules of YouTube were followed and his channel was terminated.
6. If you do not want Alex Jones to be removed from YouTube, you have to reduce the burden of the rules needed to be followed in the terms of service, so that Alex Jone’s content does not violate the terms of service. This will result in advertisers leaving YouTube and lowering everyone’s pay. There is no way to keep advertisers and to keep Alex Jones broadcasting the content he has been doing, including incitements to violence.


Long time listener to TDPS and this is the first promotion that has caught my attention.  Is there any way of knowing when [the promotion code ends with Indochino](https://youtu.be/aFxIqvq-EoM?t=440)?  

The clip says "This week" so I am assuming it is good until Friday?  But I don't want to miss out because of timing.

Also, the promotion actually puts the suits down to $360, not $380 which is what he said in the video.No one batted an eye when the treasury was tapped to pay off bank balances to shore them up, so why not use the capacity to print money to help shift the US from one corrosive payment model for healthcare to something more sustainable?  This would only need to be one time, transition costs are not long term costs.  I'd even be willing to consider gifting some workers that would be displaced in insurance/medical industries because they are not longer needed in a universal system some extra cash to help with their own transitions.  I'm thinking of all those people who work in medical billing.

In fact, I'm generally in favor of and wish there was more precedent for a sort of imminent domain standards for when government comes in and displaces things.  If we decided that we were going to shut down coal plants by 2030, and that would necessarily cause a loss of X number of coal jobs, instead of saying to those people, sucks to be you, go suck lemon, we could say, here is some cash and some training where you can make similar if not better money doing something else.  This might lower the negative associations with trying to change sub optimal systems due to self interested parties who benefit from the status quo and get more people willing to embrace change if we minimize the consequences for people of that change.Here are some the public/non-free market policies we have in healthcare:
1) Public funding of colleges to create doctors in the first place, which decreases wait times by over 300%.
2) State, local and federal subsidies for hospitals and healthcare facilities since they have high startup costs. We pay 3/4 the cost for every new hospital through taxes. Hospitals would not exist in rural communities without the government, it is not financially viable.
3) Medical licenses to increase quality of healthcare and increase standards of care. 
4) Free emergency rooms and ambulances for all uninsured
people. Free dialysis for all Americans, created by President Nixon.
5) Tax deductions to allow private companies to buy their employees health insurance using the government’s money.
6) Medicare, government health insurance for the sickest and oldest group of Americans
7) Medicaid, health insurance for the poor
8) Children’s Health Insurance Program- Universal healthcare for children created by President Clinton.
9) Medical malpractice to sue doctor’s who injury patients or perform unethical procedures. This prevents doctors from doing harm in many cases.
10) The National Institutes of Health, which accounts for 80% of all medical innovations, new medicine and procedures, all from tax payer dollars.
11) Tax deductions for medical research, which lets the government pay for all private medical research.
12) Tax deductions for charity to subsidize private charities that provide healthcare to children or other individuals.
13) The Affordable Care Act
14) Patents/intellectual property rights for people’s medical inventions.
15) If you want a true free market, you have to eliminate government currency, courts, and property rights as well.What if I told you there was a machine that could create fascists, incels, nazis and insane people? What if I told you that this machine could pass amongst humans? It wears the same clothes we wear, eats the same food, works at our workplaces and attends our churches.


Of course, the monsters that I am talking about is the despicable single mother. Hitler was raised by a single mother the man who allegedly according to some sources perpetrated the holocaust of the Jewish people. Hitlers father died when he was only 14, imagine if his father died even earlier he may have killed even more jews!


Recently I've noticed a trend of single mothers trying to concentrate their malevolence even further. Sometimes two Lesbian single mothers will try to trick a man into impregnating one of them or they will try to adopt. I can only imagine what hell we're in for in the future when the product of TWO single mothers begins his genocide...
I used to work in OH-12 until about a year ago, and lived just on the other side of the border with OH-3. Based on my time there, I have some insights on today's election results:

- OH-12 has been reliably Republican for decades, previously held by Governor Kasich. Both Romney and Trump won it by 11 points. That 11 point gap was almost completely closed today. That should be celebrated.

- The district is very gerrymandered. O'Connor won only Franklin County - actually, only part of it. The county is split between OH-3 and OH-12, and the very liberal Ohio State campus is on the District 3 side (represented by a Democrat). The rest of District 12 is rural, and all other counties went for Balderson. While Balderson's slight at Franklin rightly drove Democratic turnout, a look at the district map will show that Franklin is barely part of the district, so he had a point.

- Balderson owes his win to Kasich, not Trump. Reportedly, Trump was not actually invited to hold a rally this past weekend. He endorsed the wrong person on Twitter last week, and insulted the state's most beloved sports icon. Trump did everything to mess up this special election, so he should not get any credit. His base would have shown up regardless of his involvement.

- The seat is up again in November, so we have another and maybe even a *better* shot in just three short months. This small of a loss should mobilize Democratic voters. If the tariffs continue to hurt farmers in the rural counties, it could flip or depress some of the conservative/blue collar votes in those areas. That could be wishful thinking on my part, but we'll see what happens.

Thoughts? They are the worst undermines of the opposition comparable to the milquetoast civility police embodied by Chuck and Nancy.!they are completely lacking in moral clarity and will gladly enable Trump for money or ideology, some are Russian assets like Max Blumenthal. Others are useful idiots like Kyle Kulinski. They need to lose their credibility to save this country come 2020. Any ideas?I’m finding it difficult to navigate the varying viewpoints of ESEA Title I, Funds Follow the Student, and ESSA Weighted Student Funding. I’d appreciate seeing this objectively discussed below as well as in a segment on the show. I don't know if David accepts these requests, but I have a one:
Eleanor Goldfield (She does Common Censored with Lee Camp)So I was listening to the voicemail David covered on the show about the guy who wanted to join the Marines.  I was in the Navy for six years, and based on accounts I've read, I can offer some additional information:

Pros:
The GI Bill is a very good thing towards getting your college degree.  If you have the opportunity while in service, take advantage of the time in to get some college credit.  Also, there are programs such as USMAP you can use to get credit towards a journeyman's license in certain fields:

https://usmap.netc.navy.mil/usmapss/static/index.htm
It also looks good on the resume overall.  Individual states also offer benefits to citizens who join in their particular states, whether to the vets themselves, or their progeny.

Cons:  The obvious is that if you are in a combat role is dying.  The not so obvious is PTSD.  It would be in your interest to read accounts of soldiers who have this condition and understanding how their lives have been affected.  There isn't much in the way of reintegrating people into society who have PTSD, or it's not uniform.  Also, there is a strong antiliberal/antiprogressive sentiment in the service.  When I was in, there was a lot of homophobia/toxic masculinity.  I'm not sure that it has changed that much since I was in.  I was also on a sub, so it was almost exclusively male.

Be sure to document any treatment you receive in the service, as that can be used after you get out to determine the amount of disability you receive from your service.News and politics can be draining, I was wondering what people like to do here for fun. I basically live on the internet myself when I'm not working or with my friends, but I wanna know what the rest of you are interested in.I remember David recommending Making a Murderer when it came out and since its release I've been completely captivated by the story and its weird twist and turns. Ive even read the court transcripts and been active on the MAM sub for a long time.  

And there is one thing I find fascinating. A lot of the people who argue Avery is guilty seem to be republican voters or even Trump supporters, and the people who find Avery innocent seem to lean towards the left. 

Im of course leaning left politically and also believe Avery is innocent. But why do we keep dividing us in the same political groups, even though topics like these have nothing to do with being a democrat or republican? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyESeRByVrAI been listening to The David Pakman Show for over 2 years now. I love his show. I think he's smart, reliable, and honest and I look forward to a new episode each day. But when it came to Hatriot Mail, I had this funny idea and began wondering...

What if some of those hatriot mails were written by David and Pat themselves just to troll us listeners? 😆😆😆So I was reading this article on Vox about Twitter's unwillingness to do anything about Alex Jones' content on their platform:

https://www.vox.com/2018/8/8/17662774/twitter-alex-jones-jack-dorsey

Maybe it's just time to be done with Twitter.  I'm not sure how many people use it, but I think it has lead to an erosion in discourse.  I don't really use it myself, but it seems that it has devolved into a toxic cesspool for both sides of the political spectrum.  Has anyone's mind actually been changed or enlightened by a twitter thread?The anniversary of the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville Virginia, where neo-nazis and assorted fascists committed despicable acts of violence and domestic terrorism, culminating in the death of Heather Heyer, is this weekend. And to celebrate this anniversary, and the continued rise of fascism in America, there is going to be a Unite The Right rally number 2 this weekend in Washington DC. The fascists are bringing their display to the president that gave them support and empowerment after their acts of violence and domestic terrorism last year. 

I'm curious what people think is going to happen? There has been warm up rallies across the US, and now we are going to have the main event this weekend. 

It will surely be another black mark on the history of the US. I think violence is guaranteed to happen. 

In case anyone hasn't yet seen this, or is interested, this is a very good documentary that was just recently released on the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville Virginia last year. Very much worth watching.  

https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/documenting-hate-charlottesville/A German news outlet reported today that the pharma company got notice that the officials for the execution got hold of one of their products violating existing deals. How the state of Nebraska got the poisonous substance is not clear yet.
Here is the German article: https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/pharmakonzern-fresenius-kabi-will-hinrichtung-in-den-usa.1939.de.html?drn:news_id=912500Why the hunger?

Is food production field area smaller, food yield per area smaller or food sold to export for money?

If yield per area is smaller, does climate change or bad luck with weather have some part in it? Some new plant bug? Failure to use pesticides / anti-bug chemicals? Lack of fertilizers? 

Field chemicals used in wrong times because of incompetent government orders?

Field chemical production lacking because some chemical plants wore out / got broken or competent chemists and engineers fled or retired?

Some field chemicals need oil for raw material and that oil is stolen? by government officials?

Tractors in disrepair / broken? 

Cows treated incompetently because government placed wrong people or not enough people with them?

Is the government trying to hide the exact reasons, trying to make it difficult to figure out? If so, does it itself know the reasons? 

I heard some claim that government is using hunger for power. How does that work? What does that mean?

Satellite pictures can tell about fields and possibly about field chemical production facilities. Maybe some journalists on the ground have figured it out and I just haven't heard about it?

DP should have a 15 minute segment about this.If you have an system for social media sites to choose to be regulated by the government then I think the sites might sometimes choose it. If a site chooses to be regulated then they should get the people who want that. The ones that don't choose regulation will get the user who don't trust the government so much. If a site chooses regulation or not they should be granted the ability to wear their choice like a badge and market them selves that way. They could market to specific demographics that way. See what I mean? Any questions?Have you ever seen public school textbooks on climate science that don't mention human factors?

I knew he would be thrilled, thrilled milquetoast loser centrists won the day, because that how much of a weak crippled man he is.  I know David loves this guy, but he sometimes annoys the hell out of me.He has a point. It is a slippery slope for him. He is a conspiracy nutjob that says that Syrian chemical attacks were false flags, Clinton Foundation which the Clintons receive $0 from is a bribery scheme (it’s actually most likely the best charity in the entire world, better than the Carter Center), etc. He SHOULD be next, right after Jimmy Dore gets banned from YouTube!Do you ever get what you would consider to be hatriot mail from people that seem to be on the left? All of your hatriots appear to be right wingers, and I'm wondering if left leaning people also send hate mail, and at what rate compared to right leaning people. 

Idea for new segment: As an inverse to hatriot mail, feature criticisms from the left, and address their criticisms in a serious way.13 Reasons why Trump is scarier than Pence:

1. He seems to be the most brazen right-enabling President in recent American history anyway. He lets the theocratic right pass or do whatever they want. If the main issue David has with Pence is that he's a committed right wing ideologue, whereas Trump isn't, I don't see why that's much more dangerous than an opportunistic non-ideologue that lets ideologues do whatever they want anyway. Indeed, on a basic ethical level, it's even *more* cynical and evil than being a committed ideologue because you're willing to enable dangerous ideology for personal gain, which is just an extra layer of odiousness and distaste. 
2. He is (very likely) a true malignant narcissist and sociopath with nuclear weapons at his disposal.
3. He is a naked authoritarian rabble rouser that repeatedly promotes violence at his rallies (something Pence isn't prone to do: [https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/mike-pence-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-election-2016/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/mike-pence-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-election-2016/index.html))
4. He threatens war, and even nuclear war, on Twitter -- something I don't see Pence doing.
5. He's got a charisma and cult of personality that Pence lacks, and this is particularly instrumental in rousing the alt-right, neo-fascists, and neo-Nazis.
6. His assault on the concept of the truth itself, with gibberish and lies and gaslighting, are at a rate unheard of in American history. You have to look at fascist, communist,  and/or authoritarian countries to even see anything similar, and frankly I think Trump is a gaslighting gibberish spewer even beyond the likes of some of these fascist leaders. I think the sheer volume of these lies and misleading statements are something unique to a personality like Trump and not something Pence would be as effective at, let alone attempt.
7. His conflicts of interest dwarf any that Pence would have.
8. There's mounting evidence that Trump is in the pocket of Russian oligarchs, a national security concern that a President Pence would lack.
9. Trump's extreme assault on our allies around the world seems unlikely to come from Pence (and seems suspiciously Kremlin-directed, especially on the subject of NATO).
10. I doubt Pence would issue all these irrational tariffs. 
11. I doubt Pence would attack private citizens and businesses he doesn't like on Twitter.
12. I doubt Pence would call the free press "the enemy of the people" and assault the free press to this degree.
13. Trump's open lust for dictatorship is something, again, we have no inkling of from Pence.

The only point that I believe is arguable on David's view is that Trump is so scandalous that his scandals get in the way of doing real legislative damage. But the damage already done with just executive orders, not to mention legislation and Supreme Court picks, is horrific enough, and the potential damage from a nutcase, dictator-wannabe like Trump to me is beyond any conceivable damage Pence could do. Imagine another 9/11 happening and the subsequent stripping of civil liberties and police/surveillance state. Who would you be more comfortable with at the helm of that, Trump or Pence?

As odious as Pence is (and he is *extremely* odious), it's beyond clear at this point, to me at least, that Trump is far more dangerous. 

Any counter-arguments?Inequality hurts and distorts societies.
1) Societies and nations perish when the rich avoid taxes.
2) Rich societies are often learning-resistant despite crises and contradictions.
3) Without a social contract, we become wolves to each other.
4) Christianity stands and falls with social justice and the eschatological reign of God. Social justice makes life human and worthwhile and is not a mere decoration.
more at www.citizen.org and www.freembtranslations.netIn a German article, I read German GDP went up 30% from 1970 to 2016 with 30% fewer workers. Is this true?
Computerization, info technology, robotization and better trained workers have led to greater productivity.
Reduced working hours could be a socio-economic investment bringing better long-term health and more time sovereignty.

marc1seed@yahoo.comThe bank crisis became a state revenue crisis. The state that made itself poor by injecting $18 trillion into "too-big-to-fail" banks made private risks into public risks. Now Republican fearmongers Ryan &amp; Co. are threatening cuts to food stamps, social security, Medicaid and Medicare, third-rails of our country. The GOP tax heist gave $5 trillion to households with more than a million dollars income. Did Voodoo economics become the new normal or moral cowardice and fear?

https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2015/07/14/18774873.phpI love my country for the most part and most of the time. But as a child I was forced to make this ridiculous pledge to a country which does not assure liberty and justice for all and does not exist under any God. I hope Trump hears of this decision and rants about it on twitter just for laughs.So again, he spends 25 minutes screaming this is an attack on free speech and that Facebook and YouTube have a monopoly. And that they need to be regulated, etc...

Im seriously starting to doubt if he is deliberately clueless, or actually clueless. 

Again, this is NOT a grey area. Alex Jones directly and deliberately lied about massacre victims, and as a direct result these people have been harassed and stalked. And as a direct result of his deliberate lies, a guy went into a normal pizza restaurant with a rifle, because Alex told him there was a pedophile sex ring operating in their basement. 

This is not censorship of free speech. Its a cooperation deciding not to publicize material that is clearly untrue, dangerous, violent and defamatory. 

And Facebook/YouTube does NOT have a monopoly. Corporations like these come and go. Like Myspace. Just because they are BIG right now, does not equal a monopoly. Any day a new corporation with a better service or idea can kick them off of the throne. That is how the system works. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgB-pmwlwDw[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qMBbOKsGAk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qMBbOKsGAk)I am not well-enough traveled to know this, but I am very interested to knowWould you like to see a David Pakman and Alex Jones collab? (vote below)I'm not a mod here, but I think it should be a rule that you can't just post an article or a video without comment. At the very least, if you are posting the article or video in support of a position you hold or a proposition, 1) Tell us what that position or proposition is, and 2) Include quotes from that article or timestamps from the video that support your position or proposition. Don't just post an article or a video link without comment. It's very lazy! If you’re for outlawing libel, slander, death threats, incitements to violence and yelling fire in a theater, then you are NOT a free speech absolutist. And if you read the first amendment with a literal interpretation, all of that is legal and constitutional. How does extending that to hate speech make it a “slippery slope” when hate speech is proven to lower lifespans, increase blood pressure, decrease productivity and test scores, etc. Almost every developed country other than America outlaws hate speech. What is wrong with that? It doesn’t lead to a slippery slope. And who gets to decide what speech to outlaw in that case? The people, it’s called a democracy. 
I’m not for outlawing hate speech by the way. Please don’t respond with hypotheticals and your theories of how hate speech laws would go wrong. I could theorize how Trump could use libel and slander laws against his opponents, it doesn’t actually happen. I want to know specifically what is wrong with hate speech laws in western democracies like Canada that already have them. Additionally, when you look at ideological scoring on free speech of judicial appointments, you will see that liberal justices place the least restrictions on free speech and that conservative Justices place the greatest government restrictions on free speech.As America should be waking up to, fascists are about to march in the streets in Washington DC, and Charlottesville Virginia, to celebrate the 1 year anniversary death of Heather Heyer, and continue their campaign of violence, which is well documented by a recent Frontline documentary by A.C.Thompson. 

https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/documenting-hate-charlottesville/

As some may or may not know, in organizational security, the insider is the biggest threat, as they are trusted, and are granted elevated privleges within the organization for greater access to assets. 

The right wing white nationalist groups in this country know all too well about the threat of insiders, but yet they keep falling victim because the insder threat is so hard to protect against, and people keep successfully infiltrating their groups and gaining privileged access. Not only do these fascist groups have to worry about the infiltration of federal agents into their ranks, but they also have to worry about Antifa. And of course the difference between feds and Antifa, is feds don't tell the public who they're investigating. Antifa outs nazis. 

The organizers of Unite The Right 2 have failed at their opsec, in a hilariously childish way: by organizing on facebook group chats. A mole was under foot, and their communications have been leaked. 

Here are some highlights: 

&gt; McCormick H Foley: Wait a minute you guys want non-white speakers?

&gt;Jason Kessler: A couple wouldn’t hurt. It would give us political cover to bring on (David) Duke

(group discussing Mind of Jamal as a non white speaker) 

&gt;Kat Snyder: Excellent speaker. And Jovi is not white of course.... When I saw him speak, he crushed Antifa. Amazing speaker.

&gt;McCormick H Foley: Yeah I know who he is.. and I can understand. I mean you guys are white nationalist essentially. Little bit different for me being a Neo-Nazi to accept

&gt;Jason Kessler: These are very difficult decisions. I’m not interested in having anyone but pro-white or pro-monument speakers. Being a (fill in the blank here) conservative speaker is not enough. However I would consider a couple of non white who have genuinely important pro-white messages if it makes it easier to balance out (David) Duke
...

&gt; Jason Kessler: This isn’t a “conservative” event. It’s pro-white, America First. There are only certain nonwhites who would fit, or even want to come
...

&gt;Al Stankard: @Dave Shyne and McCormick: You think optics isn't important? Is the point of this rally to just express ourselves for hoots, or is to push the goal post further with regards to equal rights for whites? As I understand it, Jason is trying to change things, not merely meet up and have a good time. And by optics, were talking not about having beach bodies and expensive clothes, but looking like non-shitty humans with legitimate grievances. Are we on the same page?

&gt; Dave Shyne: Yes, we are on the same page.

&gt;McCormick H Foley: I think Optics is somewhat important.

&gt;Eva Gunther: It is important

&gt;Kat Snyder: Perception is reality

&gt;Al Stankard: Optics is the entire thing.
...

&gt; Jason Kessler: It might not be “politically correct” within the Alt Right but I think if we delivered our message with a few nonwhites speaking it would open a lot more minds. Potentially millions. Getting the American public to love white people again is huge. We are good people.
....

&gt;McCormick H Foley: We're coming with some of our Hammer skin friends.

&gt;McCormick H Foley: @Anita Gunter don't let the Jew ..trick you..ANTIFA has their shit together. Praying and hoping for the best butt to be honest with you we are ready for the worst
.....

&gt;Rickey Entwisle: Yall need a professional security team or?

&gt;Dave Shyne: We've got pros. We need more though, for sure.

&gt;Dave Shyne: We don't really need anymore people with security backgrounds. Just strong men who can follow orders.

&gt;McCormick H Foley: How big and strong do you want guys ?

&gt;Dave Shyne: @McCormick H Foley obviously I'd like them to be big guys, but more than anything we need cool head that can take orders from the Team Leaders.

&gt;McCormick H Foley: I'm pretty big myself. 5-11 200 play football for many years... I can bench-press a small car... I've been hit on the football field. Bye guys 285

&gt;Dave Shyne: @McCormick H Foley I'll be in touch with you again soon.

&gt;McCormick H Foley: You got it brother like I said as long as I can stay at least somewhat close to my Vanguard.

&gt;Dave Shyne: @McCormick H Foley How many guys do you have coming?

&gt;McCormick H Foley: If we fully commit between us and maybe a few hammerskins. 7 to 15

&gt;Dave Shyne: Ok. How many are vets?

&gt;McCormick H Foley: Quite a few actually. We are paramilitary + neo-Nazi

&gt;Jason Kessler: This is absolutely the wrong kind of thing ti be talking about on Facebook

&gt;McCormick H Foley: It's not like nobody knows

&gt;Jason Kessler: This is not a paramilitary event and we are currently being sued for a similar thing

&gt;McCormick H Foley: Trust me I deal with ANTIFA.. on some level almost every weekend. 

&gt;Jason Kessler: Please be selective about what you put in the chat though

&gt;Dave Shyne: I am asking about veterans for hands off security, Police Liaisons and surveillance. @McCormick H Foley I like you dude, but you've got to be smarter about what you say here or else you'll be booted. This is a non violent event. We don't need or want militia/Paramilitary types running around in level 3 Body Armor and Rifles. It sends the wrong message.

&gt;McCormick H Foley: Lol... we're not coming in body armor
...

&gt;Kat Snyder: Shouldn’t you all be chatting on that secure messenger you asked us to download?

&gt;Danny Wolf: I'm DLing now, never used it before

&gt;McCormick H Foley: There any people listening probably ANTIFA

8-14-18 edit: There have been some major updates to this story.

https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/978ea0/alabama_police_officer_dating_and_organizing_with/In this convoluted case the former officer has paid partial restitution, is no longer able to serve in law enforcement and has likely promised to get on with his family life. His defense attorney stated that this 'stiff' sentence was unfairly harsh since he was a police office and that an average citizen would likely have gotten ARD. Welcome to rural America. The judge's decision sounds o.k. but not for his given reasons. Since when are cops and 'family' men different than everyone else in the eyes of the law?  For far too long. Satellites for taking photos, satellites for intercepting radio and radar signals and GPS satellites usually get launched with air force rockets. Those functions might get a new fancy name and some new logos, nothing of substance. Then trump can brag endlessy about that "new force" or "new branch"... Maybe it is good that he has a distraction from bad things he could be doing...

I'm looking to donate to the show, but I don't want to use USD. I want to donate in Monero. Can the DPS implement cryptocurrency donations? It takes under 5 minutes. Would be willing to guide you every step of the way.

ThanksI used to like this guy. I’m listening to him on the Joe Rogan experience right now and it seems like he has gone down a crazy road. He’s claimed that Israel’s “interference” in our politics should be a priorairy, not Russia (citing Chomsky, and i think that when you look at when Chomsky says it, you should know the context of Chomsky’s thought and know what Chomsky means) because Netanyahu addressed congress. In doing this, he ignores that Israel is an ally and did this *openly*, so that all Americans could draw whatever conclusions they would from it, whereas the Russians - our longest running geopolitical foe - *subverted our democratic process covertly*. That’s a HUGE difference. 

He additionally is claiming that there’s a bill in congress that would make cops a protected class so that any protest against cops would be outlawed, and is using this as a way of shitting on the concept of hate speech itself. I don’t know the particulars about this bill, but I know that a. It has no chance of passing, and b. It’s almost certainly just some dipshit GOP lawmaker putting on an act to show to their constituents just how much they *love* the cops. 

This isn’t even half of what he’s said that’s straight crazy and I’m about 45 minutes in. What happened to this guy?straight liberals need to fucking cut it out with their obssession with calling right wing men they hate gay, it's insulting as fuck to gay men. for example the amount of straight liberals that are so delusional on this issue that they've actually convinced themselves that pence is  a gay guy(despite the fact there isn't a shred of evidence for that) is mind boggling. mike pence is a bigted straight guy that hates us, stop trying to pawn off bigotry against us onto us ourselves as if we're responsible for persecuting ourselves and straight men have nothing to do with it, it's fucking sick
Living in Boston I was excited about Charlie Baker signing the automatic voter registration in Massachusetts. I shared this with my father-in-law ( he voted for Trump both in the primary and in the general, even though he was a pretty big Bernie fan) all he had to say was now that the illegals can vote. 

I had to explain to him it’s more about young people fresh out of high school not knowing about the voting process or other people who haven’t joined and they wouldn’t be locked out of the voter process anymore. 

So annoying that people think these illegals have so much power over their daily lifes! Meanwhile the corporations that got the tax cuts are the ones hiring these illegals in the first place! The propaganda from the right wing talking about how the illegals are everything wrong in the country is so stupid and the fact normal people who are generally kind can be so stupid when it comes to blatant right wing propaganda it just makes me sad. Just needed to vent!

Does anyone else have family members that are blatantly ignorant about subjects and it’s hard to talk to them even though you have facts and evidence on your side it’s almost as if it doesn’t matter. Power of associations is strong, regardless of rationality. That is why advertising can be strangely effective.

Countless Youtube channels have chosen to include one video feature that makes their channel and their hosts associate with annoyance, at least to some percentage of viewers and potential viewers. Different channels make that feature annoy with different levels. This DP show does it with mid level irritation. TYT and Cenk Uygur have it really bad, as most that use it.

Before anyone thinks it, no, saying "you are too weak minded to get annoyed" or "the amount of annoyed is under 50%, so it does not matter" are not valid arguments. First is like saying "I figured out that I can refer to that irritation as getting triggered so therefore the irritation does not exist or the irritation is invalid and therefore can not have any effect on anything".

That terrible editing choice is to start an advertisement for the channel or for something else just tenth of a second after the host is finished. That is not good for the channel or for that external company's product sales, because both get associated with annoyance. Just 5 second pause before the ad would make a huge difference. Many have difficulty believing it. If you are one of them, count it as yet another strange thing in this world.

Some causes of that irritation: Ad has different speech style and speed. Many channels, like TYT, have different sound volume.

Annoying audio and video tends to get muted or paused with panic speed. That may be visible in statistics if it's done from the video interface, but not if the muting is done on the operating system level or on the physical speaker knob. Many annoyed people are not visible in stats because one video was too much and they never saw a second video.

Similar thing with video ad annotations that begin too early or even before the host is finished.Pat has been refining his shirt game, his style, swagger, and wit for long enough. .

and I get similar vibes from Davids reaction as I've had before to his... sense of actors on his general side being "unworthy"

He did not go that far with Alexandria, but because David is hyper precise and basically combs over policy issues almost daily, he expects politicians to be at the same level at all times.

I get it, but I sort of think he's expecting too much.  It's easier to use conservatives to make the point.  On the far negative end, we have Sarah Palin, whose bumbling responses actually damaged the reputation of conservative ideas in the minds of people that even some CONSERVATIVES were pissed at her.

Check out this clip of that Hoover institute guy interviewing Claire Berlinski years back who was a thatcher biographer and trying to make comparisons.

Savage.  And to her point, the person I was going to suggest at the polar opposite extreme on issue knowledge and rhetorical competence on the conservative side was Thatcher herself (calm down liberals, no one is claiming she was right, but she had mastery over issues and craft):

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okHGCz6xxiw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okHGCz6xxiw)

Thatcher is a great case because I think she had solid mastery over policy details, like David does and seems to demand in liberal candidates, but she also had something that David focuses less on, rhetorical skill and presentation of arguments.  Whether you agreed with her hand comparisons of concerns over gaps, that was an effective retort in the moment.

Alexandria is by NO MEANS closer to Sarah Palin than Thatcher.   I don't think she is Thatcher level competent on issues, but based on appearances with Kris Cuomo, she has the capacity to make solid and effective points and rebuttals.

David talked about preferring people not learn on the job.  I agree, that would be great.  We don't have that luxury, I'd prefer talent with some FIRE inside someone that was more effective as a rhetorician than someone who merely had more mastery of policy details.

Not everyone is moved by the kinds of white matter logical argumentation David gives, and prefers.  So his affinities CANNOT be the standard.  Now ideally, we'd have people who were great at everything.  But we go to war with the army we have, not the army we want.  We can all agree that the answer Corey Bush gave was not up to par.  Our people need to be more prepared for those kinds of questions and if they can't hack it, we need better.  But give people a LITTLE more slack.KKK are Republicans today. They endorsed Nixon, Goldwater, Ronald Reagan who refused to condemn the KKK and they endorsed Donald Trump. By the time the 1980s came, every single democrat voted in favor of civil rights and only Republicans voted against civil rights. Look no further than the civil rights restoration act, which only republicans voted against. It was then vetoed by the racist president Ronald Reagan, who opposed every single civil rights law/legislation. Only Republicans opposed the Community Reinvestment Act which outlawed redlining, a major civil rights legislation. Only Republicans including Ronald Reagan opposed creating Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Only Republicans opposed the Fair Housing Amendments of 1988 which were watered down in senate committee exclusively by Republicans for civil rights to only cover 80% of housing rentals in America. Only Republicans have voted against civil rights since the Community Reinvestment Act, including the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, MLK Jr. Day, South Africa apartheid bill, The Civil Rights Act of 1991, The CFPB, Lily Ledbetter, etc. KKK has endorsed Republicans since 1960 when they supported Nixon due to his stance to not use government to force businesses to desegregate (known as civil rights). Reagan supported (and fought for while in office) interracial marriage opposition groups such as Bob Jones racist church in South Carolina. Reagan fought to protect their racist bans on interracial marriage. Reagan lost at the Supreme Court, which ruled 8-1 against him. Republicans oppose the voting rights act today and refuse to reinstate it. They oppose the 1965 immigration act today and have fought to limit this immigration that does not have racial quotas. The Republican Party today is the party of slavery, with it's advocacy for the private prison slavery industrial complex, both for citizens and as a half-way house for illegal immigrants.
Additionally, all civil rights court decisions have been decided by liberal justices and racial integration was ended after Nixon turned the Supreme Court conservative in 1971. They also blocked democrats from ended property tax based education funding which was a segregationist policy and replacing it with state-level education funding. Today, once Trump gets his next conservative on the court, they will have five conservative votes to end disparate impact, the centerpiece of modern day civil rights. Black and minority liberals (as well as white Republican liberals known as Rockefeller Republicans) became Democrats and conservative whites became Republicans. This is why 70% of white people are not democrats today and why 90% of black people are. Because they switched parties.[Photo from a Beto Rally in the Government District of Dallas, Texas \(Mulligan, B.A.\)](https://i.redd.it/q6gou1plstf11.jpg)And Sanders and AOC calling themselves democratic socialists is so weird, they're not, they're using the term incorrectly. but yeah anyway, Nordic capitalism would probably sound alot better to american ears and is a way more accurate description of what they're actually advocating for than democratic socialism          Hillary would have changed the Supreme Court from conservative to liberal, which it hasn’t been since 1971. EVERY court decision that established corporatism and decimated unions was decided exclusively by Republican/conservative Justices. The judicial nominees that Democrats (Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and yes, Hillary Clinton) have supported and picked not only would repeal Citizens United, but Buckley v Valeo and would reinstate the full separation of corporations and politics that was briefly law after Nixon resigned and we passed anti-corruption laws (which was thrown out by CONSERVATIVE Justices solely).
          This is an attempt of David to claim both sides are equal, when they are NOT. It’s a neutrality bias or just ignorance on his part. Very disappointing! David is usually a good commentator that knows his facts.
[Look at David’s delusions here!!!](https://youtu.be/ChnDDtpUigI) 

          Also, Hillary turning the court liberal would not just create a wall of separation between politicians and corporations, but would instate cars check and unionize all workplaces by majority vote, finish racial integration which was stopped in 1971 by the conservative court, end property-tax based education which the conservative court blocked democrat’s lawsuit that would have made all education be funded at the state level (and federal) and not by property taxes because that is and was a segregationist policy, would end the death penalty, end mandatory minimums, expand Medicaid in all states etc. The list is almost endless. 
          To not understand the depth of loss that liberals and America is suffering because Hillary did not get elected makes me lose a lot of respect for David. To David’s points, Democrats are HURT by the status quo of corporate power in politics. It directly skews resources and propaganda to help Republicans. here's the vid

His point about christians isn't very good, he started talking about US christians when the issue was Uk muslim beliefs and asked "how many christians think being gay should be illegal"(for the record 23% of americans think  same sex relations should be illegal) and then he also made a point about opposition to marriage among christians which I think is sort of missing the point, being against gay marriage is nowhere even close to the depravd level of bigotry of literally thinking being gay should be a crime, which is what 52% of muslims in the UK think. and on his question of "how many christians want to ban homosexuality?" in the Uk it is very, very few, whereas the majority of muslims think it should be illegal.he didn't really explain his reasoning why the point about not allowing mass immigration of people that oppose "western" values such as basic human rights for gay people is wrong

I posted this cause his answer seemed a bit wishy washy or whatever and I think the left really needs to start doing a better job of adressing the extreme social regressivness among muslims, cause right now the dominant position seems to be ignoring it or obfuscating and that feeds into the right wing, there is serious issues with muslim integration in Europe and if the left fails to address the issue with nuance it will empower the right. a good illustration of left wing failure to adress muslim homophobia is, I was on the UK politics sub trying to discuss this, and was pointing out how insanely and horrificly anti gay muslims are here in the UK and just for pointing that out was being accused of being an anti muslim bigot, and accused of saying bigoted shit against them, even though all I done was point out the majority of them literally think my existence should be a crime, but somehow in that situation I, the gay man whos existence they think should be a crime was the bigot. when a social democrat gay guy is being accused of being an anti muslim bigot for pointing out and condemning that the majority of muslims literally think my fucking existence should be a crime you know something is going terribly wrong, it's actually sickening that those accusations would even be made considering the reality of the situation

This post might be a bit of a rant but I just wanted to throw some thoughts out and start a discussion about these issues. Do you agree that the left needs to do a better job at confronting regressive muslim social views? cause we/they seem 100% able to do that with christians but when it comes to muslims they are definetely holding back and not fighting as hard as when it's christians on these issues. and how do you think this should be tackled?As adults we might forget how impressionable we were as children and that inscribed mottoes such as this can hold power over us. Children are taught to respect adults, authority and proclamations.  How many elementary students will find themselves coerced by peer pressure if not by teachers and principals to not question the proclamation on their school's wall? This is a very bad thing.

It literally makes people think we have a three party system/options and that they actually have a choice to elect Jill Stein or whatever other unqualified idiot they like.

Not to mention that it’s a form of escapism from getting involved and using organized movements such as interest groups and voting to enact change in a democracy. Not voting for an idiot and de facto not voting at all.Palestinians refused Israeli citizenship in 1948 and have been fighting for secession ever since. They share most beliefs on social issues with confederates and are to the right of Israel.

I do not support a two-state solution. I believe in a one-state solution with a very limited federal government. The two provinces of Israel and Palestine should govern themselves on almost all issues. But they should not have two states and they should share a military, to protect each other from each other and the Palestinians from other actors that could decimate them if Palestinians were on their own.&amp;#x200B;I have a lot of respect for Nancy Pelosi as a politician but right now she is seriously jeopardizing the midterms for the Democrats by running for Speaker of the House.

The Blue Wave is obviously not something Democrats should take for granted because like the 2016 election this one may come down to the independents aka swing voters and by knowing that she may be the Democratic House Speaker, we could lose tons of votes. The stakes are to high and we can’t offord to be taking any more risks. Worst of all if we will have to deal with a Republican Congress for another four years and Trump will never shut up about it. Democrats cant go on with the same leadership we have had since the Obama Presidency.

David, you need to apologize! Very offensive!John McCain will live on in our thoughts! His commitment to the enforcement of human rights and international law should be remembered and embraced by all! He pushed the ideology of liberal internationalism, NOT neoconservatism. He shared foreign policy views with FDR, Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Thank you for your service to not just our country, but our world. Rest In Peace, John McCain!As I understand it, socialism is meant to democratise, humanise, and rationalise economic relations, largely eliminating the undermining of democracy, the facilitation of exploitation, the unfair distribution of opportunities and resources, the vitiation of community, and the stunting of self-realization and human development, all of which are problems inherent (according to socialist thought) within capitalism. Socialism then, it appears to me, is inherently democratic. Therefore, "democratic socialism" is  tautologous. It is like saying "widow woman".

Sure, "socialism" has largely been demonised in North America. And although it is now experiencing something of a rehabilitation, it appears supporters of socialist ideals would rather add the word "democratic" to "socialism", than just rescue the word "socialism", much in the same way that libertarians abandoned the term "liberal" and opted instead for "libertarian".We haven’t had a Keynesian stimulus like the last budget since the stimulus. It’s unbelievable that this isn’t mentioned in news reports about the economy. If Trump cut spending, like Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush did, it would directly harm the economy as opposed to how Nixon, Reagan, and W. Bush used Keynesian spending bills to stimulate the economy using deficits and debt.We outlaw incest and we cite the genetic health of the offspring (studies show it increases risk of extreme abnormalities around 4% for a first-cousin marriage but each generation of incest compounds it). This is undeniably a form of eugenics.

We also stop prisoners from procreating and from what I have read this was first put into place from the understanding of eugenics, that “undesirable” male criminals should not procreate with “undesirable” female criminals. This is undeniably a form of eugenics as well.

I like to think that I don’t believe in eugenics, but I am opposed to incest, although I do not want it to be a felony. 

We also allow people to sterilize themselves (get a vasectomy), to take birth control and to get abortions, based upon the idea that they own their own body and that no one, including another person including a fetus, has a right to someone else’s body. This is technically a form of eugenics. 

Most of us think of eugenics as forced sterilization and/or extermination. But it does not just cover that. It covers all methods of controlling reproduction to ensure a better genetic pool is in the next generation. 

For reference, it was the conservative Supreme Court in 1927 that fully legalized eugenics, including forced sterilization and it was partially reversed by the new deal Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has never fully rebutted eugenics in terms of it’s legality. The last legal forced sterilization was in 1981 from what I read. Although sterilization of prisoners occurred under Governor Schwarzenegger from 2006 to 2010, which was just a rogue prison, not a policy of the governor.The shot was fired by police. I can't provide a link to this story as it is only available to purchasers or subscribers to the paper I read daily. I'll keep watching televised news broadcasts to see if they cover the story.

This was disappointing for me, since I support the war. But nevertheless, either these people are ignorant or they can’t accept that he changed his mind. Similar to Hillary changing her mind in 2013, long after the public turned against the war. She didn’t change with public opinion, she genuinely changed her mind. Similar to Bobby Kennedy changing his mind on his initial support for the war in Vietnam. But many on the left who opposed Hillary couldn’t be honest about her change of position and had to use a lie of deception to argue that Hillary was “for the war” No where can I find this term defined as having any relation to race. 'Monkey up' means to screw up. Would you also consider the phrase 'throwing a monkey wrench into something' as a racial reference? I know a lot of us whites who have thrown monkey wrenches into things and monkeyed things up. Your critique of the man's utterance of this term is understandable re his history, but implying that the term itself is racist is a stretch. Its like accusing someone for using the n-word when they really didn't. I don't know who or what gave you the impression that this is a good idea. **I hope you're not inspired by the major news networks on TV for running muted video footage, which only distracts your audience from paying attention to your commentary.

**when politics and partisan positioning appears to take precedence over national security; the Democrats and Republicans are so worried about each other as adversaries that they can’t get around the idea that there is a bigger adversary.**

Answer: 

1) Obama administration feared to be seen as (and accused of) influencing election themselves by attributing hacking to the Russian government 

2) Obama administration's complacency: they expected that Hillary would win the election and wanted to Hillary Clinton to deal with the problem after she took office 

3) Obama administration has a habit of overthinking 

4) Partisan Positioning. The Republican party in Congress thought it was a trick that Obama deployed to jeopardize the chances of Republican Party wining the election. Yep, here we go again.

I know David Pakman has brought up this issue numerous times, but I think it's illustrative to see the hypocrisy in video:

Fox News shows how not to politicize a tragedy
ISIS and other groups have unleashed a Pandora's box contents of evil ideology on the world. A war against such which can not be won but only contained, incident by incident. Bigger military, travel bans, stronger punishments for offenders only feed the appetites of the terrorists.  Totally illegitimate?  Someone reasonable some of the time?  Ought to be a major consideration?

This seems to be a major sticking point of the right and other groups I see as part of larger anti immigrant reactionary movements.  My question is whether that fact makes the entire concept toxic to you and illegitimate or if you find some of the concerns completely valid?

For myself, I don't care at all about whether the country of my birth, the US, remains majority white or not.  That means literally nothing to me and it makes me deeply suspicious of people where that is a concern.  I'm not white so I suppose that makes sense, but even if I was, I'd hope that would not be some sticking point for me.  

But I do have other criteria that would make me uneasy.  I am an atheist, and think all religion is fantasyville.  But I am in the general Sam Harris camp that is more hostile to Islam based on the actions of many of its adherents in modern times.  I can't bring myself to jump on the Cenk/TYT bandwagon and presume that all religions are basically the same and equally bad, or that the differences we see have less to do with doctrinal differences and more to do with external factors.

I can see that sentiment inside myself bleed over into my attitudes towards muslims, though I try to restrain it.  But I confess, I am not fond of seeing a woman walking by wearing a Hijab as it suggests increased representation of a belief system I find more antagonistic towards many of my ideals.  I have no such feelings for anyone in Buddhist or Hindu garb.  I know muslims personally, one an indian muslim who is an absolute fucking delight to be around and I share more camaraderie with him than most of my other friends and family because of shared attitudes and interests.

I think that last is how it's supposed to be.  I subscribe to that way of putting it by Ali Rizvi:

"The left is wrong on Islam. The right is wrong on Muslims."

The idea being that the left is too soft on Islam as a set of ideas, while the right is wrong about their views of muslims as people and individuals.

But the cultural concerns do not go away entirely for me.  If we (The US - and yes, I know we are not doing that) were to hypothetically start accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees into the US from muslim countries, that would cause some anxiety in me.  Not because I think all muslims are bad, I don't, because I think people come with all sorts of baggage.  Some good, some bad, and my impression is that Islam as a belief system saddles people with more negative baggage than many other religious ideologies.  That does not mean being being muslim = bad person, I don't believe that, it's more of a sense of a numbers game.

If we let in a large number of muslims, that often have very illiberal beliefs, will that not change the culture in ways many of us as liberals would find... problematic?  

Or do you find the question itself a sign of my own corruption and moral failings?  Just asking. This was the first time I watched this show. I could hardly believe my ears !!!Sorry about the lack of organization in this post. There are just a lot of scattered thoughts.

# Russian government had plenty of time for hacking and timely release to damage Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party 

It was clear to anyone watching politics that Hillary Clinton was going run for presidency in 2016 and very likely to be the nominee. Therefore, the hackers was trying to hack in well in advance, and they succeeded into hacking DNC servers in 2015. And John Pedesta (Hillary Clinton's campaign chair)'s email account was hacked in March 2016. 

The Russian government obviously had a lot of dirt on Trump even before he decided to run for the presidency, given how closely he is with Russian oligarchs who use Trump as money laundering. And the Russian government was helping Trump all along. Trump was already the front runner among GOP candidates by July of 2015. 

# Why Russia didn't succeed in meddling the French election

Some possible reasons that Russia was much less successful in influencing the French election was that French election is much more dynamic: there were many parties in very close contest. There was no clear front runner in run-up to the first round. (there are two rounds of elections, first run pick the top two candidates; the second run is a contest between the top two.) Also, the election season was very short in French elections. Therefore, there was much less time for targeting, and hacking and releasing hacked information; there was less chance to meddle elections. These are certain some lessons US can learn from it (but probably won't). 

# Damaging the Democratic Party and helping Trump 

It is unclear whether Russian hackers got into the RNC servers, and how much information were obtained if they did. If the Russian government got dirt on the RNC, I speculate that the Russian government would hold RNC hostage, but only released emails of the DNC to sow discord within the Democratic Party and also help defeat Hillary Clinton (if possible). And it didn't help the emails provided the evidence that Hillary Clinton was colluding with DNC to skew the primary election in her favor, as it would further the narrative of Russian propaganda. 

Because there were no leaks from the RNC but a lot of leaks from the DNC creates the perception that the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton are more corrupt than the Republican Party. Again, we don't know if this contrast is by design or just a coincidence. 

The possibility that Russia may have dirt on the Republican Party (which is definitely far more corrupt than the Democratic Party) might be one of the reasons that the Republican leadership refuse to knowledge that the Russian government was meddling with the election. However, there are other reasons are 

1) they thought Obama administration was paying politics with the intelligence report to damage Republican chances to win the election. 

2) the intelligence report would certain damage the reputation of the party and at least the party nominee and thus their chances of winning. 

## the role of wikileaks

After the emails were hacked, they were strategically released by Wikileaks, which has a long standing relationship with the Russian government. See more information here:

**Even though Wikileaks has ostensibly asked for Trump's tax returns, I doubt that Wikileaks would release the tax returns even if the organization has it. This is because Wikileaks is working with the Russian government, which supports Trump. And of course, to this way, we still have his full tax returns from recent years.** 

## The propaganda information flow about Hillary Clinton is like this: 

1) damaging propaganda about Hillary Clinton appears on **Russian news organization**

2) the propaganda is picked up by **conspiracy theorists** such as Info Wars. 

3) then it spreads to **conservative propaganda news** organizations such as Fox News. 

4) Finally, **the mainstream media** starts to cover it to some extent. 

5) Trump campaign sometimes pick up the stories, too -- and even in one occasion pull out a story directly from Sputnik (a Russian propaganda outlet).  

6) social media spread the propaganda with bots/impostors/trolls. 

By doing so, the Russian government is able to gradually cast doubts on and damage the reputation of Hillary Clinton in the mind of people (poison the mind). Now, I don't know if Russian propaganda news, conspiracy theorists and conservative propaganda news coordinated with each other or not, or they simply pick up the stories opportunistically. 

Of course, the drip by drip release of damaging emails about Hillary Clinton greatly helps. 

# The narrative of Russian propaganda 

Besides the personal attacks against opponents in western countries, the "narrative" goal is to say that...

1) Democracy is a facade, and there is no such thing as fair election: every election is rigged and manipulated by the power to be

2) government everywhere is equally abusive and corrupt and is failing its people 

3) there is no such thing as genuine media freedom across the world. The mainstream journalists and the media in western countries are dishonest and collude with the "deep state". 

4) Truth is relative or difficult to be known 

5) Since the US has been interfering the domestic affairs of foreign countries, it's hypocritical that US accuses that Russia have been meddled American elections.  

Of course, there are varying degree of truth to most of the claims. And democracy and elections are not perfect even Western democratic countries. One good indicator is that whether it is a functioning democracy is that whether the power to be actually lose power or not. Putin, of course, has never lost power or elections. 

In addition to this "narrative" propaganda, the Russian propaganda machine and trolls spread all kinds of conspiracy theories about the US government and specific people. 

# Russian meddling of American politics will only get worse if unchecked 

Lastly, of course Russian meddling is not going away; as a matter of fact, it will only get more rampant in the upcoming elections. Trump is now the president, being very beneficiary of Russian meddling and collusion, will definitely not obstruct Putin's Russia in any way. If anything, he would encourage such activities in order to help him to win elections. If another person (not connected to the Russian government/oligarchs) was the president, this kind of activities would not go unchecked. 


I can't tell you how many times I've had to drive ALL the way to my moms house to submit a damn resume. I fill out the application on my phone, come to find out when I try to submit my resume "format not accepted." Legit, I'll just use a library computer. So I go into the library, file out the application AGAIN, then come to find out that they won't allow me to transfer my resume from google docs to the resume portion of the application. So I'm like, thanks assholes for wasting my time. I call up my mom, "hey, can I use your computer to file a job application?" "Of corse!"
I go all the way to my moms to only have enough time to fill out ONE application, I'm like cool. That is so good of you guys to waste my time like that. I'm sooo glad employers are willing to make everything as hard and inconvenient as it could possibly be to fill out a damn application. Not to mention, they didn't even review my application and already gave the job to someone else. Multiple companies, unemployment since for three months, and its driving me insane. Sometimes I think its they want me to be poor, and die in the cold. Can someone's atheism show up on a background check? I have no criminal history, wtf is wrong with these fucking employers?! 

I thought this was a "free market" where I can choose from all the available jobs. Not, "TEHEH! We'd love to waste your time, fill out this application, then come in for an interview so we can give the job to someone else, and make you feel like a loser, cause you deserve to die for not being as holy and pure as me."

I wouldn't be surprised if one day employers decided "wow, you know what would raise our profits? If we charged 5$ per application! We could make so much money! Haha, that'll teach people to stop being poor and get a job! I'm gonna be so rich, I don't give a fuck if my policy is causing you inconvenience and hardship, fuck you, and give me your damn money!" # The White House Correspondents' Association 

**"The WHCA represents the White House press corps in its dealings with the administration on coverage-related issues. A nine-member board of directors, elected by correspondents, addresses access to the chief executive; coverage arrangements; work space arrangements; logistics and costs for press travel to accompany a president on the road." 

http://www.whca.net/index.htm

The WHCA was founded on February 25, 1914, by journalists **in response to an ~~unfounded rumor~~ [I checked the source, it's NOT unfounded] that a Congressional committee would select which journalists could attend press conferences of President Woodrow Wilson.[4]**

Its most high-profile activity is the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner, which is traditionally attended by the president and covered by the news media.

## White House press credentials and the seating chart


## press credentials 

http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/06/07/can-the-white-house-revoke-a-reporters-credentials/

Can the White House Revoke a Reporter’s Credentials? Not really. 

"**To get accredited for the White House, a reporter first needs to be approved for a congressional press pass by the Standing Committee of Correspondents, elected by accredited reporters. [sounds like a Fraternity and sorority, existing members choose which newcomer can get in.]**

Among other requirements, congressional reporters must demonstrate that they work for a publication whose "principal business is the daily dissemination of original news and opinion of interest to a broad segment of the public" and is "editorially independent of any institution, foundation or interest group that lobbies the federal government." The White House also requires an additional Secret Service background check. The White House Correspondents‘ Association (WHCA), a professional association of journalists who cover the president, is not involved in the credentialing process, and White House reporters are not required to be WHCA members. [but WHCA members have to be White House reporters.]

Once you’ve got the pass, you can renew it every year without additional scrutiny. More than 2,000 reporters have "hard passes" to the White House, though the vast majority don’t work out of the building every day and the briefing room seats just 50 people, with standing room for about another 30."

# The important Seating chart, and who has the control over Q &amp; A session? 

And there is a seating chart where sitting correspondents of a particular organization are designated to particular seats. And **the seating charter is decided by the White House Correspondents' Association.** Here's 2015 seating chart for illustration: 

https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/the-white-house-press-room-seating-chart-204543]

In 2017, more conservative media outlets have more seats in the press room: 

http://thehill.com/homenews/media/340323-conservative-media-outlets-gain-seats-in-white-house-briefing-room

Conservative media outlets gain seats in White House briefing room

Obviously, which media outlets get the seats and how many seats they get and where they sit matter. Reporters in the front rows usually get called. Some organizations have to share the same section, and some organizations get kicked out. And of course, the president or whoever holds the press conference pick the reporter for answering, not the other way around. **So the control is on the person who hold the conference during questioning, not on the reporters**. And if, for example, the president doesn't like the question, he can ignore it (like Trump), or give a long-winded answer that doesn't really answer the question. And they don't often get to ask a follow-up question. As you can imagine, the atmosphere can get contentious. 

Why Fox news is there? I don't know. But my speculation is that it's a giant organization that reporters and news anchors might work for it some day. And it happens from time to time, where reporters switch to work for another media organization. 


# Criticism of White House Correspondence Dinner

The WHCD has been increasingly criticized as an example of the coziness between the White House press corps and the administration.  The dinner typically includes a skit, either live or videotaped, by the sitting president in which he mocks himself, for the amusement of the press corps. The press corps, in turn, hobnobs with administration officials, even those who are unpopular and are not regularly cooperative with the press.


Other criticism has focused on the amount of money actually raised for scholarships, which has decreased over the past few years.[16]

Press Gets Cozy at White House Correspondents Dinner

________________________________________

# Another problem: the growing trend of the administration avoiding holding press conferences: 

The following article has nothing to do with the cozy relationship between the administration and the White House correspondents. It is about the a growing trend that presidents and the administrations are increasingly avoiding press conferences as it has been done traditionally in order to hold the government accountable, in preference for direct communication to the audience on social networks (such as Youtube, Facebook, Twitter). 

By avoiding the "pesky" journalists, the administration can have more control of its message (or propaganda, if you're cynical) and avoid answering embarrassing and incisive questions. And it trend has been very apparent in Trump administration. 

The clock may have just run out on the White House press corps

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-clock-may-have-just-run-out-on-the-white-house-press-corps/2017/07/22/6053d6b4-6f13-11e7-b9e2-2056e768a7e5_story.htmlDisclaimer: this would only be applicable/useful for jobs that pay hourly as jobs that pay salary cannot be regulated with the same effect. If the employer is in charge of paying an employee hourly, that is a lot easier to regulate compared to salary jobs that pay you once a month, quarterly, whatever, as most of those jobs are sales jobs, and require you to sell a certain amount of product to keep that salary. Perhaps there is a GOOD organized labor solution to salary jobs, im working on figuring that out. 

Have a hard time looking for a job that fits your qualifications? Maybe the government should have some sort of organized labor program to substitute workers who are sick, with employees from different locations, help others struggling to find work, cut down on time wasted on applications, resolve workplace/schedule issues instead of having to deal with a douchebag boss that doesnt give a fuck if you're late to or miss school, help transfer people out of their miserable jobs from abusive coworkers so they can quit their job and find work elsewhere instantly if they become unhappy with work. 

This would be a government agency that is run by elected officials, elections happening once a year, on a basis of 250 people or less, depending on locality, work type, job status and other factors that'll determine who represents you. If your representative is a prick, you can get in contact with the others that are employed with the same representative and find a candidate that will fight for whatever issue you couldn't get resolved with the last representative. That's right, YOU can fire your boss (sorta), but you have to find someone to replace him. It's only a matter of 200 people, so it's a lot easier for people to network if they become dissatisfied with their representative. 

Here's my vision on how pay will work under a government labor agency. The corporation/ business looking to hire would pay the government for employees, then the employees would get reimbursed for their work from the government. Employees can submit their hours to a government regulated computer system that would calculate your pay. Pretty simple, and it cuts out any "funny" business that happens often regarding payment that never gets resolved such as but not limited to: clock machines that don't make it clear wether or not you were added on roll call, hours that were not accounted for, etc. If the clock machines were regulated by the government, they would clearly state that you are logged in, rather than making you guess wether or not your hours were accounted for. 

Here's how hiring employees would work:You go into the government agency, tell them your interests, experiences, education, etc and they calculate that to give you a choice between several positions that fit your needs according to what is available. If the job you are qualified for, and is your dream job (let's say you want to work at as a paralegal for example) but unfortunately is not available, as is often the case already, considering the amount of competition, they can put you on a waiting list, and find you a temporary job that gives you experience that you can use for that paralegal job, maybe some sort of office job, or legal referral service until a position is available, and you will be notified as soon as it is. Instead of looking for HOURS on end, applying to companies that may or even hire you, employers would be forced to cooperate with the government to make accommodations to disabilities, religious beliefs (for instance, some Muslims don't want to work around alcohol), and to ensure no "funny" business happens like when bigoted employers who after finding out that you are X,Y, or Z, race, sexual orientation, religion, etc suddenly don't want to give you the job because they found a "better fit." 

"That sounds horrible! How can anyone open a small business if they have to cooperate with so many government regulations?" Ah the good-ole, "but regulations are hurting small business" argument. Here's how owning a business would work under a government labor agency. First you register your business with the government, they give you whatever paper work you have to do in order to ensure healthy working conditions instead of having to go out of your way to contact multiple agencies, get several licenses and inspectors because that would be done for you by the government agency. They find you multiple selections and options for places to run your business, then you pay the government every month for employees and the lease, (much like how affordable housing is run), for the shop instead of having to go through a greedy middleman landlord who always wants to find any excuse to make you pay more on your lease. "Oh I see business is really thriving! That'll be an extra 200$ a month!" Starting a business would be so much easier with organized labor, and you would see small businesses take over towns instead of large tyrannical corporations that would love to make you work slave wages, treat their employees like animals and give you crap service in return.

You often hear conservatives, specifically libertarians say "a small government is a good government." I see business the same way. If large multiple national corporations like Walmart and Target faced an influx of small businesses, they would be run out of town from all the competition. You could employ so many more people on a local level, if production was more organized and localized. It would also create more specialized jobs particularly in this case referring food production, handling, transportation, because if those companies have to compensate for the demand of whatever commodity their customers want, more jobs will be created to make up for that demand. 

"But Trevor, some commodities can only be manufactured outside the US, like Coffee which can only be grown in Hawaii." Great point but I see a hole in that argument. If labor was more localized, more people will demand Hawaiian made coffee, as the prices for the commodity itself will decease with an influx of supply and distribution, which will give more incentive to create more jobs in the local coffee industry, and give some jobs to the homeless in Hawaii. Contrary to popular belief, there is plenty of undeveloped land in Hawaii which is NOT on an environmental reserve. Yea, most of this land is on the big island, but still, you can make enough coffee on a 1000 acre property to supply millions of people with coffee that's even better than the stuff they were drinking before, provide more jobs in the US, and create an economic incentive for more countries to buy from the USA. 

"But Trevor, the Hawaiians can only make so much coffee. There will have to be other ways to supplement the demand for coffee." Of corse, and the solution to this may not be that obvious to some, but if enacted, could create millions of jobs not only in the coffee industry, but other agricultural industries as well. HYDROPONIC WAREHOUSING. "Trevor, wtf, hydroponics is only for cannabis, are you high." What are you smoking? Not true at all. Hydroponics can be used to cultivate many   food products ranging from rice, wheat, corn, berries, vegetables and if done properly, even fruit along with a plethora of foods we already consume on a daily basis! I'm not sure how hydroponic fruit would work, perhaps you would need a sort of genetic engineering that could large amounts of organic fruit on smaller branches. But as for things like corn, wheat, rice, etc, you can easily place the plants on warehouse shelves, stack them on top of each other, and save TONS in space, land costs, and waste and insect pesticides as bugs tend to bury themselves into soil, whereas hydroponic water would get replaced once a week, insuring that no bugs contaminate your crop. Not every farmer can find the resources to compensate for all his lost crops, however with a hydroponic system, you can time when the next harvest is gonna be and plan accordingly instead of having to go through the possibility of famine, not being able to find enough workers. It is the perfect solution to improve agriculture, create maintenance jobs, and hire people that want experience in the food industry. Look, if we gathered 200 people to get together on a ranch, and build a small town we can create businesses, agriculture and create our own laws while being a self sufficient country. 
No more oppression! The law is on your side! Legalize, tax and regulate! I have create my own economic system whereby the ruling class is the working class!
We will have own flag, national anthem, and military of about 10 people, and a navy of two guys with a kanoe! We will write our own constitution and our second amendment will be the right to bear BONGS and smoke cannabis! 
We will have single payer!
We will have a 15$ minimum wage!
We will have a hospital!
We will have high paying jobs!
Not a single chain store will be in our land, and our community is self sufficient with local produce!
Small business friendly! Leases 250$ a month.
This is gonna be how the Democratic-Republican of Anti-Corporatist America will be! A sovereign self sufficient state will a democratic process and an entirely left leaning population 



We are now witnessing a great exposure to factually confirmed instances of politicians knowingly lying about big and small things.

The confidence, these lies were sold to us with, points not to the "few bad apples" problem, but rather a widespread culture in political circles. 

Politicians lie boldly, because they know that others are going to lie for them/with them.

And the fact that there is so much resistance from both parties to uncover these lies tells that we only see a tiny tip of an iceberg. Congressional hearings are a joke. Nobody digs deep. All of the questions tip toe around the problem, so that only the lies that have leaked are exposed, and no other lies they are trying to hide are accidentally revealed.

I am very tired of this. And I am wondering, how can we, the voters, organize ourselves to stop this from happening.

My suggestion: only vote for politicians that do crowdfunding campaign financing. Ignore the big shots. We can start with senators and congressmen, as there are very few of them. Then spread the culture to local governments.

Think about it: how many politicians you have a personal connection with? How many of them depend on your support to be successful? It is time to turn the tide.https://youtu.be/2SHoq9SQZBs

The Democratic establishment is so out of touch with their own voters. This is literally the definition of regressive and illiberal! Diane, you are just as backwards as the republicans, I hope you lose your job in a primary election. 

When was the last time Feinstein has done ANYTHING progressive or liberal! Ohhh, remember when California passed single payer healthcare? Me neither. It's just another conservative with the label Democrat, a wolf in sheep's clothing.Watch the video so we are on the same page: https://youtu.be/pj8n78AuN3w

Wait, so they demonitize another YouTube's regarding the Las Vegas shooting, but when Jimmy Kimmel makes a YouTube video about that same shooting, he gets plenty of ads playing on his show?! 
YouTube has gone full corporatist shill. They are propping up corporatist media, while taking away ad revenue from independent media because YouTube is working for the establishment! 

I'm considering creating a new YouTube type platform, except, you can get all the features of YouTube red for free, like not being able to listen to music and news while surfing other apps, or download videos on your phone for offline use. No videos that get more than 1k views per week will get demonized, and will be independently supported. Not run by/like big moguls like Google or Yahoo.

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v8e5d8HOaMA/maxresdefault.jpgTrump wants us to respect our military while he does so only when their decisions coincide with his judgments. He wanted Bergdahl shot after spending five years in  horrible enemy confinement and enduring torture. He also lied about having military leadership support for booting transgender soldiers out of service. How do these actions demonstrate  respect for the military? Would the military respectfully engage in any questionable engagement ordered by their commander in chief who only respects them when it suits him?Donna Brazile tweeted the following: 

&gt;Today’s lesson: Being quoted by Donald Trump means being MIS-quoted by Donald Trump. Stop trolling me. #NeverSaidHillaryRiggedElection

Interpretation 1: Although Donna Brazile technically hasn't said Hillary rigged the election, **her recent article that she wrote in detail about how Hillary Clinton's campaign took control of the DNC, which gave many advantaged to Hillary Clinton. That, by definition, is rigged.** 

Interpretation 2: Although Hillary didn't rig the general election, she did rig the Democratic primary. **She (and I) assume that Donald Trump meant that Hillary Clinton rigged the general election, in which case it was not true.** 

Well, it's not telling which interpretation is what she meant. But for the sake of the argument...
___________
If we follow interpretation 1:

Donna Brazile's thinking could have gone like this: 

&gt;I'm a Democratic politician, so I must defend the Democratic Party. Also, Donald Trump is always wrong. Therefore, Hillary Clinton didn't rig the election.

&gt;However....

&gt;I wrote the article claiming that Hillary Clinton rigged the Democratic primary.  Therefore, Hillary Clinton indeed rigged the election.  

Of course, both can't be true at the same time. I made a stupid slide show with Alex Jones doing bizarre things like putting tin foil on his head, and yelling into his microphone cause for whatever reason, my phone won't let me upload songs to SoundCloud.

"One of the big issues in state legislative races all over the country is uncontested seats," he says. "Roughly 35 percent of state legislative contests in the country are uncontested each year, so that's a very high percentage."

Myers believes it's a bad sign for democracy when voters aren't presented with at least two options in a race. And he says, the problem tends to get worse the further down ballot a race is.


"We don't have the same data on local races, but we have every reason to believe that the percentage of local races — so school board races, city council races, etc — that are uncontested is even higher."

# Long hours, little or no pay

Myer says one of the biggest reasons people don't run for school board in particular is money. It's a volunteer office in Colorado, as it is in many other states. Myers' research shows that states with higher pay for elected offices tend to have fewer uncontested races. And when it comes to school board, not only is it unpaid, but it's also a lot of work.

# Other reasons: from bleeding population to untenable time commitment 

Cook says a variety of factors play into this year's high number of uncontested school board races. For one, almost all of the six counties that canceled elections this year are remote or rural places — places that have steadily bled population in recent years as many have left in droves for Colorado's larger cities. 

"We know that there's about 80 percent of the state that doesn't have a direct connection to public education, either through a student in the district, a grandchild, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, something like that," he says. "Often times it's hard for them to really see what's going on."

Another reason is the nature of the office itself, says Cook. School board seats — unlike other political offices — are a hard sell for people who don't have kids.

Webster says she felt bad about pulling out of the race, but she says she did it because she didn't think she could give the position the time and dedication it deserved. It turned out no one else could either, aside from the candidate who will be appointed to the seat without earning a single vote.https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-08-30/historians-disagree-whether-star-spangled-banner-racist

“Essentially,” says writer and academic Jason Johnson, “Francis Scott Key was happy to see former slaves, who had joined the British as part of their Colonial Marines, getting slaughtered and killed as they attempted to take Baltimore.”

Johnson is an associate professor at Morgan State University in Baltimore, and has a piece in online magazine The Root on this issue.

“So it’s clearly racist; it’s clearly pro-slavery, but it’s pretty much in line with the kind of man that Francis Scott Key was.”

Key was a typical white Marylander of his time, and he favored slavery.

About 6,000 African Americans fled to the British during the War of 1812, on the promise of freedom. Most of the men were recruited into the Royal Navy or into the Colonial Marines, a mostly black unit, which fought with distinction.

“It was an amazing opportunity for African Americans to fight for their freedom,” says Johnson.

Many historians agree with Johnson, but some disagree. They point out that Key never told anyone what he actually meant, and some historians interpret his mention of hirelings and slaves to reference all of the invading British forces.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5kUITklALQ

Bill Clinton, Jerry Brown trade jabs at 1992 Democratic primary debate

There's a lot of amusing little things in the video: 

# Jerry Brown 

Jerry Brown (born April 7, 1938) is the 39th Governor of California since 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, Brown previously served as the 34th governor from 1975 to 1983, and is the longest-serving governor in California history.

Brown ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 1992, once again finishing second in the popular vote, carrying six states and coming second in the convention, though substantially behind Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas.


# the heated exchange between two candidates 

Jerry Brown accused the Clintons of a series of unethical corrupt behavior, citing newspaper articles. 

## This is an illustration of Bill Clinton's playbook (with variations, there is another crisis playbook): 


## step 1: dodge the question

Bill Clinton first **dogged the accusation**, 

## Step 2: attack the opponent(s)

and then **attacked Jerry Brown** on his supposed habit of reinventing himself. Jerry Brown cut him off, accusing him of dodging the question. 

## Step 3: when forced, deny the accusation without going to the specifics 

When forced to answer the question, Bill Clinton **denied the accusation** 

## Step 4: accuse the attacks are unfair and personal 

Bill Clinton said everyone is trying to attack him and his wife's personal characters and history. 

## Step 5: touting that he doesn't attack other people's history and characters

Bill Clinton said he didn't attack any candidate personally. (He just did) 

## Step 6: I can stand up to the attacks

He continued to say that **when he and his wife got attacked, he always wins**...

## Step 7: We are good people doing good work, and we are fighting for ordinary people 

...because **he fights for ordinary people and fights for change.** Then, he started to defend his wife, saying that **his life is a fine person, who hasn't done anything unethical.** And he cited numerous altruistic work for Arkansas state. 

Finally, he implied that only he can stand up to these personal attacks from the Republicans. 

________________

# agent of change 

Funny that Bill Clinton was running as the agent of change, very similar to Obama. By contrast, Hillary Clinton was running as the establishment candidate, touting experience. 

______________

# The famous Clinton crisis playbook is different: 

## First, parse the story. 

 find the factual errors (or supposed factual errors) 

## Second, attack the accuser. 

Tell the story that your accuser has some pretty shady histories and ulterior nefarious motives. 

## Third, bring in the candidate's wife (or spouse in general)

Hillary Clinton took the stage for her first star turn in a supporting role.

## Fourth, When scandal erupts, work relentlessly to stay on message.

if you make it about the American people's lives instead of your life, you're going to be OK.

**BBC Timewatch - The Secret File On J Edgar Hoover**

If I'm not mistaken, this is the same PBS FRONTLINE documentary film of the same name word for word. (But I can't find the PBS FRONTLINE film anywhere on the Internet now, and the film is quite old.) I think this video's intro and ending were cut off, making it 50 mins video instead of 60 mins.

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh//pages/frontline/////////programs/info/1111.html

&gt;For nearly 50 years, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover amassed secret files on America's most prominent figures, files he used to smear and control presidents and politicians. Frontline reveals how Hoover's own secret life left him open to blackmail by the Mafia and offers a startling new explanation why the FBI allowed the mob to operate unchallenged for over two decaes.


**I think this documentary is rather important in understanding this tumultuous time, a nation traumatized with assassinations and rampant organized crime, the choice of LBJ as vice president, and the reason that J Edgar Hoover was kept as FBI director for four decades until his death (he blackmailed each president and countless politicians). He also targeted civil rights groups and spied on and tried to smear Martin Luther King.**

Classical Liberalism and the meaning of work

# the full quote 

[It's rather difficult to understand due to its complex sentence structure. But what's what you get from an intellect 1800s, translated from French to English.]

&gt;In proportion as the principle of the division of labor is more extensively applied, the workman becomes more weak, more narrow-minded, and more dependent. **The art advances, the artisan recedes.** On the other hand, in proportion as it becomes more manifest that the productions of manufactures are by so much the cheaper and better as the manufacture is larger and the amount of capital employed more considerable, wealthy and educated men come forward to embark in manufacture, which were heretofore [before now] abandoned to poor or ignorant handicraftsmen. The magnitude of the efforts required and the importance of the results to be obtained attract them. [sentence fragment?] Thus, at the very time at which the science of manufactures lowers the class of workmen, it raises the class of masters.

# Alexis de Tocqueville

A French diplomat, political scientist, and historian, **Alexis de Tocqueville was best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856)**. In both he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science.

He argued the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. **The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals.** Tocqueville was a **classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but he was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.**

The post is response to this video titled: Would David Interview Noam Chomsky?


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf2YRq7JVfII think a dynamic like someone who is so anti establishment like David and someone who is the pinnacle of apologetic crony Capitalism and authoritarianism like Sarah would make a fantastic interview. They are so on the polar opposite of the political spectrum it would make for a good debate, and further ruin the Trump administration's already terrible reputation.I ask because I think it would be fascinating to have such places run experimental societies to test them out.

I am thinking specifically of some pretty toxic styles and fantasies of the right and libertarians that want to have extremely minimal government.  I am sick of hearing libertarians assert that their ultra limited government model produces better results and would lead to a more prosperous and generally superior society.  These idiots confuse their own ASSERTIONS about the world with REALITY itself.  I try to point this out to them but they just go back to their model not REALLY being tried.  But I don't want them to try it here because I do not want my own society to implode like rapture under the sea.  I want them to get their Randian test far far away, so I can watch the light show of their fool society go nova from safety.

So first, we need a piece of land, or perhaps some deserted isle to get these randians going.  Let them show the rest of us collectivists how you build a society.  Let them prove their ideology correct, or die trying.Has Mr. Pakman ever done a segment on comics doing news. Mr. Pakman is obviously trained in journalism and economics. It must be frustrating seeing some dude with a good comedy bit on Trump being considered a news expert. Also, I wonder if he believes comics giving the news has a negative impact on social responsibility. I figure “comedy news” brings in a lot of casual observers. We need dedicated people to turn this country around.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bl19RoR7lc

Episode 699: Why Did The Job Cross The Road?


**States across the country are at war right now. A war over jobs. They are competing with each other to get companies to move within their borders. Politicians love to call this "job creation."**

**States dangle incentives like tax breaks, training programs, freshly paved roads. According to one study, states all over the country are spending $70 billion a year to "create" jobs. But is it really creating a job if it came from a few miles away across the state border?**

Usually, this competition happens over great distances: California and New York battle it out over tech start-ups, New Jersey and Georgia fight for car companies. But in Kansas City, which straddles two states, Kansas and Missouri, this war is happening very close up, right along State Line Road.

On today's show, when "creating" new jobs is a matter of moving an office across the street, things can get a little out of hand.

The courtship for companies has gotten so intense around Kansas City there are code names, top secret documents, multi-million dollar deals and of course, those tax breaks. One local attorney who helps companies cash in on all this, calls it, "probably the worst public policy in the history of the world."# My response: 

The method that the caller was referring to is called "sortition", which actually has a long history. In ancient Athens, Athenians were actually suspicious of the effectiveness of election as being truly democratic, because elections could be easily manipulated by the aristocracy. (sound familiar?)

Therefore, most of their officials were randomly selected from the pool of assembly, and only a small number of the officials are elected. And every free (not slaves) male over age of 20 have the right to part take the assembly. **There are a couple of measures to hold these randomly selected officials accountable:**

1) chosen individuals must pass exams that test their competence. Rarely, people were disqualified based on exams. 

2) Officials could be impeached and removed by the assembly at any time. And their official conducts were examined constantly monitored constantly.

3) when the officials selected by sortition leave office, their conducts during their time in office must be examined. 

4) officials selected by sortition only served 1 year. A individual could serve only twice in his lifetime non-consecutively for a particular position.

**Sortition - doing democracy differently | Brett Hennig | TEDxDanubia**

This is a video about a proposal of modern democratic rule by sortition, using stratified random selection method to select the representatives. 

______________________________________________________

# sortition 

In governance, sortition (also known as allotment or demarchy) selects political officials as a random sample from a larger pool of candidates.

Today, sortition is commonly used to select prospective jurors in common law-based legal systems and is sometimes used in forming citizen groups with political advisory power (citizens' juries or citizens' assemblies).

# Sortition and Athenian democracy 

Athenian democracy developed in the 6th century BC out of what was then called isonomia (equality of law and political rights). Sortition was then the principal way of achieving this fairness. It was utilized to pick most[4] of the magistrates for their governing committees, and for their juries (typically of 501 men). 

Aristotle relates equality and democracy:

&gt; Democracy arose from the idea that **those who are equal in any respect are equal absolutely. All are alike free, therefore they claim that all are free absolutely... The next is when the democrats, on the grounds that they are all equal, claim equal participation in everything.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition#Ancient_Athens


In ancient Athenian democracy, sortition was the traditional and primary method for appointing political officials, and its use was regarded as a principal characteristic of true democracy. **The Athenians believed sortition to be democratic but not elections[4] and used complex procedures with purpose-built allotment machines (kleroteria) to avoid the corrupt practices used by oligarchs to buy their way into office.** 

Both Aristotle and Herodotus (one of the earliest writers on democracy) emphasize selection by lot as a test of democracy, "The rule of the people has the fairest name of all, equality (isonomia), and does none of the things that a monarch does. The lot determines offices, power is held accountable, and deliberation is conducted in public."

# In Athenian democracy, How Sortition works and How the accountability of officers chosen by sortition 

In Athens, to be eligible to be chosen by lot, citizens self-selected themselves into the available pool, then lotteries in the kleroteria machines. 

**The magistracies assigned by lot generally had terms of service of 1 year. A citizen could not hold magistracy more than once in his lifetime, but could hold other magistracies. Those selected through lot underwent examination called dokimasia in order to avoid incompetent officials.** Rarely were selected citizens discarded.**Magistrates, once in place, were subjected to constant monitoring by the Assembly. Magistrates appointed by lot had to render account of their time in office upon their leave, called euthynai. However, any citizen could request the suspension of a magistrate with due reason.**

## Elections

**During an Athenian election, approximately one hundred officials out of a thousand were elected rather than chosen by lot.** Election in general strongly favored the rich, but in this case wealth was virtually a prerequisite.

**Generals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge but also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the wider Greek world where wars were fought.** Elected officials too were subject to review before holding office and scrutiny after office. And they too could be removed from office at any time that the assembly met. 

## the Assembly

The central events of the Athenian democracy were the meetings of the assembly (ἐκκλησία, ekklêsia). Unlike a parliament, the assembly's members were not elected, but attended by right when they chose. Greek democracy created at Athens was direct, rather than representative: any adult male citizen over the age of 20 could take part,[26] and it was a duty to do so. The officials of the democracy were in part elected by the Assembly and in large part chosen by lottery in a process called sortition.

# Idiots: a person who is not actively interested in politics 

A good example of the contempt the first democrats (supporters of democracy) felt for those who did not participate in politics can be found in the modern word 'idiot', which finds its origins in the ancient Greek word ἰδιώτης, idiōtēs, meaning a private person, a person who is not actively interested in politics; such characters were talked about with contempt, and the word eventually acquired its modern meaning. According to Thucydides, Pericles may have declared in a funeral oration:

&gt;We do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy


This might sound crazy but let me explain:

The idea of a bank being to
1: loan individuals money for business start ups

2: have a place for individuals to keep their savings safe

3: to generate long term wealth

I submit the idea of banning privatized banking and replaced it with a combination of state and federally run banks aimed at spurring economic development

I view privatized banks the same as privatized healthcare: I'm giving my money to an ineffective middle man. Giving your money to a private bank comes with the following problems

1: Without hawkish regulation the industry leans towards self destructive practices, the Great Depression and Great Recession

2: they are profit driven: you are earning less potential money as the bank has to insure it's survival and then pad the bottom line of the owners

3: Wall Street style bonuses: an improper use of money compared to distributing those earnings to it's customers

4: They influence our politics in a negative fashion

I propose we ban private banking. We create the United States of America Central Bank, which will have branches in every state. Have 3% of all tax revenue be dedicated to banking capital. If anyone is wondering how I would model the operations of the bank I would have it run like the Bank of North Dakota, which is currently the only state run bank in the US, but it's flourishing and wildly successful. 

A radical idea, but i honestly don't see any upside to privatized banking. Let me know if you agree or disagree in the comment section.

David normally wears the graph-paper style shirts, which is proper with a blazer, however today he stepped his shirt game up a notch to a new level with his more casual, but still stylishly as if purposefully unkempt solid shirt, which reminds me of several styles from cotton-on, and with just the proper amount of fade in the fabric, and also (at least to my color calibrated monitor, which allows me to see color in the way most people see colors).

A very nice oxford button taper and style. One lacking thing, is the lack of the proper sleeve roll-up - it could be done with a bit more care, so as to look a bit more 'crispy' and orderly so that it doesn't look bunched up near the crook of his elbow, but I suspect that may because of the fabric. 

The color matches his skin tone very well, and I also like the style of the shirt with the buttons a bit more spaced than his normal oxfords. 

Naturally, Pat's shirt game is still unparalleled - particularly in Pat's roll-up of the sleeve, but I do say, quite a good choice.

Black Panthers For Self-Defense - Vanguard of The Revolution


“The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution,” a documentary by Stanley Nelson which aired on PBS, shined a necessary light on the contributions, convictions and struggles of members in the party. Nelson’s informative film took a deep dive into discussing the truth behind the Black Panthers and underscored the heavy institutional backlash the liberation movement received from police and the government. 

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/27-important-facts-everyone-should-know-about-the-black-panthers_us_56c4d853e4b08ffac1276462

While I was doing some research on the NRA, I came across this bizarre fact from Pew Research.

Read this exert from Pew Research Center:
"A majority of gun owners (61%) are Republicans or lean to the Republican Party, but NRA members skew even more heavily to the political right than other gun owners. *Roughly three-quarters (77%) of gun owners who say they belong to the NRA are Republicans or lean Republican, while only 20% are Democrats or lean Democratic.* Among gun owners who do not belong to the NRA, by contrast, 58% are Republicans and 39% are Democrats. And among Republican gun owners, NRA members are much more likely than nonmembers to describe their political views as very conservative (29% vs. 18%)."
Link: https://www.google.com/amp/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/05/among-gun-owners-nra-members-have-a-unique-set-of-views-and-experiences/%3Famp%3D1

While most gun owners do not have a membership with the NRA, the NRA has a membership count around 5 million. That means if 20% of members are Democrats, there are 1 million left leaning NRA members. Some aspects about gun control are not popular with a proportion of those on the left.

- I support background checks
-I support single payer healthcare which would provide more access to mental healthcare 
-ban Bump stocks, and other accessories that make full auto conversion possible 
-I don't not support banning semi auto rifles
-I don't support waiting periods
-I'm skeptical on mental health exams as a prerequisite to get a gun. Not because mental ill should be able to get a gun, but because the methodology could discriminate against minorities, and women. I had a Reddit post about this early, but I deleted it, because of the lack of nuance. When doctors have the authority to ban people from getting guns, and make them look crazy for trying to obtain a gun, no one will be able/want to get a gun legally. It's about the methodology I'm skeptical about, and how that would treat law abiding citizens like they are guilty until proven innocent. Anyone with any historical knowledge about Soviet mental institution will be just as skeptical as me.

What it would take for me to change my mind about mental health exams as a prerequisite to buying a gun.
-the exams shouldn't be face to face as a racist doctor could call a person of color insane even if all the answers they answered to the doctors questions were 100% sane and reasonable. People get convicted of crimes they didn't commit, I don't see why mental health is any different (in this circumstance alone, outside of a voluntary clinical setting).
- what questions will be asked? If the questions are 
"Are you suicidal?"
 "Have you thought about murdering someone?"
"Do you have a history of violence?"
Okay, that isn't so unreasonable. What I'm concerned about with these mental health exams in the context of necessity to trying to get a gun is unlimited authority in the hands of a doctor. If doctors could lie and say that their subject had answered these questions, no body would be able to get a gun, and could face institutionalization as a result of that doctor lying.
"But Trevor! You can sue them!"
Good luck trying to prove that these doctors wouldn't be liars. They could always say in a court of law:
"But their body language seemed uncomfortable with me asking these questions so I marked them down as lying." Most people are convinced the doctor is always right, so I don't see much of a point of these tests besides punishing people for trying to obtain a gun by throwing them in a mental institution.

What About Randomly Assigning People to Be Elected Officials? [**Oh, by the way, it's called sortition, I actually wrote a Reddit post, in response to the video**: https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/7bb87e/response_to_what_about_randomly_assigning_people/
unfortunately, it didn't gain any traction. I'm not sure why...] 

In this video, David Pakman momentarily showed what's on his paper: 

Looks like it has a list of names, presumably of callers. above which are three numbers that I cannot make out. They do not seem to be phone area codes, though, which are 3 digit numbers, not 4 digits. 

On the left side, they are written as: 

2840

3650

4757 (or 4707)

It looks like an addition calculation, in which case obviously these numbers are guessed wrong. However, it might well mean something else. As the first two numbers and the last two numbers are more closely together, which might indicate time, but the numbers do not make any sense.

25 (??) [Bold, within a rectangle, which may indicate a new title, or answer of a calculation] 

On the right side, it seems to be a series of calculation. starting with an addition: 

4707

13X0
_ _ _

XX17 
 8

.....

The numbers go around the edges, until its stops at the bottom left with a number, enclosed by a rectangle. 

There is a number on the upper right corner on the paper. I think it is something like "7 AM" or "11 AM", or "12 AM" or "1700" (some people write number "7" like "1", which can be annoying. There are a lot of variations in handwriting, that's why I hate reading handwriting.) David Pakman's fingers block some of the text. However, I assume there are a series of calculations.

I don't think these numbers have any significance to caller questions and answers.

Oh, by the way, in case you haven't noticed, David Pakman is left-handed.


Recent caller had me thinking, and I would like you guys to chime in on this.

Let's assume that Pence is far worse for the US in regards to national stability than Trump, because he would go under the radar and pass a lot of nasty policy.  Let's also assume that Trump is far worse for our national standing worldwide, and global stability, than Pence, since Trumps posturing against North Korea could potentially cause millions of people in Seoul to get killed.

My question is this:  Which is worse?  Greater global instability under Trump or greater national instability under Pence?  Which one do you choose, why, and whether this counts as a possible false dichotomy, then explain.

My other question:  How effective would Pence be in implementing anti-LGBT policies?  Given the recent upsets for progressives in the recent election, would a Pence presidency even have the momentum to succeed in implementing anti-civil rights laws?

What also could be said in regards to our civil stability when considering Trump vs Pence.  Since Trump is a cult of personality, would Pence gain the same fervor from his supporters?  Would Pence fan the flames as heavily in this regard as Trump, or would it be less, or equal?https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/19/just-three-percent-of-adults-own-half-of-americas-guns/

How to Fix the Democratic Party.

It’s time we come together to enact real reform—only then can we defeat Donald Trump and retake the country.

## excerpt [with personal comments]: 

&gt; Last year, Secretary Hillary Clinton and I agreed upon the need for a **Unity Reform Commission** to move the party in a new and more democratic direction. In a few weeks, this group will have its final meeting in Washington, D.C., and **will decide if we are going to move forward** in an inclusive way or continue with the current failed approach.

&gt; # What are some of the reforms that are desperately needed?

&gt; First, **it is absurd that the Democratic Party now gives over 700 superdelegates—almost one-third the number a presidential candidate needs to win the nomination**—the power to control the nominating process and ignore the will of voters.

&gt; Second, in contrast to Republicans, Democrats believe in making voting easier, not harder. We believe in **universal and same-day voter registration and ending antiquated, arbitrary and discriminatory voter registration laws.** These same principles must apply to our primaries .... **Independent voters are critical to general election victories. Locking them out of primaries is a pathway to failure.**

&gt; Third, in states that use caucuses, we must make it easier for working people and students to participate. While there is much to be said for bringing people together, face to face to discuss why they support the candidate of their choice, not everybody is able to participate because of work, child care or other obligations. **A process must be developed that gives everyone the right to cast a vote even if they are not physically able to attend a caucus.** [that's not a concrete suggestion, but thanks for pointing out the problem.] 

&gt; Finally, if we are to succeed, we must fully appreciate Brazile’s revelations and understand the **need for far more transparency in the financial and policy workings of the Democratic Party. Hundreds of millions of dollars flow in and out of the Democratic National Committee with little to no accountability.** That simply is not acceptable.

The Trump administration this week began dismantling a longstanding humanitarian program known as Temporary Protected Status, leaving hundreds of thousands of Central American immigrants living in heightened fear of deportation.

The program grants temporary visas that allow immigrants to live and work in the U.S. and protects them from being forced to return to their home countries. The U.S. has granted TPS to immigrants from 10 countries, mostly in Central America, for decades.

Federal Judicial Nominee Who Has Never Tried A Case Advanced By Senate Committee

https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/11/563488356/federal-judicial-nominee-who-has-never-tried-a-case-advanced-by-senate-committee

## Name: Brett Joseph Talley

## Nominating position: 

a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. 

## Age: 

36 years old. Why does it matter? **All Article III federal judges (judges whose powers are vested in Article III of the Constitution) are lifetime appointments: they hold their seats until they resign, die, or are removed from office by impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate.** Article III federal judges include the judges serving on..

+ the Supreme Court (total: 9 judges); 

+ 13 courts of appeals (also called "circuit courts") with appellate (appealing) jurisdiction over different regions of the United States (total: 179 judges); 

+ and 94 United States district courts (total: 677 judges).

+ the United States Court of International Trade (total: 9 judges, not counting senior judges, who are semi-retired)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGfXipClCjU

Why Supreme Court Justices Serve For Life


There are also Article I federal judges. But that's a story for another day. 


## Nominated by: President Donald Trump 

# Current situation: 

The Senate Judiciary Committee's partisan 11-9 vote on Thursday sends Talley to the full Senate for votes that are expected to break similarly along party lines. [meaning, he is expected to be approved by the senate, as the Republican Party has the majority in the Senate.]

## Nominee selection: 

When Senator Jeff Sessions moved to the attorney general’s post, Talley took a job in the Justice Department’s office that selects judicial nominees. **In other words, Talley selected himself to be one of judicial nominees.** 

## Experience (or lack thereof): Very limited experience as a lawyer

+ He has never tried a case, meaning he has never argued a lawsuit in court as a lawyer, or served the role of a judge. 

+ He earned degrees from the University of Alabama and Harvard Law School. 

+ He clerked for two federal judges and worked as a speech writer on the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney.

+ And, like many people who eventually became federal judges, he became the protege of someone who became a senator. In this case, his mentor was Republican Sen. Luther Strange, the former Alabama state attorney general who was appointed to the Senate in January to replace Jeff Sessions. Sessions left the Senate to become U.S. attorney general. Talley worked for Luther Strange as a state deputy attorney general. 

## Overtly political: Unable to rule fairly

Talley's involvement in **overtly political work** appeared to arouse concern from some on the Senate Judiciary Committee about his ability to rule fairly over cases.

+ Feinstein noted tweets in which Talley had referred to the 2016 Democratic nominee for president as "Hillary Rotten Clinton" and blog posts he authored that seemed to display a **steadfast allegiance to gun rights advocates**.

    +  A month after a gunman killed 20 children at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Talley described efforts by the Obama administration to advance gun control legislation as follows: "the President and his democratic allies in Congress are about to launch the greatest attack on our constitutional freedoms in our lifetime."

    + One month later, as the national debate over gun control raged on, Talley responded to a reader's comment that "[w]e will have to resort to arms when our other rights—of speech, press, assembly, representative government—fail to yield the desired results," by writing, "I agree with this completely."

## Professional Assessment: not qualified 

+ Before the Senate committee's meeting, the **American Bar Association's judicial rating committee had unanimously deemed Talley "not qualified" for his nomination to preside over a federal court in Alabama. The group said in a separate letter that it "believes that Mr. Talley does not presently have the requisite trial experience or its equivalent."**

+ “He’s **practiced law for less than three years and never argued a motion, let alone brought a case.** This is the least amount of experience I’ve seen in a judicial nominee,” said Kristine Lucius, executive vice president of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.

+ Since 1989, the **ABA has only unanimously voted to label four federal judge nominees "not qualified," and as NPR's Carrie Johnson reported, two of those have occurred in the first year of the Trump administration.**

# A history of Republican obstructionism in Judicial nomination under a Democratic administration creates a large number of vacant seats, which are filled by the Trump administration 

Trump and McConnell have succeeded in pushing judicial nominees through the Senate because the Republicans have voted in lockstep since taking control of the chamber in 2014.

**When Trump took office in January, there were more than 100 vacant seats on the federal courts, thanks to an unprecedented slowdown engineered by McConnell during the final two years of President Obama’s term. The Senate under GOP control approved only 22 judges in that two-year period, the lowest total since 1951-52 in the last year of President Truman’s term. By contrast, the Senate under Democratic control approved 68 judges in the last two years of George W. Bush’s presidency.**

The best known vacancy was on the Supreme Court. After Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, McConnell refused to permit a hearing for Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nominee. Trump filled the seat earlier this year with Justice Neil M. Gorsuch.

The Alliance for Justice, which tracks judicial nominees, said Trump’s team is off to a fast start, particularly when compared with Obama’s first year. By November 2009, Obama had made 27 judicial nominations, including Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Trump has nominated 59 people to the federal courts, including Justice Gorsuch. That’s also a contrast with Trump’s pace in filling executive branch jobs, where he has lagged far behind the pace of previous administrations.If we want to overthrow Clinton allies from the DNC, we better find the weaknesses and the entry points in the organization and understand the power relation among various positions.

Questions such as these must be answered: 

+ who makes and changes the rules? Who has the veto power? 

+ Who gets elected by whom? 

+ Who oversights the actions of whom? 

+ Who has what power? 

+ who oversees the finance of DNC? 





I'm not one to say that semi auto rifles should be banned, however, I see no reason that AR15's need to be in full assembly when they are being displayed. The rifle can easily be in two parts while being showcased, making this sort of robbery impossible. Luckily no one got hurt in this gun fight, but there clearly needs to be better safety regulation on how these things are displayed in stores and to customers.

https://youtu.be/BueTT_tT_YkDavid, on your show you seem to be a strong advocate for capitalism, specifically regulated capitalism, based on solid demand-side stimulating policies.   Do you support this sort of approach of bottom-up regulated capitalism with strong social programs paid for by taxation on the rich because you feel it's the best possible economic system we could achieve, or do you feel that a socialist, centrally planned economy where workers control the means of production in an egalitarian, hierarchy-less society would be better, but simply think it's not achievable in our lifetime in the USA?

Basically, do you adhere to supporting regulated capitalism because you feel it's better, or because you're being pragmatic about what's possible to achieve?I was watching some older clips from this year when I watched this clip earlier this January of a caller Pat knows who was holding back some details about this road trip that made it seem like something crazy happened.

**Broth**: a **savory liquid** made of water in which bones, meat, fish, or vegetables have been simmered.
http://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/aub-bon-broth.jpg


**Soup**: a **primarily liquid food**, generally served warm or hot (but may be cool or cold), that is made by combining ingredients such as meat and vegetables with stock, juice, water, or another liquid.

**Relationship between broth and soup**: Hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a broth.

**Stew**: Soups are similar to stews, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two; however, **soups generally have more liquid than stews**.

# Conclusions: 

From the look of it, it should be considered stew.

# A stereotypical route: 

Imagine the start of a political career. The logical development might look something like this: law school, campaigning on the local level and then gradually working your way up in the system. The past careers of many members of Congress, however, are in fact much more diverse.

# The low reputation of lawyers 

**Those who are actually lawyers – like Chris Christie or Ted Cruz – prefer to use a more specific job title, like “prosecutor” or “solicitor general,” when discussing their resume.** According to 2013 poll by Pew Research Center, about a third of Americans said that lawyers contributed little or nothing to society -- the worst results of any profession surveyed. So when the term does pop up in political campaigns, “lawyer” is usually a slur slung by an opponent.

# lawyers have been very influential in shaping politics historically 

Yet American politics is actually full of lawyers. New research that looks at more than **200 years of historical data by Nick Robinson, a lecturer in law at Yale, shows that lawyers have had an impressive influence on politics. In total, more than half of all presidents, vice presidents and members of Congress in U.S. history had a background in law.**

## Thinking of higher office

Only about 5 percent of Americans have ever thought about **running for elected office**, according to a 2002 survey. Yet according to another survey Robinson cites, **58 percent of lawyers have considered the idea.** Lawyers also tend to earn more and come from more elite family backgrounds – giving them the resources to pay for high-priced law schools and political campaigns. 

# waning influence of lawyers on American politics today 

**While lawyers are still a huge part of American politics today, their influence has faded somewhat. By the 1960s, lawyers held fewer than 60 percent of Congressional seats. In 2015, fewer than 40 percent of Congressional members were lawyers.** 

The reason for the change, Robinson says, is partly the rise of a professionalized political class after World War II. After the war, a permanent political class began to form in Washington -- people who work as political aides or in civil society organizations, many with the intention of making a career in politics. **Today, those dreaming of a political post might intern on Capitol Hill or enroll in public policy school instead of law school.**

Finally, the historic decline of lawyer/politicians probably also stems from changes in the legal profession, the paper argues. After World War II, **all lawyers were required to get a post-graduate degree, which raised the barrier to becoming a lawyer. And corporate law swelled as a profession, offering lawyers a path far more lucrative than Congress.**

# Congressional Service: 10 years on average

The average length of service for Representatives at the beginning of the 115th Congress was 9.4 years (4.7 House terms); for Senators, 10.1 years (1.7 Senate terms). [this is a historically representative snapshot; both House of representatives and senators hold their offices for around 10 years, with senators a bit longer.]

### transcript: 

“Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are — nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? — but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.”

# context: 

&gt;On 19 July 2016, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appeared at Sun City’s Magnolia Hall in South Carolina to deliver a noontime speech. The event was an otherwise unremarkable campaign stop, save for one portion of Trump’s speech in which he apparently started out attempting to criticize the nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated with Iran but veered into a minute-and-a-half long sentence that spanned his uncle’s academic qualifications, his own education, Democrats’ denying Republicans’ credentials, the power of nuclear technology, the number of American prisoners freed by Iran in conjunction with the nuclear deal, and the adeptness of “Persian” negotiators (particularly women), before circling back to how the Iranians “killed us” in the nuclear deal.

A rambling, jumbled portion of a July 2016 Donald Trump speech has amused and stunned social media users.https://youtu.be/nURFY5AvN8U

Incumbent Mayor Rick Kriseman's 2,186-vote victory over former Mayor Rick Baker didn't go over well with Kevin McBride.

The day after the election, McBride, who owns a men's clothing store in St. Petersburg's Edge District, was apparently so upset that he affixed a note to the door of his storefront indicating his business would be "closed until further notice" and that he would accept prospective clothing buyers by appointment — but only if they had voted for Baker.

"Ever since you had your independence and got accepted many years back, you went on with it," he said. "You kept pressing forward. And you've been greedy and selfish and you keep moving forward like...Once you got your equal rights and you started being respected and accepted into our lives, you went on and pushed. I don't know if you watched the red carpet shows, or, you know E! channel, but you're just constantly complaining and pressing for more when you've already been accepted. So be happy, move on, stop complaining and critiquing...every little issue about everything. I mean, really, you've got it good."

Yelp responses:  https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcbs-mens-clothing-st-petersburgLink: https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/25/congress-aides-stock-market-trades-investments-analysis-242692

this following is only the excerpt: 

A POLITICO review of federal disclosures for 2015 and 2016 found that some senior aides regularly buy and sell individual stocks that present potential conflicts of interest with their work. A smaller number of staffers trade in companies that lobby Congress and the committees that employ them. In all, approximately 450 aides have bought or sold a stock of more than $1,001 in value since May 2015.

That’s likely just **the tip of the iceberg, since most congressional aides aren’t required to report their trades.** **Only those in positions earning more than $124,406 per year must reveal their investments. Of the 12,500 staffers working for lawmakers, committees and leadership offices, only about 1,700 make that much,** according to data compiled by Legistorm and the Brookings Institution.

Government watchdogs say that, at a minimum, staffers should be prevented from buying shares of companies with business before their committees. But they are not. **And despite the disparity between the rigorous standards for the executive branch and the laxness of Congress, the House and Senate have taken a permissive approach even to enforcing existing rules.**

That’s a serious problem, watchdogs say, because **aides often have more of a hands-on role than the members themselves in crafting details of legislation that could have enormous consequences for individual companies. And because aides are rarely in the spotlight, there’s more potential for ethical lapses to go unnoticed.**I do not know what the reward should be, but it's clear Pat has shown up in more recent videos.  As such, I propose more people on the fence sign up on patreon or Davids site.  That is all.I know this is a competition with stiff competition, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Bill Orielly, Glenn Beck, alex jones (more right wing troll conspiracy nut than standard conservative, but still linked more with the right), Limbaugh, scores of other right wing radio hosts, anti sjw youtubers....

But out of them all I still find Sean Hannity the most loathsome of them all.  Alex Jones lies all the time, but at least it's pretty clear to non crazy people he's putting on a show to con a bunch of rubes.  Hannity is a more insidious figure because a lot of right wing rubes actually buy into what he's selling, what he refuses to talk about, the abject spin and lies.

He is like the combination of Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee at their worst rolled into one, but with a longer and more lucrative career.  I think the man is absolute swine... but is anyone actually worse?Here are some examples:

The Onion's Future News From The Year 2137

Unfortunately, it seems like Onion has changed its management several years ago, most of their new videos are very poor in quality by comparison. 
I must admit that I have never played Jenga before. Since he's basically playing against himself (rather than against another player), he has every interest to keep the tower standing (or does he? I'm not sure). But I think David Pakman is making a couple of bad moves in playing this "nonsense" as he calls it. 

1. Try not to remove the blocks from low levels, as this will create a top-heavy tower, which will hasten the eventual collapse of the tower; any disturbance in the above levels will be greatly amplified. A stable tower is supposed to be bottom heavy. Also, don't create a tower with a hollowed out middle levels for the same reason.

2. Try not to remove too many blocks from continuous levels. David Pakman has created several weak points, where only one block is left in each level for two continuous levels. This will make tower less stable at these levels. If the tower falls, these places are the first to go. 

3. Try to create a symmetrical tower such as the opposite sides are more or less equally weighted, so that tower doesn't lean over to one side, which can cause the tower to fall. 

4. Think about the placement of blocks, it's better to place the block in the midline first, and then left and right. Doing so will reduce the chance of tower to lean over, as you place the block on the topmost level. 

5. Try to take out the blocks from top levels as the tower gets higher and higher. This is desirable because taking out top levels reduces wobble in the tower as you take them out. This, in turn, reduces the likelihood of collapse. 

What David is doing right: he removes the block that doesn't give much support to the tower. But that doesn't prevent the tower from falling, when he puts the removed block back at the topmost level, as the weight distribution changes as he does so. 

David often imitates Donald Trump's speech and writing style, with expressions like "sad!", "thinnngs", "bigly", "low energy", etc.

I understand that this usually expresses mockery, but I would avoid these expressions even as a joke. These jokes gradually drift away from being clearly identified as Trumpisms into the general English language, and perpetuate Trump's influence on popular culture.

Resisting Trump should also mean not letting him leave a mark in language and culture. Use these expressions only in direct quotes.# 1. honesty

It's really hard to find another politician to be this honest. Although there are some instances of exaggeration and over-generalization, most of his statements are accurate. But I haven't found any statement that Bernie made is blatantly false. 

I think one of Hillary Clinton's problem is her low credibility; the people who like her policies even has doubt that she genuinely will push for these policies once she's in office. If a candidate has lost his credibility, it's really difficult for him/her to recover from it, because his policies will be passed off as voter pandering. 

# 2. consistency/principled stance

Throughout his 40 years of political life, Bernie Sanders' policies, political message, and political philosophy have been remarkably consistent. This is almost unheard of in Modern politics. Now, it would be disastrous if his worldview is wrong, but in my opinion his worldview is correct. 

Here are just some issues that he's been consistent: his fight against economic and social injustice he sees around the world and in this country; his fight for democratic values; his fight against money dominated two-party political system; his fight against poverty and "free" trade, his support for African Americans and gays/lesbians, and his opposition against the military-industrial complex and America's expensive interventionist foreign policy that violates international norms and democratic values; his fight for universal healthcare.

Bernie Sanders Has Stuck To The Same Message For 40 Years

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R4IjNRk-uo

Rachel Maddow Tale of The Tape Bernie Sanders 08 13 2015


# 3. insight and foresight/being ahead of his time 

This is always a rare quality for a politician. While most politicians try to appeal to the American public and go along with the establishment thinking (even though they are wrong), Bernie Sanders doesn't wavier even though it is not popular at the time. 

He was against the first Iraq war, fearing that war would be America's preferred method for dealing conflicts in the Middle East and would divert funding for important social programs to the war effort. He was against the second war for a variety of reasons which turned out to be valid: the blank-check to President G. W. Bush for the second Iraq war would set the precedence for preemptive invasion of a foreign country; the war would lead to perpetual war, cause Iraqi civil war, and gives rise of extremists, jeopardize counter-terrorist campaign; the war would be expensive, with also with no estimate about the human causality. 

https://youtu.be/UAE3hXI-hRw

Bernie Sanders' Foresight About the Middle East

His support for gay rights was later accepted by the American public many decades later. He has railed against money in politics, dominance of the two-party system, and wealth inequality, which would only worsen over time. 

There are countless examples, but these are a just few examples. 

# 4. compassion

Bernie Sanders was born in a working family in Brooklyn. And he has never forgotten about the people at the bottom of the economic status as well as the middle class, unlike some other people who was not born in a wealthy family but became wealthy later on have ignored the struggles of everyday Americans. His concerns are beyond speeches and statements, but also in actions and demeanor. His tenure as Burlington mayor was a clear evidence of his concerns about the well-beings as ordinary Americans. In 1987, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Sanders as one of America's best mayors.

# 5. forgiveness/magnanimous (OK, maybe "magnanimous" is too much) 

After his lost in the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders endorsed and supported Hillary Clinton for the presidency and was even concerned with Hillary's chance to be the president, even though he was well aware that Hillary Clinton had cheated. I am not sure if most people can do the same if they were in Bernie Sanders' position. Bernie Sanders doesn't seem to hold grudges against people who have wronged or viciously attacked him. 

# 6. politeness/humility 

While most politicians promote themselves whenever they can, Bernie Sanders seems to always talk about the concerns of the American people. As a matter of fact, throughout the primary, Bernie Sanders always bring up the issues that Americans care about and offer genuine and concrete policy solutions for those issues. He attacks his opponents on the issues and claims rather than on the person's character (except when it's relevant to the issue), and his attacks are always fair, evidence-based, and not overbearing. 

Of course, such politeness has its shortcoming during campaigning for an office; the candidate is supposed to tout his accomplishment as the evidence of his ability. 

# 7. able to see the big picture 

Even though he knew that Hillary Clinton had cheated her way to the nomination, Bernie Sanders accepted defeat in the Democratic primary in 2016 and endorsed Hillary Clinton for the presidency after all primary elections were over and continued to support and speak at Hillary Clinton's rallies throughout the general election. He decided to put aside his grievances when the primary was over, when most people probably wouldn't swallow this bitter pill. His support for Hillary Clinton was not out of love or favoritism, but out of necessity to prevent Trump presidency, he knew that a Trump presidency would be terrible for the country. (You can argue if his tactic was the right move, but that's his motivation.) 

# 8. down-to-earth quality 

Bernie Sanders never comes off as pretentious, like so many politicians today. His clothes don't seem to be as expensive as other politicians, and even his hair is unkempt (not that it matters). But it does indicate what Bernie Sanders focuses on on the daily basis: certainly not his appearance. And he certainly doesn't spend his campaign money on professional public image handlers. 

The content of his speech doesn't seem to be poll-tested and overly contrived like those of so many politicians. That's why the speeches of so many politicians appear superficial and phony. By comparison, Bernie's speech seems to be written by himself (I'm not sure even if he has a speechwriter). Bernie Sanders isn't a good orator like Obama, but still he is able to attract a large crowd because of his straightforward, popular, progressive message, which Bernie Sanders genuinely believes in.

# 9. lack of scandals/corruption

Although this is certainly not unique to Bernie Sanders, it is certainly rare to see a politician so scandal-free. This says a lot about his character in a very corrupt political world in America. This brings to my last point. 


# 10. Basic human decency 

It's rather sad to see so many politicians simply lack human decency, especially on the Republican side. People who hold powerful positions especially need this quality in order to serve the public. This again says a lot about American political culture. He is what you expected as a good person, I'm sorry that I can't elaborate much further than I have already done in the points I mentioned above.

__________

By the way, Bernie Sanders joined the race in 2016 probably as a protest candidate; no one seemed to want to compete against the quintessential corporate-friendly candidate Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary (I think we know why by now) or fight for ordinary Americans. But as his popularity surged, he decided to take to go for the Democratic nominee to thanks to the enthusiasm of his supporters. 

# Conclusions: 

**I think Bernie Sanders is a president candidate that you will probably only see once in your lifetime. I am not sure if he will be a great president (but I think it's very likely given past records), but it would be a real shame to pass off the opportunity for him to be the president.**This Prague Declaration lays out seven urgent steps the democratic West must do now to stop the Russian aggression.  Response of Western democracies  to this threat has been “weak”, because “large part of the Western political establishment still does not recognize the kind of threat we are facing”.In Australia, they have compulsory voting.  If you don't vote, you receive a $90 fine.  Because of this, voter turnouts in Australia are incredibly high.  Just recently, Australia has had an 80% voter turnout for the vote to legalize same-sex marriage.  

It made me think that we need compulsory voting here in the states.  I know that it would most likely not pass because Republicans KNOW they will lose if more turn out to vote.  It's a known fact that higher voter turn-out equals a Democratic win.  The GOP won't like this... But if we managed to enact such a law, we could greatly improve our country.https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/15/16653698/ceos-investment-tax-reform


Damn, I bet he thought they would lie for the cameras!Warning: this rant is rather unhinged because frankly I'm in an EXTRA shitty mood, and need to vent about how much I HATE the Oregon job market.

But I decided to post it anyway so people could give me some constructive criticism on how I could view things in a better light, cause rn, I hate everything about living here.


Kate Brown received 250k from Michael Bloomberg link:
https://votesmart.org/candidate/campaign-finance/2990/kate-brown

Who is Michael Bloomberg? He worked in Wall Street for 15 years before entering into politics. He was the Republican mayor of New York City from 2001-2007. He received the endorsement of Rudy Giuliani, during his campaign and is now promoting neo liberalism throughout America. He is the 10th richest person in the world, and has a net worth of 47.8 billion according to Forbes.

https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#1d5f5c08251c

Why would a republican donate so much money to a "Democratic" governor. I use the term lightly, considering Kate Brown is the Oregon version of Hillary Clinton. She's unpopular among voters a lot of counties, whereas her Senate counterparts were able to win those counties. Check out the election results in the link below. Kate lost Deschutes, Gilliam, Wasco, Marion, Polk, Yamhill, Tillamook, Jefferson, and Jackson counties, all of which were counties that Democrat Ron Wyden won! Scroll down to the senate/governors race, compare and contrast. I wouldn't be surprised if the reason why Ron Wyden won these counties isn't because of his long tenure as Senator, rather his early endorsement of Bernie Sanders is what appealed to a lot of Left Leaning voters who are feed up with the status quo.

NYT election results, Oregon: https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/oregon

At this point, I'm very reluctant to even vote for Kate Brown again. No I won't vote republican, but I would love to see her get primaried. 12 months of unemployment, and 6 months of collecting cans for a fucking living will make you change your mind about a political candidate really quick. Huh, the same politician that wants to drug test cannabis for people working in grocery has my vote? NOT AT FUCKING ALL! Thanks Michael Bloomberg for corrupting or politics, and thanks Kate Brown for making sure Michael Bloomberg matters more than your own constituents! I'm about ready to move out of Oregon, I have an impossible time trying to get a job here, send in hundreds of applications to no avail yet all I see on her Facebook page is her bragging about the unemployment being at a record low. Way to rub it in what a loser I am! At record unemployment im still NOT able to get a fucking job. You don't even know how demoralizing it is to fill out hundreds of applications to restaurants and store all for fucking NOTHING. You come in for an interview and they give the job to a FUCKING HIGH SCHOOLER WHO LIVES OFF HIS PARENTS! Man, that really hurts, not to mention the DOZENS of times this same thing as happened to me. While I'm stuck being unemployed for over a year, they are giving the jobs I applied for to high schoolers?! Holy fuck that annoys me so fucking much. Where were the jobs when I was in high school?! Oh right, not like I could drive to work since I didn't have a car, lived in a rural area and public transportation was a 45 minute walk in the rain. And that's just TO the bus stop.

At this point, I'd rather live in Soviet Russia than Oregon. I don't give a fuck if you like living in Oregon, I don't give a fuck if Kate Brown has the highest approval rating compared to other governors. She ain't helping anyone get a job besides the lazy Texans who blame immigrants taking their jobs, then move to Oregon cause they wanna take our jobs! From seeing the amount of Texas license plates throughout beaverton, I wouldn't be surprised if she had a hard time winning re election. I've never seen so many cars from Texas in my life. Yea that's antidotal but I think barring cannabis users from employment, advocating banning guns, and bragging about the unemployment rate while people are still struggling to find work. They always point and say "look at unemployment it's at an all time low." YEA! FOR ADULTS THAT ARE 30 YEARS OR OVER! WHAT ABOUT THE COLLEGE STUDENT THAT CAN BARELY AFFORD TO PUT GAS IN THEIR TANK?! WHAT ABOUT THE COUNTLESS KIDS WHO HAVE TO DROP OUT OF COLLEGE BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL INSTABILITY TEMPORARILY! NOT A SINGLE SHIT, FUCK, or DAMN IS GIVEN ABOUT US! The youth unemployment is at 12.4%! But no body gives a single fuck if you're unemployed and young. It's all your fault if an employer decides to call you in for an interview just to waste your time and gas getting there, then not even being able to get that shitty job that they already treat their employees like mules! And people wonder why filling out job applications makes me wanna cry sometimes, ITS CAUSE NO BODY WANTS TO FUCKING HIRE ME HERE AND NO MATTER HOW FUCKING GOOD I AM TO PEOPLE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH BS IM FORCED TO GO THRU BECAUSE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, NO MATTER HOW MANY FUCKING APPLICATIONS I FILL OUT, NOTHING IS EVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANYONE! Ain't no felonies, ain't no misdemeanors, NOTHING! And yet I get looked at like I'm some sorta criminal when I'm picking cans out the trash! You can thank the "free" market, and capitalism for that one! FUCK THESE BOURGEOIS PILES OF SHIT! FUCK THESE FAT CATS STUFFING THEMSELVES WHILE THE PROLETARIAT IS STUCK DIGGING CANS OUT THE TRASH TO MAKE ENDS MEAT! FUCK THE PIECE OF SHIT EMPLOYERS WHO DONT GIVE A FUCK WETHER YOU LIVE OR DIE! THE ONLY THING THAT BEING UNEMPLOYED FOR SO LONG HAS TAUGHT ME IS THAT ORGANIZED LABOR IS NEEDED TO STOP THIS EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT AND MAYBE COMMUNISM ISNT SUCH A BAD THING IF THAT MEANS JOBS WILL BE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE WORKING CLASS! Not like Kate Brown will give a fuck, considering she's taking huge sums of money from Wall Street. ARGH, fucking corporatists,...smh.

I was already having a bad day, then I hear about this kinda shit and it makes me so angry to know that good people don't make it as far as the bad ones. I've already got enough things stressing me out, the last thing this country needs is another groper. Franken should resign, if we are gonna hold republicans to the standards that they should resign if they sexually assault someone, we must definitely hold democrats to the same standards! Man, I am so angry and disappointed at Al Franken rn, way to lead the resistance against pussy grabbing trump! *facepalms* ARGH go fuck yourself Al Franken and leave office while you're at it!
I'm a millennial but on the older side like David, and as such I was around to see one of the most ridiculous movies of all time as a child.  The movie was called Weekend at Bernies, where a guy dies, but some people that found out need him to be alive so they don't get kicked out or have to go elsewhere (I actually forgot the reason why he can't die too early, but it does not matter).  Their solution is to pretend he is still alive, and prop up his lifeless body and have it move around and interact as if its still alive...

The results were so ridiculous that no sentient person looking at this figure would buy it... but that was the same sense I get from Jesse Lee Peterson as a host.  A literal walking corpse of a host... and I guess that is popular with the Trump supporting crowd.


His arguments, his "logic" is so broken and malformed, such an abomination of reason and sense, it's inconceivable to me anyone could actually listen to him and think he was making sense.  But just like the movie, apparently a lot of people are fooled and buy into it completely.1)  **Trump has violated the Constitution in many aspects.** I don't think I need to elaborate on that, I think most of us have known. 

&gt; "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors." 


# If you have the facts on your side, your case for impeachment should be strong, if you care to promote it; and it won't be frowned upon even if it fails. 

2) **Since you have facts on your back, your narrative would be much stronger (if the Democratic politicians care to promote the narrative, which most of them for some reason don't want to do), making members of Congress who don't support it look like they are not doing their constitutional duty.** And of course, the people who oppose impeachment or removal of the president are indeed not doing their constitutional duty. And the Republican members of Congress will most oppose impeachment. The Democrats can easily point out they are putting their party before the country; they are rather willing to protect the president even he violates the Constitution and broke the law. 

3) **The Republicans voters are already fired up as much as they possibly could,** Trump always says the Democrats are obstructionists whenever a bill fails or whenever bad things happen. I don't think it will get any worse than now.

4) 

## **Around half of Americans support the impeachment.** 

&gt;Nearly half of all Americans support impeaching President Donald Trump, according to a poll by Public Policy Polling (PPP) – a record high since the group began asking the question.

&gt;At the end of October, 49% of voters surveyed by the Democratic polling firm said they would support impeaching the President. Forty-one per cent said they would oppose it.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-impeachment-poll-high-americans-latest-a8030221.html

Back in August, 2017... 

Four in ten Americans now support the impeachment of President Donald Trump — a ten point jump in the last six months — according to a new poll from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI).

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/poll-40-percent-now-support-trump-impeachment-n793251


5) Trump is ruining this country in other ways other than signing and pushing for bills. 

## Remember,**Trump has the power of issuing executive orders, which has the power of law. The administration doesn't need to pass any law to change how laws are enforced.**

Some of the executive orders issued and long-standing executive orders repealed are not even popular among regular Republican politicians. From the immigration ban, to dismantling a refugee program for Central American immigrants. 

&gt; Reducing regulations (January 30) 
&gt;This executive order requires any executive department or agency that proposes a new regulation to identify two regulations to be repealed. 

(I'm not even sure how it can be implemented)

http://www.newsweek.com/trump-obama-executive-order-president-684368

TRUMP, THE HYPOCRITICAL IMPERIAL PRESIDENT, IS ON PACE TO DOUBLE OBAMA’S NUMBER OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS

# Mike Pence is a run-of-the-mill republican politician who has experience running the executive branch; he won't run this government to the ground; and he won't sell out this country; he's not authoritarian

1) Trump has the power to make appointments. **The appointments that Trump has been putting forward are much worse than any previous Republican administration**: they are unqualified, have conflict of interest, don't believe in the mission of the government agency. **I doubt that Mike Pence would appoint these people.** 

2) **Trump is shamelessly enriching himself and his family using the power of the presidency**. Mike Pence wouldn't do that, he has no business operations, he's been a career politician. 

4) **Trump is working in the interest of Russia**, Mike Pence wouldn't do that, since he's not involved in the Russian-collusion. I don't think Mike Pence is not subject to Russian blackmail as of now. And there won't be any reason for Russians to support Trump once he's impeached and removed, even though it will continually meddle future elections. The Russian government doesn't like either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. 

5) **Mike Pence, as horrible as he is, is a run-of-the-mill career politician. He knows how to keep the government running, and he is more or less competent to do his job and is responsible.** Trump is literally asleep at the wheels; he is ignorant, narcissistic, impulsive, rude, and utterly irresponsible. All he does is to delegate important things to other people without any supervision. 

6) Trump's policies are actually more extreme than the policies of the Republican Party, not less. Trump cares much less about the optics than other Republican politicians. Trump's appointees are much more ideological extreme and driven than previous Republican administrations. 

7) **Trump is very hostile to the media, much more so than other Republican politicians.**

8) **Trump has authoritarian tendencies, Mike Pence doesn't; Pence is rather meek, in my opinion.** 

9) **And I haven't mentioned Trump's impulsive and belligerent nature, his willful ignorance, his narcissism, etc.**

# David Pakman is overthinking. 

In the case of Bill Clinton, the removal failed simply because there was not enough evidence to support the claim that he failed to do his job. This simply fact persuaded some Republican senators to not vote for the removal. And most Americans thought the Republican Party was playing politics and impeachment was excessive. 

The Trump impeachment is different. Trump's popularity is low and his gross incompetence is apparent, he is being investigated for Russian collusion, which only gets closer to Trump's circle. # The electoral college is not what it used to be 

The electoral college has gone through a series of changes over time. But I am here to explore the changes relevant to the 2016 election and why the electoral college failed to its intended purpose of denying demagogues or disqualified individuals like Trump to the presidency. Of course, electoral college has many problems that produce undemocratic results, which I won't delve into. 

# political parties discourages/disallows faithless electors 

The founders disliked political parties and thought they were dangerous, and they certainly didn't take political parties into the account in the establishment of electoral college. However, soon after the Constitution was drafted (for the second time), political parties formed (although they were more like caucuses in politics today in term of party structure) soon after George Washington finished his second term. And unfortunately, they didn't do anything to ban political parties; the matter is silent in the Constitution. 

&gt; Washington warns the people that political factions may seek to obstruct the execution of the laws created by the government, or to prevent the branches of government from enacting the powers provided them by the constitution. Such factions may claim to be trying to answer popular demands or solve pressing problems, but their true intentions are to take the power from the people and place it in the hands of unjust men.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington%27s_Farewell_Address#The_Constitution_and_political_factions

Electoral college was obviously intended to be unconstrained by the wishes of the electorate; they should have the ability to be unfaithful. However, **state laws today prevent elector to vote against the wishes of the electorate they represent.** 

**The electors were originally intended to be chosen by the citizens in the district. Nowadays, electors are chosen by their respective political party, or nominated by the voters in the primary.** Political parties usually pick highly royal individuals as electors and punish unfaithful electors.** In some states, the faithless elector vote is void (not valid). In other words, **the electoral college is only a meaningless holdover from the earlier times in this regard; electors essentially have lost their independence.** 

# the two party system makes it worse 

The two party system only makes it worse, since political parties do not bargain with one another as it would be in a multi-party system. **In a multi-party system, parties rarely have the control over 50% of the seats (in this case, electors), this means they have to let the Congress decide the president and the vice president. In the case that faithless electors are allowed, the political parties will bargain with each other and build a party coalition to obtain the majority of electors.** 

In the case of multi-party system, political parties have to bargain. **During the bargain, it is unlikely that more than one parties will agree to elect a completely unqualified individual to be the president.** Obviously, this wouldn't happen in Congress today, as the Congress now is dominated by two political parties; whichever party controls the majority seats in the Senate gets to choose the vice president, and whichever party is the majority in the House picks the vice president. Again, members of both chambers lose independence as parties will impose them to vote with the party in such important votes.

The Electoral College for Dummies: How it Works
One of the problems I see in politics is "playing for a team". the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are institutions who cemented their power post Civil War, then realigned, based on name recognition. What if we could make sure that no party going forward were able to use the same name in multiple elections.

I envision this as a processes where an individual goes to a centralized office which distributed random party names. For example you could have

1: The Rose Party
2: The Brown Party
3: The Sky Party

I would institute laws to make sure the names of the party's are respectable and no one could get a preference. Therefore every election when people are wondering who to vote for they are forced to look at each party's platform. 

Among other issues, I think it's a problem for a party's name to be used for too long because it can cement their power and if the party has changed beliefs, but the people still think their party stands for what it used to this will help break up that relationship.

&gt; ### What You Need To Know: 

&gt;✓ Conspiracy is one of the main instruments of Russian propaganda 

&gt;✓ Russian propaganda isn't about convincing people, but more about starting a confusion 

&gt;✓ RT actively recruits people who come from a fringe &amp; conspiracy background

Maybe the lack of information is meant to be a mystery to hide their real wealth, but still it's important to know. 

We do know that ultra wealthy people (or multinational corporations) are no more likely to reinvest into companies to hire more workers or trickle-down with the extra income if they are given tax breaks. However, do the ultra-rich do with their wealth??? 

Some possible options I can think of: 

1. Do they speculate on the economy, for example, by putting their money in a hedge fund? If so, how much of their wealth or income is put in there? 

2. Buy luxury goods, such as fine art, expensive rare handbags, expensive cars, yacht, antique furniture, etc. If so, how much of their income is spent in this category? 

3. Buy real estate, such as multiple houses and mansions, and commercial and residential real estate as investment. 

4. hide their money in foreign banks, such as Switzerland, to avoid paying taxes. (If the purpose to avoid paying income tax, they will eventually find ways to funnel the money back and use that money) 

5. Buying shares of publicly traded companies directly as long-term investment. 

6. deposit into banks. (I don't think most of their money are in savings account, which makes very little sense economically due to very low return.) 

7. buy index funds. Probably the best way to invest for laymen (which the super wealthy are not; they hire financial advisers to manage their money and find ways to lower their taxes). It certainly isn't as nearly lucrative as other options. 

8. set up a venture capital fund and give seed money to start-ups that they think will handsomely profit upon IPO. (This, in some sense, would be trickle-down.)

9. Of course, some of their money is spent on charitable donations (if they are charitable), or set up private foundations that fund various non-profit organizations and other pet projects.

# Just for clarification, these people are not cheering for Putin's regime. But it's more more subtle. 

## Here are familiar themes that what they believe in with some variations. All of these positions benefit the Putin regime: 

1) US "deep state" (or government agencies and Congress) is looking for ways to start a new Cold War with Russia, which we shouldn't do. Instead, we should have a friendly relationship with Russia. 

2) There is no Trump-Russian collusion. It's a hysteria cooked up by the DNC and the neoconservatives. [Granted, we would like to see more evidence that DNC was hacked by Russian hackers hired by the Russian government. But such evidence may reveal the methodology and the sources of US intelligence agencies.]

3) US should not intervene domestic affairs in other countries (e.g., Syria and Ukraine), because US always make things worse. American government should not be killing innocent civilians by supporting authoritarian regimes, such as the Saudi government. 

4) US is down in the gutter, US government is hypocritical, horribly corrupt, dominated by the interests of corporations, the ultra-wealthy, and career politicians. Elections are rigged. There is no real democracy in America. So why is America criticizing other countries? (In other words, US government is as bad as authoritarian regimes.) [I wonder why they are not offering some constructive criticism? Maybe because they do not want US to get better.]

5) US corporate media has become the cheerleaders of America's pro-war agenda, inciting a new Cold war. 

Their creative usage of loaded words, "spook industry", "neo-Nazis" when referring to Ukranian protesters, "death economy", hinder critical thinking and derogatively label their targets without showing the evidence. 

# I'm here just to give you a few examples: 

1. Ed Schultz, for example, is subtly pro Donald Trump. He says he tells like it is and not bought by anyone, even though he says inappropriate things some times. [Seriously?] And Schultz also says Trump is a middle-of-the-road guy. [I guess you can only say that by believing Trump's rhetoric blindly.]

2. Thom Hartmann, constantly steers away from the collusion between Trump and Russia whenever the links between them are revealed; he instead focuses on the incompetence and gross corruption of Donald Trump, and giving excuses for Russian aggression by pointing on the wrongdoings of American foreign policy. He wants US to have a friendly relationship with Russia, even though Russia is punching US in the stomach. (I don't think this is how a friendly relationship is built on. A friendly relationship comes in both ways.) 

3. Mike Papantonio wanted to give Donald Trump "a chance" when he was elected to be the president. By then, it was pretty apparent Donald Trump was going to be a far more corrupt and incompetent government than any previous administration. 

+ Mike papantonio also subscribes a version of the "deep state" conspiracy (or " the spook industry" as he calls it). Sam Sader and Mike Papantonio actually had a disagreement about it. Papantonio doesn't like whistleblowers revealing the ties between Donald Trump and Russia. Of course, he calls the Trump-Russian Collusion a "hysteria", and accusing some within Congress and the FBI and CIA want to start a war with Russia by leaking these stories.

Dangerous Democrats Think Stoking New Cold War Fears Will Win Elections - The Ring Of Fire

# Why are they working with RT? 

Because they want a prominent media platform and want to get paid. (I guess beggars can't be choosers.) RT knows that corporate media don't host them, and that's why RT is so alluring. 

# Why is RT attracting progressive hosts? 

It gives RT the legitimacy it needs as a genuine media company, rather than a Kremlin mouthpiece (which is what it really is).

This is completely irrelevant to the Ring of Fire network, I just want to mention it: 

sidenote: Larry King hosts Larry King Now and Politicking with Larry King on RT America. From 1985 to 2010, he hosted the nightly interview television program Larry King Live on CNN.**It should be obvious to political commentators, political observers and voters, we should question both the source and the content. However, frequently we have forgot about it.** 

## Some questions we should be asking, even though we may not have answers to: 

### Question the source. 

1. is the source credible? Does he/she/the organization have a good track records of telling the truth? 

2. does the source have ulterior motive? If so, does the ulterior motive interfere with the authenticity of the story? 

### Question the content: 

1. is the content verifiable? 

2. What part of it is likely to be false? What part of it is likely to be true? (errors or falsehood in a party of the story do not necessarily the whole thing is false.) 

3. Who will benefit or hurt by the content?


# A case in point: the email leaks during 2016 election 

**Most progressives during the 2016 election mainly focus on the content of these leaks, ignoring the motives of hackers and Wikileaks. And many progressive commentators even questioned the official government story that it was Russians who hacked into the DNC and Podesta emails (fearing it was just another propaganda like the Iraq war -- even though the circumstances are vastly different.)**

At the same time, DNC is putting the following accusations: 

1) illegality of hacking, 

2) foreign interference of US elections, 

3) the sources being Russian (foreign) hackers funded by the Russian government, and their motives to hurt Hillary Clinton's chances, and 

4) Wikileaks was working with the Russian government. 

**Of course, most progressive media covered the content of the leaks extensively in order to get the much needed validation that the DNC had violated its neutrality charter and had actively helped Hillary Clinton to win the Democratic nomination. The email leaks also exposed the corruption within the Democratic party that the progressives want to expose.** 

And on the other hand, DNC is trying to distract the audience by focusing on the source, in order to control the damage that these emails can incur on the credibility and perception of Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton. 

In the meantime, mainstream media are simply chasing whatever next titillating scandal whether it has actual basis or not, be it the accusation that Russian was meddling the election, to the content of the email leaks (albeit reluctantly), or Hillary Clinton's private email scandal (which is unrelated to Wikileaks), or Trump's genital grabbing scandal. Some members of the mainstream media have tried their best to bury the embarrassing details of Wikileaks emails. 

The conservative media are simply covering the content of the leaks without ever questioning the motive of Wikileaks and disputing the possibility that Russian hackers were responsible for the hacking. The conservative media even got friendly with Wikileaks. 

# The moral of the story: avoid unwittingly advancing the narrative of malevolent actors 

Obviously, it is convenient for the progressive and conservative media outlets to cover the side of the story that fits their worldviews or serve their interests. **The media should be more thoughtful in covering the stories like this, in order to avoid to unwittingly spread the narrative of pernicious actors.** **While the conservative media are hopelessly partisan and propagandadistic, we should hold the progressive media to a higher standard. Also, in politics, the correct worldview shouldn't be through the lens of good guys vs. bad guys. Many political actors have hidden motives for better or for worse.** I'm not saying the progressive media shouldn't have covered the email leaks, they should. But they should put the email leaks into a larger context. 

# Now, we know the truth (at least we think so): 

1) Ulterior motive: Wikileaks leaked the info in order to help Donald Trump to win and hurt Hillary's chances. Wikileaks and Donald Trump coordinate their effort in spreading the media coverage of leaked emails. Wikileaks has knowingly worked with the Russian government to spread the leaked emails. 

2) the US government's analysis is likely to be correct all along, even though they are very reluctantly to reveal the evidence. DNC was right in that Russian hackers funded by the Russian government hacked into their emails. 

3) the content of the email leaks from Wikileaks are truthful as far as we can tell. And the collusion between Hillary Clinton and the DNC is real. And the corruption of the Democratic Party is real.

So my personal politics are quite liberal but occasionally I do enjoy reading a book or listening to a podcast from the other side, to get the ‘right wing’ or ‘conservative’ perspective. I recently read Douglas Murray’s book “The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity &amp; Islam” and to my surprise, absolutely loved it!!

Even though, British right wingers are generally saner and less foaming at the mouth than their American counterparts, I was nevertheless shocked at realising how dire the situation is in Western Europe with regards to Islam and how calmly &amp; factually Murray documents it in his book. It’s a must read for every liberal - especially the delusional ones who don’t understand the threat that Islam poses to the world.

Can I please request you David, to bring him on as a guest on your show and discuss this book please? Plz make it happen mate :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa7GAvOXymA

How Porn Creates the John: Porn, Trafficking and the Social Construction of Masculinity"




Given Trump's extensive money laundry dealings with Russian oligarchs and other criminals, he should have been indicted years ago. 

Possible reasons: 

+ the justice Department simply doesn't have enough resource to investigate the people they want to. 

+ Maybe the Justice Department doesn't want to investigate rich and powerful people, in the fear that their budget will get cut or for some other reasons.If you don't know what a button button is, it's a button that makes it harder to quickly switch magazines from an ar15 for example. They also have a 10 round magazine capacity limit. Honestly, that isn't so unreasonable. I'm really not in the camp of banning AR15's, so I see this as a viable option to stop mass shootings. There haven't been a whole lot of mass shootings in California recently, that's probably because AR15 owners have to have a bullet button installed in their rifle to make it legal. It's a waste of time for writing the speech, waste of resource for the media to cover it and the White house staff to attend it. 

I know it's tiny compared to other government waste, but it is still ridiculous and pointless. 

And yes, I know the history of this ritual. Thanks a lot, Ronald Reagan (sarcastic). 

At the time, Reagan was facing questions over the Iran-Contra affair, on whether or not he would consider pardoning Oliver North (who had yet to be tried for his involvement in the affair); Reagan conjured the notion of the turkey pardon as a joke to deflect those questions.[1][10] Reagan did not pardon a turkey in his final year as President in 1988, but his successor, George H. W. Bush, instituted the turkey pardon as a permanent part of the presentation beginning his first year in office, 1989, in response to the protests of animal rights activists.[3]

Oh, by the way, the feathers of domestic turkeys we commonly see are all white (they are all in the same breed: Broad Breasted White), wild turkeys are much more colorful and agile. It's rather difficult to catch a wild turkey. 

Broad Breasted White turkeys are bred for size at the expense of longer life, making them prone to health problems associated with obesity such as heart disease, respiratory failure and joint damage. For many years, the pardoned turkeys were documented to have very short lives after their pardoning, frequently dying within a year of being pardoned;[12][17] for comparison, a wild or heritage turkey has a lifespan of at least five years.[18] 
Title correction: why liberalism (except for classical liberalism) is always the way of the future and progress, **conservatism** is always an obstacle for change and progress

# A philosophical(?) analysis of liberals and conservatives and the progress

**The conservatives are, by definition, is to keep the way things are or to go back to the past, no matter how wrong they are. The liberals don't always get things right, but they are always trying to push for progress and trying to correct past mistakes by experimentation with new ideas. By contrast, the conservatives always put obstacles on change and progress. If the conservatives won all the time, we would probably be stuck in 17th century America and feudalism in Europe.** 


Just to give you some examples, the two issues on which the society has progressed over the years:

Slavery --&gt; segregation --&gt; discrimination (we're about here) --&gt; stereotypes

Voting rights: property-owning white men --&gt; white men --&gt; all whites --&gt; all humans (who are citizens)

**Of course, history doesn't have to have a direction and history is not deterministic, but thanks to the efforts of liberals and progressives, the society has made better.** 

# Differences in the justification of the policies between conservatives and liberals today


Moreover, the modern liberals tend to use factual and evidence and logic based arguments to justify their polices, whereas the arguments that the conservatives make to justify their policies are increasingly based on the moral grounds and their beliefs, and increasingly deviating from evidence and reality.



# sidenote: The association of the Democratic party with liberalism and the Republican Party with conservatism is not always the case 

The fact that the Democratic Party promotes liberalism and the Republican Party promotes conservationism has not always been the case historically. **Two major parties in the US have realigned with the voters by changing their platforms over time.** (I haven't made up my mind that the current association between dems/liberals, and republicans/conservatives is simply a historical coincidence, or something caused by larger social forces or if it is a historical trend in Western democracy.)

+ The Republican party (led by President Abraham Lincoln) emancipated the slaves in 1863 while the Democratic Party (led by President Lyndon B. Johnson) ended the racial segregation in the 1964. 

+ The Republican Party (led by Theodore Roosevelt) broke up the trusts (conglomerates; big corporations) to increase competition and passed major food safety regulations and established the Food and Drugs administration in the early 1900s. On the other hand, The Democratic Party led by Franklin D. Roosevelt passed major market regulations and social safety net laws, many of which still exist today (despite the attempts by the Republican Party to dismantle them).




At least this didn't come out on the regular show. On a related bonus show topic:  I was in London during a rare heat wave one summer and was met with incredulous looks from vendors as I searched in vain for an iced tea. So Pat might be right re no iced coffee in England.?All last summer I was treated like the boy who cried wolf when I tried to expose this issue. People told me I belong in a mental institution just for daring to speak truth about the nightmares and human rights violations that go on in these places. So with all this talk about sexual harassment in the workplace I think it's time to talk about abuse in mental hospitals because no body gives a fuck! 
-solidarity confinement 
-physical/sexual abuse 
-forcing people to take medications against their will
-no contact with the outside world, you may get a phone call, maybe, if they are nice and in a good mood
-no opportunities for higher education when you're stuck in there! 
-No time frame on when you could get out, meaning you can be stuck there for years for no other reason than "because"

And I just scratched the surface. I could go on, but the only time I've ever had a post removed by a moderator on here was regarding mental health, so I'll keep it PG13, because the stigmas regarding mental health are still very present, and VERY dangerous. 

Watch this clip from Buzzfeed about mental institution abuse:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TVYd9iUcB4M

I wonder if the reason why many mass killers are afraid to seek help is because they are afraid shit like this might happen to them, so they retaliate against everyone they can for not listening to their cries for help. 

"But Trevor, you can just sue them!"
Mmm good luck trying to convince a jury! they will just say the doctors were in the right because of your mental illness. Most cases regarding this issue are never brought to court, and the so few that are, the prosecution rarely wins on behalf of those abused in mental Institutions. 

Bernie Sanders doesn't give a fuck
Donald Trump doesn't give a fuck
Hillary Clinton doesn't give a fuck
Your governor doesn't give a fuck
Your police department doesn't give a fuck
Hospital staff don't give a fuck
Congress doesn't give a fuck
The House of Representatives doesn't give a fuck
The judge don't give a single motherfucking rat ass about people being abused in these places cause in the minds of most people, the mentally ill probably did something to deserve that. Just like the girl that was raped because "her skirt was too short or something." ARGH and people wonder why I hate Oregon, it's cause almost everyone who I try to talk about this issue thinks I'm crazy for even bringing it up. 
I emailed Kate Brown, I got only the automated response 
I emailed Ron Wyden, no response, not even one of those automated emails that's says "thanks for sharing your thoughts,...blah blah blah,...your opinion means a lot to us."
I considered emailing Jeff Merkley, but why? If the other representatives won't listen to me about this issue, why would I think Jeff is any different? Maybe I'll try later
I posted about this on Facebook and I got the most insulting responses about this issue. "Trevor, STFU! YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH,...blah blah blah,...I hope you rot away in a mental institution,...blah blah blah,...your words are promoting violence because you make me wanna punch you!"
I'm  just a bag of blood and bones to everyone, I hope don't get any on the carpet after they beat the shit out of me or they'll kick me some more for CHOOSING to bleed. Honestly, maybe Machiavelli was right, *most* people are EVIL by their very nature. 2016-2017 made me lose my faith in humanity real quick. https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/14/520080606/murdoch-and-trump-an-alliance-of-mutual-interest

What kind of increased taxation / tax loopholes closing would be needed at this point to create a budget Surplus instead of a deficit for the United States?

I'm curious exactly how much taxes would have to be increased so we could start paying down the debt, instead of adding to it every year.I heard about this on the Thom Hartmann show and went to look it up and I find this absolutely insane, and incalculably vindictive.

Trump Staff Keeps Him Happy with "Delusional" Good Polls



# Trump's explanations:

## 1. emails keep records of correspondences, which can be used for evidence in court. 

**It is the same reason that the secretive former vice president Dick Cheney avoids using emails or leaving other electronic trace; he prefers to talk in person privately.**

&gt; And in a 2005 interview on Howard Stern's radio show, Trump talked about friends of his "under indictment right now because they sent emails to each other about how they're screwing people."



## 2. Also, emails and computers can be hacked into, which exposes his wrongdoings. 

This certainly reminds me of DNC hacking and Podesta email hacking controversies

&gt;"I'm not an email person," Trump said during a July press conference in which he invited Russia to uncover and release Clinton's deleted emails. "I don't believe in it because I think it can be hacked, for one thing. 

## 3. It complicates lives, according to Trump

&gt;"I think the computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole, you know, age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what's going on. We have speed and we have a lot of other things, but I'm not sure you have the kind of security you need," Trump told reporters Thursday evening.

What now, Germany? [About coalition talks and the procedure involved in the event that a coalition government cannot be achieved.]

# First some background about some of the parties in Germany (very, very briefly): 

**Free Democratic Party (FDP)**: classical liberals.

**Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)**: center-right, hesitant about progressive taxation, slightly less governmental intervention, a bit religious (Christianity, pro-family values), pro-European Union, more government surveillance and more pro-military. Basically, a much watered-down version of the Republican Party. 

**Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD)**: center-left. For social democracy. It's been moving a bit to the conservative side on economic issues in recent decades, much like the Democratic Party. 

&gt; Social democracy is a political, social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a capitalist economy, as well as a policy regime involving a commitment to representative democracy, measures for income redistribution and regulation of the economy in the general interest and welfare state provisions.[1][2][3] 

**Alternative for Germany (Alternative für Deutschland; AfD)**: Nationalism, their ideology is very much neo-nazism, without explicitly said so. 

**Alliance '90/The Greens (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen)**: basically Green politics. A more successful version of the Green Party in the US. 

**The Left (Die Linke)**: a more progressive version of the center left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).

Future Of Germany's Merkel In Doubt As Coalition Talks Collapse

_____________
The SPD's leader and Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz and other party leaders stated that the SPD would not continue the current grand coalition government after unsatisfactory election results.[17] 

Following the SPD's announcement that it would return to the opposition, the media speculated that Chancellor Angela Merkel might need to form a Jamaica coalition (black-yellow-green) with the Free Democrats and the Greens as that is the only viable coalition without the AfD or The Left, both of which had been ruled out by Merkel as coalition partners before the election.[18] 

On 9 October 2017 Merkel officially announced that she would invite the Free Democrats (libertarians) and the Greens for talks about building a coalition government starting on 18 October 2017.[19][20]

In the final days of the preliminary talks, the four parties had still failed to come to agreement on migration and climate issues.[21] Preliminary talks between the parties collapsed on 20 November after the FDP withdrew, arguing that the talks had failed to produce a common vision or trust.[22]

On 24 November, Schulz (from the center-left major party, SPD) said he wants party members to be polled on whether to form another grand coalition with CDU/CSU after a meeting with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier the day before.[23]

Trump Brings Up 'Pocahontas' At Event Honoring Navajo Code Talkers

____________
**There are so many things wrong with the statement.**

1) Pocahontas is a racial slur to refer to native Americans.

2) No one calls Elizabeth Warren as "Pocahontas", no one except for Donald Trump. (Donald Trump was referring to Elizabeth Warren when invoking the racial slur, as he has done many times to demean her.)

3) These code talkers were not in the American Continent before "us" the people with European ancestry, their ancestors were here before the European ancestors were. 

Trump then said, "I like you, because you're special." A classic Trump compliment that has become an empty and meaningless platitude at this point.

&gt;Three former Navajo Code Talkers joined the president on Monday, including Peter MacDonald, former chairman of the Navajo Nation. MacDonald shared the Marines' history and their role in keeping communications secret during World War II. MacDonald said the 13 surviving Code Talkers "still have one mission": to build a national Navajo Code Talker museum.

&gt;"Why? Because what we did truly represents who we are as Americans. America, we know, is composed of diverse community. We have different languages, different skills, different talents, and different religion," he said. "But when our way of life is threatened ... freedom and liberty that we all cherish, we come together as one. And when we come together as one, we are invincible. We cannot be defeated."

Yes, Donald Trump’s hands are actually pretty small

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/08/05/yes-donald-trumps-hands-are-actually-pretty-small/

### Excerpt: (links of the article can be accessed from the article itself)  

**Trump does, in fact, have unusually small hands. 15th percentile small.**

**Near the exit of Madame Tussauds wax museum in New York hangs a bronze cast of Trump’s hand. It’s been there since 1997, after the museum’s artists took impressions of Trump’s body parts to create a wax figure of him for their collection.**

**The Hollywood Reporter measured his hand to be 7.25 inches from his wrist to the tip of his middle finger.** (You can print out a life-sized outline of Trump’s hand here, and see how you stack up.)

**According to data from Ergonomics Center of North Carolina, the average American male’s hand is 7.61 inches long. Trump’s hand sits at the 15th percentile mark. That is, 85 percent of American men have larger hands than Trump.** As do a third of women.

But bear in mind, that is the 15th percentile among all American men. **Trump is tall – about 6-foot-3, half a foot taller than the 5-foot-9 average among American men, according to the Center for Disease Control. If Trump were compared to men of his stature rather than the public at large, his hands would comparatively be even smaller.**

## We cannot verify or debunk Trump’s claim about his penis

As for Trump's penis size, it actually should not be assessed qualitatively. As Trump was very promiscuous and participated drug-fueled sex parties in the 1980s and 1990s with young and underage female models. I'm sure there are a lot of witnesses, but as Trump likes to threaten lawsuits, I guess it's not likely we will know.

Measuring penis size accurately is actually quite tricky, because the penis size ( in terms of the length as well as the circumference) is a constant flux somewhere between fully flaccid and fully erect states.

I saw this article on The Liberal Gun Club, and it is clear that gun registration is only good for confiscating people's firearms. If you wanna own a gun and drink a fifth of jack Daniels a day, that's legal, but if you have a medical Marijuana license suddenly it's okay to take away your firearms?! How much more corrupt can it get?! First they Mandate GROCERY STORES take drug tests for THC and wastes people's time and money for a job they aren't gonna get anyway. Then they wanna take away our guns, what next?! If you're caught with cannabis, then we are gonna put a chasity belt on you for the rest of your life?! America is fucking garbage. First gun rights advocates act like they care about the second amendment unless it's someone they don't like, like blacks, liberals, pot smokers, women, then they get all up in arms and blame the black guy for trying to take away their guns. There needs to be a serious gun rights advocacy group on the left to counteract the corrupting influence of the NRA while also making sure people's second amendment rights aren't being violated. I'm so sick of republicans leading the charge for gun rights, when they refuse to defend the rights of those that they don't like and aren't like them.I'm surprised that this isn't being discussed on here in-depth.

What are some of the best scenarios and some of the worst scenarios?  

What is the likelihood that a Net Neutrality repeal can be blocked?

What are the chances of the Supreme Court acting against the repeal?  Can the Supreme Court save the internet if the repeal goes through the vote?  There are nations in which an open internet is considered a human right.  Perhaps if this thing goes through then we should push for the same rights here in the states.  If we made it a human right, net neutrality wouldn't even be necessary.

What are the chances of developing a public internet?

Can areas with ISP competition, as rare as that is, help to prevent the fast/slow lane and tier style ISP services?

omfg, The David Pakman show is getting all grown up now, and the theme is pretty damn catchy!  Is there a link to the theme by itself?  Whoever did it did a great job.I have been noticing on a laptop browser, when on Facebook I will catch small glimpses of a Justice Democrat post, then in the blink of an eye it gets replaced by a variety of different posts. I have seen Justice Democrat posts be replaced by either sponsored content or content posted from my friends. This doesn't seem to be happening on the mobile version. Has anyone else seen this?I heard that the moderate Republicans like Murkowski will vote on the tax plan. I think that they are doing so initially so they can flip-flop during reconciliation, where it will fail to pass, similar to what McCain did during the third attempt to repeal ACA.

It can reach the White House but the rich don't get a penny as Trump himself pockets the money himself, i.e personal corruption.

Laïcité: Is French state secularism too extreme?

# Two versions of secularism: 

1. In France, it's called Laïcité. **One is the absence of religion in public space, as faith is considered a private matter.** There will be no praying in public school, no display of conspicuous religious symbols in government and public school, and avoid expressing religious opinions in political discourse. **So, you wouldn't hear political leaders say, "God bless America", or "God bless France", or "In God we Trust", or swear into office on a bible**. This obviously clashes with wearing religious clothing in Public, such as wearing headscarf in public.

2. the American version is more relaxed. It is non-discriminatory policies on religious matter (at least this is my understanding of it). This means, no establishment of state religion, no preferential treatment to one religion in government policies.

______________________________
**There are noncontroversial activities that the government does that may be viewed as the violation of the church and the state** 

### 1.  Chaplains in Congress (in both Chambers) 

There is a Congressional Prayer Room in Capitol hill specifically designed for members of Congress to pray (it's not open to public). Chaplains always say a prayer before the opening of each session of both the House and the Senate. 

### 2.  Military Chaplains

There are Chaplains in the US army to say prayers as well supposed to boost troop morale and give counseling (whatever that means). And as you may have guessed it, almost all of chaplains are Catholic (I would argue that this has already violated the separation between the Church and the State). 

### 3. National Prayer Breakfast

It is hosted by members of the United States Congress and is organized on their behalf by The Fellowship Foundation, a Christian organization. Initially called the Presidential Prayer Breakfast, the name was changed in 1970 to the National Prayer Breakfast.
The damages caused are just as bad either way.In response to David Pakman's video:

REPORT: Trump Might Not Be a Liar, Just Delusional

# possibility 1: perception is reality

Donald Trump seems to subscribe to the saying, "perception is reality". 

He has repeatedly lied about the number of floors in his buildings (including Trump Tower), even though they are easily proven to be false (just count the number of floors as you go up; floor numbers are deceiving). 

So by repeating lying to others, he believes he can change other people's perception of reality, no matter how ludicrous it sounds. (**repetition makes it true; Illusory truth effect**) And he may believe that perception of reality is equally and more important than the reality itself. [of course, that doesn't make sense] And thus, he tells convenient lies to even closest advisers, let alone to the American people. 

http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tower-is-not-as-tall-as-trump-says-2016-10

Trump Tower is actually 10 floors shorter than Donald Trump says it is

# possibility 2: self-delusional 

There is also research that suggest a liar may repeat a lie so frequently that he might believe in it (effectively making him self-delusional). So he or people around him may repeat the same lie over and over again that Trump himself may actually believe in it. 
First of all, I find the topic of innate biological differences between conservatives and liberals and libertarians absolutely fascinating.

I eat those stories and videos delving into differences in the brains of the average conservative and liberal.  For example, apparently conservatives tend to have larger right amygdalas (the region of the brain that response to FEAR) while liberals tend to have a larger anterior cingulate gyrus (area that in part regulates processing new information for decision making).

There are also those survey studies by people like Jonathan Haidt showing that liberals focus on harm and fairness while having less concern for the other metrics where conservatives are stronger.  Same for libertarians which look more like liberals in some areas, but tend to score much lower on empathy (I know, who saw THAT one coming!).


But doesn't this evidence of differences in how we perceive reality and politics based on biological differences make some of our divides futile to bridge?

How do I make an argument for redistribution to a libertarian is they literally give zero fucks about the well being of someone not them?

How do I convince conservatives to have some concern for the fate of dreamers who were dragged to the US at age 2 and have made lives here, when they are not part of the conservative in group?

That last point is telling, I've read stories that conservatives are actually MORE giving and more likely to give to things like charity, even after controlling for church attendance, it's not that conservatives don't give a shit about anyone else, their problem (from my purview) is that their circles of concern are more narrow and not as broad as my liberal circle of concern.  So while some illegal dreamer might be outside the concern field for a conservative, they are still WELL within my sphere of concern for not wanting to uproot and displace.

But if part of those differences in attitude are based on how we are wired... what is the point?  How do you argue with someone who literally has different desires and impulses and preferences and down to how we are made DON'T want the same things?  DON'T care about the same people?Did bankrupt Trump golf course in Puerto Rico leave taxpayers on the hook?

# A failing business funded by Puerto Rico to start with

The resort in Rio Grande opened as Coco Beach Golf &amp; Country Club in 2004. 

The property was built through bonds backed by the Puerto Rican government (through the Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund), through its efforts to pay for loans and guarantees to finance its hotel industry. In 2000 and 2004, the Puerto Rican government backed a total of about $25.5 million in bonds for the resort, which opened in 2004.

The resort already was headed toward bankruptcy by the time Trump came along in 2008. It couldn’t finish renovations, so it wasn’t open all year. There weren’t enough people playing golf there, so the resort ran over budget just maintaining the course. Membership dwindled and staff members resigned. In 2006 and 2007, the resort had net operating losses of $5 million to $6 million, according to the 2007 annual report.

# the recession(s) hit hard 

Then, the recession hit Puerto Rico hard. The prolonged, decade-long economic turmoil made it tougher for the resort to turn back around. The island was hit recession in 2006 (due to the elimination of a tax subsidy for manufacturers) before the 2007 financial crisis hit the island even harder.


# empty promise by Donald Trump and sweet licensing agreement and management agreement (without putting a single dime)

**In 2008, Trump signed two deals: a licensing agreement to rename the club as Trump International Golf Club Puerto Rico, and a management agreement to position Trump to handle the club’s operations in exchange for a share of its annual revenue and a slice of the profit.** This is a standard management deal in the golf industry, according to Golf News, and **Trump leased his name for marketing purposes.**

Trump promised to bring the resort back into the black, but the resort kept struggling. "Puerto Rico is a fantastic place and deserves the best, which is what we will deliver," Trump said at a 2008 news conference on the island, according to the Washington Post. "Every detail will be important to me."

In 2011, the resort came out with a new $28 million bond offering. The offering document shows that proceeds would be used to refund the roughly $25 million in outstanding 2000 and 2004 bonds, and the rest to pay for associated fees. [Essentially, the resort had to get new loans in order to pay back the old loans in order to avoid defaulting on the old loan.]**

The offering document shows that the Puerto Rican government knew just how much money the resort was losing and that taxpayers were on the hook, even if it defaulted. The government lent the money anyway.

In 2015, the property filed for bankruptcy under its original name, Coco Beach Golf and Country Club. It was then sold for roughly $2 million to a private investment firm.

# Business declared bankruptcy, but Trump profited 

**Trump claimed more than $600,000 in profits by the end of 2012. Ultimately, the Trump Organization walked away with more than $600,000 in revenue from the management and licensing deal. Eric Trump, the president’s son and an executive in the Trump Organization, said after the bankruptcy filing, “We made many millions of dollars on it but never invested a dime.”** (In the bankruptcy case, Eric Trump filed a claim for about $927,000 in unpaid fees on behalf of Trump Golf Coco Beach LLC, PolitiFact Florida found.)

### sidenote: wait, what are bonds?

in case that you're confused about bonds, here's an introduction: 

http://www.investopedia.com/university/bonds/bonds1.asp







why Hillary Clinton lost 2016 election to Donald Trump: 

## 1. It's the economy, stupid! (that was the unofficial 1992 Bill Clinton's slogan)

She is still for free trade even though people are suffering badly from these free trade deals. Jobs are lost from outsourcing, product dumping, etc. If you look at the electoral map, she lost almost all the Rust Belt states (Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, as well as Pennsylvania; although she won Illinois). People in these states used to be factory workers. They used to vote reliably for the Democratic party, but thanks to free trade and automation, factories have been closing down, they are forced to work in minimum wage jobs at retail stores or simply leave the town and look for jobs elsewhere. That's why people resent Hillary Clinton for supporting free trade.


### the issue of free trade: somewhat unprecedented 

Of course, what surprised almost all political pundits are some of the Rust belt states that were thought to be solid Democratic states went for Trump (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania), when in fact these states had been slowly turning to the Republican Party since the 1980s. **And what's especially important is that 2016 election was for the first time since the conception of free trade in the 1990s that one of two major party nominees (i.e., Trump) has been very critical of free trade (usually free trade has the support of both major parties). This sharp contrast (at least on the surface) between Hillary and Trump, of course, will give an opportunity for voters in the Rust Belt to make their voice heard at the voting booth, the choice based on free trade was not readily apparent in past general elections. Of course, the difference was only a facade, both are supportive of free trade.** 

In 1992, both Bush 41 (G. W. H Bush, GOP) and Bill Clinton (Dem) were in favor of free trade. 

In 1996, both Bob Dole (GOP) and Bill Clinton (dem) were for free trade. Third party candidate Ross Perot was an outspoken critic of free trade in both elections, he did pretty well for a third party candidate in 1992. 

In 2000, both Gore and G.W. Bush were for free trade. 

In 2004, both Kerry and G.W. Bush were for free trade. 

In 2008, Obama expressed some criticism of free trade and wanted to renegotiate for a better terms for the US. McCain was for free trade. 

In 2012, free trade was not a prominent issue. Mitt Romney was for free trade. Obama in practice was for free trade. 


## 2. Hillary Clinton exemplifies the establishment when the nation's voters are in the anti-establishment sentiment. 

Hillary Clinton is undoubted the most establishment candidate one can find in the Democratic Party. Not only she has been in the politics ever since 1978 during her husband Bill Clinton's election for the Governor of Arkansas (unlike most wives of politicians, she's pretty involved in the campaign as well as the governance). And of course, her husband was the president for 8 years. But it's not just the time in politics that mattered, it's also what she did (see point 4). 
 
People believe (rightly so) establishment candidates are corrupt. That's why Obama won, and that's why Hillary lost. Trump positioned himself as an anti-establishment candidate, claiming that he's so rich and he wouldn't need to want more money (LOL, yeah, right...). Although Trump has only forayed into politics directly relatively recently, he actually is the quintessential establishment candidate: he has played politics for enriching himself and his business, he's very wealthy (compared to an average American), and he lies without any qualm, and he changes positions depending on who he's talking to or even in the same speech, and he's incredibly greedy. 

During the Democratic primary, the entire weight of the establishment was behind Hillary Clinton. The vast majority of the super-delegates endorsed her. Many party and government officials came out to campaign for her. In a sharp contrast, Bernie Sanders earned a token of superdelegates (who are consist of current or former party officials, government officials, etc.), while he has earned widespread support among the common people. 

## 3. Hillary Clinton has repeatedly antagonized the progressive base of the Democratic Party. 

Colluding DNC and the media to get rid of Bernie Sanders, hiring Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a honorary Chairwoman of Hillary's campaign (after she was forced to resign as the chair of DNC after Wikileaks email revealed that DNC had colluded with Hillary), getting debate questions in the day before the debate (cheating!), and nominating another establishment candidate as her vice president (Tim Kaine) are some of the examples. And of course, she refused to change her positions to become more progressive, claiming that she has gotten more votes than Bernie Sanders and was winning -- until just before the Democratic convention, when she realized that she was gonna lose the support of progressives in the general election. 

When she was all but certain to be the Democratic nominee after beating Bernie Sanders toward the end of the primary, she started to court the Republican donors, touting their supports in public. (I think she's tone-deaf.)

## 4. Her unpopularity was sky high (Trump was a bit worse). Political Corruption and Dishonesty (at least the perception of them)

From a laundry list of scandals and controversies (although some are unjustified), to being perceived as a liar and corrupt, to being robotic and highly scripted, to flip-flopping to the current trend in the polls, there is no wonder that her disapproval ratings is around 50-60%. With that kind of disapproval ratings going to the election, the voter turnout for her is bound to be depressed.

Some of her flip-flopped positions or less-than-honest records: 

1. Free trade, both on NAFTA and TPP. She changed her positions multiple times on both trade agreements. 

2. XL Keystone Pipeline

3. same-sex marriage. She was against it until 2013, since which time she was for it. 

4. Obama's Immigration policy. 

5. on Wall Street (praise or rebuke), it was especially brought up by the existence of her Wall Street speeches https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/hillary-clinton-speeches-wikileaks.html?mcubz=3

6. Her attitudes toward African Americans. During her husband's presidency, She used the term "super predators" in her speech and supported much tougher crime bills and a "3 strikes" laws, which results in a surge of prison population and has devastated the black community. The term "super predator" is a  derogatory coded word for a violent young black men. 

7. Bankruptcy vote. During her husband's presidency, she was against the bankruptcy bill that would make it more difficult to file for personal bankruptcy. In bankruptcy, some portion of the loans would be forgiven. However, she went to support the bill when she became a senator due to the campaign contributions and lobbying from the credit card industry.

Elizabeth Warren vs. Hillary Clinton (2004)
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/09/elizabeth-warrens-critique-of-hillary-clintons-2001-bankruptcy-vote/

8. Are you a moderate or progressive? She seems to want to have both ways. 

## 5. Hillary Clinton is greedy and politically corrupt and out of touch (although she's is still a mile away compared to Donald Trump). 

Getting multi-million dollars from her speech fees and using her position of Secretary of the State to raise money for her foundation (and indirectly benefiting from it personally) are just two of many examples. She also transferred political operatives to her foundation in order to keep them getting paid while she was waiting for the 2016 election run. When she decided to run, she transferred these people back to her political campaign. (I think it was rather innovative despite being highly unethical.) **This is a frequent theme in Hillary Clinton. She does not necessarily do illegal things, but the things she's done are clearly unethical or on the borderline of illegality.**

### A quick rise to the top 1% and beyond in a glamorous life 

The Clintons' economic status actually has changed dramatically since Bill Clinton left his office. For a starter, Hillary Rodham Clinton was born in a relatively well-off middle class family. The Clintons had a lot of debt due to a series of lawsuits during Bill Clinton's presidency. However, within a year after the Clinton Presidency, their debt was completely wiped off, earning 12 million dollars. By 2007, the couple had already had earned 170 million dollars. In the last 15 years, the couple have made somewhere between 200 and 240 million dollars (estimates differ). Most of the money came from Bill Clinton. In the case of Bill Clinton, he made almost half of his money from speaking fees, and less so in book deals. 

As for their wealth, the estimates are between $11.3 million and $52.7 million, with no liabilities. 

Of course, with such wealth, anyone can be easily out-of-touch with the rest of the Americans.

How have Clinton and Trump earned their money over the years?



## 6. Hillary Clinton feels entitled and is arrogant. 

She felt so entitled and was so ambitious to being elected to be the president, she rather risked Trump winning the presidency than letting Bernie Sanders competing in the general election against Trump. In every hypothetical Bernie Sanders vs. Donald Trump matchup, Bernie Sanders' support was consistently higher than Donald Trump, with more than 10% lead among likely voters. While Hillary and Trump's support are roughly the same. Also, Bernie Sanders have much higher support than Hillary Clinton among independent and younger voters. Also, She rebuffed repeated concerns about her private email server and her speech fees from her staff and the State Department. These issues only came back and hunted her later. 

Obama, who wanted to help Hillary Clinton, persuaded then vice President Joe biden not to run  when Joe biden was deciding if he should run for president in 2016 election.

Elizabeth Warren also did not run, either despite encouragement from the progressive. I assume that Elizabeth Warren knew DNC had already been co-opted by people who favored Hillary Clinton. 

## 7. Hillary Clinton has failed to bring out the voters. 

First off, She's not an inspirational speaker, which alone gives an disadvantage in elections. And she doesn't hammer on her core message like Bernie Sanders did. 

Also, her whole strategy was wrong. Bernie Sanders has known that economic progressive ideas (e.g., universal healthcare, anti-free trade, protecting unions, protecting social security) are far more effective than social liberalism (e.g., gay marriage, gender equality, immigration, racial equality) in terms of voter turnout. 

However, Hillary Clinton's strategy was to rely on so-called coalition of ascendance: the emergence of a new majority of women, Latinos, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, gays and lesbians, immigrants, millennials and Muslims. The voter turnout among Latinos, blacks, and even women are rather low compared to Obama. These groups were supposed to be her advantage. At least for blacks, the radio ads aired in the their neighborhoods only the last few days before the election, way too late to motivate the voters. Previously white Obama voters, citing economic hardship and Hillary Clinton favoring the wealthy, did not vote in the general election or voted for Trump; many of these voters see Trump as a candidate that may look out for the interest of average workers. Certainly Trump has succeeded on spreading his propaganda via Fox News, Sinclair Broadcast Group and social media. 

Even though the final tally of Clinton's total votes exceeds Trump's by almost 3 millions, she simply didn't bring out the voters in the right states. She narrowly lost to Donald Trump on several Rust Belt states, which result in Trump having many more electoral voters than Hillary. 


## 8. It seems that she didn't learn much from her last attempt of running for the presidency (in 2008). 

She still felt entitled, she was still arrogant, she still can't attract voters, her every step still seemed scripted, and she still hasn't opposed free trade as a concept. She has become more corrupt than ever. It seems like 2008 all over again, but lost in a much more humiliating and spectacular fashion. 

## 9. Hillary Clinton relied on a "sophisticated" but untested computer algorithm called Ada that planned her everything on the campaign trail. 

She relies on the algorithm from what ads to air on TV, to when to have what events. I'm sure if many people will find that her decision of over-reliance on untested algorithm crazy if not stupid. 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/09/clintons-data-driven-campaign-relied-heavily-on-an-algorithm-named-ada-what-didnt-she-see/

## 10. She is terrible at managing her resources during election campaigns

Hillary Clinton had heavily relied on the consultants and TV advertising, and she hadn't not sent enough volunteers and staffer to knock on doors to get them out to vote for her. 

Furthermore, the staffers that Hillary Clinton's team hired were overwhelmingly upper middle class, who do not have any connection with lower middle class and the working poor. This overall out-of-touch organization definitely has a hard time convincing poorer voters to vote for Hillary Clinton. By comparison, the Republican party had spent on a lot of money to get on the ground game and knock on the door of the voters as much as it could. 

## 11. diverting almost all of the money from the Democratic state Party and DNC to cover her presidential campaign expenses 

**This is perhaps one of the most egregious thing her campaign did.** Even before she officially starts to run for office, she had already planned for the general election with the DNC. The contributions of a joint fundraising committee are supposed to be divvied up among Clinton's campaign, the DNC, and the state party Committees. However, almost all of the funds were clandestinely diverted to benefit her election campaign alone, leaving the state parties and congressional candidates with little money for helping their own candidates. I think this is one of the biggest reasons that state and Congressional elections have done so poorly in this election. **And what Hillary Clinton had to show for with all that money: nothing, she lost to Donald Trump for the presidency. **

Clinton fundraising leaves little for state parties
The Democratic front-runner says she's raising big checks to help state committees, but they've gotten to keep only 1 percent of the $60 million raised.

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670

the politico article reads: 

The venture, the Hillary Victory Fund, is a so-called joint fundraising committee comprised of Clinton’s presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee and 32 state party committees. The setup allows Clinton to solicit checks of $350,000 or more from her super-rich supporters at extravagant fundraisers including a dinner at George Clooney’s house and a concert at Radio City Music Hall featuring Katy Perry and Elton John.

The victory fund has transferred $3.8 million to the state parties, but almost all of that cash ($3.3 million, or 88 percent) was quickly transferred to the DNC, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who controls the committee, POLITICO’s analysis of the FEC records found.

**And most of the $23.3 million spent directly by the victory fund has gone toward expenses that appear to have directly benefited Clinton’s campaign, including $2.8 million for “salary and overhead” and $8.6 million for web advertising that mostly looks indistinguishable from Clinton campaign ads and that has helped Clinton build a network of small donors who will be critical in a general election expected to cost each side well in excess of $1 billion.**

The arrangement has sparked concerns among campaign finance watchdogs and allies of Clinton’s Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. **They see it as a circumvention of campaign contribution limits by a national party apparatus intent on doing whatever it takes to help Clinton defeat Sanders during the party’s primary, and then win the White House.**

**Some fundraisers who work for state parties predict that the arrangement could actually hurt participating state parties. They worry that participating states that aren’t presidential battlegrounds and lack competitive Senate races could see very little return investment from the DNC or Clinton’s campaign, and are essentially acting as money laundering conduits for them.**

## 12. She for a long time ignored the help or heeded the warnings from people from Bernie Sanders' campaign. 

After the Democratic Primary is over, Bernie Sanders' staffers and community organizers had repeated contacted Hillary Clinton's campaign in order to help her win over progressives and white working class voters that Bernie Sanders was able to bring over to his campaign during the primary. Clinton's staffers initially agreed to meet and strategize with Bernie's staffers and community organizers, but they never followed up with them. Only weeks before the general election did Clinton's staffers realize that they did not have the votes of the white working class and the support of unions in the Rust Belt states. In a panic, Clinton campaign finally decided to campaign in the Rust Belts in the final days of the election, and even Obama showed up in the rallies. 

## 13. She did not campaign on policies/issues, but rather heavily on attacking Trump's characters. 

Most of her TV ads were attack-only ads and heavily focused on Trump's personal characters. This character heavy attack ads is a departure from the past, which usually a even mixture of policy and character, attack (the others) and promote (yourself). 

While it is important to attack Trump's personal characters (e.g., racism, xenophobia, anti-Muslim, vulgarity, his volatile behavior, intensities toward others), voters really want to know is what the candidate has to offer in terms of broad policies, especially on economics. Although it's important to point out the other candidate is bad, you still have to explain why you're the right candidate. 

One thing that has puzzled me is why **Hillary Clinton did not hammer on Trump's abysmal incompetence, which is Trump's Achilles's heel.** Trump has carefully cultivated the myth in the public that he is a very successful self-made businessman. (which comes in handy when making licensing deals with a strong brand.) She has only brought up this issue occasionally when she should have used it to shatter Trump's public image. 

## 14. She lacks Conviction. Who's the real Hillary Clinton? And What's your core message? 

Because almost all of her positions are poll-tested and she changes her positions accordingly, people (including me) often beg the question: What does Hillary Clinton really believe in? Although I don't vote people on candidates' personal convictions, many people do. 

If you wanna summarize a person's candidacy, it would be Donald Trump's vague but nostaglic message "Make America Great Again", and Obama's inspirational "Hope and Change" and "Yes, we can", and Bernie Sander's principled progressivism. I am not sure what Hillary Clinton's core message is, "I'm with Her" and "stronger together" don't seem to resonate with the voter, and it's not hard to see why. 

## 15. She's not a convincing liar; lawyerly lies; "I've always tried to" to tell the truth

While almost all politicians lie or distort the facts more or less, what makes a big difference is to lie convincingly. Obama is able to lie and distort facts without appearing to be so. Trump is able to lie so shamelessly and off-handedly without any qualm that some people may not notice without looking it closely. 

Hillary Clinton is, however, a classic example of lawyerly liar. She always gives herself a bit wiggle room when lying. While this is a necessary strategy under oath (otherwise, you will perjure yourself), people can immediately spot it when you give a lawyerly lie in public while not under oath. Phrases, such as "as far as I know", "knowingly", "to the best of my ability", "tried to", "I don't believe that" are some good indicators that a person is trying to lie without technically doing so. And of course, answering the wrong question is another good indicator. 

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/campaign-2016-hillary-clinton-ive-always-tried-to-tell-the-truth/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd3UMU85od0
Clinton: I Always Try To Tell The Truth; 2-18-2016

While Jimmy Carter famously said to American Public, "I will not lie to you." When Hillary Clinton was asked repeatedly if she has ever told the truth, her replied was less than straight-forward. Here's the transcript (without going to her body language, which can be telling):

PELLEY:You know, in '76, Jimmy Carter famously said, "I will not lie to you."

CLINTON: Well, I have to tell you **I have tried** in every way I know how literally from my years as a young lawyer all the way through my time as secretary of state to level with the American people.

PELLEY:You talk about leveling with the American people. Have you always told the truth?

CLINTON: I've always tried to. Always. Always.

PELLEY: Some people are gonna call that wiggle room that you just gave yourself.

CLINTON:Well, no, I've always tried --

PELLEY: I mean, Jimmy Carter said, "I will never lie to you."

CLINTON:Well, but, you know, you're asking me to say, "Have I ever?" **I don't believe I ever have.** I don't believe I ever have. I don't believe I ever will. I'm gonna do the best I can to level with the American people.

## 16. Did she cheat in the primary? | You can cheat in the primary, but you can't cheat in the general election

There have been serious accusations with regards to whether Hillary Clinton had cheated in the primary. I'm not talking about the questionable tactics during the campaign (e.g., leaking questions to Hillary Clinton, and manipulating the debate schedules and limiting the number of debates) --although they did happen -- I'm talking about trying to manipulate the ballot results. 

Some of them are confirmed, some are not.  

1. voter purging (especially around 120,000 people were purged in Brooklyn, New York, Bernie Sanders' birthplace) [confirmed]

2. reducing the polling stations or number of staff of these polling stations in precincts where Bernie Sanders is more popular [confirmed]

3. Give voters provisional ballots instead of in-party ballots as in the past. Provisional ballots are rarely counted, this would essentially make these people's ballots useless. [accused]

4. This is not cheating, but it's certainly a sign of dysfunction. Poll workers were hastily assembled without enough training, causing confusion at the poll stations. [not confirmed]

http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/new-york-primary-voter-purge/


Incidentally, most of the caucus states are won by Bernie Sanders. Causes are very different than the primaries. The residents go to the cause and have a long discussion/debate with the fellow attendees in order to convince others to change their vote. At the end of the meeting, the attendees from the precinct are going to do a hand vote, the workers then tally up the numbers. By comparison, primaries are essentially voting with your ballots. The ballots are then collected, the ballot boxes are escorted, and then counted. 

Certainly, Bernie Sanders' supporters are much more enthusiastic about him and thus are willing to attend the meeting, which can last as long as 2 hours. However, I speculate that there is another possibility. It's just much harder to cheat in caucuses, all the numbers are counted in public. 

In the general election, the paper ballots are counted in private, but with scrutiny from representatives from major parties and the watchdog groups that are allowed to attend. Therefore, it's harder to cheat in this scenario for the major parties (I didn't mention the attendance of third parties, did I?) 

### a small sidenote: GOP primary vs. Democratic Primary: which was messier? 

In the beginning of the primary season, it seems that the Republican Party was in total shamble; more than 20 Republican candidates vying for the nomination seems more like a farce. In contrast, the Democratic Party seems to have already their nominee: Hillary Clinton. But as the time went on, Donald Trump seem to be on his way to nomination, while the Democratic primary became heavily contested. With the official party nomination, the GOP convention was relatively orderly (if not vociferous), while the tension between the progressives and the establishment in the Democratic Party convention was rather high. Wikileak's leaked DNC emails just confirmed what Bernie Sanders supporter had long suspected: Hillary Clinton and DNC were colluding. (This is a bit reminiscent of Nixon vs. Humphrey in 1968; the Democrats were split on the issue of Vietnam War, while Nixon came out seem to be the "law and order" guy.)
___________________________________

## External factors: 

 Of course, what I listed above just the things that she has done wrong. There are many external factors are often cited by Hillary Clinton and others. I am just gleaning over, just to cover all bases. 


### 1. James Comey's  send a letter to Congress a week before the election, claiming that he has found Hillary's emails as Secretary of State on Anthony Weiner's laptop even before analyzing them. Only days after, Comey cleared Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoings. By then, the damage on Hillary Clinton had already done, as the right wing and Donald Trump immediately jumped on it. 

### 2. Sexism. 

There's no doubt that sexism is still a problem in America, especially in the Republican Party, as we have seen during 2008 general election. 

### 3. Russia. Russia. Russia! And Wikileaks! 

**President Obama refused to let James Comey to publish an op-ed, in which James Comey wanted to warn Americans about the Russian influence on this election in Summer 2016. If Obama let him do it (or warn Americans personally), people would give more credence to the fact that Russian was influencing the election by damaging Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump. Alas, Obama wanted to appear "neutral" (not appearing to influence the election in any way). And when Obama administration finally released a statement accusing Putin and Russian government of email hacking and meddling the election, it offered very little detail.**

Report: Obama Rejected Comey Op-Ed on Russia’s Election Meddling

http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/report-obama-rejected-comey-op-ed-on-russian-interference.html


I don't want to elaborate on this subject than I need to, since a lot of other media have reported this. I just want to summarize. Putin knew Hillary Clinton was going to be the Democratic nominee years ago (I mean, it's pretty much given) and decided to hack into DNC and Pedesta's email account. And then release the damaging emails in order to sow discord within the Democratic Party. It certainly didn't help that Hillary Clinton was actually colluding with DNC, which is supposed to be neutral, as it will only give credence of the Russian propaganda that elections are manipulated. (Hacking was much less successful in France, because there was no clear front-runner in the multi-party French election, and election season was much shorter. Certainly something US can learn.) 

Putin probably knew Donald Trump was going to run for president years ago, given his close ties to Russian oligarchs. And the Russian government was probably in communication and coordinating with Trump campaign throughout the election. And the Russian government obviously has a lot of damaging information about Trump to hold him hostage. 

It's likely that the Russian government might have damaging information about RNC as well, but again to hold the Republican leaders hostage. And that might be one of the reason that Republicans in Congress refuse to knowledge the authenticity of intelligence report that Russia was meddling the election. (Of course, as always, Republicans believed Obama administration had a political motive in compiling this report.) 

The Russian government (along with its trolls/bots/impostors), Trump's campaign organization, Wikileaks, and RT are clearly coordinating with one another in the release of emails and spreading conspiracy theories and propaganda in order to damage Hillary Clinton's reputation and maximize the chances of Donald Trump, despite the apparent fact Donald Trump was totally unqualified for the presidency (or any elected office). 


### 4. the Failure of the TV journalism and the Donald Trump's secret deals with right wing media organizations. 

Obviously, the media did not help Hillary Clinton, either. The media mostly covers the horse race, inviting delegates of the candidates go at each other in a shouting match, or giving a pass to the candidates without asking incisive questions or follow-up on evasive answers, or closely follows whatever the controversies of the day. 

While Newspaper journalists general does a far better job at covering the important issues of the election, could not gain much traction, because most of the news that people get are still coming from the TV, less from online news and social media, and exceedingly small from paper newspaper. As the results, whatever important investigations and analysis are buried and soon forgotten. 

The right wing media was, however, in full support of Donald Trump since his nomination. Donald Trump secretly made a deal with Sinclair Broadcast Group, which allowed unfiltered, uncritical, and favorable coverage of Donald Trump on their many TV stations, most of which are local TV stations. He also made a deal with Rupert Murdoch, who initially was in disagreement with Donald Trump over issues such as immigration. Before the secret deal, Fox News and other News Corp networks was rather critical of Donald Trump, as shown in early GOP primary debates. After the deal, Fox News had stopped the attack, but rather supported Donald Trump since. 

________________________________________________________
# A combination of Internal and External factors: 

## DNC was already heavily in debt, and DNC let Hillary Clinton's team to take control of the organization in exchange for Hillary's campaign assuming the debt

Since the election of 2012, DNC was already heavily in debt in order to re-elect President Obama. It was slowly paying off and hired Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Hillary supporter, to help speed up the process. Although she is supposed to be a good fundraiser (for paying off the debt, but it turns out not be true), she's not a good at messaging or organizing or controlling the finances. And of course, DNC has been now dominated by Hillary Clinton's faction. Progressives are now rather difficult to overthrow them, since they are so ideologically consistent and holding all the key positions.

## What's not a factor: Bernie Sanders (or least he didn't do anything inappropriate) 

It is apparent that the lack of support from Bernie Sanders is not a factor of her loss. Bernie Sanders came to endorse her after all the primary contests finished, the time that Hillary Clinton endorsed Obama in 2008. Bernie Sanders continued to campaign for Hillary Clinton afterwards, trying to rally voters to vote for her in the general elections. However, Bernie Sanders has warned Hillary Clinton toward the end of the primary that even though he will 

Of course, one shouldn't say that Bernie Sanders should not join the primary contest in the first place, because that would be absurd. (What's the whole point of party primary)

## Personal reflections: 

**Despite her numerous shortcomings, she's undoubtedly intelligent and hard-working. Despite people's feeling of hatred toward her now because of these shortcomings, Hillary Clinton hasn't always been this way. And she at her early political years was viewed as a policy wonk. When young in her Wellesley College years, she was a hopeful progressive. However, over the years her spirit of "making the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible" (sounds like what Obama would say) has all but disappeared. Instead, they have been replaced with her current caged mannerism, her cynical views of the world, and her complacency with the status quo.** 

Hillary Rodham Clinton's student speech

https://youtu.be/2CAUOa5m5nY?t=58s

I knew all long her chance to win 2016 presidency was not good, but so many people willing to vote for Trump despite his viciousness, stupidity, incompetency, ceaselessly lying, flagrant disregard toward truth and other people, and his narcissistic and antisocial personality disorder is something that deeply disturbed me, given so much at stake in this election. (I know, every election is viewed as the most important election, maybe it's because we have never solved problems that have been piling up for the last four decades.)

## The brutal consequences: 

Now, Trump is the president, with both house of Congress lost to the Republicans, and the Supreme Court is dominated by conservative judges. With executive, legislative, and judiciary branch in the control of the Republicans. Not to mention that most of the state and local elected officials are held by the Republicans, not the Democrats. 

Our Democracy, the republic and hard-fought small progress we've made over the years are clearly in jeopardy. I wonder if we will ever recover from such setback. 

Partly, thanks to you, HRC (Hillary Rodham Clinton).The news has becoming more and more ironic considering some of the headlines I've been seeing lately. If something even more ironic happened like Sessions getting caught with weed, that would be the meme of the century I admit it, I look to David for insight into the spanish speaking world.  It's not fair David, but you are the main liberal I know of on youtube that is spanish speaking and covers news.  Your Argentinian heritage makes you a defacto expert on the entire spanish speaking world to me.

And if that is crazy and insane, just reach out on twitter and ask for people in Spain/Catalonia to talk with you on your show Monday.  I think we'd all like that.I am fairly experienced with firearms, my first gun I ever bought was an AR15 and I'm telling you, there's no way you can shoot as rapidly as the Las Vegas shooter did with only a semi auto trigger configuration. If you've seen videos of the shooting, he was shooting probably 5 rounds per second, where as a semi, you can shoot 2 maybe 3 rounds. It seems to me that the shooter responsible may of had a binary trigger system to carry out this massacre. 

You might be thinking "but what is a binary trigger system?" A binary trigger system is a trigger that shoots a bullet when you pull the trigger then when you release the trigger the hammer shoots another round, basically legal full auto.

Here is a video of someone with a binary trigger configuration at the gun range: https://youtu.be/DzwHAFpqqQk

If you wanna get full auto's off the streets then I recommend banning binary triggers. They are a legal loop hole to get a full auto. As a gun owner, I don't think AR15's should be banned, rather these triggers. There are practical uses for AR's and AK's. If you're living on a farm, then some whacko is shooting at your house from across the field, then an AR15/AK may be your best option for self defense. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQcJfTGbjuo

Do all you straight liberals who love calling homophobes gay(i've noticed yous particularly enjoy calling republicans gay, mmm wonder why) so much realize how insulting, nonesensical and annoying it is, and how many of us in the gay community are sick and tired of it? Like 90% of straight liberals appear to be literally incapable of responding to homophobia without calling the bigots gay. homophobia in general or to get more specific anti gay extremism is not, has never been, and will never be evidence a person is gay. straight people are the ones responsible for homophobia,anti gay hate crimes, anti gay legislation and anti gay hate groups. the vast,vast majority of homophobes in the world are staright people(obviously), like literally 99% of them. now of course lots of yous like to point out the tiny,miniscule amount of homophobes who did actually turn out to be gay but yous always conveinently ignore that for every one of those guys theres literally thousands of anti gay activists/extremists who are just bigoted straight people. It think it's time that the communities straight allies started having a more serious respone to the bigotry against the community instead of just "lols he's gay"I know that I'll most likely be down voted into oblivion, but can I be the only one that thinks Jordan Peterson to be exceptionally boring?

What he says is usually needlessly wordy, and what he does say wasn't all that insightful at the end of it. 

There is this one moment with Rubin that he says Sam Harris is using Christian philosophy because he doesn't rob banks or murder people...  I mean; what?

Am I wrong about him?  If you like him, share your opinion on why you find him insightful.Note: Although ostensibly reviewing BBC Rome TV series for historical accuracy,  these two videos actually spend most of the time explaining how the societal forces, the turmoils and civil wars, historical events and figures that resulted in the demise of Roman Republic and the rise of Roman Empire (with a dictator for life).

History Buffs: Rome Season One


https://youtu.be/Jz8WWIz_a-I
History Buffs: Rome Season Two

Pakman asked on the show about what peoples' opinions are on his shopping at Target, and whether it was any better than shopping at walmart. 

I live in an area that has a Super Target and whatever the walmart equivalent is. Wal Mart Super Center, I think.

In terms of whether they both treat their workers poorly, I think Target seems to do a better job on the PR front, but they're both ultimately low wage, anti-union corporations. 

That being said, at Target, I buy a lot of things for my classroom teaching, or things like laundry detergent, trash bags, cleaning solvents, general housewares, etc. and use the online pickup option. It's convenient for me, and I don't have to deal with a l ot of people and noise when I need to get something, I can just order it, and then pick it up in a few hours when it's ready. 

I will say on the positive side about Target, they give our high school trumpet choir a $75 gift card every year, after we fill out some paperwork, as a donation to the band and orchestra program. We use that gift card for snacks, and other supplies for travel and rehearsal, which helps out quite a bit. 

I've tried filling out the donation form request from Walmart, and have gotten nothing. Most of the local corporate retailers here donate to the school and fine arts programs, so, it tells me a lot when Best Buy, Target, Fry's, Subway Corporate, Zales, and Discount Tire will donate something or provide an item to be used in a silent auction, and Wal-Mart provides nothing. 


## Targeting Blacks and Hippies to help the Republican Party politically 

##Nixon: 

The new generation of the left back in the 1970s were hippies, who smoked marijuana and vote for the Democratic Party. (The hippies were anti-war and thus supported the anti-war faction of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party had always supported the Vietnam War.) The current progressives, left and libertarians are still fond of marijuana, but leaning a bit more toward its medical purposes, not purely for recreational purposes.

The discriminatory voting laws against the blacks in South by then had become officially illegal after the passage of Civil Rights Act of 1965 during Johnson (Democrat) administration. To appeal to the White racists in the South in the famous Southern Strategy and to reduce the influence of the blacks (who by then mostly voted for the Democratic Party) in elections, Nixon decided to associate blacks with hard drugs (e.g., heroin), because it helps the Republican Party politically (just like targeting the hippies). 

Nixon's overall strategy was to arrest these groups and send them to prison, so they can't vote. Prisoners usually are usually deprived of their right to vote, as normal citizens do. As the time can tell, it would have devastated the black community. Of course, he couldn't do it blatantly, since it would be against the Constitution. And the term "the War on Drugs" was first used by Nixon. 

### Reagan: Minimal sentencing &amp; sentencing disparity against the Blacks

The War on Drugs has taken roots since then. During Reagan years, Ronald Reagan signed into law the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which created **minimal sentencing laws**. It also created the **100:1 sentencing disparity for possession of powdered cocaine vs. crack cocaine** (having 500 grams of powdered cocaine is equivalent to having 5 grams of crack cocaine). The blacks were more likely to use crack cocaine (because it's cheaper), whereas the whites were more likely to use powered cocaine. The law in effect discriminated against the blacks, as they will suffer harsher sentence for the same amount of drugs.

### It didn't get better during the Clinton Administration: 3 strikes law 

Even as Bill Clinton took office, his administration doubled down to appear "tough on crime", supported the passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which had "three strikes" provision which mandated life sentences for people convicted of 3 violent crimes (including drug crimes). 

## the Long-Lasting Effect 

Even now, the war on drugs in practice discriminates against the Blacks and minorities, because the police disproportionately arrest these groups even though they are no more likely than whites to do drugs (including marijuana). And we are still suffering the effects of War on Drugs and harsh sentencing laws today; US has a large prison population with disproportionately African-Americans behind bars. If they violate "three strikes" laws, they must at least serve 25 years in prison. In some states, drug possession is considered a violent crime, even though it shouldn't be. 

Of course, the War on Drugs has hurt the blacks economically, both in terms of time wasted behind bars and the employment prospects (employers do not like ex-convicts, and some jobs required employees to have a clean criminal records). The people have drug offenses on their records are not eligible for some government programs. 

I'm sure the War on Drugs hurts drug offenders and the communities a lot psychologically, too.

## sidenote: The War on Drugs is also a foreign policy

note: the War on Drugs is not a domestic policy, the war has also extended to countries like Mexico and Columbia. But I am not going to touch on this topic for now.

The gun modification that made the Las Vegas shooting so deadly

side note: bump stock also makes shooting less accurate than a true fully automatic rifle (but that's a moot point as far as a mass murder is concerned; it would be problematic in target shooting.) 



What are your thoughts about cocaine legalization? legalize, tax and regulate is the way to goSomebody should tell Mr. Trump he can build a 3200 kilometers Mexico border wall instead of a 1900 miles Mexico border wall. 3200 is MUCH bigger than 1900. It's HUGE.

All he needs to do is to switch to the metric system.This comes off the heels of the tax reform Trump/GOP are trying to pass. This got me to think that politicians make a decent amount of money and for self preservation reasons wouldn't want to raise taxes on the rich, so should we give them a special tax bracket. For all publicly elected officials we create a super low tax rate so they can raise the tax rate of rich people and not have to second guess whether they want to do this or not. I'm a gun owner, the first rifle I ever owned was an AR15, and I have a fair amount of experience with firearms in general under my belt. I thought this could be an argument worth exploring. Granted, owning a gun safe won't stop all mass shootings, like the one in Vegas, but in the case of the columbine massacre, maybe if the owner of the rifles used during the massacre had a safe, Dylan and Eric wouldn't have been able to steal those rifles, and they would still be alive today along with those killed in the massacre. I have seconded John 316's challenge to debate the Sargon viewers on their Reddit post. I think we can debate them successfully. And with a touch of class, I might add, as well. This doesn't make much sense to me why he wouldn't but he doesn't. He could reach more people, and they have video podcasts as well. Kyle should definitely have his own podcast I'm curious -- I know there's not a ton of older TDPS viewers but I know there are some, so I'll open this up say, for age 45-50+ viewers. 

I'm curious if you see us has having totally failed to make progress. Or if the progress is about what you expected. 

Did you think we would have flying cars (as you were promised) by now? What other things about where we have moved forwards, and back, may have been of note to you? I am curious.

Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un and Stephen Paddock have all caused senseless violence. They have caused death and injury, with dumb stupid motivations, if any. Putin invaded Ukraine while giving invalid stupid trick arguments that are tricking a surprisingly high percentage of people if the counter arguments are not reaching them. It is unclear if Putin actually believes his own trick arguments for invading Ukraine. It would take just slightly more stupid arguments and slightly more outrageous lies to invade EU and start WW3. History has taught that some leaders glorify war and conquest. Prospect of "glorious" battles on european soil might be enough motivation for Putin. The public arguments would be something like "NATO made me do it". WW3 would not make any sense, but there are plenty of events that do not make sense, like for example, mass shootings. Unlike mass shooters, Putin would not have to die at the end of his act, at least if it's a war with conventional (non-nuclear) weapons.

Trump is dangerous in a different way: He might start a war because of his incompetence, temper and lack of consideration. But Trump is in a much more constrained position, limited by officials, congress and nato allies.
You know when someone is lying so harder. Using recycled materials and or talking points on explaining a very simple question with a yes or no.  Julian gets a childish attitude towards Amy Goodman on Democracy Now. Julian gets really heated over the Russian prob stuff. Claiming it's fake news and the investigation is a witch hunt because. The email leaks of Hillary Clinton and Podesta  with Roger Stone talking about the leaks before they happen. Lastly, doing a song saying that Rodger stone is a troll to the Democratic party is dead giveaway  a stupid answer.


Link to the video
https://youtu.be/lNdG6iE4a84https://youtu.be/nFTux3v_a4kTelling gun death listings in every show is depressing and not fun, but it could be important and maybe even have some impact. Or maybe not.

Is there anybody else who does it? I remember an organization in D.C. called Homicide Watch that tried do something like this around 2012 and ran crowdfunding to get every violent death in D.C. reported. I wonder whether it had any impact.I usually listen to the podcast, but occasionally David suggests watching the video, and too often I'm having a hard time finding it. Is there any trick to find it easily?If someone is a victim or witness of some wrongdoing, going public about it may feel too hard. Lighter alternative is to make sure that the accusations are at least privately logged with a provable time. It increases credibility if it is known that the accusation was made long before something like it was public and also that many different accusers had details matching before anything was public.

Options could involve justice system, accusers organization, media or even an encrypted video file where the accuser speaks, uploaded at a provable time. The decryption key for the file could be published any time. How to prove that some file was created before some date? There could be many methods. I even remember hearing about a date verification method that somehow uses something about the bitcoin protocol... Yes, it is considered for something else besides paying.

Not expert in any of this. How this seems? Is going to David one media-related option? Maybe David should make a video about these options... It deeply saddens me that almost no one would get the reference.  It comes from the second book of "The First Law" trilogy by Joe Abercrombie.

Kind of a dark fantasy series.  The first book has a pretty loose narrative, but I still found it enjoyable, the second book is where it really hit its stride, and towards the end there was a scene with a particular character that perfectly summed up my impression of the attitude of so many right ring reactionaries and culture warriors.

The character?  Sand Dan Glokta.  Probably one of the most delightfully bitter figures in all of fiction.

A short bit of back story on the character:

SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!

In his younger days, Glokta was handsome and upwardly mobile in the kingdom, got captured during the war, and was tortured, his teeth missing and in shambles, and rendered a cripple who can barely walk.  When he is released he reinvents himself in a lower form and works as a practical, a sort of inquisitor/investigator and has underlings that engage in their own interrogations.

He is DEEPLY bitter and resentful of others that were more fortunate than him, he delights and cheers on seeing others who were in his position before his fall to fall on their face, if not to fall as far as he had, to give him some kind of fleeting dark satisfaction at the misfortune of another.

Enter the latter part of book 2, his practicals that were trying to aprehend a power house went terrible wrong, the target was far too strong for them, here is the dialog.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Eventually she was standing, her bandaged hand clutched against her ribs. “You able to walk?” asked Glokta.

“I’ll loosen up.”

“What happened? Dogs?”

She gave a bark of laughter. “No. A big Northman knocked the shit out of me.”

Glokta snorted. Well, forthright at least. “Shall we go?”

She looked down at his cane. “Don’t suppose you’ve got one of those spare, have you?”

“I’m afraid not. I only have the one, and I can’t walk without it.”

“I know how you feel.”

Not quite. Glokta turned and began to limp away from the Arch Lector’s office. Not quite. He could hear the woman hobbling along behind. Strangely invigorating to have someone trying to keep up with me. **He upped the pace, and it hurt him. But it hurts her more.**

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


Pay CLOSE attention to the part I bolded.  That to me sums up so much of the conservative movement and the draw of the party.  Of resentful rural voters, of voters mad hollywood and academia is liberal and not conservative.  The people spending too many of their waking moments worried about Antifa and a dozen other reactionary culture war issues while republican policies make them worse off.

Tanking liberal economic policy hurts many of them, but I think they think in their minds.... **but it hurts them more**

And that is enough to push forward.  Driven by bitterness and resentment.  http://www.widewalls.ch/art-exhibition-mistaken-for-garbage/

This was reported on a couple years back, but it came up again and I felt impelled to share it with more of the world.

It truly is the greatest art story there ever was.http://www.kgw.com/mobile/article/news/local/central-coast/dead-zone-off-central-oregon-coast-is-one-of-the-worst-in-a-decade/283-482392480 

According to researchers familiar with marine life told reporters that lower oxygen levels in the ocean floor are contributing to this massive loss of sea life, which crabs are suffocating from. 

They told reporters that the dead zone stretches from Newport Beach to Florence, Oregon, approximately a good 60 or so miles of coast line.  Trump likes to brag about how he has a higher IQ than Rex, and recommended an IQ test. The problem with an IQ tests is that they are fairly short, (unless we are talking about the ASVAB or SAT) and Trump could be given the answers beforehand. Why doesn't trump just challenge Rex to a game of chess? Probably because Trump isn't good at strategy, which explains A LOT about him as a president.Im worried if we don't unite, organize and strategize on the local level, we may fail in trying to gain any seats in the house, or possibly lose seats in the 2018 election.

I'm a democrat from Oregon, and studying political science here in the Portland area. Is anyone on this forum from Oregon and willing to get in contact with me regarding the 2018 mid terms? We will do such things as: 

1)setting up tables downtown, and other high walking traffic areas to get people to register to vote
2)organizing peaceful demonstrations for progressive causes like healthcare, reproductive rights, advocating for unions, among a plethora of issues that afflict this country today. 
3)promote progressive political candidates here in Oregon I called out this kid I knew from high school about this stupid meme he posted on Facebook about the political spectrum in which it basically labeled everyone on the left as snowflakes and everyone on the right is some angel that just wants smaller government and less regulation in general. I demolished his argument with one simple question. "Why do you claim to be anti-regulation yet you look the other way when republicans pass regulations on limiting abortion clinics?" 
He got really pissed off at me, and posted a cartoon picture of a person falling out of a helicopter, implying "go kill yourself." Guess it isn't hard to trigger Alex Jones fans LMFAO, what a crybaby. Can't even defend his position on abortion, makes me think pro-lifers just wanna punish women for having sex rather than giving a fuck about the life of the child like they always make it seem to be. https://youtu.be/vtKtG_XeeDcOkay, forgive me for being antidotal. I understand that is not the best means to bring light to an issue, however looking at some of the comments on different progressive youtube channels, I saw a lot of progressives who commonly frequent David and Kyle's channel are now advocating for war with North Korea. These same people get top comment on a lot of political videos, and you've probably seen some of their comments. 

No way in hell am I gonna respect advocating for war against a Banana Republic like North Korea. They have done nothing to provoke us to war, and by striking them first, they could strike us, South Korea, Japan, and china with nuclear weapons in retaliation. Having a nuclear first strike or a war is pointless but why are so many 'progressives' advocating for war? Could they be Russian stooges? No way David or Kyle would advocate war."The Republican budget is a gift to billionaires: its robin hood in reverse" Bernie Sanders

The very people Trump said he would help, he is hurting by his Reaganomics, which has been regarded by  Reagan's VP, George H.W. Bush as Voodoo economics because it's magical non sense and has been debunked. The money does not trickle down to the bottom, it is stored in banks where the rich can accumulate more wealth by the interests of having large somes of money. https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-10-13/tillerson-letters-show-u-s-nearly-averted-kurdish-referendum

Saw this article from a link on david frums twitter, talking about how Eli, a fellow conservative, gave the gentlest of critiques of not having the state department functioning at a higher level.

In this case, it seemed like a decent path forward to avoid armed conflict, but it came too slowly and too late to do any good.  That way David's eyes undress the truth. The way his sharpie-holding hands tone-down bodies of lies. His jokes, so slick, you would think he grew up across 110th street. 

In this thread -- we post the Slow Jams, the R&amp;B, the songs from the likes of old and new artists that capture the essence of the slow jam.

To start us off: 'Do You Feel Me?' from Anthony Hamilton

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1in5wAVOyIk

For our resident bot: Slow Jams = noun; informal.

(chiefly in R &amp; B pop music) a slow, romantic song.
"if slow jams are your thing, then politically, The David Pakman Show really does the trick"https://youtu.be/GUVm1-6SLxYI came across this R. Dawkins video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u8gAV7om_g

In this video, he explains that the right question would be the one in the title, rather than: "What is the survival value of religion?"

On one side, there is definitely a possibility to live without religions. But is it as utopian as, say, communism? 

On the other side, religions bring a lot of suffering into this world.

What is it in us, that makes religions such an appealing proposition, despite obvious inconsistencies with the real world. Is it something that makes wolves join into packs? 

R. Dawkins is going quite aggressively after the religions, and I am wondering if that is the right approach. There is something in us, humans, that makes us susceptible to the idea of a god. Perhaps, the right approach is to evolve religions into something less dogmatic, more aligned with science, yet something that provides a force of cohesion in our societies.

What is your take?Chief of Staff Kelly defends the comments as having their meaning twisted even though the wording was exactly as claimed by the congressman. Regardless, they were insensitive and against Kelly's recommendation to the President that he not even make such calls(possibly realizing Trump would F-up the calls). Really much ado about almost nothing considering the many worse examples of damage Trump is inflicting on our nation. Video of an actual speech made by the congresswoman has been made public which contradicts Kelly's claims that the 2015 speech was self advancing , disrespectful and ignored the main purpose of the speech re the dedication of an F.B.I. building. Its feeling like Kelly might be a racist as well as a liar . Thinking about how Trump/Republicans have the potential to shape the supreme court for a generation to come this has me thinking that the Supreme Court system needs massive reform. The measures I recommend are

1: Disconnecting the appointment of Supreme Court justices from presidential recommendation and Senate approval.

I'm of the belief that if the Legislative and Judicial branches are supposed to be independent, then one branch should not be in charge of appointing the other. My solution is is to have a standardized test decide which individuals with a law degree can become a judge. The test would only be based on textbook information, not an ideological test.

2: Make the Supreme Court much bigger
I would recommend the supreme court have a larger body to help normalize decisions. 

3: Have an annual test for dementia to ensure the judges are competent. 

4: Implement a rule which says they must have been a judge for 15 years prior. 

5: Implement a rule where they can never run for another political office, to prevent political favors. 

What do you guys think of these ideas? let me knowhttps://youtu.be/pJSTfKXDVrghttps://youtu.be/A3rM0d0GrNU

Trump has hit yet another low of hypocrisy, and sheer benevolence. For months I've been having a hard time getting a job. No criminal record, no warrants out for my arrest, I don't use drugs (outside of cannabis and nicotine) yet employers for whatever reason refuse to hire me. I've went in for a handful of interviews and didn't get the job, I applied at 50 or so businesses yet these Corporatists refuse to give me a job. 

That doesn't stop my money making ambitions. As of the past few months I've been collecting cans, and bottles, then return them for the deposit to make ends meat. I can make 50$ sometimes more a day, depending on the day of the week, how much effort I put in and where I look. If it weren't for the bottle tax, I wouldn't have any way to get income, thus I wouldn't have been able to support David's show, and become a member, put gas in my tank to go to school, buy books, textbooks, food, and taking girls out on dates. Over my time of collecting cans, I've meet a lot of homeless people at the deposit centers who have benefited from this tax. Yea, a lot of them abuse drugs, and use a lot of their money to supply their habit, but the tax is helping them provide shelter, like water proof sleeping bags, blankets, backpacks, transportation, clothes, cell phones and other necessities. I meet a young woman who was collecting cans at my apartment who is addicted to herion, and if it weren't for the 10 cent can tax, she would have resorted to prostituting herself for her bad habit. 

To get rid of this tax or lower it would be utterly deplorable, and violent crime would skyrocket as a result. Women would be forced to start prostituting themselves, men would get involved with organized crime to sell drugs, and other violent crimes associated with organized crime. 

The day that Republicans take away the deposit tax here in Oregon is the day I get my friends together and organize a protest downtown. I'll post flyers around town, and be leading the resistance against those that wanna oppress the poor as much as they can. I can't tell you how many player hating cashiers at Walmart tell me that the bottle tax is a burdensome tax, and should be abolished. I find that position to be rooted in a deep seeded ignorance on how the homeless and poor are able to sustain themselves with offensive stereotypes that everyone that collects cans uses drugs. Not true at all. I've meet plenty of college students who also collect cans to make ends meet.

The bottle tax empowers women, and provides income to those that need it the most. Anyone that is against the bottle tax is not in favor of the poor, the empowerment of women or the environment. I consider them political enemies and malevolent. Do you know what happens when the bottles you put in trash go into the waste management truck? THEY GET COMPACTED IN THE TRUCK AND PUT IN A LANDFILL! Waste management doesn't have the resources to organize all the trash, that is part of the reason why lawmakers put this tax in place, and to provide income to the unemployed. 

Don't tell me that you care about the empowerment of women, the environment, wealth inequality, reducing crime and helping the unemployed get income if you are against the deposit tax. YOU ARE NOT IF THAT IS THE WAY YOU THINK! Supporting the bottle tax is one of the best solutions to help the homeless! 

The bottle deposit tax should be national, not varying across states, at 10 cents in every state, every bottle. No more "brand not accepted" no more "bottle only depositable in Maine and Hawaii," no more plastic water bottles without CRV's!!! which is complete bull, and is only meant to load up land fills with more waste and oppress the poor. I had an idea for a sort of collectors edition to a future Trump presidency book, why not couple a hard cover with a bottle of REALLY hard liquor?  Something to take a swig of when you get to one of the many chapters when the tantrums begin to flow?  A proper insult to the most deserving of presidents.

But since I'm not a drinker, I do not know the names of a proper hard liquor that would be appropriate to have coupled with such a future biography.  Any ideas?Luckily the flight went routinely. I'm not judging David. I wasn't in his position. But I'd like to think I'd have spoken up to a flight attendant. Airlines make good money to provide a safe trip. See something wrong. Speak up,right?What does everyone think of the Clinton Uranium Scandal. It has been reported by TYT, Vox, MSNBC, and the New York Times. I have not heard DP talk about it. Is it a conspiracy theory or is there something to it.According to Kyle's video, a 9th circuit court is determining a case about the legality of prostitution. Watch the video: 
https://youtu.be/nid0aUshVsA

By all means, prostitution should be legal. It would be prevent STD's with the regulation of mandatory testing for sex workers and "johns" aka the men buying the prostitutes. I've made the case before on this Reddit and I 100% agree with Kyle on this one. 

Don't masterbate. Legalize, tax, and regulate. What do we want?

Producer Pat!

When do we want it? 
As soon as possible on the regular show with consistent frequency!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUtrXnP1JEE

At the very end of the video David says that it isn't worth it to ignore people who watch Fox news and believe their BS. I would like to point out that David helped me see straight and I was once a Republican who voted for Trump. 

People watch Fox News for a variety of reasons, but I wouldn't say all of them, myself included, are absolute boneheads. Maybe it's family upbringing that makes them believe Fox News is trustworthy, my story, or maybe people are hardcore conservative but in any case I don't believe that all Fox News audience members, and not everyone who voted for Trump is completely lost. If we give up on these people, they'll give up on us and stay in the Republican party where they aren't treated with disrespect. That's my two centsGood candidates for this term are people like Sargon of Akkad and throngs of like minded anti sjw youtubers.  People who when it comes to actual government policies, are not at all aligned with the right, are not socially conservative, are mostly socially liberal.  Are mixed on economics, but when it comes to the sort of cultural attitudes and reactions... they share an awful lot with the right.

So they are not economic conservatives, or social conservatives, but they are reactionary much like the right, so why not call them cultural reactionaries?  These are the anti immigrant segment of Brexit voters.  The anti immigrant faction in the US.

I get why there would be a rise in much of Europe with a more antagonist population of conservative muslims flooding into their home countries, but the reaction to such things is what separates a cultural reactionary from a standard liberal or someone further to the left that is more in love with Islam and wants to go to the other extreme and offer special protections because minority = must protect.

What do you think?  Is it a bad formulation?  Are there better words for it?

People like Sargon stick out to me, as do many others because they might agree with a dozen left leaning policies, and get more of what they actually want politically by voting for someone on the left, but because of their cultural reactions and attitude towards certain hot button issues, they focus on that above all else.  It's people fueled by their hatreds more than their preferences.  This to me is the essence of their kind of mindset.The test?  

David can force his class to watch this old interview

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD-B44Uxjew

and have the students isolate and identify each logical fallacy contained therein.  Now this might not be a fair test, the students might need more than 3 hours to catalog all the flaws coming off Jesse Peterson.. but then, that's what grading on a curve was invented!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JxkyHgjQqnAI don't really know much about the cryptocurrency market...but, is it possible for an individual, or group of individuals, essentially a venture capital group, such as Raviga, to at any point acquire enough of a stake in the show/group, significant enough to essentially turn the independent media into a media organization controlled by financial interests?

If so...is that a dangerous idea?

Or -- is it finally a way to use whatever means necessary to get The Holy Motamedi [Genuflects] and Vegan Producer Pat back on the show?Look, do what you wanna do. If you like to drink, drink, if you wanna smoke, smoke. If you don't wanna smoke, you don't gotta smoke. If you don't wanna drink, you don't gotta drink. But why is it that so many people think that cannabis should be demonized more than alcohol in terms of advertising, legalization, what doctors want you to take, and so many other bizarre things that don't add up? 

Look at my home state of Oregon for instance. Republican Monica Wehby is in charge of the Oregon Health Authority, which basically uses tax payer money to fund an organization called "stay true Oregon." They supposedly "focus" on propagating that people under 21 shouldn't smoke, which sounds somewhat responsible (despite the fact weed should be for people 18 and over, not 21 but that's a convo for a different day) until you actually see their page. They advertise ALOT on YouTube and especially Instagram. They got ads that come across as VERY Prohibitionist, telling people, "is it worth it to lose your job over pot?" This is EXACTLY why we need unions so they can stand up for the right of recreational users to use AFTER work and for medical users to use during work (as long as they don't operate heavy Machinery, preform surgery or something like that). But since we got this kinda crap floating around Instagram, we still gotta fight the undue stigmas that surround pot. I see beer ads all the time yet why no pot ads in Oregon? You can thank the Oregon "Health" authority for that. They have yet to educate ANYONE on the dangers of serious drugs like herion, or meth, it's only about stigmatizing pot so the alcohol company's can make more money.

One reason I often hear on why people justify their hypocritical double standards is that pot causes mental illness. This critic of pot I find lacking self-analysis of their own favorite vice: ALCOHOL. Alcohol can still cause mental illness, yet I don't see schools or doctors saying that you sound quit drinking because it's bad for your mental health. Hell! A doctor even recommended that my grandma drink whiskey for reasons that make no sense other than to encourage her to drink more. Can pot lead to mental illness? Certainly not in all cases. Same with alcohol. 

Whenever I hear people say "pot causes mental illness", I ask them how they can know that for certain. 8 times out of 10 they give me some argument from authority "my doctor told me..." "I learned in health class,..." "I'm a medical professional, the doctor is always right." As some who is one of the least authoritarian people you'll ever meet, this argument doesn't pursued me.  Here's a 4 second video on how I see authoritarianism: https://youtu.be/m_8xkl5TlXA

The other 2 times out of ten I get one of two arguments. Either A) a person knows someone with mental illness and they smoked pot. However the same people that bring this personal antidote up are almost NEVER willing to accept the fact that people with mental illness have genetic predispositions can pot could exasperate, nor are they willing to confront what I see as the biggest whole in that argument: people don't choose to be mentally ill. To say otherwise is frankly equivalent to saying that a person with low IQ choose to be stupid because they didn't read their bible enough, or whatever stupid reasons people to suppose that having a low IQ is a choice. It is degrading to the mentally ill, and treats those with mental illness as needing punishment. 

Look at it this way: depression is often associated with insomnia. People smoke pot to treat their insomnia. Did smoking pot really caused some to be depressed? I know that most people bring up schizophrenia, but I used the depression analogy for a reason. Maybe the mentally ill use to pot to cope with their mental illness, and the symptoms of those illnesses? Nobody on the "cannabis is not healthy for you" side is willing to debate that point in regards to mental health and cannabis. "If you need something to make you sleep, you should take a highly addictive sleeping medication!" Is what they would tell me, if they are being honest about how addictive these sleeping meds do to people. I've tried melatonin, took a handful, and was up til 3 am, perhaps one of the few non addictive sleeping meds, over the counter, and it doesn't work for me. 

B) "statistically speaking, schizophrenia is highly correlated with mental illness because researchers found out that half of people that have mental illness, also smoked pot at one time or another." I find this to be the only argument that somewhat stands up. On one hand, we got statistics and perhaps the mentally ill use pot to excess, okay, don't use pot in excess. On the other hand, like I said earlier, how do we know that the mentally ill were trying to treat the symptoms of their mental illness, not knowing they had begun developing a mental illness? Perhaps mental illness is only inevitable with some number of unlucky people, and to say that pot causes mental illness is to say that mentally ill people choose to be that way enforces this POISONOUS narrative that the mentally ill choose prefer to suffer. I find that absurd. No one WANTS to suffer, not even the most depressed man on earth. They suffer from mental illness because that is unfortunate their nature. 

Cigarette Smokers don't smoke cause they actually want cancer, erectile dysfunction and other health problems correlated with smoking. They smoke cause they think they are beyond the point of "no return" in terms of quitting and that's why they continue to smoke. Yes - it's called the David Pakman show. 

David's smart enough to realize some viewers don't just tune in for Pakman. Some of us pay our discounted memberships to help support the show, and get access to commercial free shows, and in my case, I like to watch the show on youtube and the bonus show. 

There have been, and will always will be, people attracted to the show for more than just david. 

The social -- this forum, the discord, even friendships developed on Snapchat-- aspect of the unique TDPS viewing community is what I value most, and why I contribute financially. 

But this is not about me. It's about the reality that David own up to this, and at least give the people who may not be subscribers what they are entitled to: For the Many, Not the Few: Producer Pat. 

It may not be many - but, David, hear me, when I say this: You are not gaining some- if only a few subscribers as a result of pat not being on the regular show, or not offering a free preview of the bonus show with Pat.

And if your financial situation is as serious as you make it out to be - I suggest you think on these things.

I believe I speak for members of this whole community when I say that we will, and shall, do the best we can within our means to support you - but please don't offer platitudes:

We demand Vegan Producer Pat on the regular show, or that you offer a 2 minute, or prudent preview of the bonus show to non-members. 

Drug dealers and their products don't sit on a corner and sell themselves - and the proven model of offering a sample works for most all products - I propose you offer part of, or one of, the bonus shows per week as a means to drive membership. 

To a prospective member, 'Bonus Show' literally means nothing. It is burdened without any meaning. You can change that. You should change that. 

As an adjunct professor, and a person of journalistic persuasion, you must not forget: 

Show - don't tell. 

And, deep in your heart - find the compassion for those who cannot afford membership. The high school kid watching on his school library computer. The guy on public wifi who can't pay his internet bill, who finds solace in your show - as many of us do. The robot(s) -
 such as u/howsci - who are learning of humanity. Please. 

Your power in giving the people what they want - and what they need - is as easy as putting pat on if even for a minute or so on the regular show...it's the right thing to do. 

You know it. 
I know it. 
Everybody knows it. Disclaimer: Okay, okay, okay, before I get chewed out for saying "Russian Troll" look, I get it. We can't go around and call everyone we disagree with politically a Russian Troll. Sean Hannity isn't a Russian troll, Pat Robertson isn't a Russian troll, etc. 

However I bring this issue up because I've heard some people talk about HA Goodman on this sub Reddit, calling him a troll working for the kremlin, and I wanna know why do people say that about him? I watched a fair amount of his videos about predictions during the 2016 general election, and California primary, so yea, I'm aware how wrong his predictions were. Especially regarding the indictment of Hillary Clinton, Bernie winning the primary, etc. but that doesn't necessarily mean he is a troll colluding with the Russians. I also know that he was a contributor at the HuffPost for quite a while, so he actually has experience in political commentary prior to the 2016 election. 

But why do people call HA Goodman a Russian troll? Okay, his rhetoric was fairly divisive but that DOESN'T mean he is a Russian Troll. Has information about him come out about H.A. that I'm not aware of? Has he said something I'm not aware of? I don't keep up with his content, or anything regarding him because of how wrong his predictions have been in the past nor am I ever interested in his content. Miami-Dade county is arguably one of the most liberal counties in the south, but can they legalize cannabis in that county? Perhaps, if we organized a group to gather 100k signatures in Miami, that could very well be on the ballot. Thus, other counties will follow, and you may even see legalized cannabis in some of counties in red states. I have an opportunity. With a job and legal migrant scheme solicitors and all. I dunno if I’d be able to have the gumption to leave as much as I have here behind. 

If you could, should, and would you leave the United States for Britain or Australia? What other country would you go to?According to the young Turks someone may be indicted as soon as Monday.

He's already in the coffee game, I say he should get into the snack market as well. 

Snacking is fun - and for everyone!So as someone who is very disgruntled with the current political climate I have thought about the many ways we could fix this from new politicians to a brand new constitution. As a past time I imagined what I would do if I ever got a time machine and now I ask you if you got a time machine and you wanted to go back to one moment in history to change one aspect what would you change? I have flipped back and forth between

1: A critical battle that could have won Great Britain the revolutionary war and give them assistance winning, therefore the United States never forms and we get absorbed into Great Britain which has single payer healthcare, some checks on money in politics, and is much more left leaning than the US ever was. 

2: The Constitutional Convention: I would go back and give them all the wisdom I have about money in politics, slavery, how we need a centralized bank, and give them a giant delivery of 21st century inspired legislation.

3: Right before the 1860 election. I would talk with Lincoln, explain what the fuck happens in the future and help him win the Civil War more expediently but give him a list of 21st century inspired legislation for him to pass with his political talent and his newfound political capital (if a raging war gave him gains in the senate imagine what ending the war early would do for his political capital). 

 I'm curious what moment you would go to in American history and changeIn his /it's posting about accusing other users of being trolls and calling out for a ban, of two users of this subreddit - it has become clear that the actions are not in the spirit of this forum

You can't come on here and make accusations like that. 

Especially in a time of turmoil where we are missing our beloved pat. 

You should be ashamed and withdraw your post, u/howsci - and other members here should join me in pressuring him to do so. "What does this have to do with politics!?" Perhaps, quite a lot. If people are more unhappy with their current jobs, then could that effect the way they vote? Which might explain why a surprisingly big number (around 33%) of registered republicans actually are pro choice according to Pew Research.

https://www.google.com/amp/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/07/on-abortion-persistent-divides-between-and-within-the-two-parties-2/%3Famp%3D1


For instance, let's say you've been working at a grocery store for 15 years. You're sick of working there, but due to different restraints and lack of experience in other fields, you can't get another job so easily. Could this unhappiness with your job lead you to vote differently? 

Let's take Barack Obama's campaign. Hope and Change were the motto. Chances are, people really want a change in their working environment. According to this data from NPR, 33% of Americans make less than 10k up to 30k a year. 

http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/16/156688596/what-americans-earn

I can't imagine with pay that low, that those people making that little money per year would find their jobs radiating a feeling of happiness with the way things are going. They want change.

Maybe, job satisfaction is part of the reason independents who voted for Obama, decided to vote for Trump in 2016.
They felt like Hillary was the same old same old, and that Trump was gonna spice things up. That same feeling of wanting to change from your shitty job to a fulfilling career is perhaps part of the reason why the Trump Campaign was fueled by a lot of angst. I'm generally with progressives on a lot of issues: single payer, free college, 15$ minimum wage, abortion, environment and a plethora of other issues. For the past two years or so, I've been trying to come up with a solution to make mass shootings virtually impossible while letting law abiding firearm owners keep their guns. Here's my new solution on how such can be done, while letting people still be able to purchase AR15's that are modified, making massacres of the sort we see on a common basis virtually impossible unless you illegally obtain a gun. I believe these rifles have potential for practical self defense in rural areas, so banning them is not an option for me. 

How I would modify the AR15 in particular to make it safer for everyone:
- mandatory fixed stocks. If the stock of the rifle was fixed, meaning it was stuck in place on the rifle like most shotguns, it could not be replaced without a gunsmith, or replaced with a bumpfire stock. 
-fixed low capacity magazines (10-20rounds). We've all heard of bullet buttons, but I think a solution that goes even farther, with more success of saving lives would be to require gun manufacturers to make their semi automatic rifles with fixed magazines, meaning it could not be de-attached from the gun to quickly reload . If you had to unlatch the top receiver of your semi automatic rifle to reload it, because you can't reload a gun with a fixed clip, that could take the bad guys even more time to reload, perhaps a good 2-3 minutes. 2 or 3 minutes is crucial in fleeing from a situation, and possibly enough time to take down the bad guy, like in the case of the Aurora shooting. It would really put a damper on a bad guy's plans. 
-mental health exams. While I understand these can be used in a discriminatory manner, however police officers in the US are required to take mental exams (700 questions), before they can become a law enforcement agent. I think there is some reasonable solution to be found with mental health exams without discriminating against people's second amendment rights.
-universal background checks (obviously)

Constructive criticism would be appreciated, I won't respond to ad hominem attacks.I will smoke a bong rip in honor of Pakman getting 420k subscribers, but I'm gonna smoke weed anyway, so that number is fairly arbitrary to me, but congrats David on 420k subscribers! https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/03/17/why-does-donald-trump-demonize-cities/?utm_term=.bcc579382efd


I don't know how many people would agree with my assessment, but I've linked to and used this article CONSTANTLY throughout the year as pushback against the LIE that the liberal model and experiment in governance is the failure that needs to be corrected by conservatism.  The internet is infested by the right, and they have little to say regarding this particular chart.

Will Wilkinson, the writer, is not even a standard liberal, he is/was a libertarian who used to work at the cato institute, but he was also part of the liberaltarian movement that I heard about on bloggingheads years ago.  Anyway, anyone else have thoughts?

If you think something else was more insightful or illuminating, or perhaps just a better political weapon and rebuke to claims by the right, please let us all know.Who here thinks that there are nefarious motives behind this support?

Hillary Freakin Clinton tweeted her support. Last time she was in power, she destroyed a whole country and single-handedly caused a humanitarian crisis in Northern Africa and the immigration crisis in Europe. 

Your thoughts?If you didn't know, Senate Bill 719, a bill which allows a person to start a petition in court to get guns taken away from people deemed mentally deranged and who poss a clear threat to themselves/others, goes into effect today in my home state of Oregon. As a left leaning gun owner I have mixed feelings about this bill, but I hope to get some of those points across in this post. 

The good: 
-a person who is mentally deranged could have their guns confiscated, if a judge requested, which isn't bad. Less guns in the hands of mentally deranged people will be a good thing
-there are provisions that use this law to punish anyone who might abuse this law to harass gun owners with up to a year in jail. So if a court order was used against you unjustly, you can defend yourself in a court of law, and send your accuser to a year in jail. 
-this could be a start to encourage gun owners in Oregon to not use their weapons to menace people

The bad:
-your crazy ex wife could decide she wants to fuck over your day by lying to law enforcement that you are an threat, thus taking away your guns while you are in the appeals process, leaving you defenseless from home intruders and violent criminals. But idk the extent of evidence needed to make this happen so this NRA talking point could be complete non sense, however knowing how vitriolic people are against law abiding gun owners, it's probably gonna be a matter of time when the NRA starts investing in more propaganda against this bill.

What are your thoughts on this new bill passed in Oregon? Do only the insane people have to worry about losing their guns, or will this backfire on sane people with horrible relatives?

She fought for civil rights, against police brutality and has passed away from a heart attack at 27. This is sad, but I wanted to post about her, because I don't want her advocacy to go unnoticed. If you don't remember, her father was killed by a choke hold from a police officer after he was accused of selling loose cigarettes. 

Let's not let the Garner's be forgotten! Rest In Peace Eric and Erica. https://www.google.com/amp/s/hightimes.com/culture/hey-nra-patients-gun-rights/amp/

So let me get this straight, the NRA, a supposed PRO GUN organization is actually ANTI GUN OWNER?! Yes, folks, if it wasn't obvious already, the NRA is anti gun owner, and pro corporate interest! If it were up to the NRA, they would confiscate all our guns, so we'd be forced to buy more guns! THE ONE ORGANIZATION THAT IS SUPPOSED TO GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ISSUES LIKE THIS, HAS SUDDENLY CHANGED THEIR TUNE TO BECOME ANTI GUN OWNER! 

The more the NRA appeals to the authoritarian right, and does NOTHING to defend anyone's second amendment rights, the less membership they are going to have, and thus, the less support they will get in congress. It's only a matter of time (10-20 years), when the NRA is going to be forced to join the left in fighting for gun rights. Many gun owners are liberal (obviously), but don't support the NRA because of shit like this! 

Like they say: "can't beat them, join them!" 
The NRA is going to eventually have to cooperate with gun owners on the left, which they outright refuse to do such, even with the majority of their own conservative members as of now.Hi David and anyone who might be reading this.

With Israel being in the news so much lately, I am once again in a conflicted situation, being a Jewish Zionist who is critical of the Israeli government and having friends who are extremely anti-Israel.

It seems that there is a complete misunderstanding of what Zionism really means and how it has changed throughout history, and now I find myself questioning the motivations behind it. I was brought up believing in Israel unconditionally, but was not aware of anything to do with an occupation until a few years ago in my last year of college.

In the last few years, I've seen people mischaracterize Zionism from the right and left. On the right, one Trump supporter conflated the term with "oligarchy." A "friend" straight-up called me a white supremacist because I criticized organizers of pride parades and dyke marches for actively excluding Jews because of an assumption of Zionist beliefs based on the appearance of the Jewish Pride flag.

I was always taught that Zionism was simply a belief that the Jews are an ethnic race and deserve their own country, and that early modern Zionists (circa 1896) were looking to settle in Uganda so as to not disturb the peaceful situation in the Palestinian region at the time. But anti-Israel activists have quoted David Ben Gurion and Theodore Hertzl as calling for the ethnic cleansing of inhabitants. I'm not sure what is true anymore.

David, is there a chance you can do a deep-dive into zionism and how it factors into the current Israel situation? I think that would be a pretty interesting and educational piece.Moriarity supports executing convicted murderers in part, since they have demonstrated by their crime that they have regarded at least one human life as worthless. Shouldn't those who judge and convict these criminals avoid demonstrating the same lack of compassion? Or is the questionable catharsis achieved by executions justified?  It is sickening what is happening. White South Africans are getting murdered by gangs of criminal savages; these are people who are working very hard to maintain their livelihood under a blatantly racist &amp; black supremacist government. It is a scandal that the mainstream media is quiet about this. Please read the story carefully &amp; share your thoughts. I will provide links to story below.

I know David is chummy with Rubin, but many people like myself hate watch him much like people on the right hate watch tyt.  And Rubin loves to play the victim, as do many of the people in his sphere when talking about how "the left" behaves and interacts with him.

He is constantly bitching about how the left won't engage or go on his show, so I think it's past time to map out and find a bunch of people on the left that would be perfectly willing to go on Dave Rubins show and talk politics, and their perspective of advocating for a left wing view of politics and the world.

Dave keeps wondering why he is more welcome by people on the right, pretending his entire years + long shtick of doing little else but shitting on the left has no bearing on how he is received.  But I digress, let's get to work on a list of possibilities.


-David Pakman - Dave Rubin seems to hate Pakman less than other people on the left, perhaps he thinks he's more reasonable and not so bestial and beneath contempt that he's no longer worth speaking to, but this is a possibility.

-Kyle Kulinski - They seem to have had a bit of a falling out based on a past conversation, but this would definitely be an interesting guest from the left

-Ana Kasparian - This might be awkward having someone still affiliated with TYT, the outfit Dave left in a rage over, but why not have Ana on if she was willing (would she be willing?) to break up the right wing cheer fest on Rubins show.

-Sam Seder - He has already said he would go on Rubins show, Rubin refuses to have him on, because someone associated with Seders outfit said something mean about Dave.  I'd love to see Seder go on as Sam Seder has had NUMEROUS interactions with libertarian types on his own show and has plenty of practice hashing out ideas... but I doubt this will happen because Dave Rubin needs a safe space for both himself and his conservative audience.


-Thom Hartmann - He is under the radar for many, even though he has been doing this for some time.  He might be seen by some as someone in the more moderate camp, but I consider him fairly knowledgeable in many spheres and willing to engage people on the right with a bit more historical perspective thrown in.

-Contrapoints - Left leaning youtuber with a less authoritarian bent than some others, has no problems talking to most people.

-Others?  Know of some other candidates that might be willing to go on Rubins show?  And for the record, this is not about having them go on and talk about the weather or how awful the left is.  No, this is a left wing version of MANY of Rubins guests, where they make a case for their modern liberal world view.  Why they explicitly choose that model over an older classical liberal model of a more hands off approach.  What failures they see in right wing policy, etc etc.  Who else speaks to that niche on the left?  Know any other youtubers?  podcasters?  

I want candidates so we can contact them and get affirmatives that they would, if allowed, go on Rubins show to talk, so I don't have to hear any more of this crap from "centrist" tools like Eric Weinstein here:

I want to prove these smug, self righteous right wing enablers wrong about the left, which they consistently define down to the worst of all possible examples and little else.I'm getting a new job with higher pay, so I'd thought I'd use the money I make from collecting cans, 150$ a month, to donate to three political organizations 40$ each, and donate 10$ to David's, and Kyle's patreon, and spend the 10$ on a New York Times subscription.

What might you guys recommend? Take a look at the first section of this clip

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnpzwdjqvqw

I looked this up after seeing Kyle bitch about the lack of coverage regarding Feinsteins more progressive challengers.  

She and many other democratic representatives are clearly opposed to these kinds of universal healthcare models.  At one point Feinstein even went into conservative talking points mode and said medicare for all would be a total government takeover of the healthcare system, which would not be true.  Private hospitals and practitioners would still exist, it's not like the NHS in the UK, but she said it anyway.  Is she just confused?

Is the reason really as cynical as people on tyt and Kyle and perhaps David think, that She is just bought and paid for by her donors?  Is it a bit more complicated than that?  Does she think liberal states like California would lose out because much of the advanced medical technology, and technology in general is produced in liberal states because... let's face it, we are the seat of knowledge and modernity in multiple ways across civilizations the world over (not much happening in rural backwaters)? 

I get the sense that Feinstein is not being complete honest with her rationale to the public, but what about in private to more liberal senators and representatives?  Has someone like Tulsi Gabbard or Ro Khana had a heart to heart talk with them?  If they do not want to open up to us in public, what is really said and argued behind closed doors?

Do we have any idea?

I wonder if David has any inkling, he is definitely more connected than most of us plebs, I wonder if his vast contacts have any insight into this.  I remember hearing Nancy Pelosi talk about not supporting medicare for all, but then talked about shoring up the ACA, and expanding it to cover more people and presumably use the built in funding sources they already had to increase coverage.  Others might support universal healthcare models and just genuinely believe it is a loser of an idea because of demagogues (like Feinstein apparently) parroting lies like it being a government takeover of everything.   I just want to know peoples motivations.

I know Dianne Feinstein gets a lot of hate among progressive circles, and I definitely think it is time for her to step aside due to her current views not being aligned with the center of mass of her own party and the direction it's headed.  But I do not despise Dianne, I do not think she is a bad person with rotten values and genuine indifference to outside groups like I get from sleazeballs like Ted Cruz or Steven Crowder.White people have enough problems of our own with low birth rates, an ageing population, opioid crisis etc. Why should we cater to illegal immigration or Islamic terrorists, when we have so many issues to take care off. Why do some of you carry so much guilt? It sickens me, can someone please provide me with answers?Under the proposal, kids of incredibly rich parents such as Bill and Melinda Gates or Beyoncé and Jay-Z would get the lowest amount, $500, while babies born into extremely poor families would get the highest amount, $50,000. There would be a sliding scale to determine how much each baby would received based on the parents' wealth. A typical middle-class baby would receive around $20,000.

While there are a number of criticisms about Baby Bonds, especially how to pay for them, presidents and prime ministers around the world are trying to figure out ways to reduce inequality. In the United States, inequality is back at the levels of the 1920s' Gilded Age. It's gotten so bad that Wall Street firms are warning their clients to pay attention to it, because inequality is driving the rise of populism. Torsten Slok, Deutsche Bank's chief international economist, says the United States and other nations are going to need creative thinking to address this. He called Baby Bonds an “intriguing” idea.

I am fascinated by history and how much the human kind has not progressed, just because humans don't like to learn from their mistakes. Modern times are just like bad remakes of old classics: new actors, new decorations, but the plot stays the same.

Do you think our modern society is qualitatively different than societies of past centuries?I'm watching the winter olympics and it has me wondering. Is there a point to separating male and female olympic athletes? Why can't the olympics be co ed? At this point in society more and more aspects are acceptable to be co ed, why not sports divisions?

Edit: I've seen some of the comments about the performance levels between men and women. Didn't realize the difference was that pronounced. Hello all. In light of President Trump's "shithole" comments this week, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I believe that there is something missing in the analysis of his comments.

Putting the racism aside for a moment.

This president arose as a business man. He won't let anyone forget it. That is the only world he's ever known. So, when he says that "we don't need" immigrants from certain countries, it sounds like he sees America as just another one of his businesses, and immigrants are the pool of candidates vying for not just a job, but a prestigious job at this business.
To branch off of this point, I'm going to use a job analogy to explain what (I believe) immigration is supposed to be about.. If someone likes their job, they are unlikely to willingly leave it. But if they don't like it because it doesn't provide the growth opportunities they want, they start looking another job where they can happily thrive. Now, replace "job" with "country."

This was unquestionably racist. However, it was also elitist, something I thought his die-hard supporters resented. I thought his base resented the highly educated and the institution of higher education.

Any thoughts?
Normally when people talk about global super powers the discussion starts and stops with countries in the northern hemisphere. 

What are the chances the countries in South America unite and become The United States of South America, and correspondingly the countries of Africa unite to become The United States of Africa?

I know many of these countries are currently experiencing 3rd world problems but I remain optimistic, for their sake, that advances in technology will one day help them leap frog the issues they've experienced until this point. 

Edit: I remain optimistic that advances in technology can make infrastructure and medical advances that can help relieve many of the issues these countries have today. 

I ask because things like split ticket voting and compromise is all but dead now and bigger legislation basically requires having your entire party having enough members to push through your agenda.

In that world where compromise is either undesirable or impossible, isn't the only solution to dramatically increase the percentage of the population that identifies as democrat vs republican?  Liberal vs Conservative?  Even though Hillary won the popular vote, it was still only by 3 million votes, why is it so close?  It seems to me we need to break through this roughly even split and get more runaway support.  How we do that is another matter, but we can't do much with this political system without super majorities.


And the last time that happened was in the direct aftermath of the worst of the Iraq war failures and a massive economic crash.  We can't rely on twin calamities by the opposing party to make that happen again.(try not to make your head explode)

I tried pointing out one of the many flaws, particularly the key variable in support or opposition to the 1964 civil rights bill having almost NOTHING to do with party and EVERYTHING to do with region.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#By_party_and_region

conservative or democrat from the old confederate states?  Your representative was probably against the bill, anywhere else?  probably for it.  Not linked to party, but these LIARS keep trying to link racial animus as something tied to the core of the democratic party.

Found this posted over on the basic income subreddit and found the article interesting.

Basically, they suggest monopsony is a good candidate for part of the problem of wage stagnation.

Fewer employers = less need to compete on wages for labor and less risk of getting your employees poached by other companies.

This problem is worse of course, in smaller towns, less severe in cities.


Reason number 872 why the conservative coalition is a dead end of reason and thought.  The alpha and omega of their policy concerns related to the economy revolve around tax rates being ever lower and pulling back regulations.  And scores of other meaningful variables are left ignored.  Because they do not matter?  No, because their anti government dogma does not include those as causal forces for good or ill.

http://wjla.com/news/offbeat/elective-courses-on-bible-instruction-in-west-virginia-schools-proposed

This news report popped up on my Facebook newsfeed, and I've seen quite a few stories like it pop up over the last few years. The difference here would be that the course would be elective.
Of course, because I'm apparently a mental masochist, I dared to look in the comments section and found many comments along the lines of "Put God back into schools" and "even if you're not a Christian, it will teach you good morals."
My view on this: we have separation of church and state, and that applies to public education. If a private church-based school wants to require it, fine. But I don't want my tax dollars going toward religious indoctrination. If your kid is enrolled in public school, have them learn the Bible at home or at church if it means so much to you.

Here's another thought: bring back Civics! We had a Government class my senior year of high school, but that was a light course on basic government functions and political science.

I know I just kind of ranted there, but any thoughts on this?Booker calls her complicit in the President's agenda for not speaking what she knows is the truth.

tears of rage?  Who actually believes he was filled with any such thing?  Does anyone?  His speech patterns, his hand movements, his everything just exudes fakeness and him trying to perform for credit.

Now contrast with these performances of outrage.  This man is lost to us, he disgraced himself several times, you may already know who this is from that hint alone.  But when he railed against something there was a sense of FIRE behind the critique, a genuine disgust and rage.  

This does not seem to be a skill all people have.  I do not think David Pakman has this capacity at all, he is too composed and controlled (at least from his public appearances, maybe he is hiding some fire breathing dragon of rage).  Cenk has it to a decent degree, Kyle has it to a degree, even when he is going off the wall on some issue.  Bernie does not have it at all.  It's an interesting thing.

Oh, I forgot to show you my masterclass of an example of genuine looking rage and fire.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBjif02ZLmI

Especially that last segment.  Did you detect any fake rage there?

Part of this is that he was kind of a fighter, he actually lept right in and advocated for his ideas and called out the bullshit that was tossed in his face right then and there.

Here is another example:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvXrn4TEngE#t=1m33s

You see that?

Now that I recall these videos, he was kind of like a liberal Ben Shapiro, but with more substance.  A champion, with better sense.  That kind of advocacy is a joy to witness on your side, and I think it would be useful to cultivate it in people.  Again, not everyone has the temperament for that, but that kind of display cuts into the oppositions noise.https://i.imgur.com/led15Z7.gifv


Should we be worried about getting the results we want?Considering the Catholic Church's proven history of cover-ups of abuse and protection of the perpetrators one would expect the Pope to choose his words more wisely and not conclude that accusations are slander until they are proven false.He says that "nobody cares about online privacy". There is an interpretation of this phrase that makes it true: if you poll people I can believe that the people who don't care far outnumber those who do.

However his example betrays what a simpleton he is. He says "those people who say they care about privacy, offer them a discount coupon and see how fast they take it" (my paraphrasing).

What he's referring to is presumably the fact that coupon codes are effectively tracking codes with a discount attached. They're often used by companies not only to bring in extra sales but also to track who found which coupon code where. (not the vanity ones like Pakman's, but the ones which look like an odd string of random letters and numbers; those are tracking codes).

Here's the thing, the people who value privacy weight that value against the value of everything else, _just like everyone else on the planet_ are constantly weighting conflicting options against each other. People who "value privacy" shouldn't be thought of as fundamentalists that see the world in binary terms, where you either "have privacy" or you don't (some would argue that Richard Stallman is one example of this category). Instead, these people who value privacy should be thought of as people who include privacy in the list of upsides/downsides when considering any specific trade-off (as opposed to most people, for whom privacy isn't a point of consideration).

Example A) You ask me to choose between two scenarios. In scenario one I'm not being tracked (good) and I don't get the discount (bad), and in scenario two I'm being tracked and put on some database (bad) but I do get a discount (good). Obviously, each scenario has good and bad things and so I'm going to ask: what database is that, and how big is the discount? Then I'll decide whether I take the offer. Is this unreasonable? Of course not.

Example B) You ask me to choose between two scenarios. In scenario one I'm choosing to run an adblocker and I'm not being tracked (good) but FB makes a little less money off of me (neutral, because I don't care how much money FB makes). In scenario one I'm NOT running an adblocked and I'm being tracked (bad) and FB makes a little more money off of me (neutral, because I still don't care how much money FB is making). For someone who doesn't care about privacy, these two scenarios are indistinguishable. For someone who does, the choice is obvious: you're asking me to choose between a scenario that only has upsides and one that only has downsides. The choice is easy.

Examples A) and B) reflect what goes in the mind of every rational person. Apparently this is too much nuance for this simpleton.

(I'm also in advertising, so if you're interested in knowing more ask away)This discussion may be a waste of time, but I am frustrated to high heaven that among my conservative/libertarian friends this is all on Schumer, calling him the ultimate hypocrite based on his 2013 statements.
We all remember that the 2013 shutdown was over the GOP Congress trying to repeal the ACA in passing the budget, knowing full-well that Obama would never sign it. It was a scapegoat trap.
History is rhyming already. By pitting CHIP against DACA, the GOP trapped Democrats once again, and from the start of this week I knew that no matter what, Democrats were in a lose-lose situation. It was pretty clear from Schumer's description of Friday's events that no deal could be reached.

Any thoughts on how this might play out in midterms? I'm very concerned, given the president's campaign ads that are out already over this. The American people are so easily fooled, and because of that I'm not confident about November.I've been thinking about the November mid terms elections and I had an idea we could use against economic conservatives and the Republicans who voted in favor of the GOP tax plan. We can say that they're "Soft on Taxes" to

1: Mock their "soft on crime" or "soft on terror"
2: Hit the republicans hard for corruption

What do you guys think?I've seen both everywhere, both among friends and randomly online. It bugs me that this fight is still happening. So, let's at least have some fun with it.

It's okay to think they're equally ridiculous.http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/339248-dems-push-leaders-to-talk-less-about-russia

Apparently, according to a survey done in July, Healthcare and Jobs are considered some of the most important issues by Americans, while being reported on nearly the least by the media.  On the flip side, 75% of reporting is done on the Russia story, but the Russia story being considered nearly the least important issue by Americans.  I'm not sure how trustworthy the survey is.

But is the Russia story a good strategy to winning in 2018?  Should we focus less on this story and more on Jobs, Healthcare, and Yemen?

Am I missing something?

Ikea and Ingvar Kamprad are from Sweden, Sweden is sometimes called socialistic and some say that socialism prevents business. This is counter-example to that business-preventing claim. 
O'Brien shows the good side of Haiti which in spite of the abuse delivered by the U.S. and other nations over the years the Haitians have produced a viable, respectable culture totally underserving of the term used by Trump to describe the struggling nation.

If America is ever to evolve I'm convinced Nationalization is one of the tools we need. How do you implement nationalization without it being mis used?

For context I would nationalize

1: Internet Service Providers
2: all pharmaceutical companies
3: All private hospitals
4: All oil companies
5: all banks, enough accountants to file America's taxes
6: all private schools and charter schools
7: As many apartment complexes and hotel space to ensure 100% housing
8: All private military corporationsI am partial to ads that make fun of the policies of right wingers, especially with a little hyperbole sprinkled (or dumped!) in.  And I LOVED this ad about Paul Ryan (it had a Ryan lookalike).

For pet owners who fall on hard times there are food banks and other non-government local community based programs that provide assistance. The government can't even provide properly for human beings with needs consistently. When we've achieved that maybe then I'd support my taxes paying for other people's pet support.In the age of the 24-hour news cycle, 6AM "presidential" tweet storms, and hyper-partisanship, do we even need a SOTU speech?

Maybe it's something unique to the Trump administration, but I feel like we are constantly bombarded with stats about the economy, which seems to be the only measuring stick this administration cares about. All of this president's speeches are predictable. Even if he sticks to the teleprompter and behaves "presidential" for the duration of the speech, but by tomorrow morning he revert back to his normal rage-tweeting self.

So, what's the point of the SOTU address in this day and age?We need more left wingers, preferably liberal gun owners trolling and debunking in the comment section on the NRA's YouTube videos! They put out so bullshit, no wonder conservative gun owners are so mindlessly brainwashed and indoctrinated! They listen to this kinda shit at work all day! Maybe I'll make YouTube videos, like the format Kyle uses to debunk Pat Robertson, or David with race&amp;IQ but instead the NRA. Like holy cow, the NRA has turned against base, gun owners, so they can suck off Trump and their corporate interest, no shocker there. I consider myself very left leaning, however the one issue I'm moderately right leaning on compared with most on the left is guns. There's lots of liberal gun owners like myself, but it's not popular considering all the stigma around guns, and gun control. I believe in some form of regulation, but implementation is where I find myself disagreeing with some on the left. For example:

-I want mental exams to be mandatory for purchasing a gun, however, not so long, where it takes a whole two, or three hours out of your schedule. An hour for the test while they conduct your background check, tops. Also, they can't make the testing so confusing, like IQ tests for voting in the 1960's, just deem so they everyone to be too incompetent to own a gun. 
-assault rifles is where it gets complicated. While I understand assault rifles are impractical for anyone living in suburban or urban areas, they are practical when on a large ranch, or any large private property for self defense. You could have a couple crazy people with a guns dumping a body on your property, and sometimes a 9mm, or shotgun does not have good range to shoot the people if they have already been shooting at you from afar, and you can't escape. In that case, an AR15 would be your best option for self defense.
-large capacity magazines and bullet button type devices are where it gets overly complicated and nuanced. There are those that are already so anti gun, they think that banning semi autos would be a better option, or the people that are so pro gun that they don't see why they shouldn't be allowed to own a large capacity mag. My position is that these bullet buttons are a good solution, but not enforced strictly enough. If it were up to me, I'd mandate all gun manufacturers make their semi autos with non detachable 10 round magazines. I've shot AR15's for fun many times, you don't need 30 rounds to get an adrenaline rush. Ten is already pretty. 

Anyway, the NRA really should be trolled more often, like gawd, they are such hacks, it's irritating. On a scale of 0-10 where 0 = total dumlster fire and 10 = gold standard.

Trump
Joe Kennedy
Bernie Sanders

I thought Sanders response was the best and most substantive, by far, and having that contrast with the official democratic response shows we have a lot of work to do to make them better.Not as if this is ever going to happened, considering how virtuous people make drinking out to be and how stigmatized sobriety has become. I could imagine booze companies would be going out of business, but does the booze industry affect any other industries? 

I know you need corn to make whiskey, so perhaps corn farmers might be hurt, along with the other ingredients that go along with booze, like sugar, which some people refuse to accept their booze has a TON of sugar.

Is there ANY economic benefit to drinking? Some people say "taxes!" But wouldn't that just even out, after you account for how much drunk driving/drunk assaults are costing tax payers, so if anything, it seems like a tax on booze is just to make up for the negative effects binge drinking has on society. We do little to educate children on alcoholism, show them a fictional documentary, that somewhat glamorizes alcoholism and that's about it. Everywhere I go, it's some ad for Budweiser or some other beer company I could care less about. 

If I could some up the thing I am least proud of in this country, that word would be: alcohol. I swear, everywhere I turn, I feel surrounded by alcoholics. 

I turn on the TV, or go on YouTube, I see booze commercials.

I go on Tinder, get reported for having a selfie with a weed plant, but plenty of girls get to post selfies with drinks in their hands, and confederate flags?!?! 

alcohol Supremacy needs to be called out for what it is: a destructive force to American civility and American society in general. 

Whenever I criticize America's rampant alcoholism epidemic, there's always one dumbass that will call me a Prohibitionist. No, I am not a Prohibitionist, I just criticize how detrimental alcohol has become to American society. 

Sometimes I wonder how many homeless people don't have homes, because their family doesn't like that they don't drink, so they kick him out when he's down, so he can't question their alcoholism! 

Sometimes I wonder how many people don't get that promotion/bonus/raise cause they didn't want to have drinks with their boss. 

Sometimes I wonder how many times I'm rejected by women, for the sole purpose of my status as a tee total'er. I've lost plenty of friends after I quit drinking, honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if women found my lack of alcohol consumption unattractive. Girls just want to have fun, for whatever dumb reason, alcohol is associated with fun, soda isn't fun, but booze is?! Honestly, booze is just as fun as watching paint dry. 

Thanks, big alcohol, for making sure sober people feel as unwanted as possible. No wonder alcoholism is such a problem, cause everyone that drinks perpetuates this myth that they must drink to be moral. You must drink to be part of the cool kids. If you don't drink, suddenly you're unintelligent and boring. 

Honestly, sometimes I don't know who I resent more, NRA members for making me feel alienated for being a liberal gun owner, or alcoholics, for making me feel isolated and stupid for being sober. 

Not that I will ever start drinking again, but ever since I've quit drinking, people have been cutting me out of their life, as if I've changed my sexual orientation or my skin color. I feel this amount of hatred-anonymous towards me can which I can only explain by my own sobriety. Yea maybe I ramble too much, and post about politics a lot on FB but drunk people ramble and you don't see anyone criticize them for that. Kyle Kuliniski and David Pakman are super political, and they drink booze. 

Name a single progressive talk show host that doesn't drink alcohol, whatsoever and maybe you'll see my problem with the culture of alcoholism. Hell, even try naming a conservative talk show host that doesn't drink! 

People say they drink cause it makes them less shy, I think you have to drink for people to like you. Go to a party with soda, and people will look at you like some evil person, and treat you like you just ran off with their 24 pack and truck. 

Rant over, glad got that off my chest. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF2lFGyADtM&amp;t=7m15s


Crowder was clearly flustered and off balance by basic and sensible counters being tossed into that conservative bubble world view of his, and he kept interrupting to try to shut the counters down.  Obvious he does not his mind changed, but he's still less of a weak little coward like Rubin who CUTS OUT the Q&amp;A that does not go the way he wants on live streams.


btw, I'm not sure if that student was on the left exactly, he said he was an economic nationalist and seemed more hostile to immigration than the left and concerned about the wage issues surrounding immigration.  So he might be more aligned with the right on that issue as a practical matter, but on economics, he was going after the libertarian fantasy world view.. or tried to before Crowder saw the rail guns being lined up and aimed at hs world view and tried to shut it down.https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/980175772206993409

One of the most effed up stories I've read in awhile.  This is one of those stories that weeds out the decent and the indecent.  Show it to a conservative, if they think this is justified, you are dealing with trash.I've been listening to Secular Talk since 2012, and I've didn't start watching TDPS regularly until the 2016 general election, not cause I didn't like David, but cause I didn't find out about David until the 2016 election. Ever since David's 2016 live election results, I've been hooked on that TDPS life, and I became a member last December. 

Recently, I've been watching a lot of Jordan Peterson lectures. Occasionally, I disagree with him, especially on social issues like abortion, or the effect porn has on society, but it's not like the stuff he says about those things is enough to make me entirely stop listening. Jordan seems to understands that we need liberals to balance out conservativism and vice Versa, so it's not like Jordan's opinion on issues like abortion and such is coming from some sort of obvious malice towards women. I find his lectures on the big 5 personality traits to have illuminated a lot of mysterious things about people and their political views. 

Is this an unreasonable position?! Maybe I've been watching too much Sam Seder or something, but I feel like being a progressive and watching Jordan Peterson is kinda looked down upon. source- https://myvote.wi.gov/en-US/MyBallot

They even want it to make it unacceptable to acknowledge that there's a nuance. So, when I was doing radio people would ask me how I feel about Faith Goldy's views and I'd have to...I found myself explaining the difference between white nationalism and white supremacism because journalism and white because there's a huge difference and the left wants to make it so that even if you acknowledge that difference there must be like something really dangerous or something really scary about you and so even when I was explaining that difference I felt like very self-conscious about it, right?*

So, this is Lindsay Shepherd's reason for saying "goodbye to the left"; because the left refuses to acknowledge the nuances between White supremacy and White nationalism and that made her feel really uncomfortable. I think that feeling she felt was probably cognitive dissonance, because deep down, the better part of her knows she was trying to make a bad ideology seem less bad than it is. That was why she felt self-conscious. But what do I know? I'm no psychologist.

I guess you could say her leaving the left was a long time coming, but bear in mind that this removal of the nuance between white supremacy and white nationalism by the left in order to control the narrative, this was the straw that broke the camel's back. Really makes you think. 

Stay tuned. I'm sure she will set up a Patreon pretty soon. 

Also, I should point out that it is a bit ironic that Lindsay would accuse the left of refusing to acknowledge the nuances between white nationalism, the alt-right, the far right, white supremacy, et cetera, whilst using the term "the left" over and over again and deciding to "say goodbye to the left" because some leftists were mean to her. Nuance!Looks like the gloves are off. China is threatening to impose a matching 25% tariff on $50bn-worth of US imported soyabeans. 

Remember when Kyle Kulinski thought this was a good thing? As I recall, he called it a "left-wing".I thought David once mentioned that membership does not renew automatically. It appears mine did. 

Could someone clarify?
So many sjws getting triggered that Bernie criticised Obama and believed that he's a racist for doing that. Imagine my shock. In fact they are racist because they are suggesting a black man shouldn't be criticised.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bernie-sanders-obama-anger-martin-luther-king-death-assassination-jackson-mississippi-a8289456.htmlthat stuff was debunked literally weeks after those claims were made, but they're just now saying "hey he wasn't gay"On what it means to be a liberal, as said by JFK:
_______

If by a "Liberal" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people:
Their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties...

Someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a "Liberal", then I'm proud to say I'm a "Liberal.”If you can see a place, a building, hill or mast, it means that data transmission with it is possible with optical methods. A laser or LED has to switch millions of times per second, about as fast as the laser in CD, DVD or Blu-ray player-writer, sending directed light pulses to a telescope kilometers away. Currently this kind of FSO data transmission is rare because there is a strong assumption that even with higher speed and lower price, people would not stand 10% downtime due to weather causing bad visibility. Who knows, difficult to ask about trade-offs in market research because it may be too complicated when answerers may not be concentrating on the questions... On top of that, weather may not cause downtime on internet use, just slower speeds and extra payments when existing cables, wires, 3G and 4G are the only options. 

Is 10% downtime too hard also because there is a form of slight computer illiteracy, a lack in computer skills, that makes one unable to use a computer without internet? 

The amounts and durations of downtime vary greatly between places and depends on the distance needed. Visibility numbers are tracked for seafarers and pilots, so there might be a website with such weather statistics.

FSO is not just for internet, but also for direct peer-to-peer or point to point data transfer with whoever has direct line of sight.What's your opinion on the future of robotics and AI technology?


My thoughts; 
I'm no fan of the drone program whatsoever. However, I do see robotics with the help of AI like Iron Man Jarvis. Mankind will make robots into superheroes like the ones in Marvel film.

Do I see AI turning on mankind? No, because A.I aren't imaginative like humans are. Films like the Matrix and Terminator isn't the feasible outcome. AI/robots need humans to learn about compassion and creativity.

The possibility of drones with self-learning AI does scare the hell out of me, but I hope this technology brings more humanitarian work. Stopping warlords in Africa and the middle east, but not killing them. Feeding the hungry nations around the world. Stuff like that.

Final thought, the only way I see mankind exploring and colonizing other planets is there help with robotic A.Is. Does anyone know and play games called System Shock,  deus ex machina, Bioshock, Mass Effect and Horizon Zero Dawn? Those games have humans achieving the combing AI and humans into one being.

 Like the great Stephen Hawking said humans must reach to the stars to ensure survivability. However, space itself isn't healthy for humans body. So maybe AI and nanotechnology might be the key to our survival.like the guy on here that was claiming there's no evidence that russian security forces carried out war crimes and crimes against humanity in the chechen wars for exampleI just listened to one of his appearances on the after on podcast

https://after-on.com/episodes/024


And it was a fantastic tour of the state of the state of many bioengineering topics.

Also, I know David tends to do shorter interviews of two 10 minute segments on the high end, but this format of an hour length or longer interview allows much more room to breath.  I know, old media has breaks and there is a need to cut things up for those ancient/(read - inferior) mediums, but this is the kind of topic that deserves longer exploration.Hey, I'm the guy from Oregon that asked about Coca Leaves, what was the book you recommended? cause I'm very interested. So I called into David's show today, I was already on my way to school, and wasn't prepared to ask my question, so I ended rambling. I rushed to get to school, so I could take the call, and got lucky to catch the David's line. If I found out 5 or 10 minutes earlier, perhaps I would have been able to make some bullet points instead of rambling. This isn't an end all to rambling callers but perhaps it could have some sort of affect. My main problem were audio levels being off and his female co host coming in as booming, with pakman sounding even, and pat even quieter. I think there was a cough near the end of the show that might've gotten through when the mics were supposed to be dead, but I'm not sure. 

The audio normalization / gate / compression is all over the place and at least for me takes away from the listening experience. 

Aside from that I thought she was pretty decent. 

Could have done without her anecdotes. 

Also, if I'm going to be honest, I'd rather have Pat hosting and then bring an intern or something to run the board. She didn't have any revolutionary moments in my mind. This just happened to me: So I clicked on a Ben Dixon video, and it took 5 minutes, just to not load. Out of nowhere, without clicking on it, or anything, YouTube loaded a dating advice for men INSTANTLY. I don't wanna waste my time with women advice that will probably do nothing for my skinny ass, I want to watch this Dixon video, but noooooo. YouTube wants me to watch dating advice, fuck off youtube! God damn it! 

I notice "misclicks" (for lack of a better word, considering its not like I'm even touching my phone half way through a video, when they play another random video) happen the most on political videos, especially on Secular Talk videos. I'll be half way done with a Secular Talk video, and YouTube is like "fuck you, watch this other video, so you'd have to pull up the video you wanted to finish." 

I've even been mysteriously unsubscribed to TDPS. Since the 2016 election, I've been a regular watcher, and it's not like David has said anything to piss me off enough to un sub. I don't think I've ever been pissed off at anything David has said, so I have no fucking clue why I get mysteriously unsubscribed to TDPS. Now I've watching this cat Ben Swann in the Obama era and now Trump era. I don't take his reports as fact until I checked the facts as well. So I knew what the deal was.

Jump into the topic at hand. I watched the newest video from Ben Swann about the Syrian Crisis. So Swan talks about the chemical used again by Assad government. However, homie talks a good game about. It's a Israel, US, Russia, Iran, and United Arab grand scheme for more power over the Middle East.

I do agree to appoint that it's a proxy war for other super powered countries. However , its still a civil war. Plus, adding report about X country and or force did what. Without muplite sources to make a strong case. I want more proof and or strong case on 1+1=2 type of talk. 

The Syria crisis along with the Gaza Strip is very heated topic. However,  we have to think a little bit more reasonable. Would Assad use chemical weapons on his own people? Assad father did the same when he was leader of the country. Also, Assad lighted the fuse first with shooting protesters and other horrific acts before the use of chemical weapons. 


Here's the video from Benn Swan.

Back closer to the seder, I was getting ad after ad about how to have a great seder and then, a bunch of other Jewish related business content, in my advertisements. 

Now let me be clear - I don't have a problem with this, but, why does google think I'm jewish? 

I also have had instances lately where it's one NRA ad after the other, and the NRA being the NRA, naturally, each ad is more absurd than the last.

The ads I get are constantly irrelevant to me...but also starting to get extremely odd in what they're showing me. 

Has anyone else been noticing extremely odd advertisements?For example, African Americans did not switch over to voting Trump like 12% of Bernie supporters. To them, any democrat is better than any Republican. It was only the demographic of white Bernie supporters who saw Hillary as "worse than a republican" which she wasn't. To be fair, some of those 12% of Bernie supporters who voted for trump could have been conservative voters who backed Bernie.Don't give me the idea of 'oh well someone has to pay for the fucking roads, schools and military' because that just affirms the person's argumentI've seen him do clips talking about legal prostitution but I haven't seen him do any interviews with sex workers (current or former) about the issue, or maybe an advocate for this issue and I think it could shine a light on this bizarre double standard in our justice system regarding legalizing prostitution. 

With the recent backpage censorship, I think it's about time there was more political advocacy to counter the radical puritans that want to lock women and johns up in a cage for moving up the socio economic latter, and experiencing consenting sex that doesn't harm anyone. Honestly, I'm so sick of the race realists like Stephan Molynuex who tout this book as the basis for their belief about race/IQ, but I also criticize fellow progressives who think this book was only written to stir racial tensions. 

In the Bell Curve, Charles Murray has a chapter about raising IQ, and some painful reality that IQ cannot be raised, at least not significantly. People will then use the whole chapter about race/IQ to obfuscate from their ignorance about the realities of IQ. 

The common points I'll hear to the contrary goes as followed: 
-if you were raised in poverty, and didn't have proper nutrition then your IQ will be lowered 
-if you just attend the right class, your IQ will be raised

However, if you look at holocaust survivors, are you really willing to say that the concentration camps lowered their IQ?! They were in conditions far worse than anyone who's impoverished in America today, sometimes working 18 hours in the cold, and getting not a single piece of bread at the end of the day. 

As for education, lack of education while in these concentration camps did not lead to the lowering of IQ. Look at Elie Wiesel, he was very well spoken about his experience in the holocaust and clearly very intelligent. 
I was thinking recently about how we make the census more useful and I was wondering why do we ask what "race" someone is. Race is nothing more than a manmade construct. Being a different race doesn't change what you need: money, healthcare, education, housing, food, water, electricity, affordable internet/ government run internet, a basic computer to access the internet.

In my opinion race isn't a relevant question to ask. What is relevant is 

1: Annual income

2: A person/ family's housing situatino

3: Their healthcare situation (bankruptcy, healthy, medical conditions)

4: The number of people in the country

5: Gender

6: I don't think we "need" to have religion on the census, religion doesn't/shouldn't play a factor in allocating money but it is interesting to see the rise or fall of religion in the country.

7: The time it takes to commute to one's place of work

8: A person's housing situtaion

9: Sexuality

10: marital status and status of kids

As far as I'm concerned these are the factors, combined with land surveys, should be informing our congressional funding and not questions of race or citizenship. This was a thought on my head, let me know what you think. I love podcasts but I also love to read, sometimes I spend an hour at the book store, not sure what I should get. Rn I'm reading a book about the scientific experiments with LSD, and the documentation of LSD trips before it was illegal, so I've got a great book, but I read like a book a week. I'm gonna pick up narconomics, a book recommended to me to pick up on a phone call, but I'd love to hear a weekly segment about some good book David read. Judicial review, as in the courts being able to declare laws passed by congress unconstitutional and provide a check on congress and the executive branch, that power is not given anywhere in the constitution to the judicial branch. The founders did not believe in judicial review and wanted congress (the people) to be able to override the constitution. I heard Rand Paul say that the constitution gives congress the authority to declare war. Yes, but it gives no enforcement power of that clause to the judiciary. It is congress that is Supreme over the executive branch and since congress passed  AUMF in 2001, wars against terrorism including Assad who is clearly a terrorist, are lawful. The only action that can be taken against the president is impeachment if he goes to war without the congress, a check by the court is unconstitutional by an originalist interpretation. As in the antonin Scalia originalist view of the constitution is complete bullshit. Link for U.N. report is below https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-warcrimes/syrian-government-forces-used-chemical-weapons-more-than-two-dozen-times-u-n-idUSKCN1BH18WRemember now: many of us were mad at Liz Warren for playing the waiting game during the 2016 Primaries! It would be hypocritical if we did not hold Sanders to the same standard. But I have virtually ZERO sports knowledge.

I remember reading or hearing awhile back that nfl teams distributed television revenue across the entire league.  I do not know if some teams got more, but the idea was that it was not every individual team for themselves.  Some markets are of course larger and can support higher earnings for players and other expenses, but the leagues sometimes put caps on people and redistribute funds so that smaller teams are not too unequal.  That happens with the drafts too does it not?  Some lower teams get earlier drafts to redistribute talent.


Or is that not how it works?  My point is, please someone who knows more about sports relate this to effective redistribution making the system working better than it would without such redistribution.Just wanted to run this by some fellow liberals.  There have been variations on some of these pieces going address homelessness, but here is my current idea.



Note, this is focused on the homeless population that is not full on mentally unstable where we probably just need to fund some sort of mandatory institutionalization to get them off the streets.


Assuming we ever get a UBI with 1k+ implemented, on top of universal healthcare.


Build college style residence halls with compact lodging where residence have utilities paid for (electricity, water, internet access), and part of their funds go towards a food kitchen for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I don't know how may colleges have that kind of system with residence halls, but I remember back to my days at ucla in the early 2000s where we lived in places like Sproul Hall or Rieber Hall, or some of the suites, and your housing fees took care of residency/utilities/and food.

The funds to pay for this would be deducted from a UBI for people that choose to live in such a place.  If they chose, the funds would go to the location first, and whatever is left over would go to the recipient until the recipients moved.

I always thought those kinds of college residence arrangements took a lot of the hassle and expense and budgeting out of living where people could focus on other things.  

Once a UBI was implemented and we had places built for people to go to get off the streets, I would advocate for bringing the hammer down on living in the streets of big cities, which is a problem that seems to be getting worse with time.  

My assumption is that MOST people that are homeless would choose to have their own lodging where food was provided and utilities IF they could afford such a thing, so that we could get more people that were homeless to voluntarily leave the streets.  

For the people with mental issues, we just need to build places off the streets to house them.  But living on the streets will not be tolerated any longer within county limits.


What do you all think?  Insane?  Unworkable?  I see some potentially massive problems.

One is the NIMBY problem, I'd imagine many people would not want one of these residence hall style locations to go up near them.  But I do not imagine this kind of living arrangement to ONLY be for the homeless population.  A lot of younger people who want to move away from parents but do not have the funds might love to go live in one of those kinds of residence halls for several years before they move on.

But being in close proximity to a lot of formerly homeless people will probably be unpleasant for many others.  I do not know how to solve that problem, do any of you?I think at first Trump thought the Presidency would be like being a king and that he could use his position to make millions for his empire and whether he knew that violated ethic laws or not, I'm sure he had the assumption that because he was President he could order the justice department to do his bidding and hault any investigation into whatever. And it's still pretty apparent that he just doesn't understand anything about politics at all and I can't imagine he will ever grow into the position. That being said I think any smart person in his position would quit or resign because the longer he remains president the more trouble he gets himself into and also everyone around him. There is no positive thing coming out of his time as our Commander in Chief. So why continue???So, Orban has come under fire from the usual "Never Trump" crowd and shrill leftists. He has been accused of being a dictator, a racist &amp; all the usual epithets. But what gets lost is that Orban has shown a lot of courage &amp; bravery by standing up to Islamic extremism, taking in very few refugees and spelling out the Islamic problem in a way that the new atheist crowd sould find admirable.

Here's a link of Waking UP Podcast guest Douglas Murray's book "The Strange Death of Europe" being endorsed by Viktor Orban.

I am very curious to see what this sub thinks of Viktor Orban. Please share your thoughts below.
Comment below.Its shocking that in Britain's largest city, London, White Britons now only make up 37% of the population. So how much immigration do leftists want? Will progressive hosts like David Pakman ever address the immigration issue in a substantive way?

https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/04/enoch-powell-rivers-of-blood-speech-1968-still-resonates/I have sort of a standard daily news routine, in terms of what I read, and consume, and I also do not have television. When I watch most major networks or also happen to catch commercials - it's sometimes as if I'm watching a parody of life itself. 

I do visit conservative-leaning news sites, 'more center' sites like CNN, and try to look at the news some people are consuming that do not share my views. Unfortunately, this involves forcing myself to watch some of Ben Shapiro's clips and watch Prager U videos. 

I'm often astounded by what I see, and read, and hear. 

I'm curious as to how you avoid an echo chamber?He was arguably our most liberal president. He was inline with Bernie Sanders.
One of the main claims that these liars say is that “Kennedy cut taxes”. This is false. First off, it was Lyndon Johnson who cut taxes, not JFK. So right off the bat they are aligning themselves with the man who signed the welfare state into law, Johnson, arguing that he was a conservative too. Now for the specific tax cut. Kennedy ran on closing loopholes and lowering tax rates simultaneously. The effective corporate tax rate went from 37% in 1963 to 43% in 1964 as a result of the tax changes, which is what JFK referred to them as. When JFK said that “a rising tide lifts all boats” what he meant is that welfare programs and tax cuts for the poor and middle class raise all boats including the rich and that a growing economy through increased aggregate demand would help everyone. JFK also voted while a congressman in the senate consistently to close loopholes which he voted in favor of twice during the Eisenhower administration. JFK said that the point of the tax changes, while debating Nixon, was to increase revenue, the definition of a tax hike, in order to spend more money on domestic programs. 
Other claims like JFK was part of the NRA are bogus. NRA supported gun control when he was a member. They also make claims like “he opposed abortion” which he didn’t, he opposed forced abortion as does every liberal.
Moral of the story: JFK was our first Keynesian president and don’t let right wing think tanks lie to you.No homo if you’re a male.In case you don't get the bonus show: Pat was vacationing in Paris and the pretender was a thief trying to distract him into lowering his guard potentially resulting in his being pick-pocketed. On the plus side its good to hear that both David and Pat had nice vacations. Hard work deserves just rewards.https://www.thedailybeast.com/video-shows-alabama-police-throwing-black-woman-to-ground-in-waffle-house-arrestIf there is anything I learned being an IT support person many moons ago, is that the best IT personnel is in the companies that seem to never need them. And the worst personnel was in the companies that always needed their help and they were busy as hell.

Why? Because if you have a good IT specialist, your systems will just work. And you won't need to see him/her.

However, the chances of getting fired go up, when your boss starts to think that you are a lazy bum and the company doesn't really need you. So it looks like being an expert professional is against your interests, as most of the managerial staff does not posses the insight that will allow them to see your true value.

My point: we should start looking at people in politics who are not on the screen. Quietly doing their job, while others parade through our media like peacocks. Chances are the quiet ones are the ones making the country great. Chances are, they can fix the country. We just have to employ them and let them do their work. We should be those bosses with the insight.

Who's your favorite underdog?A great video on what's wrong with corporate media, what's wrong with specifically CNN, why it won't work in the end, and why Jimmy Dore is a benefit to our discourse. This is why I love Kyle, that passion. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wgvsYPQ_aw&amp;disable_polymer=trueGeorge W. Bush has been the most anti-Saudi president since FDR started our alliance with them. 
FACTS:
1) Saudi Arabia supported Saddam Hussein and opposed intervention in Iraq in 2003
2) Saudi Arabia opposed the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan
Now to Obama
1) Saudi Arabia opposed any intervention in Pakistan. Obama invading Pakistan was justified because they harbored terrorists. This is indisputable.
2) Saudi Arabia opposed the Iran Dealhttps://youtu.be/fG2ffBV4VbEHow do you feel about people who, despite the scientific consensus, hold some skepticism about climate change science? Do you think the fact that 99.9% of scientist in this area say it is happening is enough or should be enough to convince a rational person?The right: Socialism has never worked 
Some on the left: Socialism has never been tried 

Like stfu, Socialism is a broad church which ranges from Social democrats to Marxist-Leninist communists. Also I think many on the right are either ignorant or lying on socialism when they see it as purely Venezuela or the Soviet Union. Obviously the race-IQ stuff outs Harris as at least sympathetic to racism. He has also made absurd points like the ticking time bomb scenario for torture. The list goes on. 
His greatest contribution is his work on secular morality, arguing that once morality is defined as having the goal of well-being that it becomes objective and not subjective. His critiques of Christianity and all religions and pointing out that although there is some overlap that Islam is generally the worst religion in its core beliefs, such as the core rejection of state-religion separation. 
Another critique of Harris is that he downplays historical context to modern day differences between religious groups. I don’t care if someone says I’m taking him out of context, I’m not. [Fraud ](https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/989320787395055624?s=21)Specifically, Cenk Uygur is not actually for single-payer. He supports Medicare Advantage, which is private health insurance plans that are sold inside of Medicare. They cost 15% more for the same coverage as Medicare.
http://www.ncpssm.org/Document/ArticleID/754
More importantly, they undermine the purpose of Medicare, which is to concentrate buying power to negotiate and control prices. Single-payer saves costs mostly by being a monopoly of health insurance, therefore being able to negotiate prices with healthcare providers. Having private insurance plans undermines this and makes Medicare, if it covered everyone, have to compete with Medicare advantage plans by trying to out-bid them to get service. That’s partially how private insurance companies compete. 
Many people that are Bernie supporters and hate most Democrats don’t know this or still want to be able to buy better service than others by out-bidding them and inflating costs for everyone. 
Also know that single-payer is NOT the most cost-effective. Direct socialized medicine is more cost effective, such as in Britain. Single payer has the government own and run all health insurance, with healthcare provided by private actors. Socialized medicine has the government directly own and operate healthcare facilities and directly employ all doctors and nurses. Let’s take single-payer healthcare, here are some of his claims
1. It’s not government’s role
Rebuttal: False. Alexander Hamilton said the purpose of government as said in the constitution is to provide for the general welfare
2. It would enslave my wife who is a doctor
Rebuttal: Nope. Your wife would be privately employed at a private healthcare facility. Independently, the private healthcare facility would be paid by a public Medicare system. No slavery, you fucking idiot.
3. It will cause rationing of care and long wait times
Rebuttal: Absolutely false. America has the longest wait times in the world. When preventative care isn’t free at the time of service, it provides a disincentive for people to get care. This creates a larger pool of sick people, driving up healthcare costs and wait times. A single-payer system expands the pool of people covered, but SHRINKS the pool of sick people and lowers wait times.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/americas-waiting-times-are-the-worst-in-the-world/2011/05/09/AFGIxr2G_blog.html?utm_term=.c7a0b4201c0d
Also, he doesn’t admit that our wait times, even though they are the worst in the world, would be unbearable if it weren’t for public education. Our supply of doctors is created largely through the government, from the G.I. bill, subsidized student loans, TANF aka welfare before 1996 which allowed people to receive welfare while studying to become a doctor, pell grants etc.
4. We have high costs because of government
Rebuttal: Half-true. But unless you’re advocating getting rid of basic things such as medical licenses and allow anyone to be a doctor, then you won’t have a free market. High startup costs for healthcare providers (hospitals etc) and competition in health insurance both drive costs up and exist in the free market as well. Also note that hospitals would largely not exist in rural areas if not for the government.

Taxes
1. We have record high revenues
Our economy is the largest it’s ever been
2. That’s because of our lower taxes rates
Rebuttal: Absolutely false. We have had slower growth since the 80s and with the last two decades having lower and lower taxes and slower growth. Tax cuts for wealthy people have very low force multipliers in the economy and spending on social programs, human capital (education), infrastructure etc. have very high force multipliers. If you cut taxes and cut spending simultaneously, you will necessarily slow growth.
3. Cutting taxes will spur business investment
Rebuttal: Absolutely false. Business investment is tax deductible and still only occurs when there is demand for business investment. Economics for 7,000 years including under Adam Smith has taught a simple demand-side equation where products are invented, sold and created when there is demand. Period.
4. Tax cuts will lower the cost of goods over time
Rebuttal: This is laughable. This is the cornerstone of supply side economics. That if you cut taxes, that supply will increase. It won’t. Supply increases when there is an increase in demand. This is Adam Smith for you. People won’t be hired that aren’t needed, shelves won’t be filled with products that can’t be sold and products won’t be made that can’t be sold. That’s what he means by that prices will lower. He’s saying that tax cuts will create an excess supply of goods that can’t be sold, therefore lowering the price of goods. Ben Shapiro is the biggest idiot and easily defeat-able in a debate.

Transgenderism
1. Its a mental disorder
That’s not the scientific consensus. They are proven to have parts of their brain identical to members of the opposite of their birth sex.
2. Their suicide rates don’t go down after operation
False. Absolutely false. That’s based off of articles in right wing media that cites a Swedish study. In that study it found that people who transitioned in the 80s had equal suicide rates as the surgeries were often failures. It has been found that people who transition today end up with suicide rates EQUAL to the general population.
3. They have suicide rates near Jews during the holocaust
First off, I would not want to commit suicide if I were in the holocaust because I would have hope that I would be able to survive. Transgenderism is something that you hypothetically can’t escape. Having said that, they can now escape it and suicide rates are equal to the general population post-surgery. 

On feminism
1. Gender pay gap is a myth
False. Women earn 94 cents on the dollar for the same exact work and the remaining gap is possibly due to discrimination. The wage gap continues to shrink every year and is lower in other countries which implies it is not biological.
Men are discouraged to be nurses and women are discouraged to be scientists etc.
2. Men receive longer sentences for the same crime 
Exactly! That’s because of people like you, Ben! You view women as inferior to men, therefore less responsible for crimes as men. Feminism will eliminate disparities in sentencing for men.
3. Young women out earn young men
That’s because young women have more education than young men. For the same work and same qualifications, young women earn less than young men. 

You can also bring out that Ben Shapiro admitted when he talked with Sam Harris that he opposes the civil rights act of 1964, claiming that private discrimination was mandated by local governments. Utter nonsense.

Ben Shapiro also opposes democracy in principle. He believes in despotism. Take money in politics, he says you should have the freedom to spend your money how you want to. The problem is that it’s despotic to undermine democracy and have unfair influence, which is scientifically proven to occur from political contributions. The main point to drive in is that he opposes democracy, he hates egalitarianism, etc. There is a sliding scale from democracy to despotism and Ben is a despot. You either want the majority to have power and make decisions or you want the minority to have power and make all of the decisions. Ben wants a small minority to have ultimate power.http://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1190a1TrumpandCharlottesville.pdf
https://www.thenation.com/article/election-2018-is-off-to-the-racists/After the Fox and Friends incident yesterday I think the time has come for Republicans to finally step up and force Trump to resign. There's no point for him to be in the drivers seat anymore. Nothing is getting done, he can't stay focused on the important things like I donno, running the government or our military, and he hasn't shown us that he is capable and also able to learn the job as he goes. I mean what's the point anymore? Why Republicans think that Trump is the best person they can think of to be the leader of their party beats me but still he should realize that his scandals are not going away and it will only get a lot worse. Personally I think he should take his businesses and money and leave the country, him and especially Kushner and Don Jr because the legal trouble that's about to pop into the publics eye is carrying a lot of very serious trouble for the both of them and for Kushner at least, it looks like he could be facing some serious prison time if the Feds have a strong enough case for fraud and money laundering and possible tax crimes. People around the President should tell him that he could go golfing everyday and go back to being the fake godfather of his bogus empire. Will any of this happen??? Will Trump resign or will Republicans consider moving against him?? Haha No and I don't expect it to happen. It's funny whenever someone brings up impeachment or the 25th amendment usually the response is always the same saying things like the democrats are just pissed off and they want to gain control again blah blah blah. But the reason why it's funny to me is that yes, Democrats want Trump gone but who do they think is going to take over when removed from office??? I can tell you one thing it's not Nancy Pelosi(who I think should also resign). It's one of the most hardcore conservatives out the, Mr. Mike Pence.......a Republican not a Democract basically a win win for the GOP......I honestly think if the Republican Party got rid of Trump right now, they would have a better chance of holding onto the House and Senate winning back the confidence of many Republicans voters and possibly even some Democratic ones as well. Anyways what do any of you think???Claim: The U.S. grew fast during the golden era of high taxes, unions and increasing regulation because we were the sole economic superpower and had the rest of the world to sell to.
Rebuttal: Exports only grew at around 2% per year during the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Economic growth resulted from increased aggregate demand inside of the U.S. economy, largely from government programs. Real wages tripled in just 12 years under FDR and the real GDP growth per capita was over 8% a year. The economy grew at over 5% under JFK and Johnson while debt to GDP declined and effective tax rates were raised, largely a result of internal increases in aggregate demand from the new frontier and great society programs.It’s like as if they think most of the black community can’t think for themselves and are stupid to fall for ‘big government’ and social liberalism. In fact, I think Obama ought to be stripped of his and Trump deserves one (if either must be awarded one)I thought Jacobin liked Bernie Sanders? Why would they try to hurt his case and his cause like this? Talk about not knowing your audience.Clearly, Kim Jong Un isn't impressed with Trump, so what is he really after?

It's obvious that NK will not denuclearize, so what's the deal?Marx wrote an essay called "On the Jewish Question" which contains the following:

&gt;What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money.…. Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist. Money degrades all the gods of man – and turns them into commodities…. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange….The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant, of the man of money in general.

In his article, “The Russian Loan,” published in the New-York Daily Tribune on January 4, 1856, Marx wrote:

&gt;Thus we find every tyrant backed by a Jew, as is every pope by a Jesuit. In truth, the cravings of oppressors would be hopeless, and the practicability of war out of the question, if there were not an army of Jesuits to smother thought and a handful of Jews to ransack pockets.

&gt;… the real work is done by the Jews, and can only be done by them, as they monopolize the machinery of the loanmongering mysteries by concentrating their energies upon the barter trade in securities… Here and there and everywhere that a little capital courts investment, there is ever one of these little Jews ready to make a little suggestion or place a little bit of a loan. The smartest highwayman in the Abruzzi is not better posted up about the locale of the hard cash in a traveler’s valise or pocket than those Jews about any loose capital in the hands of a trader… The language spoken smells strongly of Babel, and the perfume which otherwise pervades the place is by no means of a choice kind.

&gt;… Thus do these loans, which are a curse to the people, a ruin to the holders, and a danger to the governments, become a blessing to the houses of the children of Judah. This Jew organization of loan-mongers is as dangerous to the people as the aristocratic organization of landowners… The fortunes amassed by these loan-mongers are immense, but the wrongs and sufferings thus entailed on the people and the encouragement thus afforded to their oppressors still remain to be told.

&gt;… The fact that 1855 years ago Christ drove the Jewish moneychangers out of the temple, and that the moneychangers of our age enlisted on the side of tyranny happen again chiefly to be Jews, is perhaps no more than a historical coincidence. The loan-mongering Jews of Europe do only on a larger and more obnoxious scale what many others do on one smaller and less significant. But it is only because the Jews are so strong that it is timely and expedient to expose and stigmatize their organization.

Cue the angry leftists with their apologia.I’m glad I live in Britain with a now progressive Labour Party under Corbyn. [For The Many, Not The Few ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XGL9segt8Fs)This is highly misleading.
First off, it’s $31,099 which includes children and young adults as well as the elderly who have supplemental income from social security.
Second off, that number is actually really good. It’s one of the highest in the world.
For median household income, we rank 7th.
http://news.gallup.com/poll/166211/worldwide-median-household-income-000.aspx
Our median household income of over $59,000 compares to the global median of just over $9,000. Let that sink in.
Here’s the key: we actually have the second wealthiest middle class in the world, second only to the country of Luxembourg.
http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/05/through-an-american-lens-western-europes-middle-classes-appear-smaller/North Korea has promised to close its nuclear test site next month and invite foreign inspectors to verify the closure, South Korean officials said on Sunday, as the two sides sought to build on the momentum of their historic summit.

Seriously, Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. Looking at the problems the US has it does make me feel small, insignificant, and unlikely to make any real change. While I'm keeping my fingers crossed for movements like Justice Democrats I'm not optimistic that all the problems the US has can be solved in a reasonable amount of time. One solution is to throw our hands in the air and give up. Not just give up solving our problems, give up on this failed experiment we call 2 year congressional terms, gerrymandering, and over 150 years of a rotten foundation we call the United States. 

However there may be hope. If the US were to negotiate a deal with Canada where we give them control of the land and all the assets, Canadians will allow Americans to be automatically enrolled in Canadian wellfare programs and Canadian law takes effect immediately. Looking at Canada's government, and looking at the ever increasing list of issues we won't be able to solve I would go for this. 

Edit: This was a shit post I came up with while talking with some friends at a party. Was curious how the community would reactThese pieces of subhuman shit brought us Trump, and now they think they have the right to be offended? We all need to start talking like Michelle Wolf, she is a hero of mine now. These assholes brought us Trump who made fun of the disabled and veterans and is one of the most racist, deplorable human beings I have ever seen. Reading David's YouTube comments, I see he has a lot of Sedar fans, and I'm so sick of Sedar's hate band wagon against Harris and Peterson made of lies, obvious misrepresentations, and double standards. 

Sedar has been at it since the 2014 bill maher fiasco with Sam Harris and Ben Affleck, and has turned into Reza Azlen. 

Now, Sam Sedar critizes Peterson for using sophistry to explain psychology, but what does Sedar do to discuss race/IQ? Sophistry, straw men arguments, and ad hominems! 

Look, I don't care if you have a different opinion than me with the race/IQ shenanigan of a debate. I've talked with several *liberal* psychologists about this in my home town, and they said there is some truth to Murray's claim. There are radical racial differences in IQ, how they got that way is where the debate really is, but Sedar seems to be stuck on "hate Sam Harris" mode, cause it's not a debate about these differences. The debate is how IQ distribution got that way and if there is anyway of fixing it. 


The view of the American Psychological Association:


"In response to the controversy surrounding The Bell Curve, the American Psychological Association's Board of Scientific Affairs established a task force to write a consensus statement on the state of intelligence research which could be used by all sides as a basis for discussion. The full text of the report is available at a third-party website. 

The findings of the task force state that IQ scores do have high predictive validity for individual (but not necessarily population) differences in school achievement. They confirm the predictive validity of IQ for adult occupational status, even when variables such as education and family background have been statistically controlled. They agree that individual (again, not necessarily population) differences in intelligence are substantially influenced by genetics. 

They state there is little evidence to show that childhood diet influences intelligence except in cases of severe malnutrition. They agree that there are no significant differences between the average IQ scores of males and females. The task force agrees that large differences do exist between the average IQ scores of blacks and whites, and that these differences cannot be attributed to biases in test construction. While they admit there is no empirical evidence supporting it, the APA task force suggests that explanations based on social status and cultural differences may be possible. Regarding genetic causes, they noted that there is not much direct evidence on this point, but what little there is fails to support the genetic hypothesis. 

The APA journal that published the statement, American Psychologist, subsequently published eleven critical responses in January 1997, most arguing that the report failed to examine adequately the evidence for partly-genetic explanations. 

The report was published in 1995 and thus does not include a decade of recent research." 

https://www.iq-tests.eu/iq-test-The-view-of-the-American-Psychological-Association-1120.html

However, I should note, the psychologist I talked with did say this shouldn't be discussed outside of an academic setting, so perhaps we are all at fault for bringing it up to begin with. 

Saying that, I bet I'm gonna get called stupid, ignorant, etc, just for holding an opinion that goes against the equality of outcome way. 

I've been unsubscribed to Sedar's show for quite a while now, but the more Pakman brings Sedar up on his show, the more I consider dropping my membership, and using that money towards a Sam Harris Patreon donation. 5$ isn't much to Pakman, but I'm pretty sick of Sedar, and if that means cutting out the David Pakman Show so I don't get a Sedar headache. I've been a regular listener for a while, and I'm sick of Sedar. 

Idc if you don't like Harris, or Peterson, whatever. Just don't spread Blantantly false lies, or misleading quotes out of context about them to smear them. 

Don't even get me talking shit about his co host. I watched Michael talk for about 10 15minute clips, and if he's just gonna villianize people for listening to Harris's podcast, why bother?!Jordan gets cornered on his anti-intellectual beliefs.
He first claims that hallucinogens prove the supernatural dimension and that you can’t quit smoking without a supernatural experience.
He then spends an hour denying that secular morality can exist and sneers at the concept of skepticism. He gets enraged when explained secular morality based on objective standards at achieving well-being.
He ends it off by claiming that Soviet Russia was secular humanist! Enjoy!

This video made by David Rubin who gives off the same talking points like Progressive folks are really regressive left and they don't support free speech and blah blah blah. Remember those same talking points from Larry Epder and Mike Rowe. 

Don't get me wrong. Regressive Left is annoying group. However, most of Congress is conservatives who wrote back a lot of helpful social programs. 

In Rubin video of bullspit. Rubin Miss directly on why the Little Sister for the Poor program was in a legal battle with the government. To make a long story short. The nonprofit organization need it to file some important paperwork. 

Again, I find this video very funny because. Rubin is giving the nut jobs of the world a platform to speak there conspiracy theories about x y and z. 


Rubin silly video
https://youtu.be/hiVQ8vrGA_8If I heard it correctly, David said that Circuit City showed him a video saying that unions are bad. This is very curious. Can I watch it somewhere or at least hear more about it?As of recently, there hasn't been much talk about Organized Labor, which is a shame considering it could seriously benefit so many people's lives, reducing unemployment, giving employment to the homeless, and disabled, making the hiring process easier for employers, making it harder for employers to discriminate, and solving workplace issues that would otherwise go unresolved. So I'm writing a book rn about how I believe Organized Labor should be structured, as this is just as complicated as healthcare. I'm calling this essay the Trevor Hinck vision for Organized Labor, as I don't know anyone with this same exact idea. Instead of filling out hundreds of applications to no avail, all you would need to do is fill out one application at the labor Agency. Save the working class some time and grief if they don't get the job.

I am not too focused on Salary wage workers and internships in this essay, as it is even more complicated and perhaps worse for salary workers, interns but hourly workers and employers could seriously benefit from this program.

How will it work?

It will create the unemployment offices into a sort of Temp Agency. You go in, and after telling them what kind of work experience you're looking, things that might affect job performance (drug abuse, disability, etc.) they fit you with a job that is the closest fit at the end of the day. Even if you are a raging drug addict, we will still be able to provide you work, under the condition that you attend weekly drug counseling meetings if you fail a drug test. (Cannabis will not be tested for unless you operate heavy machinery, or perform a task that is a safety risk like surgery, not that surgeons will be hired through this agency, but you get my point). No one shouldn't be able to work, if they have a drug addiction. I will get into the nuances of this problem later in this essay as finding work for drug addicts is complicated. With single payer, instituting an organized labor system would be 1000x more efficient/effective.
Such industries you might work for in this program include but not limited to :
-retail/customer service 
-restaurants jobs
-agricultural 
-entry level construction, warehouse jobs
-food production 
-entry level office jobs, assistance and other people to organize office work for students studying law, health, accounting, and loads of other studies that could work as useful work experience when trying to apply for a law firm, journalism, healthcare accountant etc
-delivery services
-lawn/property maintenance 
-entry level electronic/automotive production jobs
-recycling jobs
-cleaning services 
-translators
- entry level healthcare assistants for college students studying medicine, healthcare, etc
-house keeping

The list is practically endless!

How will this Organized Labor Agency work for employers?
Let's say you own a small restaurant and you are trying to find employees. You call up the Labor Agency, they find employees looking for food handling experience, and you pay the government in advance for the workers wages, which in return, the government will give the employees their wages at the end of one or two weeks. You can find employment almost instantly through this labor agency. 

Schedule issues are a big problem with people, especially college students and single or low income parents. They can't always make it to work on time, and by having an agency, they will figure out how to distribute labor. 

Let's say you work at McDonald's and can't make it in for work for whatever reason. You call your Agency, and they schedule a person with the skills and knowledge about how to work at McDonalds as a replacement from your town. My home town of Beaverton, Oregon has like 25 McDonald's. Chances are that the people that want to work Saturday's aren't able to because of scheduling conflicts whereas there is a person across town that cant make it but is forced to work anyways or lose their jobs, making them cancel their plans just to work at McDonald's on Saturday to filling those hours that the other workers need. 

How will drug testing/hiring drug addicts work under the Organized Labor program?

There will be three categories of labor
-type 1: no liability or no risk of physical danger such as packaging, or stamping jobs. This is where drug addicts can work while they are continuing to receive help for their mental health and addiction problems. Once a drug addict proves they have been able to keep their soberiety for a certain amount of time, they will be qualified to find a better job from the labor agency. 
-type 2: some liability risk, little to no physical danger risk jobs. This might include a cashier job, for example as it is not dangerous operating a cash register but is a liability if the employee can't count the cash properly or steals because of drug addiction.
-type 3: great liability and physical danger risk, employees must be in a strict working condition. These are the jobs that under no circumstances, an employee should be working at if they come to work under the influence. This includes operating heavy machinery or preforming dangerous tasks like welding. 

You can qualify for any of the three types of jobs if you don't use drugs during work, no criminal record and don't have any drugs in your system during a drug test. THC will be regulated differently and I will get to that in a minute. 

If you are drug tested, and any of the following drugs are found in your system:
Coke, Herion, Meth, Alcohol, Xanax, (basically drugs with a high potential for abuse), then you can only qualify for type 1 jobs. If you can't come to your interview/drug test, without getting fucked up, something has got to change. 

How I would regulate THC testing:
If you have THC in your system during a drug test, you qualify for type 1, and type 2 jobs. I've worked stoned when I was working at a warehouse, it was never a problem and plenty of others came stoned, and are very productive. I even gotten an award for my productivity from my boss! Having THC in your system and getting qualified for a type 3 job will work like this:
-you get a recreational/medical workers permit, that once granted you must take a drug test everyday before and after work at your own expense. This test will be fairly cheap, because a lot of people will need to take this test if they want to smoke weed/have a good paying job and will determine wether or not your THC levels rise during work. This could also create jobs for healthcare professionals because the demand for professionals to review these tests will be very high. It doesn't take long to figure out wether or not THC levels have risen, and would discourage people from using other drugs. If your THC level is raised during a work shift, (unless you can prove that someone blew smoke in your face or someone gave you an edible to get you in trouble). you are immediately fired, are transferred to a type 1 or type 2 job and do not qualify for a type 3 job for another year because your worker permit has been revoked. If you fear someone may have given you an edible without telling you it has THC, you can still keep your job, but you can't work any longer that day, and have to report that incident to a supervisor or manager. 

Let's say you have a disability, for example, like you are deaf. The Labor Organization will find you a job that your safety isn't a liability because of your disability. It's hard for many with disabilities to find employment because their disabilities make it hard to preform the necessary tasks of work. 
Recently it's been stated that ABC got a detail wrong about yesterday's Trump/Flynn report. I'm confused about what they got wrong, can anyone set me straight?I think you already talked about this. However, I would like small reminder. Also, since the downfall of Time Warner. Should we be worried about AT&amp;T taking over WB entertainment side?What do you guys make of the possible move of the embassy to Jerusalem?? Is it something that can even happen or just a 4-D chess move to divert from the investigation.The clip of the encounter is on Thursday's show. Both representatives are married straight men. The attendees of the meeting erupted in laughter as did I. The Representative has of course refused to resign.So glad I can laugh having long recovered from the delusional state of ludicrousness which so many embrace.https://twitter.com/HawaiiDelilah/status/940705530040942592


There is more, but I thought I'd just leave that gem so your heads would not explode.

It does make you wonder though.

If you had a child that got in an accident, and there were only two surgeons that could treat the child for open heart surgery, Ted Crockett or Jesse Lee Peterson...  Who would you choose?

Would you just say eff it and perform some kind of voodoo enchant as it might have even more chance of success than relying on those people who be competent and knowledgeable in their fields?The coffee cups might be crap and wasteful its true, but the machine can be used as Pat uses it with the reusable cup. BlueFire coffee roaster's coffee available from the show doesn't care what mechanism brews it. Its not such a bad little brewer. All it needs is a little love. Please someone come up with a way to win or somehow acquire this machine. Save its life!In Alabama, initially I thought that Roy Moore would win, turning the party into the party of indecency. However, the black voters made the odds towards Jones, who prosecuted KKK members who killed 4 black girls in a church bombing.

We see this similar trend earlier this year. Democrats made sweeps in local elections. The Netherlands and France rejected their far-right candidates. The Labour Party in the UK gained seats from the Conservative Party, causing a hung parliament. Germany kept Mercel, but Alternative for Germany gained seats in the parliament. Japan's left-wing Constitutional Democrat Party gained seats from its right-wing counterparts. This means a new trend is replacing the old, dark trend before the 2016 election.

The GOP is a party of crony capitalism. People are rising up against the establishment party. I prefer Justice Democrats and Berniecrats. Trump is backing candidates that lost elections. We can expect this same trend in 2018 where many GOP members lost hold of the congress.

Many political commenters said that the GOP must die. This is the first step.Disclaimer: This is a satire, so don't get offended. If you don't think it is funny, whatever, click off, leave a dislike, idgaf, I'm just trying to pass time before work and maybe make a couple people laugh. This is a joke, and is meant for comedic purposes only. I like to push the envelope with the most bizarre rant I could think of. And here is what I could come up with. With that said, enjoy!

TRUMP IS COLLUDING WITH SANTA CLAUSE TO PROMOTE THE ANTI CHRISTMAS AGENDA!!!! Trump throughout his presidential campaign promoted reviving the dying coal industry, but why?!
ITS BECAUSE TRUMP AND SANTA ARE PLANNING ON GIVING EVERYONE COAL SO HE CAN OUTSOURCE OUR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS TO PUTIN!!! 

The rate of trade of coal from West Virginia to the North Pole has gone up exponentially. The Trump administration has removed tariffs to the North Pole, making coal more affordable for Santa. They are planning on giving the toys that would otherwise go to us, and outsourcing our presents to those that voted for Trump, and Putin!  Santa has enough coal to give every American coal and more! 

Despite popular opinion, Santa is the most evil man on earth.
-he only pays his slave elves candy canes, so they all suffer from diabetes as a result
-his elves have no access to healthcare, so they die off young
-he abuses his reindeer. If You saw me flying through the sky whipping some reindeer, yelling "FASTER, FASTER!" you would want to put me in prison, but when a fat old white guy does it, it's okay?!?!
-he invades our homes without a warrant or probable cause which is UNCONSTITUTIONAL!
-he doesn't clean up after his reindeer. Every Christmas, I have to climb on my Icey roof, and clean the lump of ReinDeer shit off of my roof!
-he steals my milk and cookies that I was saving for Christmas morning! 

If you see Santa Clause in your home on Christmas, grab the shotgun, and call the police. It's about time someone threw Santa in prison for his crimes against humanity! 

I ask because I noticed a notification in reddit that linked to a past post from awhile back.  I went and reread the thread and looked at what I wrote earlier and came away thinking... my GOD, that guy (myself) is so on point with damn near everything he writes and says.  It was like a warm blanket of clear thinking and confirmation and SENSE in a sea of wrongness and blockheaded perspectives.  Now if you all read what I wrote you would completely disagree and think I was an insane troll at least half the time, but that is beside the point.


And then I wondered, is that what identical twins experience more than anyone else because they have someone else that thinks more like themselves than almost any other?The question is for everybody, not just David and Pat :)

I loved these:

* Karl Popper, The Open Society and Its Enemies
* Leopold Kohr, The Breakdown of Nations

What else would you suggest? Everything goes: conservative, progressive, moderate, ancient, modern, etc.For background, I'm a relatively new to the Liberal camp. Looking into what would make America better IMO involves some combo of campaign finance reform, helping Americans earn $50,000-$200,000, make sure people have a reliable source of food and a reliable shelter. Focusing on the housing aspect, logistically how do you put a roof over everyone's head? Do we create massive apartment complexes or giant "suburbias". Or is there a solution I'm not aware of. I'm curious how people think we should fix the homelessness issue. Unintentionally or perhaps not Trump could be inspiring Americans to work harder to improve the economy and could be confusing our enemies to the point they actually fear our power. Its like the movie 'Being There' where the practically brain dead protagonist somehow manages to wield great influence over others in powerful government positions. The difference being that that was comedic fiction whereas Trump is tragic reality. I'm not saying America isn't already great. That's part of Trump's agenda trying to fix things that aren't broken. At least not as badly as he claims.I ask because I know most people on the left are near eternally against optional wars, or wars where we are not directly attacked.  And I certainly do not think it would be justified if S. Korea was against it because they would bear the brunt of the fallout.  But if they got fed up and wanted it all to end, even with the spectre of some nuclear attacks, would it be worth getting involved more than we already are and helping?


One of the arguments I never bought into from the left during the Iraq war was that it was not justified to invade another country that did not directly threaten you, no matter what they happened to be doing.  So no scale of barbarism or human evil would be enough to intervene.

This stance seems to me to essentially negate the concept of human rights, is that something we want to jettison as liberals?  If North Korea is basically a decades long concentration camp of physically stunted and worm infested people, is it really none of our business as fellow human beings how such people are treated?  I get how the paleocons and non interventionists of the past don't want to get involved, because at their core they are linked with a sort of libertarian attitude of ME and MINE and genuinely give zero fucks about people that are not them.  

How do you square having some concern for the fates of all human beings with a strict policy of non intervention, of having the power to remove a dictator and choosing not to?

Is it wrong on principle to intervene, or just because of practical matters?  I get and understand the practical objections, but the principled ones?  Someone please explain this to me.

Dick Cheyney is a neocon, but you know who else is, Daenerys Targaryen.  And I distincly remember getting the sense from the left during the height of the Iraq war that the only possible motivation for a neocon attitude was the Cheyney motivation of pure presumed malice and greed.  Is that really all there is?  And does it even matter?  Dany took her dragons in a foreign land, looked around at cultures that held up slavery, and said FUCK your culture, it ends, and she used force and war to impose her will.  And most people cheered her on.  Just because it was a show?

I wonder.  Ok, now set me straight.Still doin that ish. http://thegatewaypundit.com/2017/12/justice-democrats-calls-cenk-uygurs-resignation-quickly-deletes-statement/

If you haven't heard, Cenk Uygur has resigned from Justice Democrats over an ancient blog post. Yea, what he said was fairly stupid, but it's not like he's been accused of sexual assault/harassment. His comments were not pro-rape, yes it was sexist, but pro rape?! BULL FUCKING SHIT! In my opinion, this scandal is blown way out of proportion. 

Before I go on, here are the comments Cenk is in hot water for, that I found on another Reddit post :

"I live in Miami now. There are an incredible amount of outrageously hot women here. In fact, there are more beautiful women here than any other city I have ever seen.

The only problem is that after seeing these girls every day and not being able to have sex with them, after awhile, you begin to lose your mind.

Don't get me wrong, I hook up a decent amount (defined as: at least make out with a new girl every six to eight weeks and have sex with a steady girl at least once a week), but it seems like there is a sea of tits here, and I am drinking in tiny droplets. I want to dive into the whole god damn ocean.

Obviously, the genes of women are flawed. They are poorly designed creatures who do not want to have sex nearly as often as needed for the human race to get along peaceably and fruitfully."

Is this really a reason for him to resign?! This comment was made *DECADES* ago, when he was still a republican. He has obviously underwent a fair amount of change since then. I call, fucking bullshit. A heaping pile of bull fucking shit. There are women being raped as we speak, and 'justice' democrats wanna focus on some crude comment made by Cenk years ago?! WHAT THE SERIOUS FUCK JUSTICE DEMOCRATS! I really wanted to support Justice Democrats financially, but if they are gonna dig up the most irrelevant dirt on their members, and create a bunch of unnecessary drama, they obviously aren't worthy of my hard earned money. More cash for David's PatreonIf you don't know what BackPage is, it is a Craigslist type site, that is most well known for having forums that you find strippers for parties and such. Before net neutrality was repealed, sex workers could post a bio in their ads, and a description in for their ads. Now, it's only photos and a phone number. You're not suppose to text any of these women, unless specified because it can get them in serious legal/safety trouble. The women would have ways of screening law enforcement but now without descriptions, they can't do that so easily.

It's about damn time we legalize sex work, instead of letting Ajit Pai interfere with the plans of consenting adults! There's a special place in hell for Ajit! Lately, the GOP wants to fire investigator Robert Muller. However, I doubt that will happen.

Robert Muller was appointed to investigate the scandalous, illegal deeds of Trump. He is doing a good job and is quite competent. Last May, we see Trump firing FBI director James Comey for knowing too much, which made Muller stronger. Currently, Muller is investigating on the Trump family. The evidence is very damning.

The GOP insiders want to fire Muller because he knows too much. However, he will not be taken down, as what he is doing is the right thing to save democracy. The GOP is incompetent, let alone firing Muller. Two days ago, a group of psychics and I see that the insiders will accuse Muller of wrongdoing, but Muller will stay around, as the accusations are false.

The GOP wants to fire Muller is that they want to save their asses. However, that will unlikely going to happen. When Muller raps up the investigation, the GOP insiders, representatives, and senators will be arrested and thrown to jail. They will end up in jail, as 2018 the Dems will definitely regain the congress, eventually leading to the impeachment of Trump, rise of progressives, and the gradual end of the GOP.https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5626816

How can we get a ballot initiative in the state of Florida? Out of all the states in the south, Florida is perhaps the most progressive, meaning with some organization and grass roots movement, we can legalize in Florida!We all get gifts we have no desire to keep during the holidays.

We are all PakPals. 

Kingsday is on January 6th, but we could celebrate it after, and re-wrap gifts you either already have, don't want, or simply don't need or choose to use to participate in the gift exchange...and  turn these otherwise worthless gifts into something that can bring joy to our fellow redditors / discord friends with a white-elephant / kingsday gift exchange.

Some basic rules:

1. Nothing illegal or broken.
2. Strict $10-15 limit on 'subjective value of the gift', with an absolute maximum of $20. - This is kind of a hard grey area because, if someone gave me a book signed by Julia child, or whatever her name is, the book would be useless to me because I don't cook, so, i guess use your best judgement. 

3. Please avoid gift cards because the person you're sending it to may not have that retailer / shoppe in their locale, or, may not have the ability to go to that locale.

4. International PakPals are welcome.

5. No Howsci. (Can he be trusted???)

If you are interested in the gift exchange and we get more than 6-7 people, I'll randomize the names and then PM you or DM you your white-elephant secret santa and kindly ship your gift off by January 6th or so. 

Again, no Howsci.

Generally I'm in favor of gun control
-background checks
-making sure people with violent convictions don't get a hold of guns
-banning the use of high capacity magazines 
-mandating bullet buttons for civilian semi automatic rifles

But the two main aspects I have against gun control, other than waiting periods, are banning and confiscating semi auto rifles. The vast majority of gun crime is committed from pistols, not semi auto rifles. Yes, they can do quite a bit of damage, and very impractical for self defense with the exception of rural areas, however my objections against banning semi auto rifles, as someone who is a liberal are as followed:

-black market argument, which everyone who is anti gun seems to think is a nonsense argument. If banning drugs doesn't work, why would banning semi automatics work, when gangs are already able to illegally obtain fully automatics as we speak?
-there is an estimated 2.5 million AR15's in this country, meaning if you try to take away these weapons, there is going to be serious backlash. Last thing we need are rabbid NRA militia members shooting cops that are trying to confiscate their weapons.

'Nuff said.
If this isn't deplorable, idk what is! 
I need to quit because of the medical problems it's giving me, but it's not like I can afford the only thing that helped me quit before, nicotine gum! I was able to successfully quit for a year and a half, but after I got cheated on, I relapsed and haven't been able to stop smoking. 

Fuck you Philip Morris!!!. So much of my can deposit money down the drain for this terrible habit. So many cans I picked out the trash just for something that's killing me. Too many times I missed school cause I didn't have enough money for gas to get to school cause I spent my last dollar on cigarettes. I hate cigarettes so fucking much, but I can't quit. I smoke a pack a day, sometimes more, this is a terrible habit. Whatever you do DONT START SMOKING NO MATTER HOW DEPRESSED YOU ARE CAUSE IT WILL MAKE YOU MORE MISERABLE AND DEPRESSED! While we have slyly kept it under the radar of sensible media, the likes of Fox News, Infowars, Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones have been onto us for decades, as we quietly try to take the Christ out of Christmas. 

And it's true, we've been trying - and under Obama, a president of questionable birthright, as we all now-- we were making some progress. Starbucks had that cup, or whatever. EPA sanctions were placed on the plastics of unknown chemical origin that allow the inflatable santas to withstand Bayonne, NJ winters and vandalism. 
We all saw what happened when Mariah Carey tried to sing 'all I want for Christmas' at the lighting of the Rockafeller tree in recent memory. 


The European court of justice was looking into alleged labour practices at the North Pole. 

This year, we have failed.

The election of Trump the white-house has set our war on Christmas back invariably, but we will go on. 

We will never give in. Perhaps it's just me, but I've noticed David looked really tired, almost with a sort of deadpan (no disrespect or insult meant) expression in some cases expression. His eyes seemed a bit droopy and the sparkle -- even when the eggman called in--was not the same. 

Does anybody else notice this? Is it the patreon / youtube stuff wearing him down?

Is pat's radiance simply making David look more tired by contrast?I was looking in the mailbox and looks like a special election is coming up in the next month, here in Oregon. The only thing it looks like we are going to be voting on is Measure 101. Here is the summary given by the voters' pamphlet, just in case you live out of the state of Oregon, or you live in Oregon and didn't receive a pamphlet: 

"This Measure asks voters to approve or reject temporary assessments created as part of house bill 2391, enacted by the 2017 Oregon legislature to address certain healthcare funding issues. The House Bill provided funding to pay costs for providing healthcare to low income adults, children, families, and individuals with disabilities, and to stabilize premiums charged by insurance companies for health insurance purchased by individuals and families. The House Bill provided funding through 1.5 percent assessments on premiums and premium equivalents (defined in the House Bill) of health insurance companies, the Public Employees' Benefit Board, and managed care organizations for a two year period, and additional 0.7 percent assessments on the net revenue of some hospitals that begins on 10/6/2017, and ends on July 1st, 2019. This measure asks voters to approve or reject the assessments on insurance companies, the Public Employees' Benefit Board, and managed care organizations, and specifies that insurance companies may not increase premium rates by more than 1.5 percent as a result of these assessments. If this measure passes, the assessments on some hospitals will be approved, subject to approval by a federal agency. If the measure does not pass, the assessments on some hospitals will either be rejected or delayed until approved by a federal agency." 

Results of "Yes" vote: 

" 'Yes' vote approves temporary assess Mentz on insurance companies some hospitals, the Public Employees' Benefit Board, and managed care organizations. assessments provide funding for healthcare for low-income individuals, families and individuals with disabilities; also stabilize premiums charged by insurance companies for health insurance purchased by individuals and families. Insurance companies may not increase rates on health insurance premiums five more than 1.5 percent as a result of the assessments. Hospital assessments may not begin without approval by a federal agency." 

Results of "No" vote: 

" 'No' "Rejects temporary assessments on insurance companies, the Public Employees' Benefits Board, and managed care organizations; and either rejects or delays temporary assessments on some hospitals. Assessments rejected (or delayed) by a "no" vote are currently budgeted to find healthcare for low income individuals, families, and individuals with disabilities and for stabilizing the cost of insurance premiums. As a result of a "no" vote would underfund these budgeted costs."

Thanks, tr3v0rr96I’ve been a member, superchat supporter, PakPal, advocate for Pakman’s show in real life, and so on for over a year now. 

In this time frame, David has said over and over again that he would play his practice (drum) pad and some rudiments. And then there’s always some sort of caveat that comes along with it, or something like “maybe, I don’t know, we’ll see”

Others have noticed this also. 

As a person who taught middle school percussion and drum line, I want to see Pakman play his pad because I think it’d be cool to see him drum.

But lately I’m wondering if he’s ever going to play his practice pad. 

I feel we as PakPals are at least entitled to an honest answer. 

If you’re not going to play on your practice pad, it’s cool - but it would be nice if you just told the fans that you’re not going to play it. 

I have been looking forward to seeing you drum for about a year as I said. And then, I get my 💔 heart broken again and again. 

Before I start the post. I want to make one thing clear. I'm not saying opioid addiction isn't a big issue or the people who suffer from this criss. I live in Ohio where the crisis is very bad at. I'm not comparing someone suffering to another. 

All I'm saying is that this. When crack cocaine was introduce in the urban areas (Black and Latino) communities. The media called it crime wave crisis and or minority problem.

The sad fact was that our poor training and or critical thinking on the War on Drugs. I know 80s and 90s era is vastly different of today's effort to combat drugs. 

However, the mainstream media is talking about Opioid criss compare to Crack epidemic is hypocritical at best. Why don't they treat Opioid criss like the Crack epidemic?

I'm not going to make this post all about race. However, the media is known to do something like that. I won't take the bait. There's to many factors involved here. Furthermore those same factors that caused Crack epidemic is almost identical to the opioid crisis

The factors in my personal opinion is the government agencies work with and or turning a blind eye to drug trafficking dealers. The media isn't asking the hard questions to the lawmakers nor questions America's War on Drugs. Finally, the broken families who demand action but nobody is really listening to them.


Maybe I'm wrong about this. I could be  tripping over the issue. What's your overall thought about this?




Big shout out to David Pakman aka PacMan
We've been watching the videos and you been keeping us in the Loop of things going on. You don't focus on the silly things likd SJW bs. Your a really progress. Thank you for your service homie. 


First of all it's galling that Trump is publicly saying the FBI has "free rein" to do a "comprehensive" probe, while WH sources(?) are leaking that the FBI is under a narrow directive to interview only 4 people (Kavanaugh, Judge, Ramirez and Keyser), not follow up with any other people already named or described, any other people that may come up as potential new leads, and that they're not even supposed to investigate Judge's possible supermarket employment history to check that part of Blasey's testimony.

If that's true, it's a glaringly obvious agenda to NOT get any new information or corroboration against Kavanaugh.  For one thing, we already know all 4 of those people's assertions and by themselves they are dead ends.  Keyser can't change not-remembering the party, and Ramirez' story is totally separate from Blasey's, has no named witnesses and describes an isolated incident that many find easy to dismiss because it's nowhere near as harrowing as Blasey's.  Kavanaugh and Judge obviously have strong motives to lie; if they did assault women as described, why confess to it, or to any circumstantial evidence of it?

--Here's ONE thing that could motivate either of them to admit to something (anything) they hadn't before: fear of lying about something the FBI may have already corroborated or could corroborate afterward.  But think about that.  Presuming they are following the news and have the same information we have, then THEY KNOW the FBI hasn't interviewed Judge's ex-girlfriend (whose public admission actually corroborates Swetnick, and don't get me started on why the FBI won't interview HER), classmates who could talk about the drinking, the meaning of 'devil's triangle' and 'Renata Alumnius,' etc.!!!  

Trump has a long history of appearing to 'leak' things himself when it benefits him.  If whoever leaked that single tax return that just happened to make him look good licked the envelope, it's probably his DNA.  And he (or one of his devote operatives) would have every reason to leak the extremely limited scope of the FBI probe, to assure liars they can keep on lying.  look in the vid about trump saying him and kim jong un fell in love, the comments are filled with totes progressive homophobia. using bottom as an insult, saying that dumb shit about how there's a woman in gay relationships, calling him a bitch(apparently we gay men bottoms are bitches according to the totes gay friendly progressive straights).
fuck this shit, get tae fuck, stop using gayness as a means of attack against people you hate you fucking douchebagsWhy is nobody pointing out this putrid bit of hypocrisy: Trump tweeted that if Blasey's assault really happened, she and/or her "loving parents" would have reported it to the police, and he demanded that report, knowing damn well it doesn't exist.  Well, Julie Swetnick says she and her mom DID report her assault to the police, but never mind because the Montgomery police say it could take a while to dig up from the archives.  Also, I guess never mind that her accusation is of actual GANG RAPE.  And never mind Mark Judge's girlfriend saying he had confessed to her a story of gang raping a girl.﻿

Why aren't news outlets giving due attention to these HUGE concerns?  Why aren't they interviewing (on camera) someone from the Montgomery police explaining the process of looking up old records?  Why isn't Avanatti demanding that the Senate wait for the report?  And oh by the way, what about all those texts allegedly sent from Kavanaugh and 'his guys' to rally a unified denial of Ramirez' allegation before he supposedly knew about it?  Are we ever going to see those?  Why isn't the press even talking about them after brief mention two days ago?

Why are they focusing so much MORE on Kavanaugh's drinking history?  And why the fuck am I hearing Trum's putrid voice, seeing his putrid face, making his putrid mockery of Blasey-Ford, OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER.  In other words, why is the media appearing SO disinterested in seeking truth, preferring instead to dwell on truths we already know??  
--OMG, they are playing the Trump rally footage on CNN right now, for the billionth time since yesterday, and it literally says 'BREAKING NEWS' on the screen.  Yes, this is a huge ass essay; you don't have to say it and you don't have to read it.

 It's been over two weeks since I first publicly made the prediction that Flake would be a 'no' for Kavanaugh.  I could (then and now) even picture him submitting his 'no' via thumb, in tribute to his late fellow statesman, John McCain.  Everywhere I've posted my prediction I've been met with almost 100% doubt, if not ridicule, had my persuasions called 'fan fiction' and 'fantasy.'   While I'll admit the 'thumbs-down' image does cross into fantasy territory, I won't apologize for having it, and I will now try to assert why the basic expectation of a non-confirmation from Flake is absolutely realistic, thumbs or no.  It is the expectation I stand by, not based on Polyanna wishful thinking or belief in inherent goodness, but on a year of closely watching this man.

Flake has no conceivable reason to want Kavanaugh appointed, and ample reason to deny him the seat.  What you have to weigh is his not running for reelection, his despising Trump, and his support of the Mueller probe.  You also have to understand that you're watching the beginning of a 2-year campaign of Flake as the Anti-Trump Conservative candidate for 2020. To better illustrate how/why these concepts matter, let's look at the reasons people typically give for why they think Flake will vote 'yes' on Kavanaugh.

ANYONE ON THE LEFT WHO PUTS THEIR TRUST IN FLAKE IS NAIVE.  HE IS A DIEHARD CONSERVATIVE.  JUST LOOK AT HIS VOTING RECORD. --I have no delusions about this.  Flake IS a conservative, and yes his record does align almost lockstep with his fellow Republicans.  He's anti-choice, has an 'A' rating from the NRA, he voted for the tax cuts, and voted 'yes' for all three of Trump's Obamacare repeal proposals (yes, including the one McCain gave the infamous thumbs-down for).  In fact, check it out, he's not only conservative, he's more conservative than 96% of all GOP senators:
 https://voteview.com/person/20100/jeff-flake.  

So why would he risk pissing off his fellow Senators and conservative voters?  --He's only got a few more months in Senate, and isn't asking for another term after that.  What he WILL ask for (votes for President), he has two years to make his case for, and voting 'no' on Kavanaugh will be his first more-than-words exhibit for that case. 

WHY WOULDN'T HE CONFIRM A CONSERVATIVE NOMINEE BASED PURELY ON CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES?  --He will.  Just not this one. The list of potential nominees submitted to Trump by the Federalist Society is nothing but extremely conservative-leaning judges.  What makes Kavanaugh unique is what makes Trump want him SO bad; the things he has said showing a willingness to help Trump escape justice to whatever extent possible.  I'm not a lawyer so I don't know how realistic that hope is for Trump, but it's the closest thing to hope Trump can see in that list of names.  I mean, what other human being has expressed sympathy for frikkin NIXON?  And even if Flake doesn't believe Kavanaugh (and 4 other Justices) will save Trump if it becomes a Supreme Court case, he knows Trump believes it.  And he HATES Trump.  He has repeatedly called out Trump's words and behaviors (such as calling the Helskinki summit "an Orwellian moment"), and recognized the overall crassness of Trump as destructive to our culture and democracy.  Lest we forget, he first made this case one year ago: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flSbXhD0cCk

HE DOESN'T SINCERELY CARE ABOUT VICTIMS OF ASSAULT --Maybe he does and maybe he doesn't.  But you can't argue with this: Him being the initial voice demanding to hear Blasey-Ford's testimony, and then demanding an FBI investigation may not prove that he DOES sincerely care, but it certainly disputes the claim that he doesn't.  I have yet to see any such nay-sayers offer any reason whatsoever WHY he would delay the Committee vote on behalf of alleged victims' claims, TWICE, mind you. 

Now, I'll still say 'maybe he doesn't sincerely care' because maybe he's just using the accusations as an excuse to delay (maybe stop) Kavanaugh's confirmation, as the Democrats are accused of (with some measure of justification).  I myself will go so far as to say Kavanaugh must be stopped and so I am both proud of AND GRATEFUL to the women who've come forward with their stories.  --It's a shame that neither Kavanaugh's other terrible qualities, nor the Judiciary Committee's other shameful proceedings weren't enough to put the brakes on this vote, but I guess if the bar is so low only a rapist can't become a Justice, so be it.  Thanks again, courageous women.

And what about the women at the elevator? --Well if you think I don't have enough healthy cynicism about Flake, how about this?  --I don't think they changed his mind.  I think when he announced just minutes before that he intended to vote 'yes' on moving Kavanaugh from Committee to the floor, he already intended to give that vote with the caveat of an FBI investigation (which is exactly what he did).  I think he planned it BECAUSE it would be dramatic, a shock after his previous statement, a mini version of the McCain tribute we still could see, in the full Senate vote.  I've seen at least one accusation by a far-right commenter that the elevator scene was purposely staged by Flake, in cahoots with CNN and two women actors.  Now that's just silly, but you can't help but wonder if Flake could have taken a 'safer' route to the chamber, one without protesters and cameras and elevators and feet that can jam elevators.  Is it just me or does the anguish on his face belie the hint of a smile here and there?  He definitely gave brief little grins while he literally thanked the women, repeatedly, and then he said, "I need to go to the hearing.  I issued a statement.  I'll be saying more as well." --By 'more' he meant the FBI investigation caveat; he just couldn't reveal it yet. 
 https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/09/28/jeff-flake-kavanaugh-confronted-by-protesters-elevator-nr-vpx.cnn

HE'S JUST PLAYING POLITICS  --Well YES, he IS.  But what politics?  The politics of toying with America, only to confirm a Justice the People have come to disapprove of more than ever, BECAUSE OF the microscope he twice demanded we use?  That makes no sense! 

 I won't deny that Flake's tactics are part of a con, but it's a long con.  He wants Trump 1. enraged, 2. disgraced, 3. (if possible) impeached,  and if not possible, at least greatly devalued as a 2020 Presidential candidate.  It’s hard to guess whether he will run as an Independent, or actually try to primary an incumbent President (which has never succeeded).  Whatever the case, the Mueller probe must hobble Trump’s electability to the extent possible, which could be counter-hobbled by an obstacle like Kavanaugh.  Flake will eliminate that obstacle if he can (even if Kavanaugh gets 50 votes, Flake will be applauded for not being one of them).  And from there, he will use the same powerful tool as Trump: the media.  But he will wield it with its' cooperation as opposed to its' captive disgust, as Trump does.  
Look at him already schmoozing to the Press, defending them against Trump, all the way back in January of this year:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La9JtENXVqI

HE WILL USE THE SKIMPY FBI REPORT AS JUSTIFICATION FOR CONFIRMING KAVANAUGH  --Well, first I would reiterate the question as to why he would call for the investigation in the first place, when he could have just voted a plain 'yes' last Friday, or even further back if he hadn’t called for the testimony hearing.  But I'll go further and say that he knew when he asked for the investigation it would be a farce, likely predicted the chokehold Trump would put on it, likely predicted that whatever new witnesses the FBI was directed to ignore would reach the media instead (and make the chokehold all the more outrageous), likely knew there’d be no FBI interview of Blasey-Ford, Kavanaugh, Swetnick, or any of the many potential corroborators.  And in fact HE WILL CITE ALL THIS when he casts his 'no.'  
In fact he has already cited it:  “How did we arrive at a moment of such peril – wherein a president of the United States …… seems to think that the office confers on him the ability to decide who and what gets investigated, and who and what does not?” 
He asked that back in May of 2018, before a Harvard graduating class, in what might be his most scathing critique of Trump, to date.  (Seriously, listen to at least the first few minutes, not only to the criticisms he makes of Trump, but the eloquently PRESIDENTIAL ways he makes them—he stumbles on words here and there, but that’s what practice is for!). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S8hZ76QSxc


YOU SOUND LIKE PEOPLE DID ON NOVEMBER 7, 2016.  –Baseless and flippant as it sounds, this is actually the argument that rings truest to me, and fills me with anticipatory mild PTSD.  I HAD no reason to believe that Trump would win, just as I HAVE no reason to believe that Flake will vote to confirm Kavanaugh.  If he does, go ahead and shower me with ridicule because I’ll be too filled with so much disgust, bewilderment, grief, and fear, to leave room for a drop of embarrassment.  

But while we still have these last few days of suspense, I say why NOT have hope?  Seriously, why?  Right now only Jeff Flake knows whether he’ll vote to reject Kavanaugh, and probably knows whether Collins and Murkowski will do the same (I sure hope so), but I believe he would be willing to be the solitary GOP 'no' if he has to.  Hell, anyone with eyes can see that Kavanaugh's confirmation would not stop the evidence coming out.  What about when the Montgomery police locate the report filed by Swetnick and her mother?  What about when we actually see the texts Kavanaugh's 'guys' made to rally denial of the Ramirez story before Kavanaugh supposedly knew about it?  How about when Blasey-Ford gives a tearful one-on-one interview (with Oprah) about how she came forward and endured the exact nightmare she feared….for nothing?  Every Senator who votes 'yes' can see all this coming; all they can do is hope for the least amount of damaging information yet to go public, and weigh how harshly their constituents will judge them for it.  

Flake need not make such calculations.  Like McCain, who knew he was dying, Flake can afford to be a maverick.   I would assert that he can’t afford NOT to.  Considering how repugnant Trump's words about McCain have been, why WOULDN'T his fellow Arizonan honor him by sticking his thumb in Trump's eye?  Can you even imagine the reaction every pundit on every news outlet would have to an actual 'thumbs down' from Flake?  Especially now that McCain has passed.  Especially after all this tension has built up around Kavanaugh.  Especially after the whole thing has become a battle of the sexes AND the parties.  I can imagine it.  And surely Flake can imagine it.  Quite possibly he has since the day Trump announced Kavanaugh as his nominee.    

The STOP Act, is a bipartisan bill that will allow the U.S. Postal service to scan foreign merchandise for fentanyl, as well as other contraband. I never had a problem with the Patriot Act in theory and only would want it to be looked at to make sure it is being used optimally for fighting all domestic terrorism. The idea of the left hating it because it is “big government” is just silly, we of all people know that the government is the people and the people are the government. This bill is most likely a direct violation of the 4th amendment which outlaws warrantless searches from the government. I really don’t care as this is going to save tens of thousands of lives. The role of we the people, the government, is to provide for the general welfare. That is my honest opinion. Agree or disagree.

[What the STOP Act is](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/us/politics/opioids-fentanyl-postal-service-senate.html)

[STOP Act passes the Senate now, ready for the President to sign it into law!](https://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/10/portman-klobuchar-stop-act-passes-senate-now-ready-for-the-president-s-signature)Roche also talking about Ford's  (whom he also knew at the time) personality as an honest, reliable person. Congressional Democrats just announced their belief that contrary to Trump's claims, the White House directives to the F.B.I. severely restricted the scope of the investigation. No surprise here. What was the name of that game where you get to play as an epidemiologist or something? It's an advertisement but I can't remember the name of the game or the company, I know it was about vaccination. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to play this game. Glad to not waste any minutes having to read such a text although David is saying that the messages would be illegal if they indeed come from Trump.Listen to his thoughts in [this](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/02/entertainment/kanye-west-13th-amendment-clarification/index.html) TMZ clip. Most, if not all, of the ideas he spells out in this clip are, for the most part, politically left-wing ideas. Inter-generational wealth inequality, prison reform, penal labour (UK spelling), class consciousness. Why then is he supporting Trump, the current head of the GOP, the party that is opposed to measures aimed at ameliorating the problems brought about by inter-generational wealth, prison reform, and measures to address issues vis-a-vis penal labour? How can a person be *this* confused? Does he think Trump and/or the GOP are pushing for prison reform? His confusion saddens me. It saddens me further still that no one has told him "Hey, Ye, the party standing in the way of all of those things is Donald Trump's party!" - not even his wife!

Edit: Also, the fact that Trump and Trumpists will continue stanning for Ye despite the latter's patently left-wing preachings is revealing. Policy means very little to these people - Trump and Trumpists. Trump himself was a supporter of the Democratic Party for many years. As for Trumpists, as long as it "triggers the libs", they are happy with it. Watching her speak I found nearly every justification example she gave for supporting him easily explained away as her failure to grasp the details. Shame on her incompetence. She seems well informed but not the brightest bulb when it comes to seeing into the dark corners no matter how many women she has listened to. And for someone who claims she was focused on Kavanugh himself and his record she surely seemed to blame 'the process' for this decision being so difficult.I have been disheartened at the events of the last two weeks. I worry for the future not just as progressives, but for this country. But if we encounter those who may say or think we are but theorists, now is the time to show them, through our force, the world in which we exist is not a theoretical issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this orchestration by Conservatives was meant to dissuade our conviction to force upon us a sheltering of ideas and courage, let us be clear: This has not, will not, and did not work. 

**We will never give in.** 

There are fundamental flaws of those who propagate these ideas, but there should be no reason to abandon the need for our fight against the future, for our time is now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Those who fail to realize this will be sorely mistaken, as our sorrow become to seeds to grow, our anger, to action, and our visceral conviction to votes  

&amp;#x200B;

We've come a long way - but we have much further and much farther to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Our Time, is Now.**

&amp;#x200B;When people say "don't meet that leader", some people hear that as "don't negotiate with that leader", when what is usually meant is "negotiate without meeting".

Some people see difference between phone call, video call or letter as opposed to physical meeting, as semantic or inconsequential, when others see that as substantive and important.

When communicating with text, 5 people can consider every word and comma. Then 2 or more translators can consider how to translate that. Then send the text in both languages. Use both miles and kilometers, and both place names and grid coordinates to reduce risk of confusion.

Cuban missile crisis was negotiated without meeting.

If there is meeting, different question on how high level. Should it be some career diplomats, presidents or something in between, needs to be decided case by case.[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election.html)

A right wing candidate almost won outright and the election is going to a runoff, but it seems like he is poised to win.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know much about Brazilian politics, so the standard US conceptions of left and right may not apply neatly, but does anyone have any insight into this?

&amp;#x200B;

I know David stays up to date on Argentinian politics but not sure about the rest of latin america.I was listening to friend of the show Steven "Destiny" Bonnell's most recent debate with a Republican voter. One of the issues of contention was the performance of the stock market. The Republican cited the performance of the stock market as an evidence of Trump performing well on the economy. The Republican of course failed - time and time again - to point to a *specific* policy of Trump's that might have had this effect of the stock market. Thus, he mistook correlation for causation, as many who give Trump credit for the performance of the economy often do. They tend to do the same vis-a-vis record employment rates among Black Americans - i.e., they give Trump credit for that, without pointing to specific policy of his that might be a cause of that outcome.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this got me thinking: How does the stock market benefit ordinary people? Very often members of the political class will tout the performance of the stock market either as a sign that things are good or things are bad. **But only about 10% of the richest earners own shares in the stock market**. So, how does the performance of the stock market affect you and me - the average person who does not own shares? Have you ever thought about that? Well, I did and began doing so digging.

&amp;#x200B;

From my very brief (15 min) research, here's what I found:

&amp;#x200B;

**Pension**

Even if you don't own shares or bonds directly, there is a good chance you own them as part of your pension.   Many private pension funds invest in the stock market.  This means the value of your retirement income is directly dependent on the value of the shares owned by your pension fund. Therefore, the value of your retirement income depends on the stock market.  A substantial and prolonged fall in the stock market could lead to a fall in the value of your pension fund's shares, and it could lead to lower pension payouts when you retire. Similarly, if the stock market does well, the value of pension fund's shares could increase.  **However, unless you are not retiring in the very near future, the performance of the stock market probably will not affect you, even if it does affect your pension fund's shares.**

&amp;#x200B;

That's pretty much it. I think.

&amp;#x200B;

Love to know your thoughts.On the bonus show, David mentioned his Lyft driver in Las Vegas had a gun, and that he tweeted about it and was afraid of what might happen if he reports the driver, as he seemed agressive and (possibly) unhinged. 

I think David should tell Lyft what ride it was and contact the support team. It's against company policy, and unsafe. David's inaction could potentially mean another Lyft customer could be in a situation involving a gun that they would otherwise not be in. Racism is not just only about hating or wishing bad on a person just because of their race, it also counts if you view someone differently to others just because of their race. That’s why there’s a term called racial prejudice. A tiny piece of nerdy trivia about the Israeli shekel: its standard three-letter currency code according to ISO 4217 is ILS.

On Hatriot Mail on October 10 David called it "NIS". This abbreviation is indeed quite common for "New Israeli Shekel", but it's not the standard.

Nerdy, I warned you :)I subscribe to the view that identity Politics is a mode of political organisation around the belief that some social groups are oppressed. Identity political formations typically aim to secure the political freedom of a specific constituency they consider to be marginalised within its larger context. So, for example, BLM engages in identity politics because it believes Black Americans (the specific constituency) are oppressed and tries to secure the political freedom of Black Americans within America as whole, but specifically within American institutions (its larger context). In the same vein, the Women's March also engages in identity politics because it believes that women are oppressed. American Evangelicals engage in identity politics because they believe American Christians are oppressed. Martin Luther King Jr and many of the Civil Rights Activists engaged in identity politics because they believed Black Americans were oppressed.

Identity Politics as a mode of organisation is intimately connected to the idea that one's identity *as* *Black person*, *as a woman*, *as a White man, as a man, as a Native American, as a Muslim, as a Jew, as a Christian, as a bisexual individual, as a working class White man or woman, as a working class person period*, for example, makes one peculiarly vulnerable to stereotyping, erasure, violence, exploitation, marginalisation, or powerlessness.

Do you agree with this definition of Identity Politics? Let me know your thoughts in the thread. Ciao!This is little different than stop and frisk policies which Trump just advocated for use in Chicago.Waiting for Trump to decry this victory for sanity.Good or bad? Personally, I think it's bad. I abhor nationalism of any kind. Moreover, I was always under the impression that universalism and internationalism were essential traits of the political left. So Kyle's "protecting American jobs" philosophy always jars with me. I don't believe there is such a thing as "American jobs" or "British jobs" et cetera. Your nationality should not entitle you to a job anymore than the colour of your skin or your sex. But hey, that's just me.

Penny for your thoughts?All of Trump's 'friends' are 'good guys' who would have not part in something so heinous, right?So, David opposes open borders because it's just not practical. Do you know what was also impractical at one point in time? The following:

* Abolishing slavery
* Giving Black people the vote
* Integrating the army
* Legalising homosexuality
* Giving women the vote
* Giving non-property white men the vote
* Gay marriage

I could go on. The point I am trying to make is that the "It's just not practical" argument is a dangerous one because it can mean we allow injustice to be perpetuated for a long time, as all of the above injustices, especially slavery were. It is well known that many of the US Founding Fathers, and the most prominent and influential among them, opposed slavery morally, philosophically and in principle. Yet, they allowed it to continue because "it wasn't practical" to abolish it. 

If I may bring this argument to an issue some of you might better empathise with, take free college tuitions. How would you feel if I said I was for free college in principle, I just don't think it's practical? (*Cue the reeeeing*)As we come closer to the mid term elections I have been thinking about what changes should we make to the US election system. As I was thinking I wondered, why do we need state governments? IMO state governments, in their current forms, are not tax payer efficient and give rise to inconsistency among the nation. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to redesign the US election system I would do so in the following manner

&amp;#x200B;

1: Redraw state lines to make sure no state is larger than the current state of Vermont.

&amp;#x200B;

2: Institute a nationwide housing policy, then draw small voting district lines.

&amp;#x200B;

3: Institute rules of proportional representation for party representation within a voting district.

&amp;#x200B;

4: Define the power, limitations, leadership structure, and time limit of a political party. Political parties will not be able to cross state lines.

&amp;#x200B;

5: Abolish the Presidency, the Senate, and the House of Representatives to replace them with a Parliamentary based house of politicians who serve 4 year terms, capping at 20 years. The House of Politicians need a simple majority coalition to form a government.

&amp;#x200B;

6: Make it so the legislative session ends 3 months before an election, and 2 months after the election. Make it so politicians can't abuse the timing before they are kicked out of office to pass bad legislation, while giving the public a minimum amount of time to learn of last minute legislation being passed.

&amp;#x200B;

7: Allow the House of Politicians to make appointments on the Committee of Governors: a large body of individuals who run the day to day operations of the country (police, infrastructure, regulations,). I envision them as a combination of local governments and federal regulators offices combined for efficiency. I propose appointing a committee of governors in order to keep Americans vote focused on a few people arguing over big picture ideas and not worry as much on small day to day issues. The committee of governors will act as the implementation tool of the House of Politicians. 

&amp;#x200B;

8: the US government will institute automatic voter registration, mandated voting.

&amp;#x200B;

Those Points Expanded

&amp;#x200B;

1: Redraw state lines to make sure no state is larger than the current state of Vermont.

This is a response to the power of big political parties. By redrawing the size of state boundaries we make it easier for upstart political parties to cover more ground by reducing how much land they have to cover. Smaller states= smaller amounts of marketing needed to get a message = better chance of upstarts taking seats from established parts. 

&amp;#x200B;

2: Institute a nationwide housing policy, then draw small voting district lines.

We need a nationwide housing policy, and with this policy will come an increase in voter turnout assuming the houses come built with areas for lots of people to be able to vote easily. The districts would be drawn in a way to keep communities of similar thought together, and even within those communities representation is based on proportion instead of a winner take all system. Not every district will be equal, certain areas will have more people than others, but there is no perfect solution to the representation issue.

&amp;#x200B;

3: Institute rules of proportional representation for party representation within a voting district.

The formula for representation will work like this: Percent of representation per district= number of people who voted in a district/ total number of votes. Percent of political party= Number of votes received for the party/ number of votes received for all political parties. Citizens can only vote for parties in their state.

&amp;#x200B;

4: Define the power, limitations, leadership structure, and time limit of a political party. Political parties will not be able to cross state lines.

&amp;#x200B;

I would define a political party as a group of like minded people in one particular state. Political parties can be started by a minimum number of people, small enough to acquire 1% of the representatives in a district. The founding members of the party choose who they want to bring into the party, think of this as a senior partner vs junior partner relationship. The founding members of the party do not have to take up the responsibility of a Politician should their party win. The party's founding leadership then drafts a minimum platform, expressing their desires for policy ideals. If any member of the party is uncooperative to the policies during their term the leadership can vote to expel and replace this person. A political party is only active for 20 years. Every party can register their name, three letter abbreviation, nick name, slogan, mascot, etc. These can not be used by another party for 100 years. Before an election the party leadership must hold a conference with the entire party. Voting rights are reserved to people who are on the list to potentially become politicians. These members rank themselves in a "batting order" of who gets to go and who doesn't get to go to DC depending on the outcome of the election. If a member of the original leadership retires or dies, the members of the party (all individuals currently at DC and the members who didn't get to go to DC due to election results) vote on who should replace the leadership position. This person can be an active politician or an outsider. Political parties will release to the public a list of all individuals they intend to send to Washington DC, a batting order, and a list of all individuals they intend to appoint to the House of Governors. Party leadership will vote and decide on their Debater in Chief, the person who will represent the party in debates. This helps every party put on their best face and have members, while maybe not good as public speaking, are smart in other ways and helping them get through the process. Political parties must keep a transcript of all party communications available to freedom of information of requests. All communications must be catalogued and the government keep an open copy. The party's leadership votes on a minimum of 10 individuals to act as a backup of the party's batting order. Should the Us government experience a disaster and lose a large majority of the House of Politicians, ala Designated Survivor, the backup copies act as a form of pre determined backup government waiting to be installed.

&amp;#x200B;

5:  Abolish the Presidency, the Senate, and the House of Representatives to replace them with a Parlimentary based house of politicians who serve 4 year terms, capping at 20 years. The House of Politicians need a simple majority coalition to form a government.

&amp;#x200B;

The House of Politicians will be a modified version of the current House of Representatives. While I don't have an exact idea of how many politicians should be in this body I have two proposals: first is that the body is forever made up of 1001 people. Second, we determine how many politicians should represent a certain number of people. To form a government a simple majority of politicians must agree on a government platform including:

&amp;#x200B;

The Politician in Chief: The person who runs the day to day operations of the government, ala speaker of the house or a prime minister.

&amp;#x200B;

The Commander in Chief: The person who has control of the military and national guard. This person would not need the approval of the house before declaring war or troop movements.

&amp;#x200B;

The secretary of state: the public figurehead who communicates the governments actions with the people and other governments, ala the current secretary of state. 

&amp;#x200B;

Attorney General

&amp;#x200B;

A comprehensive list of Committee of Governors: A combination of what's left of the current presidential cabinet, all federal regulator responsibilities, and all the current day to day responsibilities of the current state governments. I envision them a combination of managers, engineers, doctors, law enforcement, and people who are competent at vital professions. As long as an action can fall within the constitution then the committee of governors can enforce it. The governors are accountable to the politicians, can be fired or arrested. 

&amp;#x200B;

The House of Politicians can pass laws with a simple majority, they appoint judges (16 year term limits) with a 55 percent majority. Amendments to the constitution and appointing justices to the supreme court will require a 60% majority.

&amp;#x200B;

The supreme court will operate how the Federal reserve does right now: there will be a rotating bench of judges who are term locked. Anyone in the House of Politicians can nominate someone for the role of judge. After the house comes to a simple majority conclusion they want someone to be a supreme court justice, the house must wait two months before they can vote on their nominee. This is to let the public understand who it is that is being nominated. 

&amp;#x200B;

6: I think this point is self explanatory.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a long read, but this is as comprehensive as I could make at the moment. I'm curious what people think. Let me know in the comment section. 

&amp;#x200B;The only scandal that you could argue against from a true feminist ideology would be Paula Jones. You can say that you believe Paula Jones, but there is and never has been sufficient evidence for a prosecution and to believe there is evidence of the assault to the level needed for a criminal trial is wrong and against feminist ideological commitment to equality. If you look at the case rationally, you will see that Paula Jones changed her story multiple times when her stories became more implausible and that she had a personal vendetta against Bill Clinton for not pardoning someone close to her on death row. There is no evidence outside of her testimony and she is a proven liar on this very subject. It also does not match Bill Clinton’s reported sexual behavior, as his lovers have said that he is an intimate lover, NOT an aggressor. I think you are wrong to believe (proven liar) Paula Jones, but I will not say that you are not a feminist if you do so.

HOWEVER, the rest of Bill Clinton’s sex “scandals” are all consensual sexual affairs and only a problem in the eyes of the old right-wing sex police (right-wing Muslims and Christians mostly) and now in the eyes of a loud minority of feminists who think that women are victims if they (as a full grown adult) have consensual sex. As if I would be a victim of “abuse” if Sofia Vergara were to be president, if I then became a White House intern, and then I consented to Sofia using my face as a self-groomer, cleaner and sex toy. Some people may respond to this by saying “you’re a male, you’re thinking with your dick” which is just bullshit, women can “think with their clit” and can be equally as sexual as men. It is due to social constructs that women suppress their sexuality that leads to men being perceived as more sexual than women. 

It’s belittling and demeaning to women, this type of feminist thinking, that groups in consensual sex with abuse. We should be celebrating women who have consensual sex and celebrating women’s sexuality as one of the most important aspects of feminism. The fact that there is no female equivalent of Viagra today is an OUTRAGE to me as a feminist. As is the fact that some women have never had an orgasm! I truly and seriously support taxpayer funded vibrators for all women, as a human right.

Anyway, both of these rationales for criticizing Bill’s affairs I strongly oppose. Although I think the right-wing sex police comes out of malice intent entirely and wanting to impose their “righteous morality” on everyone else. The point is that if you think that women are “victims” for choosing to have consensual sex as an adult, as if they are mentally similar to a child and cannot consent, then you are NO feminist. You actually think of women similar to right-wing misogynists who see women as inferior to men, and therefore they need extra protection from society. It’s complete nonsense.When will journalists ask Trump the simple question when he gives the 'other countries also do such and such': "does that make it right?". I guess that David's assessment Monday of how Trump twists questions and diverts from direct answers would make this futile even if they did ask.[https://politicon.com/session/charlie-kirk-vs-hasan-piker-2/](https://politicon.com/session/charlie-kirk-vs-hasan-piker-2/)

&amp;#x200B;

They already debated, and frankly Hasan is not the best at these.  I think that was part of the point of the agreement to talk again, it's like when fox news brought on representatives from the left that were more inept and tripping over their words.  They deliberately wanted to showcase a weaker form of an opposing argument to prop up their own.  

&amp;#x200B;

Pakman or Kyle would have been a much better interlocutor, but I think these right wingers are running scared and are deliberately trying to take spotlights AWAY from the left that is clearly not part of their caricature.There are so many promises the guy has promised and if the democrats pointed that out, they would win support from some disaffected or non-cultist trump supporters. 

Not cut Medicare, Medicaid and social security- cuts it 

Reimplement glass steagall- teared down parts of dodd-frank 

Promise to universal healthcare coverage- cuts coverage through repealing the individual mandate and trying to get rid of obamcare 

End outsourcing and NAFTA- Outsourced more jobs than Obama and renegotiated NAFTA 2.0 (USMCA) 

Anti-interventionism- hasn’t pulled out of one country and has bombed Assad twice 

End ties with Saudi Arabia- Maintained then and opened up businesses in SA

Edit: Also he campaigned on a new infrastructure plan which he drum roll please.... hasn’t done at least the bill he introduced was to privatise most of it Just giving arguments for and against this gives insight about homelessness.

Have a strange looking concrete structure, piece of architecture, that is made of only one material: reinforced concrete.

It is meant to protect from rain and direct sunlight and slow down wind. How much it slows down wind depends on how much there are walls or if the roof is held by columns.

Ceiling could be 4 to 6 meters high to make it cooler during hot weather and also to make using fires more feasible during cold weather.

If there comes a time without homeless people in that city, that uncategorized strange piece of architecture is usable like a park or forest. It is ugly but not too ugly, especially with white paint or artistic paint. 

Roof might be covered with solar panels.
I've been using MeWe for two days now. I personally like it. It reminds me of Reddit. No BS tactics like we see Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc. 

I'm not saying this website will change anybody's point of view of social media, but just throwing out the option of something else new.

Also, this idea of cutting out the BS with social media sites isn't a new idea. 

PS: Yes I misspelled the website name. Feel free to laugh at me. 

BBC interview with MeWe creator 
https://youtu.be/mQqitqZGpEA

https://mewe.com/mobileHave you noticed economic indicative changes, positive or negative in your community? I'm very curious about some geographic and individual  anecdotal perspectives. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Personally - I've noticed more small businesses that have closed. More of my students are having financial hardship that's visible, even among two parent households. I know an increase in homelessness when I see it, as well.  

This may be a weird indicator and unreliable, but I had an economics professor that once told me something interesting: the size of the oil and fluid deposits in  you see in parking lot spaces tells you sometimes something economists may not: In terms of whether people are driving aging cars longer, and whether they are able to get repairs done for leaking fluids, that's a subtle indicator.

&amp;#x200B;

It could just be me: I'm noticing those stains in parking lots getting larger, particularly on the college campus at which I teach. David sometimes says that some fans don't like Benjamin Dixon. Why? He's different, but great.

And on October 18 he was better than I ever remember him.

Thanks for having good stand-in hosts!

(Oh by the way, I remember that in the past he used to mention his Christianity more prominently. It's good to mention it and show that there are many different Christians.)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKDdBYVb\_BI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKDdBYVb_BI)

&amp;#x200B;

Check out the livestream comments whilst you're at it.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it just me or did David equivocate on the transgender question put to him by Peterson? So, the question was something along the lines of "If you knew a woman (personally) and she transitioned, could you begin to regard her a man, bearing in mind that you previously knew her as a woman?" It feels to me like he equivocated on this question. To be clear, I'm not mad or disappointed about it. It's just an observation. Please don't bite my head off.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously though, check out those livestream comments. The comments are so rabidly anti-semitic, anti-intellectual, anti-trans - to name a few. I almost think they are being made by leftwing trolls trying to make Jesse's fanbase seem worse than they are. It was from season 3 episode 1, "No Más", time 27:58, ex drug users around fire.

One says:  "...you're not good enough.
Not good enough for what? Not good enough to be what, President of the United States? Well, okay, so maybe you're not that good..." ( copy pasted that from a script found from a web page )

Now, anyone make a guess how many ex drug addicts would make a better president than the current one?

That part of the episode should be a video clip on youtube.I truly enjoy the holiday season, as a trumpet player and musician.

Anybody wanna go in together on getting some gifts?Both my top 2 fav Progressive YouTubers but I have to say I prefer Kulinski because Pakman seems a bit too careerist driven on making his show look appealing and always begging for members whereas Kulinski barely mentions he’s Patreon If the Nazis were socialist because they described themselves as such, then North Korea is a democratic republic. 

There! That is called an absurd counter-example and it is all you need to attack the "Nazis were socialist because "National Socialist Workers Party"" meme. 

I'm surprised more people don't use this counter-example.As we approach the midterms I was talking to a friend about voting plans. I already voted via absentee ballot, but my friend described how he plans to vote in person. He described how his voting center is borrowing a Baptist Church. My first thought when hearing this is that by tying together the act of voting in a religious location isn't that act biasing the voter to vote in a pro religious way? While Baptists may not have as much influence as Christianity or Evangelicals, I find the idea of voting in a Church odd. I don't know the logistics, and I suppose a building to vote in with four walls and a roof is better than nothing, but I wonder if we should be letting people vote in places with religious connections?I know Youtube has gotten stricter on content but what about comments, specifically cursing?  Does Youtube have any kind of bot detection of curse words and if so does it hide your comment or anything?  

Follow up question (because I haven't been on Reddit very long) --Does anyone know of a good sub for questions like this?  I subbed to the one called 'Youtubers' but it has the most ridiculous formatting requirements for submitting even basic questions, and it is also geared more for uploaders, not viewers. --Please don't troll me if you think I'm a tech idiot.  1.

Any David Pakman-related space is official sanctuary (in case you didn't know). see title.He then does the wrong thing though second guessing himself. Instead of calling the police he calls MAINTENANCE!!!  The cops are not shooting drug users at first sight in the U.S.. Not yet anyway. The user was apparently incapacitated in a laundry room. All Pat ultimately achieved was to get this guy out of his way fearing he might ruin the guy's life if he called police. Seems to me Pat just didn't want to "get involved" when sometimes one should do so, like it or not. Did it not occur to him that he might have saved the guy's life by doing so? Both David and Pat seemed o.k. with the outcome of this situation. Anyone else besides me disagree?https://youtu.be/9_vpC9yFMVEI saw segment producer Noah Ferguson credited along with Sweet Vegan Prince Producer Pat, but noticed Producer Max is not on the show's end credits. Is he not working for TDPS anymore? :( I can only support so many people monetarily. So whom between these three should I support? I currently support only David. But the whole paying tribute to White nationalist JF Garierpy has left a very bad taste in my mouth. Plus, David has sponsors. I think Destiny also has sponsors (and does not have a Patreon). I'm thinking about redirecting the money I give to the show to Cody Johnson instead. He does not appear to have any sponsors and he's still much smaller and either David or Destiny.

What do you think?This is the face, literally and maybe physically of many those who still support Trump and the current Republicans. Miserable, ignorant, homophobic, racist, would be megalomaniacs whose lives are so sad we should pity them. We can do that but must also not tolerate their tactics of fear. My neighborhood is full of them judging by the number of political signs in yards supporting  Republican candidates for the mid-terms. Since I can't move, I must somehow tolerate this environment. So thankful for Pakman, fellow supporters, and this Reddit forum.In this thread, we parody hatriot mail, and give being a patriotic american a try by seeing who can best each other posing as a hatriot typing a poorly composed, incoherent, and anti semitic, racist, homophobic, islamophobic, transphobic letters to Pakman.

Go back to comunnnnnniiitttyyyy college and learn how to get a rea l job. MAGA!His response to the encounter with the drug user is also mitigated by the fact that he was apparently experiencing cold symptoms. No one wants to deal with such a situation when they themselves are not up to par. Minimizing irrational behavior is more reasonable and a more practical goal than eliminating it completely although that would be nice. The mayor still spoke well considering the stressful situation. He clearly opposed Trump and others who advocate the militarization of America to fight the ideology of hatred. Just this past week Pittsburgh Public Schools school board voted down 8 to 1 a measure which would have allowed armed guards in their schools despite pleas from some police agencies to do so. Other cities should follow Pittsburgh's example.Charlie Kirk, Ted Cruz, and other incompetent idiots like to say that if you cut taxes, you will raise revenue. They ALSO like to say that single-payer healthcare will need massive tax hikes to pay for it! These are necessarily contradictions that cannot be reconciled together. Either to pay for single-payer AKA RAISE REVENUE, you need to raise taxes (like those horrible 50-60% taxes Charlie talks about in Scandinavia) OR you need to CUT TAXES to raise revenue. If they ACTUALLY believed in this bullshit, they would be proposing cutting taxes in Scandinavia in order to better pay for the welfare state there. They are lying scumbags is what I am saying.

I will give the following rebuttal of their hypothesis here. Raising the top marginal tax rate for people making over $1 million has a negative force multiplier of roughly $0.04 in GDP per $1.00 raised in taxes. An across-the-board tax hike, reversing the entire set of Bush tax cuts, would have a negative force multiplier of around $0.33. Now if you spend the money taxed on anything with a force multiplier over $0.04 or $0.33, respectively, there is not even a tradeoff at all. You will get higher revenue short-term and higher growth leading to higher revenue long-term. The average U.S. federal government program has a force multiplier of $1.70 just in case you didn’t know.

&amp;#x200B;Could Trump have made a half decent President as a Democrat?http://m.jpost.com/American-Politics/Womens-March-leaders-refuse-to-condemn-Farrakhan-after-antisemitic-speech-544074

Women's March leaders Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory, and Carmen Perez have embraced openly anti-Semitic, homophobic, and patriarchal leader of the Nation of Islam Louis Farrakhan. For BDSers, it's a pretty bad look for leaders of a movement they try to defend as not anti-Semitic to support a blatant anti-Semite so unequivocally. 

But it's not just the far left embracing Farrakhan. Some mainstream Democrats have ties to this man. Keith Ellison in particular has come under fire for his connection to Farrakhan as a high-ranking leader in the DNC. As far as we know, his ties ended in the late 90s. Obama was photographed with him in 2005, but later disavowing and rejecting his support in 2008. Other Democratic leaders  who have come under fire include Maxine Waters, Barbara Lee, Al Green, William Jefferson, and Danny Davis. However, these connections don't appear to be recent, as these instances appear to be at least 9 years hold with nothing new since.

We need to openly and strongly condemn leaders who unapologetically embrace Farrakhan. But given that these people are generally stand against the Democratic Party, is this a serious problem for Democrats?I remember the good old days, when Gigantic used to troll Nut Conspiracy Nut before he left us, far too soon. 

Today the whole subreddit will want to know why the quality of posts on this forum is so low, and the answer is no longer the possible cuckoldry of j437, nor the lasersharp posts of Concerndian. 

The work that brought this sub to new lows was perpetrated by a single man / replicant / bot: u/howsci. Not knowing shame, he has wrecked this place. 

It's a shame, really. 

In loving memory of u/nut_conspiracy_nutI've been taking Krav Maga off and on for a couple of years, partially for self-defense, partially because it's fun. After a while off and moving to a new state, I started back up again last week.

The instructor was demonstrating a maneuver with his wife, and in explaining the importance of one part of it, he pulled a knife out of his back pocket, which made me jump completely out of my skin. It was a practice knife, so it had no edge, and he explained that if you want to carry any kind of weapon for self defense (e.g. a knife, sidearm/CCW, pepperspray, etc.) you need to practice using it in realistic situations. Otherwise, don't carry it. He said that if we wanted, we could bring the appropriate training mock-weapons to class.

I looked up what's covered in a CCW class, and I don't feel that it's really all that sufficient in teaching people how to use it effectively for self-defense. It's mostly target practice and how to access it, but there's nothing that I've found that talks about when it's appropriate to pull it out and what your mental state will be when that time comes. But maybe I'm wrong (if you've taken CCW lessons, please let me know especially if I got that wrong and what you think).

Any thoughts about this? I just found it to be really interesting and timely advice, although I don't ever plan on carrying a gun.http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/377095-stormy-daniels-files-lawsuit-against-trump-report

#Your NDA is Invalid!

To quote my best friend...gosh, that Clinton presidency was boring.No, countries from Norway to black sea are not Russian "sphere of influence". Some countries chose to join nato and it was not unfair to Russia to take them. It would have been unfair to those countries to let Putin prevent them joining.

Using the analogy of hypothetical russian troops in Mexico or Cuba is flawed. First of all, don't decide by analogy. Secondly, if we are arguing about analogies, there were russian troops in Cuba and Kennedy started naval blockade only when nukes started coming too. Cuba crisis was wrong, Kennedy should have been passive. Russian troops were in Cuba for decades, but without nukes, and no one freaked out like Putin is doing. Mexico does not want russian troops, but if it wanted them and they came, most USA could do about it would be rearranging troops inside it's own borders.

Question about defending Baltic states and Poland if Russia invades is actually question about defending EU (and other countries), because that defending can start at Baltic states and Poland instead of deeper in EU territory.

Did nato break treaty by putting troops in Baltics? No because treaties about nato troops in Baltic states were nullified when Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014. The nato move is about ground troops. As incompetent, sick and bad as Trump is, he is not going to start any war with the few troops there, so it is not "escalating". The troops are there ready when Mike Pence, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or whoever takes over.

Lastly, usa or nato are not giving military aid to "ukrainian rebels" or "rebels in Ukraine", but to the government of Ukraine.

I know these things just by following media and not even every day. This show / David could invite some experts to talk about these things.
Our street naming committee meets every two weeks, opposite planning and zoning, and I am a member of this committee. I have, for the past several sessions, been trying to figure out how to get a street named after David Pakman. Pakman Place, or Pakman Pl is the street I am trying to get on the map. Does anyone have any ideas about how I can sneak it in?http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/south-africa-white-farms-land-seizure-anc-race-relations-a8234461.html

Refer to the article above. It is looking increasingly likely that the white farmers of South Africa will have their lands seized by the corrupt ANC without any form of compensation awarded to the white farmers. This is discrimination, racism &amp; oppression at its most disgusting! Granted that the terrible legacy of Apartheid muddies the waters, but this motion if passed, sets a dangerous precedent!

I am a liberal and Im absolutely sick that so called progressives/liberals are not speaking out about the plight of these white farmers. It is looking likely that we could end up with a Zimbabwe like situation with violence breaking out &amp; a real white genocide happening due to the radical rhetoric of despicable racists like EFF leader Julius Malema. Malema is a low IQ radical racist &amp; a vile black supremacist who has also said that "you are lucky that we are not calling for an outright genocide on white people"!

Are you going to mention this on your show David? I like your show and am a big fan &amp; as one of the best representatives of the progressive community who cares deeply about human rights, I expect you to speak up about this mate! Today, March 8 around 2 PM EST, the result shows Bill Clinton... I wonder why... And I wonder how much flak Google will get for this.

I checked with different computers in different locations. What is your result?Now I know most people here despise David Frum because of his neocon sensibilities and involvement pushing for and defending the Iraq war, but I've ALWAYS liked David Frum.


Why?  Because he is clear and concise in his speech and you can follow the thread of logic of how he gets from A to B, even if some of the initial premises may be mistaken (contrast that to many Trump supporters that are scattershot and scatterbrained and a tangled mess of logic and reason).



But here he cuts DEEP into one of my main antagonisms to how too many modern conservative think about the world and policy and problems and solutions.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W8TRj1nV4s#t=22m10s


There it is.  They tend to take old solutions and what they presume are ETERNALLY useful and relevant principles and apply them to modern problems.  And if those solutions that were sanctioned by God or the founders or conservative ideology about limited government are not up to the task of solving something or say little about a new problem, their answer is to wash their hands of anything, or just default to assuming the market will take care of it best.  And if that result is not good, the presumption will be that government involvement would just make things worse. 

Presumption and supposition and a TOTAL lack of humility about their own knowledge all the way down to their cores.


That is why I think modern conservatism is such a dead end, they have no new solutions to new problems that does not involve tax cuts and deregulation.  That is the sum total of the vast majority of their policy toolkit.  If it were MERELY an attitude of increased worry about chucking out the good along with the bad, and wanting to be more cautious about proposed tweaks and changes to society, I would respect that.  They may not want to move as fast as I would, but if we could at LEAST agree that a particular problem WAS A problem, and not just farm out any fallout from that problem to the market and say WHATEVER happens is fine, because freedom, I'd be less contemptuous of the movement, but too many of them are precise as Frum described.I just read this article on Vox

https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/3/8/17084158/wind-turbine-power-energy-blades

GE is planning a mega wind turbine over half the height of the empire state building to be released in 2021

And apparently, the bigger the wind turbine, the more energy and also capacity they have.  The energy production becomes less intermittent the larger they get.

Near the end, they talked about a future design that would be around the height of the empire state building, which to me is insane.  Wind power is going to get a lot cheaper than it already is.

Guys, it's over.  Fossil Fuels are just on a timer now.  Tock Tock doc.  And have you seen all the recent reports about electric car designs from the big auto makers?

Electric planes?  Electric fedex trucks?  Electric ferries?  Politics is shit, but on the technological side and clean energy side, we are getting over the hump.  Those lab grown burgers went from hundreds of thousands of dollars per serving to like 11 bucks, so we will have much lower waste for meat production and less energy use.  There are just so many positive developments.

Guys, we are winning, if not in politics, the world liberals want to build is being created by us in the labs and even industry.

So cheer up guys, Cheer up David, no more feeling depressed.  And if you ever do feel down, just imagine Beto O'Rourke beating Ted Cruz.There is a problem that I'm curious how people here would address. 

I'll begin by making the claim, that in order for us to achieve peace, social and economic justice, we are soon approaching a point where democratic revolution is required not just in America, but in Russia and China also.

The presence of empire throughout this century has in many ways facilitated authoritarianism to remain in Russia and China, mainly because of the absence of authentic international leadership within institutions like the United Nations, but also because US empire necessitates equal engagement from those at the receiving end. Now I should say that both the aforementioned countries hold a view of manifest destiny as to their role in the global system, being so large, prosperous and potentially powerful - US Containment has kept their ambitions constrained.

Decline in the American empire is however upon us, and with that we are seeing another important consequence of the Cold War. Russia and China are carefully shedding away any semblance of democracy, which was never really there to begin with, and committing to direct strategies to exploit US weakness in order to expand their own power. I'm sure you all know examples of how this happening.

I suspect the failure to end the imperial presidency in the United States since Roosevelt has put us in an awkward position as progressives. That we must either support US imperialism to inhibit authoritarian China and Russia to roam in a coming era of resource scarcity and volatility - or commit to deconstructing empire with coordination and cooperation with revolutionary democratic movements in both Russia and China. I doubt we could do one without the other for obvious reasons. This is most certainly the foundation of the neoliberal approach held by Obama and Clinton, which we should keep absolutely clear when we approach issues from campaign finance reform to anything that has to do with power and the party system. 

These factions of power in the United States all agree that empire is necessary in order to preserve American dominance, what has so far guaranteed peace, prosperity and security for the majority of the nations on the planet. I personally subscribe to this only partially, as I have outlined, there are dangerous consequences to running empire - it is by its very nature obstructionist, exploitative and never long lasting. Like many have commented before, a democratic international order is required. 

The question is how to get there. https://forward.com/opinion/letters/396106/to-my-black-brothers-and-sisters-im-black-and-jewish-farrakhan-is-bad-for-u/

Some commentary in the Forward from black Jews. It is the responsibility of progressives who believe in true intersectionality to explicitly denounce Farrakhan and his bigotry.The Korea situation is not so bad that Trump could not make it worse. 

Trump will spill secrets to Kim. If Trump promises anything, Trump will turn around later, and then Kim is more angry than before.

President Hillary Clinton or president Bernie Sanders should not go to north korea either, but they should talk in phone and write letters. Maybe lay some fiber optic cable so they can talk in video calls...

Trump should not participate in diplomacy in any way, he is better being passive / playing golf, but Rex Tillerson should. 

South-Korea and other countries can do lot.Lassally is also a survivor of Nazi concentration camps and described the horrors he witnessed as a child. A most apt description was of how the Nazi's continually instilled fear by changing the daily routines of their prisoners to keep them psychologically unbalanced. He said that this is the same effect Trump is causing with his behavior as President. It subjects rational people to such insanity that they find themselves in a position of not knowing how to react except with disbelief and confusion about what they are witnessing.Just watched his YouTube clip from a day ago about interventionism/non-interventionism/isolationism.

David was interviewing a prosecutor (if memory is correct) about criminal justice reform and talked about his transition from his belief that there was no such thing as a false conviction to why he now is an activist criticizing the criminal justice system. 

Long story short, I'm talking to a local democrat about a person I don't like, but who I suspect may have had a false conviction on a VERY serious charge, and is in prison rn, and I wanted to share that interview because he talked about some of the criticisms of plea bargaining. 

If someone can send me a link, cause I couldn't find it myself, that would be much appreciated. you will be my hero, and I'll click on your profile, like 20 of your posts to give you 20 more Karma points cause you deserve it. I've been thinking about the way that we keep time, I'm not sure I agree with the method behind it.

Currently we mark time by
1 second= don't know how they figure this out

60 sec= 1 minute

60 minutes= 1 hour

24 hours= 1 day

7 days= 1 week

365 days= 1 year= the time it takes for the planet to fully rotate

Should we really care about where we are in relation to when the planet circles the sun? The way we currently keep track of time seems very wonky, it reminds me of how America uses feet, yards, miles instead of the metric system.

As a thought experiment I propose making our units of time make more sense, and more similar to the unit system in the following way

1 second= 1 second now

10 seconds= 0.1 new minutes

100 seconds= 1 new minute

10 minutes= 0.1 new hour

100 minutes= 1 new hour

10 new hours= 1 new day

10 new days= one new week

10 new weeks= 0.1 new year

100 new weeks= 1 new year

This is just an idea I thought of, let me know what you think. 
Conor Lamb's apparent victory in yesterday's PA-18 election tells us that it is absolutely possible for Democrats to win over Trump voters. The key reason why was in his approach: **he was running to represent the district rather than trying to sell the Democratic Party platform where it didn't fit**.

#The Oversimplicity of Looking at Strategy as Right vs. Left

We have all probably lamented the problem's with America's two-party system and how it leaves out 43% of potential American voters who don't identify with either party. The two parties have defined policy platforms, and people who don't fit the entire platform are discouraged. However, even *within* the two major political parties, the values of individuals are very nuanced. Some Republicans, especially younger Republicans, are socially liberal and pro-choice. Some Democrats are pro-life and more conservative on immigration. These deviations from policy positions on the party platforms are pretty widely frowned upon by the national party, leading to labels like RINO and DINO.

Most people frustrated with this would probably agree that we should try to adopt a multi-party system as proportional parliamentary systems have so as to have clearly defined political parties that cover the range of those policy positions. But given the strong hold that our two parties have over the system, that is unlikely. For now, I'm afraid we are stuck with these two parties.

#The Current and Incorrect Approach

There seems to be a consensus on the left that I disagree with, and it's that we have to push for more progressive candidates *everywhere*, even if it costs us that seat. The approach does two things:

1. In very conservative areas that happen to be represented by a Democrat who faces a tough Republican in a general election, pushing a primary challenger whose platform does not fit the values of that district will most certainly result in the loss of that seat. Some may argue that the party deserves to lose it, but I'll get into why I disagree with that later.

2. It actually drives the Democratic party to play it safe when it comes to congressional elections. PA-18 is a prime example of that. The district has reliably elected Republicans for decades, one of whom was Rick Santorum. For the last two election cycles, the Democrats didn't even bother to run a candidate because they felt that it was a lost cause. The upset last night proved that that theory at least has some holes.

There is also rhetoric from pundits and commentators on the right that Democrats pretty much have to be Republicans in order to win in Republican districts. The president's confidants are even trying to comfort him by telling him that Lamb ran "as a Republican." This is also false.

The bottom line here is that the left-right dichotomy in the debate over the direction of the Democratic party is oversimplified and misses the factors that actually drive some voters.

#Why Lamb Won and What Democrats and Progressives Can Learn

Lamb was not exactly a progressive candidate. He is pro-life and against an assault weapons ban. But he gained the support of Congressman Seth Moulton (one of my picks for a future president), who does not share those specific views, as well as Van Jones (btw, David, any chance of reconciling?). Both of these progressives have been talking about how Lamb was running to represent the citizens of the district. He grew up there, people know him well, and he is known as a genuinely good guy. Ultimately, he went on the campaign trail to hear the people's concerns and built a campaign around addressing them, focusing very much on supporting labor unions and healthcare. On healthcare, while the district overwhelmingly voted for Trump, the majority were against the push to repeal ACA.

Here is where Moulton and Jones broke from the debate over the political direction of the party, and I have long agreed with this sentiment: **Democrats should embrace ideological diversity within the party**. Van Jones's full remark on this:

&gt;I think Democrats have to release a certain kind of ideological stranglehold on people who want to run in districts that are not like the districts in New York and California. New York and California - ya know - I got roots in both places. [I] love them to death. But I grew up in the rural South in a red state, and you just can't have the same kind of litmus test in Birmingham that you have in Berkeley, and you gotta be willing to back and support candidates who can actually win in parts of the country. Listen. It's very hard to remember, Don [Lemon], this country is so big we have 3 different time zones. It's as big as a continent. You gotta let people be able to raise money, and run, and get support, even if they don't agree with every single part of the liberal agenda. And, I'll tell you what, that is going to happen. People keep thinking that in some of these districts, you're going to be able to run, you know, left-wing folks like...some of the people they [Trump and the Republicans] love to beat up on. But here's the reality: people are smart locally. And you're going to have a lot of smart local Democrats who are going to learn from this, and they're going to put the right people forward. The Republicans are not going to have it easy this time because people know we're going to put up a big fight.

*Don Lemon corrected Jones on the time zone part of his statement.*

This approach requires some soul-searching on both strategy and personality, and it all has to do with realism over idealism.

#Additional Issues and Strategy

Of course, there are other issues that need to be tackled in the Democratic party, and there has been some movement to address them. Something else Lamb did right, at least IMO, was promising to not support Pelosi for House Democratic leadership for widely agreed upon reason that we just need new blood. Pelosi has become a caricature for the left, and I don't think she has the party's best interest at heart. Same with Schumer. Additionally, Democrats need to walk-the-walk on campaign finance reform, and that is happening with the growing No-PAC Caucus. Of course, the vote on loosen bank regulations just proves the need for this kind of party reform. 

There's probably more I can say about this, but I think I've rambled enough for now. Let me know your thoughts on this.I watched his new specials, and have since appreciated Dave Chappelle as being more than a good comedian.  He's actually helped me sort out what I think and feel about the whole movement.  Pretty much what he's said is exactly what I agree with.  For anyone who's not seen his two new specials, I highly recommend it.  Birds revelation is actually the more thoughtful and pertinent of the two.

But to summarize, the part that really struck me is what he said about how women are going about it.  He 100% agree's with them, but disagrees with their tactics.  Women understand the power they have and these guys are in a position of fear that they never had to experience, but fear does not create lasting peace.  He goes onto say that the Me Too movement tends to chase away the men that intend to help them;  The very best thing they can do is get men on their side, but they chase them away for being imperfect, but Dave thinks that you need imperfect allies at first in order to make lasting change.  Otherwise, things will just die down and it'll all go back  to the way it was before the movement.

There was another striking comment about how we must all engage in talking about, openly and without fear, how we actively participated in the system that allows for these things to happen.  You can't do this with revenge.  Everyone's a victim of the system we are under.  He uses South African apartheid as an example.

I'm not doing the talks justice.  You'll just have to watch and listen.  For those that have seen it, I think you all know what I mean.How to interview Adolf Hitler, Rubin style:

1. *Don't* ask Hitler about Jews.
2. *Don't* ask Hitler about Rhineland bastards.
3. *Don't* ask Hitler about euthanasia of the the disabled.
4. *Don't* ask Hitler about the Roma, the socialists, the Jehova's Witnesses, the trade unionists.
5. *Do* ask Hitler about being a vegetarian - the benefits. Does he miss eating meat?
6. *Do* ask Hitler about animal welfare - his opposition vivisection.
7. *Do* ask Hitler about his relationship with his dog, Blondi.
8. *Do* ask Hitler about banning smoking in Germany.
9. *Do* ask Hitler what it feels like to be a bachelor with his national popularity.
10. *Do* ask Hitler about his relationship with Fraulein Braun. Is he planning to put a ring on it?

See? Even the most odious human being can be sanitised. You just need an **ignorant audience**, an **irresponsible interviewer** and the **right (wrong) questions**.

Edit: We'll do Stalin next week. basically literally the only response a sickening high number of straight liberals have to homophobia is to inexplicably act as if it must be coming from a gay person. I literally don't remember the last time i seen a straight liberal assume a homophobe is straight, but whenever i point out how fucking depraved that is I essentially get told to shut my mouth and allow straight people to continue to act as if WE are the ones responsible for homophobia, and this is coming from people who think of themselves as allies aswell, which makes it an even bigger slap in the face.

&gt;Very critical article by @NathanJRobinson of my work (including Maps of Meaning) in Current Affairs (https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/03/the-intellectual-we-deserve …) is accompanied most hilariously by this ad...

The ad of course is an image recommending readers purchase a copy of a book titled "Blueprints for a Sparkling Tomorrow", written by Robinson and a colleague, Oren Nimni, in which they parody of the same type of nonsensical academic grand theory promulgated by folks like Peterson.

In the original [article](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/03/the-intellectual-we-deserve), which I strongly urge you all to read, Robinson flat out says Peterson's reading comprehension skills are… limited. Peterson just proved him right. https://observer-reporter.com/news/localnews/sarris-candies-apologizes-for-trump-jr-visit-before-special-congressional/article_15964d2-2877-11e8-8042-5fe442c54d87.htmlFeel free to leave your angry, preferably anti-capitalist music here. No but seriously I would appreciate some real suggestions. Chronixx, Immortal technique etc. anything with some depth works.Since I'm on the left I'd of course like to see more cuts into the dogmas of the right, but I'm imagining some towering intellect with the depth of the Marianas trench that could highlight and explain conservative/libertarian arguments and justifications better than the best of the actual adherents.  Explain it so well that near the end of the illustration people on the right would be chomping at the bit to make this person their new Peterson-esque champion to crush the left, then proceed to have this same person, with scalpel like precision showcase in even more compelling and powerful form why those positions and attitudes are wrong.  Account for differences in human temperaments and perferences, account for differential outcomes.

1. Transform into a parliamentary system.

2. Robust public financing of elections.

3. Federal government reform: Remove the president, Senators, and Congressman and replace them with parliment representatives who serve 4 year terms.

4. Reserve the first friday of March, June, September, and December as Federal holidays where all major elections take place.

However I did have an idea I wanted input on. We completely reform the judicial system. We get rid of the current supreme court and replace it with a panel of 201 judges. These judges would look at every new piece of legislation and judge whether it is constitutional or not and the bill doesn't take effect until they've OKed it. 

Instead of having laws pass then watch them do harm and be lucky if the supreme court catches them years later, have them catch these laws before they become reality. That's just my idea, let me know what you think.https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/85du3u/looks_like_russians_overwhelmingly_support_putin/dw0tdm9/It's so hard to choose for me.

I want a 4 way tie between:

Devin Nunes
Paul Ryan
Scott Walker
Ted CruzI think its pretty clear that the Democratic Party is desperately in need of a new leader. So far we haven't seen anyone who has really stood up to take on that role. There are of course a few that alot of people have in mind like Bernie Sanders for instance but right now the only person who I think can truly repair the damage that Trump and his congressional supporters have done to our Nation is Joe Biden. There is no one out there that is more experienced and or qualified than Biden. I know alot of people will point out the fact that he is to old for the job and they would rather have someone else younger and I somewhat agree but that doesn't matter right now. What we need is a leader who can come into the White House get things done IMMEDIATELY to try and fix and repair everything Trump has done not only to our government but also our place in the world. With Biden being in his mid seventies we don't necessarily need him for the full eight years but we do need him and there's not a single person out there that knows the job better than he does and for the sake of our nation and all others around the globe Joe Biden has to become our president. If you've never seen this interview please do. I have a hard time watching this because I can't help but think how the hell we got to this point with Donald Trump. Just listen to how he talks and answers the questions throughout the interview. What you see in this man is a person who's compassionate, who loves his country more than ever before, he understands the basic principals of what America stands for and who we are as citizens, and most importantly he shows that he is capable of restoring everything good about our country.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REuI7KIwS-8Shame on them both. Biden as next Presidential candidate? No way.In so called "socialist" countries, most people want much more than state would provide and are willing to work for that. This reason alone is sufficient incentive for work, but there are other reasons too. 

People want to own a car, house, fly to a beach resort, own a second smaller house in a remote area, own a boat, co-own a yacht/ship with 20 people, rent a ship, own a pearl necklace, own rare art or artefact, get optional surgery for beauty reasons, consume things that make look nicer, ride horses, skydive, buy a gun, drink wine alcohol or smoke pot etc....

Second reason why it works: The same reason why Wikipedia exists and is great and why free open source software is theoretically worth billions even though only some percentage is done for paid work. 

Also, as a matter of fact, there are plenty of millionaires in "socialist" countries. Yes, some of that is because family got rich 300 years ago because a king gave some land and a castle for being a good knight with a sword ( or something like that ), but there are many new rich also. If you use a map site or a map software, you can see satellite pictures of mansions and yachts in social democratic countries.

The show implied that if cake bakers are forced to write pro-gay messaging on cakes then pro-Nazi or whatever messages must also be allowed. This is NOT what the case is about! Written messages or symbols are not what the plaintiffs are arguing for. They do not want to force bakers to print messages contrary to their(the baker's) beliefs. What they want is the right to not be denied a cake(un-messaged) or other services simply because they are gay. The bakers want to refuse this basic service. Shame on "Will and Grace" for their promulgation of ignorance in this matter.He had better songs made about him.  Listen to this variation on a hunger games theme.

It's a lovely song, in service of a horrific figure.

Whoever gets the 2020 nomination, we need a song worthy of our cause.Different groups of people are moved by different promises and different concerns / threats.

Also, one person's promise can be another's concern or threat.

Politicians have always presented different image to different groups and sometimes even got away with contradictory promises in speeches to small groups ( Hitler was one ). Social media data analysis and personal ads can bring this to new level and even without tainting the candidate.

Harder to lie about products and services than about politics. With ads about products and services, data analysis can be used for good if it helps overcome irrationalities / unconscious biases: For example, the person that is talking about a product in an ad video can be same type as the potential customer. Result may be that the consumer ends up using better products than before.

With products, contradictory prices are bigger concern than contradicting promises. Some consumers may be guided to needlessy more expensive products.

I wanted to share my experience at the March for Our Lives. It was emotional, logical, data-driven, and holistic in the goals of the movement. I also feel that it's hard to gather the full impact from soundbites through media coverage.

*Warning:* It's a long read, and I don't think any TL;DR would do it justice.

##Before the Rally
The night before the main event, my entourage gathered in my hotel room to coordinate our signs, on which we argued for about two hours. We wanted to do our best to be concise, indisputable, and non-divisive, fully aware that the last goal was a far stretch especially because it is such a hot-button issue. Two of the five signed we came up with: “Mental Illness is Global; This is American” and “We’re Not Anti-Gun; We’re Pro-Life at Any Age”.

The morning of the rally, we met a man on the shuttle to the Metro station who was handing out business cards for his “AR Buyback Fund.” The man described himself as a gun enthusiast and an avid hunter, and he wants to provide an incentive for people to *voluntarily* give up their assault-style rifles, focusing on AR-15s. His goal is to raise money for a fair-market-value AR buyback program, and the rifles collected through the program would be melted down.

*Shameless plug for anyone interested in getting involved or spreading the word, here is the link*: https://grantpartnersinc.org/arbuyback/

Inside the capitol, we were approached by vendors, activists handing out website references for community building to address mental health issues as a vehicle for getting rid of gun violence, and, of course, people checking out our signs. 

##The Unexpected: A Hard Focus on Urban Gun Violence
I’m not going to waste everyone’s time here with recaps of the speeches by the Parkland survivors or the music performances (ok, just one thing on that: Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus were pretty uneventful); all of those have been run on every news channel several times. The montages were powerful, including the message from Mala Yousafzai, the psychological impacts of certain extremely realistic active shooter drills in schools, and very targeted gun violence statistics, focusing on correlations between strength of gun laws and homicide/suicide rates, urban gun violence issues, etc.

There was one Parkland speaker much later into the program whose speech explained very well the goal of this rally and why they organized it: Jaclyn Corin. I’m not talking about the introduction to Yolanda Renee King – as cute and powerful as she was. Corin showed how the Parkland students were checking their privilege, that they were fully aware of the resources they have, and that they wanted to use that to bring to light the everyday gun violence issues of urban neighborhoods across the country that do not have those resources. They wanted to unite with them and use their platform to help those communities drive the change they have been trying to achieve. They sought out to talk to children in those communities and learn from the people who experience everyday gun violence.

##More than Gun Control

Let’s be honest. Urban communities with everyday gun violence have pretty much only been used for political rhetoric until now, Chicago namely being used as a red herring by the right to show that “gun control doesn’t work.” One of the first speakers, Trevon Bosley, a Chicago teenager who lost his brother to gun violence, began his speech by leading us in a chant: “Everyday shootings are everyday problems!” He detailed the gun violence in Chicago and where that violence stems from. He placed the blame on poverty, the idea that state and local government funds were being used to fund tourism rather than neighborhood revitalization and job opportunities for their communities. He was not talking about gun reforms at all. Bosley, as well as others, put a face to a talking point, and proposed the solutions that conservatives think no one is talking about. 

The speeches by young people who have experienced everyday gun violence went far beyond Bosley. Edna Chavez delivered a powerful speech on the trauma and anxiety that followed the murder of her brother and using that emotion to drive social change in her South L.A. community. Her most powerful statement: “I learned to duck bullets before I learned to read!” Eleven-year-old Naomi Wadler – who led the March 14th walkout for her elementary school, adding an 18th minute for Courtlin Arrington, who was killed in a school shooting in Alabama after Parkland – delivered a powerful speech to bring to light the black women who don’t make the headlines when they are killed by gun fire. At the same time, she preemptively called out the inevitable critics who would say that she is too young to have an opinion about gun violence. Mya Middleton, a 16-year-old from Chicago, described her encounter with a violent man at the grocery store, who threatened her with his gun. She recounted the paralysis she felt when he walked toward her, and it devasted the crowd. Christopher Underwood, an 11-year-old from Brooklyn, described the impact of losing his then-14-year-old bother Akeal and how it has driven his activism since he was only 9 years old. At the time of his brother’s death, Christopher was only 5 years old. 

All of the speakers from these communities, I believe, were the main reason for this march, not the Parkland survivors. We know the Parkland story all too well at this point, and those students were also very powerful and convincing. I’m not trying to diminish the incredible work they’ve done by any means. But they should also be commended for actually giving a platform to kids affected by gun violence on an everyday basis, kids who have been used as political pawns shut down any gun control proposals.

##Overall Takeaways

Of course, March for Our Lives focused a lot on gun regulation policy, policies that most Americans already agree with in most polls. It also went far beyond gun policy and drove focus on the underlying issues that cause gun violence in urban communities as well as how gun control measures have actually reduced homicide *and* suicide rates in certain places where *smart* gun control measures have been implemented. I was admittedly disappointed in the lack of media coverage on the non-Parkland speakers afterward, but that might just be because that was the part that struck me the most.

I cried at least 6 times in those 3 hours. Sorry not sorry to the gun fetishists who think it’s a bad thing that the push for gun control is being driven by emotion. That’s how it should be. It’s called being human, not being a “snowflake”. 

I’ll finish with a personal story that tied this all together for me. A few years ago, my older sister got her first teaching job at a charter school in a Columbus, OH suburb, an area where everyday gun violence affected her students. In talking about it with her, the one thing she said about working at that school that always haunted me: “I will never get used to the kids talking about their friends getting shot like it’s an everyday thing.” I am so proud of this event for finally bringing these issues into the mainstream so that we can de-normalize them. This event, in my opinion, was exactly the kick in the pants our country needed to start driving sensible gun policy.

**Follow-up:** part of why I wanted to go to the march in Washington was because I knew the media would focus on the parts that likely mattered the least. David Hogg is calling them out for not paying more attention to the black speakers older than 11. 

https://www.themarysue.com/david-hogg-media-black-students/Questions like "Should Israel continue to exist?" and "Is there a role for public intellectuals?" are, begging the pardon of whoever came up with them, silly. 

Try coming up with more substantive and less nebulous questions; questions that can be debated by reference to data - evidence. Less "feels over reals" (as Destiny would say) questions. Failing that, don't bother calling it a debate. Just call it a hangout or something. I've been reading about this Russian billionaire Dmitry Itskov the founder of 2045 Initiative. The Billionaire is trying to make mankind into immortal gods with crazy science. 

The crazy science is simply just crazy, to say the least. However, we do have the blueprint of hologram bodies Itskov talks about, but I don't see it happening in 2045. Maybe, I'm wrong but I'll let you guys decide. I hope you guys like the reading this looney website details. 

http://2045.com/In 2016, Bernie Sanders said he basically doesn't think the US should be trading very much at all with countries where wages are much lower than its own. In an interview with the New York Daily News, he said "You have to have standards. And what fair trade means to say that it is fair. It is roughly equivalent to the wages and environmental standards in the United States."

According to economists, limiting trade with low-wage countries as severely as Sanders wants to would hurt the very poorest people on Earth. *A lot*.

Free trade is one of the best tools we have for fighting extreme poverty and if Sanders becomes POTUS is serious about implementing his trade agenda as outlined in 2016 interview and elsewhere, he will impoverish millions of already-poor people.

This is a particularly tricky this issue. There is real truth to Sanders's critique of free trade: Recent economic research suggests that freer trade has hurt many Americans, particularly those who worked in manufacturing. The question, then, is how much we're willing to hurt the world's poor in order to help ourselves.

If Bernie becomes POTUS in 2020 and his trade policies is anything like his voting record would suggest, which incidentally, would make them very similar to Donald Trump's, the effects would be devastating for China and Latin America.

The global decline in extreme poverty is inseparable from the global trading regime. When poor countries can sell cheap goods to rich countries, or bring in a lot of foreign direct investment, growth skyrockets. This means more jobs, better government services, and thus less poverty.

If Sanders were to impose significant trade barriers with China, as Trump currently plans on doing, the marginal middle class, or the ones who had just gotten out of poverty, would likely wind up falling back into poverty. 

I could go on, because there is a lot more that could be said. However, I will end on this note:
It is a right-wing nationalist notion that people in other countries simply do not matter as much as our fellow citizens, or that we have a greater duty to our fellow citizens. While one can sympathise with efforts to avoid Chinese manufacturing because workers are not paid well enough, the “Made In America” a strange thing to boast about. Nations are a fiction, the existence of which causes horrific wars, and it is important to avoid adopting and encouraging a nationalistic worldview, especially one with the potential to screw over roughly 900 million people still living in extreme poverty."THE LAST LIBERAL" said this at 52:20 on Colin Morarity's podcast. If there was any doubt about who Dave Rubin really is (and there shouldn't be at this point), then this is the final nail in the coffin if I've ever seen it. I am absolutely disgusted at how “intellectually honest” “liberals” like Eric Weinstein &amp; Sam Harris are friends with this guy &amp; in Harris’ case, he even funds Rubin on Patreon! Rubin is nothing but a cowardly &amp; dumb right-wing hack.

But don't forget, guys, Hillary wanted to start WW3 with Russia!

Remember that when gay marriage is possibly overturned. If you think those to things are a stretch, Obergefell v Hodges was a 5 - 4 decision and Supreme court justices have life tenure. Kennedy, Ginsburg and Breyer, the latter two of whom have recurring health problems, are no spring chickens. And even if gay marriage is not overturned, you can forget getting money out of politics (Citizens United was another 5 - 4 decision) as well as brace yourselves for an onslaught on unions.And what's your favorite publications?I've been thinking, perhaps, if we were to host a debate again in future, we might discuss issues such as -

- GMO - good or bad?
- free trade - good or bad?
- borders - good or bad?
- UBI - good idea or bad idea?
- free college - good idea or bad idea?
- school vouchers - good or bad?
- limits on independent political expenditure - good or bad?

I don't know. It beats debating whether or not Israel has a right to exist or if there is a role for public intellectuals. Back in 2016 David spoke about the possibility of hiring something like a "progressive outreach" person.

What happened with that initiative?Islam is cancerIn 2006, when the Bush White House proposed an amendment to the Constitution defining marriage as between a man and a woman, Sanders spoke out against the Republican plan, saying it was “designed to divide the American people". However, when asked by a reporter whether Vermont should legalize same-sex marriage, he said no. “Not right now, not after what we went through,” he said.

That same year, when he was asked whether the federal government should overturn a Massachusetts state court decision that legalized gay marriage, Bernie responded by talking about states’ rights, which is an argument often used by politicians who have argued against federal recognition of gay marriage as well:

&gt;*I believe the federal government should not be involved in overturning Massachusetts or any other state because I think the whole issue of marriage is a state issue*

**It wasn’t until 2009 that Sanders publicly voiced support for gay marriage, years after many of his contemporaries in Vermont.**

It seems to me then that while Bernie was obviously always an ally to the "gay community", he was only pro gay marriage when it was politically expedient or politically inexpensive. 

Now, come at me, Bernie Bros!After hearing Howard Sterns advice to Trump the other day where he said he didn't know why Trump wanted to be President in the first place and that he should get the hell out of DC I thought i would ask the question on here. WHY???? My personal guess and opinion on why Donald Trump wanted to be President was to make money and to do so the same exact way he has run his crooked empire by placing his cronies at the highest levels of the Government to gain profit. I seriously find it extremely hard to believe that Trump wanted to become President on behalf of our countries history and place in the world so that he could do some good and be remembered as someone who Americans will cherish forever. For his entire life he has been able to present himself as this multi billion dollar genius who is one of the best business deal makers in history and only a handful of people knew the truth that he was everything but all that. A smart person who has made it as far as Trump by doing all the same sketchy mob-like stuff would not even think about going for the white house because they would know that by becoming President EVERYTHING will come out and you would no longer be able to lie your way out of everything or bully and threaten to sue everyone to get your way, it just doesn't make any sense and frankly its the dumbest move he's ever made. Still as President he has tried effortlessly to play the fake news thing, even had to lie about his height otherwise the doctor would have labeled him obese and now with all the scandals, its mind blowing some days. I think everyone on the planet except for Donald Trump gets that he alone is the main cause for 99% of his problems and scandals and so far he has proven that he doesn't know ANYTHING about politics, doesn't understand that congress doesn't work for him neither does the FBI or CIA and everything else, and worst of all he has shown the world that he really doesn't know a thing about making deals even in the business world and he never has. His record speaks for itself, and remember he didn't write his cherished book the Art Of the Deal, he paid to have it written lol....I could drag on for hours but i am just curious on why some of you think Trump ran for President in the first place??**The Brady Bill**

Sanders voted five times against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which established a background check system and wait periods for people buying handguns from licensed dealers. Sanders often responds to this attack by highlighting his long-time support for “instant background checks.” That’s true, but there’s more to the story. When the Brady bill was being debated, the “instant” background checks that Sanders supported would have actually killed the Brady bill. 

**The “Charleston loophole”**

In 2016, 4,170 guns were sold to people with criminal records, mental illnesses and other circumstances which should have prevented them from being able to buy a firearm. The reason? The FBI failed to complete background checks before a three-day deadline, so these people were automatically cleared to purchase a gun.

On June 17, 2015, a young man shot and killed nine Black people in a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. This young man legally purchased his .45-caliber Glock pistol from a store, even though he had been charged with possessing a Schedule III narcotic without a prescription. This was not caught before the three-day waiting period ended because of clerical mistakes, so the store went through with the purchase. The “Charleston loophole” refers to the three-day waiting period. Sanders did not specifically vote for a three-day period, **he did vote for an even shorter one-day window — and eventually, he voted against requiring any background checks at all**. The vote in question took place almost a quarter-century ago, but there is a relatively straight line from the 1993 vote to the 2015 shooting. 

More to come.
Nepotism, being defined by a google search, is a person in power favoring friends and relatives by giving them jobs. 

In politics this usually means important appointments. Shouldn't we encourage politicians to bring onto their staff individuals they trust rather than an individual they only know professionally?

This isn't to say that hiring your friends and family will always be the best decision, in the end it all comes down to qualifications. 

For instance I look at Trump's cabinet/inner circle. Whether I'm looking at Ivanka or Jeff Sessions it doesn't matter if they are family or not: they're all unqualified.

When I look to when nepotism became a hot issue, Robert Kennedy becoming attorney general, I see those choices being more professional and cohesive than choices made today.

Personally I prefer situations where the party in power needs as little hinderance to do what they want. 51% coalitions in congress, I support no appointment necessary cabinets (let them pick whoever they want). Let their true colors show and their actions speak for themselves. Shorty after American troops suffer an attack in Syria . Obama was following up on a plan already announced by the Bush administration. Whereas Trump thought up the idea of announcing to the rebels: "we're getting out of Syria very soon" all by his 'very intelligent' self. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD_vMrmX4c4I've been watching David's show regularly since the general 2016 election, and got into some of the classic interviews with radical extremists.

Out of all these people, I personally think Frazier Glenn Miller is perhaps the most deranged man on this list, considering he is the only person that has been convicted of murder, his blatant anti Semitism and bigot in general. I added some that aren't necessarily extremists but are on this list for their whack beliefs. Do not bother with images if they do not inform about anything that people do not already know.

If you show a face, it's width and height in pixels should be at most 1/4 or quarter of the image width and height.

Repulsive people means something like D Trump, Putin, Kim jong Un or the latest mass shooter. Of those, only D.T may be well known enough to not need showing for the 1000th time with a generic picture unrelated to the subject. Audience may still need education about who the dictators are, but mass shooter pictures are not necessary, at least not after one showing. Dictators and mass shooters are not physically repulsive, but D T is also that, so it would be better to pixelate or blur images of D T at least in thumbnails, when such image is shown because it informs about something that has happened.

We need more flowcharts, mindmaps, venn diagrams and graph plots. Sometimes graph plots can be symbolic and direction giving expressions of thought, even without any data, as long as they are clearly indicated as such. Also, emoticons and groups of emoticons for expressing thoughts visually. 

Sometimes the best (thumbnail) picture would be a piece of map centered around a location the story is about.Roseanne is a Trump supporter but who's really shocked about that? Roseanne is the same Roseanne who butchered the national anthem which was comical best. Plus, she's the type of person that Trump attracts. So no beef here.

Before I start. I should note. I don't watch TV at all, Netflix and other streaming services. This goofy war between Trump and Mainstream Media is funny, to say the least. The main reason why the Roseanne show is getting a big boost in viewership is thanks to nostalgia. Trump supporters might play a factor. However, I'm very positive it's all based on nostalgia.

Furthermore, I don't hate the moron, but I still think he's a scumbag who hires the most corrupt individual who put money into his pocket. However, we shouldn't stress ourselves over the small things like Roseanne being a trump supporter or anything like that. 

Does new Roseanne show throw out conspiracy theories and BS facts? Oh God, yes, but they have the right to say what they want. We have the right not to watch burning trash on TV.

What're your thoughts on the new Roseanne show? If any of you watched it that is. I haven’t given your campaign or whatever more money based solely on the last fundraiser having left me not super stoked, also you left for vacation which wasn’t comforting but completely logical the trip was planned and paid for in advance. 

Also you need to give pat a raise and increase the base pay for Noah before you spend money on other new line items. I see David Hogg on CNN and MSNBC a lot as of late, and I kinda wonder if he gets paid by mainstream media to show up. I don't say that to devalue his position on guns, I say that out of sheer curiosity. He has to put in considerable time getting ready for these interviews, and getting there, and perhaps has to pay for transportation costs. How much do people get paid to be on these shows? Do they even get paid to show up? What exactly was the point of it? Someone help me out here?Won’t bore you with details but will include the relevant links here so you guys can do your own listening / reading.

Sam Harris basically gave a softball interview to Charles Murray of Bell Curve fame while never challenging him on its tainted sources e.g. Pioneer Fund, Richard Lynn etc. Here’s the link below.

[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1lEPQYQk8s](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1lEPQYQk8s)

Scientists Nisbett, Harden &amp; Turkheimer wrote a rebuttal published on Vox \- [https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/the\-big\-idea/2017/5/18/15655638/charles\-murray\-race\-iq\-sam\-harris\-science\-free\-speech](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/the-big-idea/2017/5/18/15655638/charles-murray-race-iq-sam-harris-science-free-speech)

This got Sam furious &amp; he had a heated email exchange with Ezra Klein, which Sam released later on without permission.

[https://samharris.org/ezra\-klein\-editor\-chief/](https://samharris.org/ezra-klein-editor-chief/)

Anyways, Ezra wrote a followup here, [https://www.vox.com/policy\-and\-politics/2018/3/27/15695060/sam\-harris\-charles\-murray\-race\-iq\-forbidden\-knowledge\-podcast\-bell\-curve](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/27/15695060/sam-harris-charles-murray-race-iq-forbidden-knowledge-podcast-bell-curve)

And ultimatel, this led to this podcast here, where they more or less talked past each other.

So so what are your opinions about this and about race\-IQ dfferences in general? Also what do you guys &amp; David make of this dustup between Sam &amp; Ezra?Just curious I’m from the UK the kind that wil butt into a conversation about russian aggression for example by talking about america as if the fact that the US does fucked up shit means no one should ever talk about other countriesSo recently I have been hearing from more "established" sources that Trump faked the doctor's note which said Trump was in great physical health. 

For example, one of many, this CNN article was written on May 2, 2018. Most news outlets only started reporting this within the last week. 

https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/02/politics/harold-bornstein-donald-trump-health/index.html

Here is David Pakman covering the same story using critical thinking and initiative. Aug 18, 2016.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zs0C5uYvUw

In short: TDPS covered a story in relevant time using brain power and initiative. The corporate media didn't run this until 2018! 

love the work TDPS does, keeps me months ahead of the corporate news cycle. 

EDIT: Jesus TDPS covered this story Pre Pat, we still had Producer Lewis! Miss Lewis, love Pat. By the time the 1980s came, actually by the time 1975 came, 100% of Democrats voted for civil rights laws, starting with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Only Republicans voted against civil rights from this point on. Ronald Reagan opposed all civil rights laws and was a lifelong segregationist. As he said “I didn’t leave the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me.” And they did. Reagan was opposed to 100% of democrats when he vetoed the civil rights restoration act of 1987 and when he opposed Martin Luther King Jr. Day before reluctantly signing it facing a veto-proof majority in Congress. But the most harmful of the Republicans attacks on Civil Rights other than not enforcing the fair housing act of 1968 under Presidents Reagan and Bush Sr., under which zero lawsuits were filed against counties for violating the act under the Justice Department. The real damage was in the Fair Housing Amendments of 1988, in which not only did Republicans solely oppose the bill, but they watered it down using their senate majority in committee to only cover 80% of housing in America and to not have oversight. They also used courts to reinterpret the law to have a lesser effect.
Fascinating read if you are interested.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808815/#!po=6.91489Hey guys, ladies. 
Ok so I am wondering where I can get actual statistics of our economy such as debt numbers or what our nations debt is currently and then what it was last month and then the month before and so on. Also looking to see what the unemployment numbers, as well as statistics of that nature from Obamas Presidency, Bush's time in office ect, going back years. Basically I am looking for the most credible website that can show any of this stuff from a month to month basis that I can go back any number of years to see how past administrations and politically controlled congresses actually did as far as economics goes. I hope someone knows where I'm getting at here. Any recommended websites for these kinds of statistics would be much appreciated.This thread is somewhat a reply to the article: "**[Hillary Clinton: Being a Capitalist ‘Probably’ Hurt Me in Primary Because Many Democrats Are Socialists](https://www.thedailybeast.com/hillary-clinton-being-a-capitalist-probably-hurt-me-in-primary-because-many-democrats-are-socialists?ref=home)**"

I'm going to outline something very simple in this thread: This statement is misleading.

Hillary Clinton is not a capitalist. Indeed, neither is Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, John McCain, Ted Cruz, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Mitt Romney ...

These people are all invariably **imperialist**. Yes, there are certainly some nuances as to how these people would want to structure government or the economy to accommodate to this principle commitment, but to label them capitalist misses the mark in a way that directly impacts our ability to dislodge them electorally. 

Yes, being a capitalist and imperialist is not mutually exclusive, however; what I am attempting to outline is that the former is subordinate to the latter. None of the people mentioned believe in capitalism as a principle, because they are willing to throw it aside whenever the power principle comes into play.

The reason someone like Hillary Clinton would not be overly conciliatory to expanding social healthcare, giving ground to the worker movement or more progressive political organizations is mainly because at the end of the day these forces inevitably challenge the priorities that maintain empire. Note that this is not a perspective most people are accustomed to or even exposed to in their daily lives, it is arises as a consequence of understanding the balance of power, the availability of resources, the ebbs and flow of history and the importance of stability. 

Clinton would view herself as a protector of a world order. In the grand scheme, this does not make her corporatist as much as it makes her American. Her loyalty to the banking industry is not the result of political donations, but a symbiotic relationship between the political party she serves and the operating principle that ensures that the United States reigns supreme. Therefore, labeling her as a *corporatist* is a category error. 

Furthermore, the charge that Hillary Clinton is "corrupted" neither holds any ground, because the nature of the "corruption" is a commitment to something undemocratic, yes, but a higher order concern compared to the survival of some Saudi dissident. 

The reason she "serves" corporations is because the corporate system is the only viable way of organizing/structuring an empire that is not colonial, or statist in the strict Communist sense where everything is in the government domain. 

Whenever we are approaching political questions that impacts the power of the United States, .. regulations, expansion of social safety nets, radically new approaches to foreign policy, restructuring of the national security state .. we are encroaching on a consensus that is extremely entrenched. 

I have no doubt that attempts will be made to outline this consensus more explicitly in the decade to come, in whatever narrative, where people are driven to understand that these ideas that we espouse can all be sacrificed at the alter of power. Neoliberalism must be maintained because it is the safest compromise that enables empire to survive. 

Personally I am as close to a Communist as one can be, so principally I should be anti-imperialist. That said, the case for it is more complicated than we often acknowledge because the system is so immense and would have ultimately have massive implications for peace and prosperity if dismantled abruptly, and without an understanding of how it functions.

&gt; (*Disclaimer: This is not an endorsement of Neoliberalism or empire*)

&gt; and .. I'll be happy to accept the charge of reductionism.

&gt; (For those interested in empire, I have a lot of recommendations, but here is something easily digestable; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM_MH_Bfq5c)http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/religion/332938-dont-be-fooled-assad-is-no-friend-of-syrias-christian-minorities
There is not freedom of religion in Syria. The Ba’ath party which he is a member of was originally created on the blueprints of European fascism. Saddam Hussein became a supporter of jihadist in his last decade of rule. They use the cover of secularism because they are a religious minority, but they persecuted religious majorities as well as minorities. They are fascists in ideology and must be eliminated.“The government assign a religious label for all Syrians from the second they are born. 90% to 85% are considered Muslims and 10% to 15% are considered Christians. This distinction will shape the babies future lives.
Women in Syria in 2017 inherit half as the man does and its testimony is half that of the man.
One of the most discriminatory laws in Assad’s secular government is that Christian by ID card Syrian men cannot marry Muslim women by ID card unless he convert officially to Islam (spoiler, he cannot convert back to Christianity). If you are thinking who needs marriage anyway then you must know that there is no such a thing as cohabitation in Syria. If you are not married then you cannot be recognised as partners and if you have children they would probably not even be registered or get the citizenship.
Religious education starts since the first grade for all Syrians even if the parents are atheists, followers of religion other than Islam/Christianity or simply don’t want their children to be brainwashed with any ideology.
You cannot remove or change your religion from your identity card. Why do they stick religion in our IDs in the first place? I am an atheist who simply doesn’t want my ID to show any religious affiliation so I want to remove it, you guessed it I can’t. Let’s say I am deeply fascinated by Buddhism and I want to convert, again the “secular” government won’t let me.
Any religion other than Islam is not allowed to preach.
Adan (Islamic call for prayer) annoys Syrians 5 times a day with loud modern speakers including once at around 4 AM telling us that (praying is better than sleeping).
The religion of the President of the Republic is Islam, Assad’s constitution says.
There is a Ministry of Religious Affairs. It takes money from us to build mosques and maintain them and pay salaries to people who work in them.
Men can beat their wives.
Men can divorce women whenever they want but women can’t divorce themselves.
Polygamy is legal. Men can marry up to 4 women. Of course the reverse is not true.
Homosexuality is illegal.”
https://www.quora.com/Is-Bashar-al-Assad-secularThe phrase was used as the title of a book that was widely circulated, when I first heard the title I thought that was a great play on words and could be used to viscerally describe all sorts of phenomenon.  What is the phrase?

The Darkness Visible.  Just sounding out the words has a certain weight to it, it's a fantastic phrase, and I think it could be applied to all sorts of tip of the iceberg like ugly manifestations that suggest an even larger hidden presence of something we need to watch out for.  The alt right could be categorized as the darkness visible, or the people who lie with impunity in public and effectively erode the value of truth in society.To start off I do live in Ohio. Now that's out of the way. I won't be voting for this go around because... The conservative lineup is soul eating with overbearing talking points like the support from NRA, handjob towards Trump supporters and so on. Democrats commercial or lack thereof hasn't shown up anytime for my local news outlets. 

Plus, the ballots for summer voting has ending the District gerrymandering. I have no idea why Democrats haven't ran on this talking points of making voting system more far. It's bad enough Ohio lawmakers mostly conservatives keep bringing up voter fraud while they're guilty of voter suppression.

Once more, I am voting in the Fall. That's where the issues will be shown more of to the public. Personally, the Summer voting isn't really important to me. The lack of communication on the issues and the overflow of far right lobbyist. I kid you not. All of Republicans commercials are back to back showing time. Repeating what the other person just said 15 seconds ago.

Many people forget that Bill Clinton originally ran to the left of Jimmy Carter on promises to expand government, restore unions and implement 1970s progressive taxation. Unfortunately, Reagan had done so much damage that he had to end up turning to banks for funding and had to move to the center and work with Republicans after they took control of congress in 1994. Remember that he never had a 1970s Congress of liberals like Nixon did and Clinton on ideological scoring was actually to the left of Nixon. He did accomplish raising taxes on the wealthy and putting extremely liberal justices onto the Supreme Court as well as doubling federal funding education funding, lowering interest rates and subsidizing mortgages to help middle class families buy and afford homes, as well as other measures such as increasing the minimum wage by a large margin which Reagan froze while in office. I hold that with a union movement like the 30s and an environmental and feminist movement like the 70s, as well as an anti-war movement and pro-drug movement, we could move congress and a hypothetical President Hillary Clinton to the left of FDR or JFK (JFK was more liberal than LBJ who was more liberal than Truman who was more liberal than FDR)The downside to the Iran deal is that Iran’s economy is boosted and allows them to further fund terrorism and opposition forces to America around the world.
If Iran stays in the deal because the other countries stay in the deal, but we get to put sanctions on them, it could turn out being good for us.
Sanctions on Iran + Iran deal &gt; Iran deal + no sanctions on Iran[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzPoDCmYmwI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzPoDCmYmwI)

He's pretty heavy into UBI as one of his central policy goals and I think David could have a great and enjoyable talk with him.  Also, this could probably go even longer than 20 minutes so feel free to go an hour.  It would also be interesting seeing a debate between a jobs guarantee advocate and a basic income advocate.Residents of the nearest large city to my locale who voted for Trump were recently interviewed by a CNN correspondent. Most said they were happy with his tactics and said they'd vote for him again. One woman said that his unpredictability is a good thing and that the best defense is not knowing what the offense is doing.(?) WTF?I see no point of forcing business to employ and serve everyone. They should be able to say “hey you’re black or hey you’re wearing a hat so therefore we won’t serve”. What’s the point of bringing a lawsuit against a scummy human being to serve you or employee just go to another store. At the end of the day many western countries have become more tolerant and instances of discrimination aren’t as prevalent as they were decades ago. The most effective way of dealing with discrimination in the private sector is through boycotts as at the end of the day the free market only cares about the colour green https://youtu.be/cE20zxOi3gY
If you look at the footage carefully, the cop originally has him with his back to him (the cop) and is trying to handcuff him. He resists and turns to the cop, the cop then grabs his throat as he is engaging the cop and resisting arrest. Cops are allowed to use force when you resist arrest. He may have been a racist though, I don’t know. Anyone want to try to change my mind on this one, it’s the first time I haven’t sided with BLM.I think it’s laughable how a bunch of rich, upper class people are whining &amp; bitching about being ‘silenced’ &amp; ‘oppressed’ whilst raking in thousands &amp; thousands of dollars on Patreon a month. (Some of these IDW folks make more on Patreon a month than most people make in a year) Also for people that are supposedly the “Modern Day Galileos” they sure as hell are getting a lot of air time &amp; print time than most folks.

I personally think that this moronic, cringeworthy IDW idea is nothing more than a repackaging of white, conservative grievances (in the case of Peterson, Shapiro, Douglas Murray &amp; Rubin) and their disgruntled liberal allies such as Sam Harris, Weinstein brothers etc. The truth of the matter is that for a supposed group of free thinkers these people spend an ‘inordinate’ amount of time going after SJW’s, identity politics whilst totally ignoring the threats to freedom of speech, press freedom &amp; other authoritarian policies being espoused by the Republicans &amp; Trump as well as sinister far-right figures such as Victor Orban in Hungary, the Christian extremist Polish government, the National Front in France etc.

The only person who has even remotely criticised Trump here is Sam Harris but even he appears far more cosy sucking upto the right &amp; funding brain dead, partisan hacks like Dave Rubin rather than offering any serious critiques of actual regressive Republican policies or Trump appointees such as Gina Haspel, John Bolton or Jeff Sessions etc. It’s a cringefest folks, and these IDW folks are coming across exactly as those whiny, ‘liberal’ ‘snowflake’ college kids! 

Former Waking Up guest Zeynep Tufekci offers a stinging rebuke here on this Twitter thread!

https://mobile.twitter.com/zeynep/status/994218981912391680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fposteverything%2Fwp%2F2018%2F05%2F11%2Fthe-ideas-industry-meets-the-intellectual-dark-web%2F&amp;tfw_creator=dandrezner&amp;tfw_site=WashingtonPostWe took out Saddam’s government in about three weeks and his military was superior to Iran. This is inevitable. They are Islamic fundamentalists who in their constitution specify to spread Islam through violence. They are NOT rational actors. If they ever move towards a bomb, we will have to flatten them off of the face of the earth. These are not people that you can negotiate peace with. A large portion of them would kill every one of us if they had the chance. They are our enemy and we need to view the fight against Iran just like the fight against Hitler in World War II. That is all. Good day.How is it a good thing for America to have the Iranian government in existence. They hate America. I love America and want only the best for our nation. Our greatest prosperity was post-WW2 when we lead the world and controlled many countries. Why can’t we go back to what Harry Truman envisioned? These barbaric and totalitarian countries must be overthrown. Not only can we help America, but we can help the people that live under these despots.
http://freebeacon.com/national-security/white-house-examining-plan-spark-regime-change-iran/there's alot of them on secular talks channelYes, they are hypocrites for not acknowledging that many of our fellow Americans ancestors did not assimilate quickly or learn the language. HOWEVER, immigrants SHOULD assimilate and learn the language. It is mutually beneficial for immigrants to learn English. It is not our responsibility to accommodate them. John Kelly’s ancestors should have learned English. Also, a reminder to those of you on the left that we should run campaigns threatening to enforce immigration laws against employers who hire illegal immigrants. Reagan stopped enforcing immigration laws against employers and busted up the meat packing and construction industries unions with illegal labor offering to work for less. It’s a real problem. For the question of “who would do the jobs illegal immigrants do if we deport them” the answer is that Americans will, but employers will have to raise the wage they are offering. This is simple supply and demand. Big businesses bring in illegal immigrants and don’t want them to assimilate or learn the language to be able to exploit them and pay them the lowest wage possible. I have a lot of thoughts about this, and have had little time to put pen to paper on them.  So, for now, I borrow words from a friend to help explain how i feel about the shit show that has been Israel lately.

##What I know I know:

- Death is tragic. The loss of a life is the loss of a world, and we've seen too many die in the past week.

- Israelis have a legitimate fear that Gazans who force their way into Israel could/would hurt Israeli citizens

- The citizens of Gaza have legitimate fear, anger, and pain, caused by a combination of Israeli government/military policy and the actions of their own leaders

- Live ammo fire should be a last resort, not a first choice

- Both Israel and Palestine are not monoliths, there are people of good conscience in both communities who desperately want a lasting peace and are willing to work towards it.

- I know that I don't know everything

##What I know I think:

- I know I think that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.

- I know I think that the decision to move the US Embassy there was handled incorrectly

- I know I think that Israel desperately needs a new Prime Minister

- I know I think the Palestinians desperately need new leadership that will work for the good of its people

- I know I think Israel's attempts to suppress free speech and reporting on what is happening in Gaza are wrong

- I know I think there are people who should be alive today who aren't.

##What I think I know:

- I think I know that some of those killed by the IDF were members of Hamas.

- I think I know that some were not.

- I think I know how to navigate all of the competing claims I'm reading in news articles—from sources that vary in reliability—rocketing across my news feed, but in truth I'm not sure.

- That this isn't going to get easier any time soon, but I hope I'm wrong.

##What I know I don't know:

- How it feels to be 19 and sitting on my country's border, tasked with defending its citizens facing tens of thousands of protestors.

- How it feels to be living a life of desperation, one without hope, one that would drive me to risk my life marching towards a fence that keeps me in, that keeps me out.

- What I should be doing about all of this, but I'm open to suggestion.

- How the leaders of Hamas and of Israel's government can both be so stubborn that they would rather see people die than work towards a just peace.

##What I don't know I don't know:

- Too much to comprehendIt gives them an edge on the general population, but makes them more aggressive, impulsive, and obviously bigger and stronger.
Link is in a comment below.In this report David said some Dems exchanged support for Harper with Republicans for support of this report. He said it was just rumor. But if an exchange is proven true this investigation has no credibility. Also, is Russian collusion more effective than all the foreign agents that contributed to the Clinton foundation? Is it more influential than English company Cambridge Analytical interference.


https://youtu.be/1fiokit1TpARobert Wright recently wrote a brilliant article on Sam Harris, taking him apart on his claims that he has transcended tribalism. It’s a MuST READ especially for Sam Harris fan boys; as a former fan myself, I’ve become quite disillusioned at Harris’ conduct recently, his continual verbal &amp; financial support for terrible shows like Rubin Report &amp; the automatic dismissal of all critics as ‘dishonest’!

Here’s the link to the article below.

https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.wired.com/story/sam-harris-and-the-myth-of-perfectly-rational-thought/amp

So David, please bring him on for a discussion regarding this article mate. It will be fascinating.

https://www.google.com/amp/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/04/70-years-after-hiroshima-opinions-have-shifted-on-use-of-atomic-bomb/%3famp=1
If you think the bombing of Hiroshima was justified you most likely are a neocon deep down. It was justified by my view because the Japanese people had no word for surrender, they thought their leader was a god and a land invasion would have led to the annihilation and complete genocide of the Japanese people. It saved lives and ended the war. Not to mention that it saved millions of American lives.David seems to do a lot of cryptocurrency-related interviews lately and many of his sponsors appear to the cryptocurrency companies.

What's the deal? 

Also, how can David continue to shill for crypto when Coinbase recently shafted him? Doesn't that whole fiasco prove how undependable crypto is? A real bank would have reimbursed you with little quibbling. Do you know why? Regulation!Seriously! What is "the Left"? I know what a leftist is. But what is "the Left"? Is it a political party? How does one join? What are its rules and policies? Who are its leaders? Is it a top-down organisation or a bottom-up organisation? I've heard people claim to have been "excommunicated" from "the Left"? How does that happen? What are the consequences of that? Can one no longer canvass for "the Left" if one if kicked out of "the Left"? Can one no longer stand for political office as a leftist? Can one no longer support leftist policies? What *is* "the Left"?Both sides are accurate in reporting why people were protesting. Some protests were from Hamas ALONGSIDE some protests from general Palestinian civilians. About 80% of those killed by Israel were Hamas/extremists, the rest are assumed to be innocent civilians protesting the embassy move. This means that Israel did overstep it’s ground and did kill innocent civilians which should be condemned, but in context that they were in proximity to others protesting with weapons and bombs.Overthrowing dictators, fighting terrorists, building coalitions for democratic governments in the Middle East, countering Iran which we are destined to eventually have to deal with (in their constitution they declare the mission to spread Islam through violence and they are a theocratic dictatorship), countering Saudi influences (overthrow of fascist Saddam Hussein, fighting al queda, fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan etc)
I don’t know how anyone that has any knowledge of the brutality of Saddam Hussein can say that Iraq is not better off today. Iraqi Kurdistan is a complete success and the rest of Iraq is heading in that direction. Saddam Hussein was alongside Mussolini and Hitler in ideology and human rights abuses. He ran Iraq as a fascistic police state and concentration camp, with all basic freedoms taken away from the people. He jailed, tortured, raped and murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people. He went to extremes of lowering children and women into vats of acid and putting hot rods into their orifices. He killed minimum 600,000 Iraqis compared to 200,000 deaths from the entire Iraq War which were largely from his forces who resisted us.
I am not alone with these views in the Democratic Party. Many Democrats have supported my views towards middle eastern foreign policy.https://youtu.be/XgFOaosuO4k
I can’t stand other liberals. If I went up to a Christian and told them I don’t like their religion and that the Bible condones genocide am I a bigot? I want everyone to convert to atheism, and especially Muslims because Islam is the worst religion in the world. Christianity has actual context to commandments of genocide, such as being specifically for Moses. Islam gives blanket instructions to get to heaven with the most rewards to kill all nonbelievers and infidels and promotes jihad. The Muslim world has never been peaceful and they have enslaved Americans in early American history and cited the Quran as evidence. Islam is a filthy religion and when a woman goes into public wearing an outfit that admits that she is part of a death cult, it is normal to want to criticize her. Islam gives a warlord as an example of their prophet while Christianity gives a peaceful hippie known as Jesus. Still, Christianity is a problem and that’s the point.They give aid and comfort to international terrorists. This is indisputable. That alone makes them lose their sovereignty just as Pakistan did by giving sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden. Also, I wouldn’t mind serving in the army. It would be an honor to fight for freedom for the Kurds, but I am working towards a career as a politician currently.I’m guessing that this will happen, but that overall it won’t be a large enough occurrence for banning people with mental issues from buying guns legally to still lower gun violence rates. Also, should banning people with mental health issues from buying guns be a priority? Mental health issues only account for 4% of gun violence. It’s mostly just a gun problem. If someone gets cut off in traffic and has road rage and also doesn’t have a gun with them, they may cut the person off, flip them off, Get them to pull over and fight them, etc. But if they have a gun with them, statistics show that increases the chance that a murder will take place. It’s indisputable. https://youtu.be/_tlIGAg1aiU
Only if you’re a racist, a conservative ideologue, ignorant, or some combination of the three can you deny white privilege. Whites with equal qualifications as blacks are hired 2:1 in the private sector. Blacks are charged more for rent and women are paid $0.94 on the dollar for the same work as a man. Discrimination is part of the free market. Solutions? Many. Greater enforcement of the fair housing act which was not enforced under Ronald Reagan and Bush Sr. and was gutted in the 1988 amendments. That’s just one example. We haven't heard from the egg man in a while, I wonder what he's been up to. Probably doing eggman type stuff. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/21/supreme-court-backs-employers-over-workers/355923002/
The right to assemble into a class action and the right to a trial are now officially banned under circumstances of if an employer gets you to sign your constitutional rights away (right to form a class action and right to a trial)If it lowers the abortion rate, I don’t see the harm from it. We should all want to lower abortions. This is coming from someone that is open to third trimester abortions in some cases.http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/saudi-funding-of-isis
It’s in both of our mutual interests to eliminate ISIS and other terror groups.
Saudis did support the Taliban directly prior to Bush’s war on the Taliban in Afghanistan.We should have taken military action against North Korea. Millions of civilian deaths would have paled in comparison to the billions of lives now at risk.Now that's Trump aka Orange scam artist gives Israel Benjamin Netanyahu a crazy right-wing extremist. The go-ahead to claim to Jerusalem as Israel's land. What could go wrong?

Anti-Israel groups like BDS will get a big push by the Scam Artist and Benjy the madman acts. The Gaza crisis is getting more complex and deadlier. Those, on the left, are showcasing the awful acts of Israel forces. I'm sickened by the acts, but I'm more sick to see the rise of hate groups towards the Jewish community. 

Before, I end this post. I know Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip are two different issues and locations, however, Trumps idiotic acts giving real hardcore scumbags like Benjy, Putin, and pretty much the Saudi Arabia kingdom to get away with awful acts of the world. 

The video that started this post. Again, I'm not saying nor calling the people behind the videos is racist or hateful towards Jewish Community.
 https://youtu.be/GaUg-f2RNZgIs anyone surprised? I mean, really?

Video for context: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4Ck1CgbrMEHi,

Just a language comment: David Pakman frequently mentions the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaia.

He pronounces her name as Veselnitskáia, with the stress on the next to last syllable. This is wrong.

The right Russian pronunciations is with the stress on the i in the middle of the word: Veselnítskaia.

Thanks for consideration! :)https://strawpoll.com/3rch956eI can't be the only one disturbed that President Trump doesn't understand some of the basics of how government works, let alone the executive branch and the DOJ. With this morning's unhinged tweet on so-called "SPYGATE" (let's call it Episode 2 in "Obama had my wires tapped") and James Comey's tweet explaining what a Confidential Human Sources are, along with a lot of other issues (details on how a bill becomes a law [beyond what we learned from School House Rock], executive privilege, cabinet nominations, what the existing immigration laws say, etc.) I think we need to tighten the qualifications on what it takes to be president.

#Here's my proposal:

Anyone who wants to run for President has to enroll in a government training course, or a super-advanced Civics course.  This way, we can still leave it open to private citizens. You learn what is legal to do in a campaign, presidential responsibilities - both macro and micro - how the Intel community is structured and how DOJ conducts different types of investigations, case studies on passing laws, etc. This would approximately be one college semester's worth of time spent on it. At the end of the course there is an exam. **Only those who pass with 75% or higher to file their candidacy with the FEC**.  People who have worked in government or have a law degree from an American institution would excel, but a capable private citizen should be able to pass at 75%.

Is it a little elitist? Maybe. But we need presidents who actually know what their doing.

Thoughts?

*I am half-joking, but we really need better qualifications than 35 years old and born here. Even Miss America contestants have more requirements just to participate.*Hey all I am looking to add some good high quality policy podcasts. I like voxs the weeds and worldly. I also have some great BBC ones. I’ll listen to either side if it has good policy at its core. Framework bias vomit ala Fox News or Huffpo does not appeal to me. I want the podcast to try and hit all of the SHIPS points ( this is a policy debate reference meaning significant, Harms, Inherent, Plan, Solvency) basically what’s the problem, why it matters, why it needs to be solved, your plan to solve it, and how it will work and why. I dislike left/right fiat bias as well. Things won’t happen because of a magic wand.To Whom it May Concern:

DALLAS, Texas -- 

THE PIANO, a fairly nice, but not too large grand, usually, I leave in the foyer of our local community college - for anyone to play, and enjoy; 

And, for those who learn that music invites all, and constrains none; Those who know the sorrow that fades, when a single note becomes sunlight, among paperback dreams, hopes and fears - if only for a while, illuminates the dark.

The work and integrity you all demonstrate in the face of what seems to be endless violence - things that from, my heart, I could not bear, were my students to leave this earth too soon, and without reason.  

Thank you for your show this week that made it clear - if anyone had doubts - this is not something we can accept. To welcome a place where we listen to ideas.

And ideas are heard. 

As you have said, getting desensitized changes many things. It also makes you learn at a young ago - even an evergreen can get sick, you'll - as lately, it seems like something, one can't help but see.  

I can only speak -and it must be said out loud- as a teacher, with the privilege to just ending it suddenly, to have students stay after, to work. It sometimes means more thawith the gravity of these times, and the responsibility of doing a job - so often repeated, but done so, with passion. 

With meaning. And care. 

A ferw months ago, not far from from teh triangle area, definaitely lots of opporutiny for houing perhaps., and all I seek for it to represent, a student, in a matter of seconds, left the day gone, shooting hi
That we are not afraid.

In an emotional response, thinking upon the conversations had between then, and now, make it feel incumbent on me, to express the professionalism, passion, and truth, refusing to concede as a people, we are powerless - your show, reminds me of that, we can fight for the future. 

In keeping on with the show, and having a genuine concern born of love, and of conviction, that reminds us and inspires the drive to do that which we have been called in life to do, aware of the dangers in the world, help with what may seem routine, and standard, for your program, many thoughts, still - that, we may be concerned, sometimes a bit anxious, and among all one could say - as I affirm - we are not afraid, and your thoughts and program helps lead this belief. 

So, thank you for avoiding the temptation of sensationalism, and, frustrated as you all may be, by many different things, humbled to have someone who has solutions. 

Having the courage as a broadcaster, to put cause, and trust, in the things you say. For whatever it may be, and however small a factor - the knowledge that, together, we must, and can fight the future - it's hard, in this reflection, not to just think of getting wrecked in a nearby bar, and surrendering to that which we must never normalize - and so that all can hear, we will never yield, not now; Not ever. 

For whatsover things you stand behind, only bolsters the network of and for the many - not the few. 

Thank you for acknowledging the stagnant figures, of our own nature, as a student asked why, I've nothing other than the hope to impact and emotions I've been thinking upon my frozen pizza - and for the things which help definte so many things -  I hope you won't either.

B.A. Mulligan, MFA MCFA ASCAPSince Republicans unanimously agreed that Clinton was evil for having a private email server (assumably because it is less efficient at providing security than the government), how long do you think it will take until Republicans officially announce their plan to privatize all government email servers? 1 year? 5 years? 10 years? It will eventually come up on their list of things to privatize.At least this is the face that the NFL owners want to present. Players who take a knee on the field during the National Anthem will be fined . But they may stay off the field(not-exist) if they don't 'feel comfortable' standing on the field. Russia comes to the U.S.. And its all neat and legal.To set the context, I describe myself as a Democratic Socialist with Socialist leanings. Unlike FDR and Bernie Sanders, who I classify as Social Democrats and to the right of my within an acceptable liberal spectrum, I am currently a Justice Democrat. I want to see the movement grow, but I want to suggest a piece of reform that needs to happen for politics to less of a constant uncertain power struggle and more orderly, principled, and procedural. I believe the only way to do this is both to set constitutional amendments defining proper campaign finance laws and for the constitution to define what a political party is, who runs them, and how they can be structured. As political parties are a reality I believe we should regulate them. These are the measures I propose with the following with the following assumptions:

1: States officials and Federal officials are elected through proportional representation. 

1A: Citizens can only participate in one party's primary.

1B: All primaries be held, for all parties, on the same day and all the party primaries be on one voting pamphlet which is delivered to people's housing with physical voting centers as a backup for those without stable housing. 

1C: No voting ID laws can be used to deny the vote. 

1D: All primaries are open

2: A political party must include enough members to receive 1% of the possible seats open. No lone wolves.

3: Every party must hold an open primary system which is based on ranked choice voting. 

4: Once candidates have been voted in through ranked choice voting, parties can not kick out candidates who have won the process due to differences.

5: All political parties must hold marketing/public events to let everyone who is attempting to run in a party have time on "the stage". Party's are not able to shun candidates/not give them a chance to speak. 

6: Once the primary votes have been received, the party must create an official platform through combined input from all members. 

6A: The candidates must agree with a 51% majority on the party's leader. The party leader is the person who controls how party funds are spent. The party leader can establish any kind of party structure they wish, as long as it doesn't break any rules in this post. The party leader is also in charge of the priority list, similar to a batting order of which politicians get to go depending on how what percentage of the vote they receive. The party leader can also eject members of the party from their elected office if they are not following the unified platform which was agreed upon and marketed to the public. 

6B: The party must agree with a 51% majority on a unified platform. If members of the party are not willing to pass the 51% unified platform the party leader can remove that individual from the lineup and replace them with his/her choice of candidate, not excluded to people who participated in the primary. 

6C: Once a unified platform, a party structure has been created, and the party leader has been chosen the party campaigns... once the election is over the party assesses the results. The party leader appoints members of the party to elected positions based on how many possible seats they won. Members of the party who did not get "sent up" have 60 days to form a 51% majority in order to remove the current party leader from office and call for a new party officer election. If this doesn't happen, the original party leader retains power and only members who are in elected positions may vote on upcoming party matters. 

The federal government under new amendments would have to give each party enough money to run for every position available. All candidates running for a particular position would be awarded the same amount of money. EX: all Senators get the same amount of money, all Governors get the same amount of money, etc. 

Different classes of politicians do not require the same funds. 

These are some of my ideas, what do you guys think. Let me know. 

I figure this would be useful to this sub when trying to detox from the shitshow that is Trump and American politics.

Hitler/Nazis were atheists was Cold War propaganda that was debunked during the age of new atheism post-9/11 and he’s now bringing it back to lie and smear all atheists. It’s no surprise that he would use Cold War propaganda on atheists, he himself is still a cold warrior, only that he sees conspiracies of “neo-Marxists” all around us.

Cutting spending means you don’t spend those dollars, but you also don’t get tax revenue from the force multiplier that those dollars produce in the economy, reducing GDP as well.
Inequality directly takes money from consumers and is not invested unless there is an increase in aggregate demand. Obviously with inequality increasing, that means there is a shift for the wealthy/supply side to have more capital. It’s not invested because there is no increase in demand. Capitalists will not create additional products that they can’t sell because they have the money, nor will they hire people that they can’t use to meet consumer demand.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/georgia-primary-stacey-abrams-hillary-clinton-trump-stacey-evans-us-governor-democrats-a8363501.html
I think that Hillary really thought that Bernie would have handed the country to Trump and that she had the best shot just as Bill running as a centrist in ‘92 was the best thing for the country. She has always been a lot more progressive than her husband and got him to block some banking deregulation as president, end Reagan-Bush era austerity, double federal education spending, increase the minimum wage, increase union protections and put liberal justices on our courts. I don’t think she’s the enemy you guys all think and I know that she loves the work that President Johnson did.https://www.vox.com/2018/5/25/17394466/john-mccain-memoir-iraq-war-mistake

Kneeling is a respectful act.  We kneel at church out of respect. Soldier's kneel at funerals for soldiers to show respect.  When the heck in human history has kneeling been a sign of disrespect? NEVER!

In fact kneeling is a bigger sign of respect then standing.  Americans might prefer to stand because so many of us are too out of shape to kneel.Especially conservative/libertarian rich people.

I got the idea after thinking over some of the alternative ideas to a UBI one of the critics in this debate brought up.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v\-JBkxDYx84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-JBkxDYx84)

The conservative guy on the right was anti UBI, and wanted more voluntary taxes \(I know, not looking promising\)  But one of his throw away points was trying to raise taxes on the rich, but allowing them to direct where some of it went, like say poverty alleviation.

Instead of that, why not have a sliding scale of tax rates?  The more inequality in society, the higher the taxes on the wealthy.  If inequality goes lower, then taxes on the high end go lower as well.  If this was the way to get taxes lower, maybe then we would have more wealthier people aligning their personal interests with the interests of the poor and lower middle class.   It would be in their interest for more people on the lower end to do better economically, and have more personal wealth.

https://www.meforum.org/articles/2006/cair-islamists-fooling-the-establishmentFound this interesting blog post that explains the reasoning behind this strategy. thought some of you might find it interesting


The recent displacement of civilians and rebel fighters from the Damascus suburb of Eastern Ghouta signals an important victory for the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In the face of these successes, it is worth remembering that the imminent downfall of Assad’s regime was proclaimed several times since the onset of violence in Syria in late 2011. Each time, Assad defied such predictions. How has his government, which several times looked so close to being toppled, weakened its rivals and ensured its continuity?

In a new article, we argue that a crucial component of the Assad regime’s wartime success has been its strategic use of aerial bombardment. Bolstered by its allies, especially Russia, the Assad regime has consistently targeted public infrastructures in opposition-held areas, including bakeries, hospitals, markets and schools. Media outlets, policy experts and international aid organizations have written about the humanitarian and military dimensions of such raids at great length. Yet they overlook the key political logic underpinning these systematic attacks.

**Disrupting opposition governance**

Our findings suggest that regime concerns with rebel governance, rather than military calculations or sectarian motivation, best explain the Assad regime’s targeted bombardment of opposition-held areas. It also helps us understand the regime’s ongoing success in the war.

From 2013 to 2016, we conducted more than 100 interviews with civilians, activists, journalists and aid workers to explore how the regime’s aerial bombardment campaigns affected various rebel groups’ attempts to govern. We found that during the conflict, carrying out basic statelike functions, from mediation to education — what we term “performing the state” — has been one of the most important governing strategies undertaken by rebel groups. At the same time, the Assad regime actively targets these institutions and services to undermine and defeat rebels that seek its downfall.

State performances by opposition forces make political authority tangible, perceptible and concrete to local residents. During the war, rebel groups have established checkpoints that control the movement of people and goods, taxed local businesses, founded courts to resolve local disputes, coordinated agricultural production and organized schooling. In contexts where sovereignty is so hotly contested, such actions can help legitimize opposition actors. When executed successfully, they demonstrate an ability to govern proficiently and allow residents to consider an alternative to the Assad regime.

**Why rebels provide welfare**

Throughout the Syrian civil war, rebel attempts to perform the state have been frequent, deliberate and purposeful. One of the most important of these everyday practices has been the provision of welfare. In addition to aiding the livelihoods of local residents, service provision works to build community by signaling membership in a polity.

Welfare in Syria has an especially strong association with the state because of the Assad regime’s interventionist development model. Beginning in the 1970s, the Syrian government provided its citizens various forms of social welfare, including free health care, education, subsidized food and utilities. This was part of a tacit social pact in which public goods were provided in exchange for political compliance. The legacy of this unstated agreement remains potent to this day.

    ”State performances by opposition forces make political authority tangible, perceptible and concrete to local residents.”

Rebel efforts to provide bread and medical support — two services that have strong symbolic resonances in Syria and were frequently mentioned in the interviews we conducted — in opposition-controlled areas are hardly surprising. In the province of Idlib, they remain a crucial terrain for producing legitimacy and popular support for rebel groups to this day.

Conversely, the Assad regime has sought to disrupt these performances. By systematically annihilating the administrative institutions and public services that shape rebel-civilian relations, the Assad regime has delegitimized its competitors and prevented the emergence of coherent alternatives. Targeted aerial bombardment is especially effective in this respect. It works by not only inflicting military, financial and psychological damage but also interrupting and undermining everyday practices through which rebels generate local support and consolidate their rule.

Over the past three years, this tactic has allowed government forces to consolidate their control over strategic areas, while displacing local populations and concentrating opposition forces in designated towns and provinces. Most important, it has prevented the stability required to build alternatives to its governing institutions.

I can't find any such reports. Perhaps I'm not looking hard enough. So, could someone help me out here?

Context: Russian war journalist and prominent Kremlin critic Arkady Babchenko has been shot dead in his home in Kiev, police said on Tuesday, making him the latest in a string of Russian dissidents to be murdered in Ukraine. I don't think The Intercept reported on any of the others in the string of murdered dissidents.https://www.defensenews.com/flashpoints/2018/05/29/poland-offers-up-to-2-billion-for-a-permanent-us-military-presence/These are some of the main differences:
1) There was and is mass Iraqi support for our invasion and overthrow of the Hussein regime. In Vietnam, there was mass support for Ho Chi Minh.
2) We liberated the Iraqi people from human rights abuses. In Vietnam, we imposed human rights abuses on the Vietnamese people.

Why is nobody covering the insane FOX News interview with Trey Gowdy yesterday?  He dismissed Spygate, demolished Giuliani, said he would never be Trump's lawyer, and said Trump should sit with Mueller for an interview, much to the obvious shock and confusion of the blonde host.  By the way, I can't say what is more precious, the interview itself or the FN viewer comments (Gowdy is Deep State now!! etc.).  Incidentally I think Gowdy should be explored as a whole sometime.  He is an enigma, swings wildly pro- and anti-Trump, even within the subject of the investigation, and it's fucking fascinating.   So is his look by the way.  Am I seriously the only one noticing his boy-man face and hair, his pale shininess and the way his weight appears to fluctuate overnight (presumably depending on whether he's able to get blood feedings)?  He also looks like the human version of that freakish, champaigne-colored "most beautiful horse in the world" (google it, though I'm sure Bronies are already with me on that).  And by the way I am reluctantly hot for him, especially after this latest interview, will probably have a fucked up sex dream about him in the very near future.﻿https://youtu.be/-hO6rLXx1L4So turns out the FBI had an informant not a spy in the Trump campaign. So the scandal can’t be dismissed. Also, the guy allegedly spied on the Carter campaign. So let’s not get too condescending to those of us that want to know more.

I have something better though.  I happened upon this tune some time ago, I have no idea what is being said because the lyrics are in spanish \(or maybe Portuguese?\).

Please check it out and comment below. Robert Spencer is a fantastic author, he has written several books about Islam, is fluent in Arabic and is an intellectual scholar. Because literally every god damn time some right winger says or does something homophobic, a sea of straight liberals come out of the wood work to tell us that he's definetely not a straight guy. they literally just use homophobia as evidence that a guy isn't straight, even though homophobia among straight men is extremely common, and even more common among religious extremists, which the GOP is, but it seems as if straight liberals are incapable of comprehending the idea of a 59 year old religious extremist(Pence, but this can apply to literally any anti gay bigot that gets media attention, because for some strange fucking reason straight left wingers think every single one of them is a gay guy) that hates gay people. and it gets worse as well, look at the comments on news articles about hate crimes against gay men, again it's filled with straight people that saying that it must have been gay men who commited the hate crime against the gay guys, it's fucking sickening, STOP BLAMING US FOR HOMOPHOBIA ALL THE GOD DAMN TIME.

I'll give you a particularly vile instance of this. Hassan Piker on TYT when they were doing a video on Kaydrov in Chechnya torturing and murdering gay men, suggested that he's probably a gay guy, because apparently it's hard to believe that a war criminal muslim extremist who is responsible for atrocity after atrocity would want to kill gay men? are ISIS just a bunch of gay guys aswell? was the entire fucking world gay until a few decades ago or something? cause straight liberals seem to think anti gay bigotry and anti gay bigotry alone is very good evidence a guy is gay(it's not) but they never seem to mention the fact that a huge percentage of the world is bigoted as fuck against us.

so, to sum up

1. being homophobic IS NOT EVIDENCE a guy is gay. it's actually much, much, much better evidence that they're a homophobic straight guy, but straight left wingers never mention this, they literally never assume a guy is straight because he's a anti gay bigot, which is pretty disturbing considering the fact that pretty much all homophobic bigot men are straight guys(other than a tiny, miniscule minority)
2.responding to every instance of anti gay bigotry you see by going "must be a gay guy, lol" is victim blaming. yous are literally blaming us for the bigotryv against ourselves, please stop it. it is vile and infuriating, and many of us are really, really getting sick of it
3. Mike Pence is a straight guy that hates gay people because he's a disgusting religious extremist, there is literally not a shred of evidence that he is a gay man(mountains of evidence that he's a straight guy though), so it would be nice if straight liberals stopped pretending he must be one of us because he hates us
4. next time you see bigotry against us, gay men, try something novel, try assuming that gay men aren't the ones responsible for the homophobia you're talking about(fucking crazy idea, right, imagine that, assuming that anti gay bigotry isn't coming from gay men, how mad)

The sad thing Is I know for a fact that what I've just said is going to be completely ignored, because whenever we gay people try and speak up against this victim blaming narrative that sooooooooooooooooo many straight people are so fond of, we get shouted down and talked over. people always go "but, but, but the studies" even though the studies people are talking about aren't anywhere close to a justification for assuming men are gay guys becasue they hate gay people. the studies literally show that the vast majority of anti gay bigots are straight, but for some reason people pretend those studies are a reason to assume, based on nothing, that every anti gay bigot is a gay guy. the studies people cite as justification for blaming us for ay instance of anti gay bigotry actually show the opposite of what people claim it does, they show that homophobia is much better evidence a guy is straight than gay, and again homophobia isn't evidence a guy is gay in any way(it's vile that gay men are now forced to come out and tell "allies" that hating us isn't evidence someone is one of us, such a sick state of affairs to be in)

and yes, I'am angry in case you didn't notice. many of us in the gay community are extremely angry at this behavior, but ebery time we try and get straight liberals to stop all the homohobia on us, we get talked over and shouted down. there seems to be zero pateince from straight liberals for gay guys that don't tow the line on this, becasue I've had many instances of trying to get people to stop this and the responses have been depressing as fuck, including accusations against me that I'm a right winger, and that I'm "defending" these politicians. becasue apparently an insane number of straight left wingers think me telling them that a homophobic straight guy isn't a gay guy is somehow defending the homophobic guy. if they think me saying that some guy they're calling gay isn't gay is defending them, then it seems pretty obvious they think it's an insult/are using it as an insult in literally the exact same way homophobes do

rant over[Trump destroying Social Security](https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/01/social-security-faces-death-by-a-thousand-service-cuts.html)[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/24/democrats-losing-millennial-vote-change-message](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/24/democrats-losing-millennial-vote-change-message)

A Higher percentage of white male millennials support Trump than oppose him according to that recent data, and even before that it was split.  White millennial women are less supportive, but still more supportive than non white women.

What is going on here?  It got me thinking about other trends.  Are cities more liberal because there are cities, or because a smaller percentage of white people make up the total population in many cities?

Even in a place like Los Angeles, which is heavily liberal, where democrat registration is almost 4 times that of republicans, I wonder if the reason it's so liberal is because only a third of the city is white...

52&amp;#37; of la county is white, no doubt because with white flight many wanted to get away from the non whites moving in.  And I'm sure because many areas are higher end and tilt towards a more college educated crowd, that tilts the white population more liberal, but there seems to just be a heavy racial component to political party now, where you are more likely to be much more shifted to republicans if white (even with millennials !!!!!!), and more shifted to the democratic part if not white.

I suppose that could be because of the dominant culture feeling a sense of nativism that does exist for non white groups, there can't be a sense of "losing ground" since non whites were never the dominant population to begin with, and the rest kind of had to make more peace with a cosmopolitan society.  

Someone please talk me off the ledge.  It's depressing to see millennial white males suckered into Trump support, or having some innate draw to it.  And maybe it's more regional where since more of the white population is weighted towards the rural areas and exurbs and suburbs rather than city centers, that bathes more of them in a different culture.

[https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/](https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/)I see that many folks in left and democratic party going with "Abolish ICE".

I understand the nuance in their argument. They want to stop the inhuman arrests/raids of undocumented immigrants..even if they are not violent-criminals.

But the POTUS and the right-wing fear-mongers are going to SELL this as "OPEN BORDERS" and try to motivate their base.

I think we should name the movement as "REFORM ICE" (or something better) which is *marketable to moderate americans who want law and order*

Edit: Thanks to u/tugeagon, we got a better one **"Repeal and Replace ICE**" is catchy and works better as slogan !! Need a way to viral this via social media (youtube, twitter).

The **"REPEAL and REPLACE ICE"** is a better slogan to get moderate american votes in the upcoming elections (Abolish ICE is going to scare moderates and let GOP attack Dems as supporters of Open-borders.). Thanks to u/tugeagon for the new slogan.

Note: Since reddit does not allow editing of the post-title, I am forced to create a new post. If there is better mechanism to do the same, please let me knowHe is supposed to be on the left, but more often than not he has that sort of Jimmy Dore / Glenn Greenwald vibe where he goes out of his way to downplay Russia ever being anything to worry about, and when a democrat criticizes some Trump policy he might jump in talking about how Obama did X, so was that still ok?  It just seems like he is some sort of undercover right winger trying to undermine left wing narratives from within.

Also, I heard him on that libertarian podcast, the fifth column, and most of what he said was annoying as fuck and just seemed to downplay issues with Trump MORE than the actual fucking libertarians on the show... or will the corporate neoliberal Democrats simply concede the floor, and allow Social Democrats or even Democratic Socialists to become the mainstream force in the power? , .. and will there be an exodus of Center-Right Democrats from the Democratic Party in the years to come?[https://youtu.be/Nr\_uw3SmXuU](https://youtu.be/Nr_uw3SmXuU)Immediate disclosure: I'm a woman who had an abortion as a senior in high school and have always known it was the right decision.  I now have a 12-year-old daughter.  We live in Alabama, where I've observed her getting absolutely zero the sex ed in public school that I got growing up in Iowa (and yes I STILL got pregnant, and Chlamydia as well).   I live in one of the mere two cities in Alabama with a Planned Parenthood clinic, I know there are states with only one, and I know that the Supreme Court could at any time return abortion legality to those states, instantly making unwanted pregnancies a dire problem for any women or girls in those states if they don't have the resources to travel to still-legal states, or do so as discreetly as they might for a shorter trip.  My question is whether the GOP leadership really wants to see this scenario unfold as their constituents do, and also whether we progressives might consider the scenario a worthwhile sacrifice.  
I explore the considerations more fully in the first reply below.  Here I just hoped to grab your attention by offering the fairly rare opportunity to talk to a woman who openly "admits" to having had and abortion and STD, and hope you can understand why everything about my life is a testament to understanding the issue deeply.

just wanted to throw my 2 cents out on the sub because this sub needs more activity!

my native korean girlfriend in college once asked me if we could go to disneyland or world- it didn't matter (we went to college in milwaukee, WI). she didn't realize just how far away florida was, and how even further away california was in relation to frickin' wisconsin, and i had to explain that florida was at LEAST a 19 hour non-stop, no-sleep drive going like 90mph (i know this because we did that drive once in high school for spring break to gulf shores, AL before katrina wiped it off the map- so basically the panhandle).

i'd also mention that many americans have never even traveled their entire state, let alone even a *portion* of any region of the US.

conversely, if i ever went to europe i think it would be a total mindfuck that some countries are something that can be done by train in easily less than a day.

jus' sayin'.I've seen it with my own eyes on facebook, people I know sharing loony far right trash as if they think it's legit, and they never seemed out of the ordinary but then you see them sharing propaganda memes(literally) and thinking the shit the meme is saying is actually true. it's a very worrying trendI don't know why I even paid any attention to this, but I did, and I am sorry for dragging you people into this, if you would have been otherwise unaware. I truly am. But, this is the guy whose show David is desperate to go on! This guy, Joe "the spineless" Rogan.

So, Alex Jones did a 30-minutes-plus video laying into Joe. Calling him a sellout. Basically discrediting. [See for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXQHx4hA6YI). So, how does Joe respond? He adopts a cowed, apologetic tone. Almost apologising for disagreeing with Alex on issues like whether Sandy Hook was staged, punctuating his sentences with "I love the guy". What a tool! I honestly don't know what people see in him. [Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOQCK28IpJY), in which Joe cucks for Alex after the latter bends him over a barrel. 

Good grief, man. Grow a spine and some balls!I've got a redditor here telling me that socialism is not an ideology, but an economic theory. 

What is an ideology?

Ideology refers, in a general sense, to a system of political ideas. An ideology means simply a set of political beliefs about how society ought to be and how to improve it. 

Does socialism meet the criteria in the definition above? Of course! Without a doubt! So how is it that this redditor can claim that socialism is not an ideology? Does he or she simply not know what ideology means? Perhaps he or she simply does not know what socialism is? 

What is an economic theory?

To start with, we need to define "economics". What is economics? Well, economics is a social science. What is social science? Social science is the branch of science that studies society and the relationships of individuals within a society. Besides economics, psychology, sociology and political science are also social sciences, as are important elements of history and geography. 

Economics, as the name suggests, studies the economic behaviour of both individuals and groups of people, and the economic relationships between individuals and groups. For example, demand theory. Demand theory addresses consumer behaviour, or how we behave when we go shopping. Why, for example, do people generally buy more strawberries as the price of strawberries falls?

Now that we have answered the "economic" part of the question "What is an economic theory?", we need to answer the question "What is a theory?"

Scientists start off by observing some aspect of the universe (in the natural sciences), or some aspect of human behaviour, in the case of the social sciences. In the case of demand theory, the starting-off point is observations of how individual consumers react to changes in the prices of the goods and services they buy. Demand theory then develops from the making of a tentative description, known as a hypothesis, of what has been observed. Predictions about human behaviour are deduced from the hypothesis, such as that an individual will always respond to a lower price by demanding more of the good in question. This prediction is then tested against collected evidence about how individuals behave in the market place. top). At this stage, the hypothesis becomes a theory. (The difference between the two is that whereas a hypothesis is a proposed explanation for something, a theory is when a hypothesis is tested and survives the test.) The process just outlined is what is known as "the Scientific Method". 

To summarise then, an economic theory is a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain the economic behaviour of both individuals and groups of people, and the economic relationships between individuals and groups.

Come to think of it, having said that last part, I don't even think the redditor who thinks socialism is an economic theory knows what a theory is. 

In any case, apart from Marxism, socialism, as a set of ideas does not intend to explain the economic behaviour of both individuals and groups of people, and the economic relationships between individuals and groups. Rather it posits how economic behaviour of both individuals and groups of people, and the economic relationships between individuals and groups should be arranged.

Am I wrong? Is our friend who thinks socialism is not an ideology, but an economic theory right? 

Ever since the first tax cut, I felt that the recession will come sooner than later. I have heard news that the next recession will come in late 2019 to mid 2020. I feel that it won't happen this year.

The GOP will try to pass the second tax cut for the corporates. The last recession happened before the Summer Olympics and caused Obama to win. I feel that when the next recessions happen, Trump and the GOP will deny causing it and will scapegoat. By then, people will be upset of them and will be energized to vote him out.I believe it's real and I believe human affairs are exacerbating it and can alleviate some of its impact. But why should I care? I don't plan on having kids. And even if I did have kids, and they have kids, and those kids have kids and so on, am I duty-bound to those kids? Can present generations  be  duty-bound  because  of  considerations  of  justice  to  future  people? If present generations can be duty-bound to future people, can future people be duty-bound to past people? Do future generations owe us a duty?

Note: I know some of you will be tempted to go "REEEEE!", but before you do, consider this: can you actually answer the question(s) posed? If you can, I suggest you skip the "REEEE!" stage and go to the part where you make a cogent argument for why I should care about future generations.So if Kavanaugh is approved impeachment is near impossible. What is Plan B? Dems still will not support populist candidates. What else do you guys have?Since RoeVWade has become talk of the town..i see many pro-choice advocates/politicians using the following argument

\- Govt should not control women's control over their body.

It's a decent legal argument, but it does address the morality based argument from pro-life groups.

# Here is my argument to rebut the morality outrage from the right...

\- All around the world, the most supreme/divine love is the MOTHERLY LOVE from another to a baby. This is a  well known fact in the entire world, even though it's not expressed explicitly in Western media or western culture. No mothers would deny this fact.

\- So If a mother decides to abort, it certainly means that mother is **NOT PHYSICALLY/EMOTIONALLY** feeling the life-of-her-baby yet. If she feels it, she would not abort the baby; except if the baby was result of illegitimate intercourse.

Share your thoughts on this argument !! Atleast it will help sensible folks on the right-wing to understand abortion...rather than equate it to killing-of-unborn-babies.

PS: even though i am pro-choice, i think abortion should not be allowed after 3 or 4 months of pregnancy (unless it's health emergency for mom or the kid).I've said this in several threads today. There's a lot of eyes on the three Democrats who voted to confirm Gorsuch right now with pressure to get them to vote no.  Since Gorsuch was confirmed, I moved to Indiana and am now a constituent of one of those three Democrats. Let me tell you, Donnelly is facing a tough race here. If he votes against Kavanaugh in October on the grounds of social issues (abortion, affirmative action, voting rights) - as much an advocate as I am for those things, and I will vote for him regardless - *he will lose*.

So back to my thesis: as a matter of strategy, *do we really want to make this an election issue*? I am asking because we faced almost the same exact situation in 2016, and clearly conservatives were more motivated by the opportunity to shape the courts than liberals and progressives. So, as I see it, putting off confirming Kavanaugh until after the midterms may actually energize the conservative base again, especially if we continue Democratic party infighting regarding the direction of the party until then (as I've also said before, I think we need to run candidates that fit the district rather than go for a one-size-fits-all approach). Part of it is on us to get out the vote, but Senate Democrats stand more to lose than to gain this fall.

Sorry if I seem a bit defeatist on this. I want Kavanaugh blocked, full-stop. But I also don't want us to lose the opportunity to flip the Senate in the process.This post is in response to Pakman's recent video "Breaking: Trump made "Deal" for SCOTUS Retirement". David Pakman seems to be outraged that Trump made a deal with with Kennedy to secure his retirement. Kennedy wanted to make sure he was replaced by someone of similar beliefs. Trump, as president, wants to take the opportunity now before he possibly loses the senate to influence the supreme court as much as he can. To which I say, is the correct strategy for any ambitious president. Possibly not principled or nice, but if you have the opportunity to secure the future of the supreme court, go for it. I don't agree with the pick Trump made, but I accept he is playing the political game well by securing Kennedy's retirement and replacement. I wish Obama had been able to strike a similar deal with Ruth Bater Ginsberg so that she doesn't retire or die during Trump's term. 

If you want to say this process is unprincipled, I understand however I don't believe this is any worse than most political deals. Am I missing something, let me know in the comment sectionOpponents of civility do not understand it. Civility is not niceness or etiquette or deference or loving your enemies. It is only the most formal form of politeness. It calls for treating others as your equals when you think they are not. It is loved by diplomats and hated by people who love war. Its purpose is not to prevent hard discussions—it’s to enable them.

Historically, the left and right embraced civility for one reason: it's effective. The civil rights workers of the '50s and '60s were always civil when they engaged in civil disobedience because they knew three things the modern left has forgotten:

1. Civility lets you speak with the people you need to convince. Martin Luther King said, "We will not obey unjust laws or submit to unjust practices. We will do this peacefully, openly, cheerfully because our aim is to persuade."
2. Civility makes your side look good and the other bad. The heroes of the civil rights movement did [workshops before engaging in civil disobedience](https://books.google.com/books?id=HU8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT31&amp;lpg=PT31&amp;dq=The+key+to+the+sit-in+is+non-violence,+but+it+takes+a+tough+inner+fiber+neither+to+flinch+nor+retaliate+when,+occasionally,+hooligans+pick+on+the+sitters-in+to+discourage+them+or+provoke+them+into+some+violent+act.+Fearing+the+stress+on+sensibilities+and+temper+to+which+a+sit-in+could+be+subjected,+the+high+school+and+college+students+of+Petersburg,+Va.+studied+at+a+unique+but+punishing+extracurricular+school+before+they+attempted+sitting-in.+In+the+course,+which+they+ironically+call+%22social+drama,%22+student+are+subjected+to+a+full+repertory+of+humiliation+and+minor+abuse.+These+include+smoke-blowing,+hair-pulling,+chair-jostling,+coffee-spilling,+hitting+with+wadded+newspaper,+along+with+such+epithets+as+%22dirty+nigger%22+and+%22black+bitch.%22+Anyone+who+gets+mad+flunks.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uoTY4Y_WTP&amp;sig=QGqcFC9U6RwuA3LxtrDPQyJ35jk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBrqj0pvTbAhVQ_oMKHXUXBcQQ6AEINzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20key%20to%20the%20sit-in%20is%20non-violence%2C%20but%20it%20takes%20a%20tough%20inner%20fiber%20neither%20to%20flinch%20nor%20retaliate%20when%2C%20occasionally%2C%20hooligans%20pick%20on%20the%20sitters-in%20to%20discourage%20them%20or%20provoke%20them%20into%20some%20violent%20act.%20Fearing%20the%20stress%20on%20sensibilities%20and%20temper%20to%20which%20a%20sit-in%20could%20be%20subjected%2C%20the%20high%20school%20and%20college%20students%20of%20Petersburg%2C%20Va.%20studied%20at%20a%20unique%20but%20punishing%20extracurricular%20school%20before%20they%20attempted%20sitting-in.%20In%20the%20course%2C%20which%20they%20ironically%20call%20%22social%20drama%2C%22%20student%20are%20subjected%20to%20a%20full%20repertory%20of%20humiliation%20and%20minor%20abuse.%20These%20include%20smoke-blowing%2C%20hair-pulling%2C%20chair-jostling%2C%20coffee-spilling%2C%20hitting%20with%20wadded%20newspaper%2C%20along%20with%20such%20epithets%20as%20%22dirty%20nigger%22%20and%20%22black%20bitch.%22%20Anyone%20who%20gets%20mad%20flunks.&amp;f=false) to help protesters stay civil under the worst provocation:

&gt;The key to the sit-in is non-violence, but it takes a tough inner fiber neither to flinch nor retaliate when, occasionally, hooligans pick on the sitters-in to discourage them or provoke them into some violent act. Fearing the stress on sensibilities and temper to which a sit-in could be subjected, the high school and college students of Petersburg, Va. studied at a unique but punishing extracurricular school before they attempted sitting-in.In the course, which they ironically call "social drama," student are subjected to a full repertory of humiliation and minor abuse. These include smoke-blowing, hair-pulling, chair-jostling, coffee-spilling, hitting with wadded newspaper, along with such epithets as "dirty nigger" and "black bitch." Anyone who gets mad flunks.

3. Civility is popular. In the recent example of a business owner expelling a Republican, ["72 percent say it is wrong to eject someone from a restaurant for their political views."](http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/394102-why-the-red-hen-incident-so-troubles-us)

Defending incivility, angry leftists say, “But Trump's not civil!” That's true. It's part of the reason he was the most unpopular candidate ever run by a major party, and he only managed to squeak through the Electoral College because [the Democrats chose to run the second most unpopular candidate.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/08/31/poll-clinton-trump-most-unfavorable-candidates-ever/89644296/) His incivility is an excellent reason not to emulate him.

**Bernie Sanders is** [**the country's most popular politician**](http://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-most-popular-politician-655315)**. This principle is one reason why:**

Consider your circumstances. Start small. Have you taken full advantage of the opportunities offered to you? **Are you working hard on your career, or even your job, or are you letting bitterness and resentment hold you back and drag you down?** **Have you made peace with your brother?** Are you treating your spouse and your children with dignity and respect? **Do you have habits that are destroying your health and well being?** Are you truly shouldering your responsibilities? Have you said what you need to say to your friends and family members? **Are there things that you could do, that you know you could do, that would make things around you better?** **Have you cleaned up your life?** **If the answer is no, here’s something to try: Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong.** **Start stopping today.** Don’t waste time questioning how you know that what you’re doing is wrong, if you are certain that it is. Inopportune questioning can confuse, without enlightening, as well as deflecting you from action. You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why. Your entire Being can tell you something that you can neither explain nor articulate. Every person is too complex to know themselves completely, and we all contain wisdom that we cannot comprehend. So, simply stop, when you apprehend, however dimly, that you should stop. Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner. Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed. Say only those things that make you strong. Do only those things that you could speak of with honour.

**Don’t** blame capitalism, **the radical left**, or the iniquity of your enemies.

Have some humility. If you cannot bring peace to your household, how dare you try to rule a city?

**Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world**.
That is fake news. British culture has been constantly changing. So too has U.S. culture. Its called evolution. As an American Anglophile I am aware of the disappearance of tea shops throughout that great nation and of streets being renamed(legally) to reflect an influx of Middle Eastern immigrants. I regret the loss of some institutions but am happy to see others(xenophobia) becoming marginalized. Trump and Trumpist's are weak and unable to be flexible when it comes to change resulting from migration. They are unwilling or unable to go with the flow. So they rail and legislate and against it instead of embracing and adjusting to it. Accommodation takes brains and effort but is the best course of action. Big Ben is still ringing. Trump would have us believe it is going to be destroyed. When acceptance of foreigners is thwarted terrorism is bred. That is what puts Big Ben at risk. I have heard news that Russia will meddle in the midterm. I asked my father that it's unlikely that it will affect the results. I consulted a psychic and said that the House will be close while the Senate will still have a red majority. Another one said that the GOP will nearly win but will end up splitting, leading to Trump and Pence leaving.

Now that Mueller made several indictments, I see good things coming out. I sense that next year, he will have damning evidence against Trump and the GOP. There will be more indictments and some will end up in jail.

Putin will more likely lost trust of Trump and leak humiliating evidence about him. He will tell others not to trust Trump. One predictor said that Dems will flip ~50 seats in the House, but since I couldn't discount meddling and voter suppression, I see Dems with 224 seats in the House and 48 seats in the Senate. I don't see a blue wave, but if there is one, it will be a weak one.a) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdC5wvo5T84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdC5wvo5T84)

The host/guest discussion is about

a) Hillary emails :) - looks like hillary should exchange emails with them and get Presidency in favor :)

b) Timing is suspicious (POTUS knew about these indicments last week. The smart-con man never tweets about it)

b) The comments section is even more weird

\- most people dismiss it as though it was settled long back (when POTUS kept denying russian-meddling until very recently)

c) No one seems to care that POTUS wants nice relationship with Russia. Where is the outrage from POTUS/MAGA-crowd.I've been thinking about this and haven't come up with a good reason why we don't allow voting online. 

Is it possible to make the process secure? If so, what are the counter arguments against being able to vote online. We'd certainly have far more participation. What do you think?Among many failings Trump was disgusting as usual continuing to deflect any opportunity to attribute any blame to Putin for anything. He even thanked Putin for his willingness to allow U.S. investigators to come to Russia to investigate even though a treaty already exists permitting this. Not that any success would be had. Thanking him was just more ass-kissing. Meanwhile Putin called Trump's bailing from the Iranian deal  as troubling. Trump is happy. He got a soccer ball from Putin.I watched this summit very closely. Putin may be an ex-KGB spy, but homie showed his poker face. Putin admitted he wanted Trump to win the election over Hillary Clinton because let's be honest he hates Hillary Clinton and anyone who's associated with her. 

Putin said he heard rumors about Trump's Infamous adventures in Russia. Putin tried to brush it off as rumors. Once more, the question was yes or no question. 

Furthermore, Trump called NATO allies foes and that Russia is allied with the United States. So, good terms with Putin. Putin loves that America is becoming more isolated from NATO.

Lastly, Trump didn't help much by bringing up old news like Clinton's emails, attacking FBI/US press, and spilling out nonsense that makes no damn sense. Saying there's no collusion doesn't help your case.

https://youtu.be/XaymlbmVwbc[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce7i441F2fk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce7i441F2fk) https://twitter.com/vicenews/status/1019037107225022464 &gt; It is difficult to estimate the number of victims of McCarthy. **The number imprisoned is in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs**. In many cases simply being subpoenaed by HUAC or one of the other committees was sufficient cause to be fired

&gt; suspected homosexuality was also a common cause for being targeted by McCarthyism. The hunt for "sexual perverts", who were presumed to be subversive by nature, **resulted in over 5,000 federal workers being fired**, and **thousands were harassed and denied employment**. Many have termed this aspect of McCarthyism the "Lavender scare"

&gt;  in the context of the highly politicised Cold War environment, homosexuality became framed as a dangerous, contagious social disease that posed a potential threat to state security. As the family was believed to be the cornerstone of American strength and integrity,the description of homosexuals as "sexual perverts" meant that they were both unable to function within a family unit and presented the potential to poison the social body. **This era also witnessed the establishment of widely spread FBI surveillance intended to identify homosexual government employees**

&gt; A port security program initiated by the Coast Guard shortly after the start of the Korean War required a review of every maritime worker who loaded or worked aboard any American ship, regardless of cargo or destination.As with other loyalty-security reviews of McCarthyism, the identities of any accusers and even the nature of any accusations were typically kept secret from the accused. **Nearly 3,000 seamen and longshoremen lost their jobs due to this program alone**

&gt; McCarthy often used accusations of homosexuality as a smear tactic in his anti-communist crusade, often combining the Second Red Scare with the Lavender Scare. On one occasion, he went so far as to announce to reporters, "If you want to be against McCarthy, boys, you've got to be either a Communist or a cocksucker."

so to sum up, all the people crying about how the russia shit is McCarthyism are idiots and are being dicks by comparing the shamefull blight that McCarthyism was to people being rightly concerned with interference in their elections and the president possibly being compromised by a hostile power*Tell us something we don't know. Am I right?* Lol.

Seriously though, academics at the universities of Bristol and Tennessee set out to test the theory that nations become more secular after becoming more prosperous and **found that the process takes place in reverse**.

The study found that the loss of religion, rather than the embracing of Protestant values, correlated with future increases in prosperity. Researchers examined GDP figures for 109 countries and the importance of religious faith in those states. They found that a decrease in religious belief was linked to an increase in tolerance for individual rights, including of women and gay people and those who seek divorce or abortions. This may allow more people to play a full part in society.

An increase in secularisation by one unit corresponded to an average £800 increase in GDP per capita within a decade, a £2,000 increase within 20 years and a £4,000 increase within 30.

Paper:  "Religious change preceded economic change in the 20th century" by Damian Ruck, R. Alexander Bentley and Daniel J. Lawson in [*Science Advances*](http://advances.sciencemag.org/)I hope I won't be subjecting myself to the the idiocy of the conservative extremists on these shows just to hear how David handles them. I'm confident he will present himself well and demand better lighting/make-up and not just be a punching bag for the right. Only he knows his endurance levels. Likely I'll be content with the regular David Pakman Show and it will not suffer from David's expansion into mainstream media ventures. Maybe Pat can pick up the slack if any ensues.Venezuela only has 40.9% public sector GDP. It is primarily a capitalist economy. France, for reference, is at 56.6% public sector GDP. The average public sector GDP of the OECD countries is tied for the U.K. and Iceland at 42.5%. So Venezuela has a below average public sector GDP ratio compared to OECD countries.

3. Even Fox News back during Chavez ran an article pointing out that there really is no socialism in Venezuela, that they are an economy run primarily on private enterprise. Additionally, current nationalized industries were previously nationalized during the early 20th century as well. http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/07/18/socialism-private-sector-dominates-venezuelan-economy-despite-chavez-crusade.htmlPrice controls do not cause scarcity, they distribute scarcity. If you let the market raise prices when there is a shortage instead of having a price control, the goods are distributed unevenly to the top earners and the bottom earners cannot consume the good or service at all. Price controls avoid this and make the market solve scarcity not by cutting off the lower sects of the economy, but by rationing the good to everyone. Let’s say we have exactly how much water we need for everyone to live, but no more. Without price controls, the rich and upper middle class will demand more than they need, raising the price of water, resulting in the lower class not being able to survive or consume the amount of water needed. A price control would stop this and distribute the scarce resource evenly.Am I in some Groundhod Day scenario where I'm still waking up on July 18th, or did the NYT not just publish an article last night, citing that "nearly a dozen" sources leaked them info that Trump was shown hard evidence of Putin-ordered interference, back in January 2017, two weeks before his inauguration?   Am I in the fucking Twilight Zone, and somehow "would" vs. "wouldn't" is still more worthy of discussion than "HE FUCKING KNEW THIS WHOLE TIME" and what that could mean, both politically and legally?  
Seriously, how is any/each instance of Trump denial about interference more "news" than us now knowing for a fact that he never had a denial leg to stand on, that he has just taken advantage of Intelligence's professional secrecy up to this point?  Just think of the fortitude it took for all those people to keep their mouths shut all this time, all the Tweets and vile televised utterances they had to stomach, all the lost careers!  --James mf'ing Comey, getting fired for "this Rusher thing," and never in all his TV interviews blurting out "BUT HE KNEW IT WAS TRUE--WE SHOWED HIM AND HE ACCEPTED IT, BEFORE HE WAS EVEN PRESIDENT!!"   Granted, Trump fired him not for just investigating just Russia, but "Trump and Russia," but Trump was still not publicly admitting even pure Russo meddling.  
And which/how many of Trump's behaviors since the Jan. 2017 briefing constitute violation of law, and/or violation of Presidential duty?  
Are my sensibilities way 'off' or shouldn't this be THE biggest story yet?
WHY ARE ALL THE NEWS CHANNELS DISCUSSING ANYTHING BESIDES THIS, NEVER MIND BARELY DISCUSSING IT AT ALL!!!  
If you think there is good reason I should calm the fuck down please do share, because I am getting more wigged out and pissed by the minute. Here in my home state of Oregon, our governor is elected/re-elected every 2 years. However, our senators get re-elected every 4 years. Why don't we make the president, and the rest of governors limited to only 1 four year term, or 2 two year terms? 

It could shift the power of the establishment to the left wing and right wing populists by making the time to campaign shorter, thus the populist candidates whose message is more potent and straight to the point will probably be represented by their party every election. i say keep them but i wish you'd have more disagreeable call-ins instead of echo chamber "i agree" calls and "as progressives, what should we do to help x?" calls. let's see david flex his intellectual muscle with more off the cuff calls from people who disagree for once.Why doesn't it exist? What's the holdup, Pakman? 

Or are we going to sit here and pretend like we don't know Pakman would put the Chupacabra revelations behind the paywall. Why isn't David stepping up to acknowledge the Chupacabra?  

I saw the Chupacabra while out in my suburban trail in the twilight hours. But, the more perturbing aspect is that, you don't really understand the full ability of the Cupacabra to make you feel and sense its presence and hostile intent. 

I know it. 

You know it.

Everybody knows it. It seems it's getting increasing difficult to oppose Muslim conservatism(like the widespread reprehensible views on gays here in the uk among muslims) without a ridicolous number of people on the left thinking you're some right winger, or anti muslim bigot, or anti arab racist.

like, seriously, 52% of muslims in my country think my existence should be illegal, wtf am I supposed to say to that?

also london pride(don't know if it was this year but read an article about it a while ago on pinknews) had an ex-muslim group that had "Allah is gay" signs and the pride organisers where attacked(not physically, rhetorically) by some muslim groups saying pride was stoking anti muslim bigotry, and pride capitulated to their demands and got the ex muslim group to not use the signs. fuck that shit, that's insane, especially considering the widespread rabid homophobia among muslims here. but they're claiming a completely mild sing saging allah is gay is anti muslim bigotry. it's such a joke but many on the left don't see it, or atleast it seems as if they don't.

anway, what do you think of all this? This whole time I have been baffled at news pundits and guests discussing only why Putin wanted Trump to win the 2016 election.  At best (greatest depth), there is the debate over whether Trump was the puppet prefabricated for Putin's goals, versus him simply hating Hilary and merely trying to make her presidency contentious from the start (or beat her if possible, even if he didn't particularly want Trump).  What I never see ANYONE considering is Putin's aims regarding Senate and House.  

This seems a no-brainer as a worthy topic, given that any president's power is correlated to whether his/her party aligns with either or both houses of Congress, also because there is a consensus that Russian interference is ongoing.  Sure, Putin and his oligarchs could just be trying to sustain Trump's base approval so his puppet behavior won't be unanimously opposed, and maybe like Trump, Putin is already looking toward a 2020 reelection.  But why would Putin not also want as many GOP Congress seats to be held or gained as possible?  Do we think Putin isn't aware of all the ways a Democrat takeover of the House could stymie Trump, even IMPEACH him??  
Not only is no one discussing this, but the general ways Putin is described as remaining a threat are completely baffling. Why are the experts mulling the least-likely outcomes of what we know from current intelligence, like Putin somehow changing vote counts (virtually impossible because even electronic voting is not internet-connected), or using electrical grid malware to stage a massive attack that would cause incalculable death and destruction?  Why do I, an admitted layperson, see the much more obvious threat--that Putin could maintain the GOP majorities not by CHANGING vote counts, just by boosting Republican voter turnout as much as possible via social media propaganda, and then MINIMIZE Democrat votes with surgical use of power outages, in just the right (blue) districts on election day, as well as surgically altering voter rolls, so that just enough Democrats would be turned away from their polling stations because their names will be missing.  Sure, anyone denied their vote on November 6th would probably get another chance in a day or two, but how many would show up again, especially after the news has covered all the results of votes that WERE counted?  
As is so often the case, Trump's idiotic Twitter spasming may have opened a can of worms he'd be better off leaving shut.  I sure fucking hope so.  Even if all the cowards in the GOP would rather we not look at them through the eyes of Mother Russia, it's about damn time the rest of us do!  In case you missed it, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/8xw5uc/do_we_really_want_kavanaughs_confirmation_to_be/) is what I said a couple of weeks ago about making the confirmation an election issue - or in other words, delaying the vote until after the November election to "let the people decide," as Senator Schumer first declared. I called in to the show last week to clarify why I feel it is a bad strategy for the midterms. Sadly, in trying to express a few ideas for issues on which we could fight it, my call got dropped. This is a long read, so there is a TL/DR at the end, but I would encourage reading the whole thing if you have time. Here are my suggestions:

## First Priority: Build a Case That Even Republican Senators Cannot Deny Make Kavanaugh a Bad Nominee

Extremely challenging, I know. However, the truth of the matter is that we have absolutely zero chance of blocking the nomination without bringing a significant number of Republicans over to the *nay* side. If all Republicans vote *yay*, it really doesn't matter how Red State Democrats vote, and I stand by my assessment that - at least for Donnelly and Heitkamp - it would be best for them to save the political capital as long as the majority of their constituents support the nomination and see the Supreme Court as a top issue.

So, how do we convince Republicans to vote no? Well, nothing is guaranteed to work, but damn it if Democrats don't try.  Here are some Senators to target, and how we may be able to get them.

1. **Rand Paul.** Senator Paul is already wavering on how he will vote on the issue of privacy; even Ted Cruz is at least sympathetic to his concerns. If we don't exploit that, then this really is nothing more than a thought experiment for Senator Paul, as he has played coy like this before on issues like the budget, and he will ultimately vote yes. So, my first suggestion is to **exploit Rand Paul's privacy concerns**. Another way we can get Paul is by taking a page from Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for Georgia governor. I am referring to how she blocked an anti-abortion bill by successfully tricking a GOP state representative into voting against it by [convincing him that it wasn't anti-abortion enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52rdKGcSO5w&amp;t=173s). Seems ruthless, but Rand Paul has already used this reasoning when discussing GOP attempts to repeal the ACA, all of which he did eventually vote for. This can be exploited by focusing on a recent opinion cast by Kavanaugh regarding abortion for an undocumented minor [last fall](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/in-major-abortion-ruling-kavanaugh-offers-clues-of-how-he-might-handle-divisive-issue-on-the-supreme-court/2018/07/11/1acd980a-8515-11e8-9e80-403a221946a7_story.html?utm_term=.4c8f2f6c5468). In this ruling, he did use the anti-abortion code language of "abortion on demand." However, his dissenting opinion was met with criticism from the other conservative justices because they believed that his opinion didn't go far enough. There's also the following observation made by David French of the conservative National Review:  *In Seven Sky v. Holder, he dissented from the majority opinion upholding the constitutionality of Obamacare, but he did so by holding that the suit was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, in a ruling that bolstered the Obama administration’s ultimately successful claim that the Obamacare penalty was truly a tax. In Priests for Life v. Department of Health and Human Services, Kavanaugh wrongly held that the government had a “compelling interest” in “facilitating access to contraceptives” for employees of the specific religious plaintiffs in the case. That conclusion wasn’t required by Supreme Court precedent, and it cheapened the very concept of a “compelling governmental interest."* Not a likely no-vote, but Paul is unpredictable these days, so it's possible. If it works, it's possible he could pull over one or two more no-votes, perhaps extreme conservatives who are also Trump-critics (eg. Ben Sasse, Jeff Flake). A very long shot, but no impossible.
2. **Susan Collins**. Two particularly obvious issues that go hand-in-hand for Collins, and by extension Murkowski, are abortion access and coverage for pre-existing conditions. Since it seems that Kavanaugh's opinion on abortion is more that it should be a state-issue than a nationwide ban and neither Maine nor Alaska look to be trying to restrict abortion access in their states, it's not very likely that abortion will be convincing enough. Plus, we know from the confirmation of Gorsuch that Collins will be swayed by anyone who claims *stare decisis* when asked about Roe v. Wade. However, there are other issues. Collins was the lone Republican to vote *yay* on restoring **net neutrality**. Kavanaugh is very much against [net neutrality](http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/07/kavanaugh-on-net-neutrality-u-s-telecom-association-v-federal-communications-commission), arguing ISPs have a First Amendment right, and by extension regulation of it is unconstitutional. This should actually be a relatively easy issue to get Collins on. However, if it is not enough, we also know that she is very active on the Senate Judiciary Committee and is very committed to getting to the bottom of the Russia investigation. Kavanaugh has said that he wants to overturn *Morrison v. Olson*, the 7-1 decision that upheld the constitutionality of an independent council. We also know that he believes that a sitting president should not even be subject to any kind of investigation, and even questioned the 8-0 decision on Nixon handing over his records (more recent statements show that his position on that has changed). This should be alarming to anyone who sits on that panel. Of course, Kavanaugh can get into the technical differences between an independent council and a special council. However, we should not assume that he would not expand that interpretation.
3. **Dean Heller** (edit). This one has little to do with where he stands on issues, and should actually be the easiest and simplest Republican no-vote. Where my initial concern has to do with the re-election chances of red state Democrats, he has the opposite problem: a Republican Senator in a blue state up for re-election this year. Currently, polls have him behind. It shouldn't take much to explain this is a gettable no-vote.

## Second Priority: Issues for Red State Democrats

I won't repeat my concerns on the problems facing the red state Democrats on the challenges of voting no with a midterm election just weeks after this confirmation vote is set to go through. The issues that may give these Democrats an out are more basic kitchen-table issues, and they will take a lot of passion to sell. So, here are those issues that can sway them to a no-vote that are most likely to keep up their chances of reelection. These issues may work to convince a Republican or two, as well.

1. **Net Neutrality**. See explanation for Susan Collins above. All Democrats voted in favor of net neutrality. So if it's popular enough in their states, it should be an issue they can sell to their constituents as a good reason for a no-vote
2. **Protections for Pre-Existing Conditions**. Red state Democrats are actually leading on a resolution to intervene in the upcoming case that aims to undo protections for [pre-existing conditions](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/397871-vulnerable-senate-dems-target-gop-on-health-care). It is believed that this resolution is meant to give them an out to allow them to vote *yay* on the Kavanaugh confirmation, but to satisfy the Democratic base in their respective states. However, if the resolution fails, then it should give them a reason to vote *nay*. Protection for pre-existing conditions is popular even in red states. In Indiana, in particular, Senator Donnelly is credited for single-handedly getting healthcare coverage for coal miners in the south, and it is a major part of his re-election platform. It's not exactly a sexy issue, so it may not be enough. But if the vote happens before they have at least election debate at which they can explain their votes, they can make it work.
3. **Worker's Rights**. This has been quite a year for unions. Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and West Virginia all experienced statewide teacher walk-outs this past spring. Just last month right before Kennedy announced his retirement, SCOTUS dealt a blow to public sector unions. Recently, a steel union in Indiana came out against Kavanaugh's confirmation as part of movement led by [AFL-CIO](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-11/trump-unites-unions-against-anti-worker-kavanaugh-for-court). His judicial writings not only are consistent with pro-corporate conservatives on the bargaining power of labor unions, but they are also quite alarming on the issue of worker safety.  One example is the case where a supposedly domesticated killer whale at SeaWorld in Florida grabbed its trainer, dragged her underwater, and drowned her. She was the fourth trainer the whale killed, the letter notes. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited and fined SeaWorld, which took the agency and its judicial arm to court. The court backed OSHA, but Kavanaugh didn’t, questioning the role of the government in determining appropriate levels of risk for workers. Given that West Virginia and Indiana are homes to the hazardous coal mining industry - *especially* WV - this should be a compelling reason to vote no.
4. **Avoid Abortion**. As much as it pains me to say it as a Social Democrat, the main driver of the conservative excitement around controlling the Supreme Court is the opportunity to abolish abortion in most cases. A federal appeals court recently struck down two anti-abortion laws in my state of Indiana in the last 3 months. Both cases are likely headed to the Supreme Court within the next few months, and anti-abortion activists see them as the opportunity they have been waiting for. Of course, this underscores the urgency of blocking a right-wing activist judge. However, while support for abortion in the entire country has never been higher, in these red states, using Roe as a reason to vote against Kavanaugh - especially when all of the other potential nominees are more extreme social conservatives - would not play well and will be their downfall in November. Trust me on this. Just because a red state has a Democratic Senator does not mean they are less married to the desire to abolish abortion.

## General Issues

There are some issues that can overall erode confidence in the pick if hammered hard enough. Most of the Democratic Senators and their constituents don't need to be convinced, so this list will not include Roe v. Wade or affirmative action. Those are self-explanatory.

1. For conservatives, **Washington Insider**. Rick Santorum slammed the pick, decry that Trump had "bowed to the elite in Washington." This point will certainly not win anyone over, but it may raise a few eyebrows.
2. **Executive Power**. I already mentioned *Morrison v. Olson*. Given his involvement in the Ken Starr investigation and service in the Bush administration, this should at least make some people scratch their heads. It's already been explained above how this should be alarming for anyone who cares about the Mueller investigation.
3. **Pre-existing Conditions**. Yes, this was already listed above for red state Democrats. However, this should also be concerning to Republicans, particularly in coal country.

# Final Thoughts

Blocking this confirmation will be an uphill battle, no doubt. However, I define the fight as what happens between now and the beginning of the roll call vote and the case we can to the American people and the Republican Senators who need convincing. By the time the confirmation vote begins, the fight is basically over because everyone has made their decision. Given the timing, we also have to balance it with how the confirmation vote will impact the midterms. An analysis of the Cook Political Report from last week projects the senate as being split 50/50 (50D/49R if we don't count McCain, who is largely absent); the analysis projects that Donnelly and Heitkamp might lose their seats, but the Democrats appear to be in position to pick up Tennessee (Corker), Arizona (Flake), and Nevada (Heller), so I'm slightly more optimistic than when I wrote my OP two weeks ago. For all we know, the SCOTUS vote may not matter in the midterms, depending on when McConnell forces the vote. In the meantime, we need to be active on the ground to get out as many votes as possible in November.  Blocking the confirmation *and* flipping the Senate can be done, but the Democrats need to get their priorities straight (first flip Republican votes to *nay*, then give red state Dems an out) and come up with a more ballsy and savvy strategy, because we cannot expect to hold Republicans to principles they don't actually have. Feel free to comment. I am ready for the fireworks.

**TL;DR**

* First priority is to flip Republican votes. Without doing that, confirmation is inevitable, and the next priority will be for red state Democrats to save political capital.
   * To try to convince Rand Paul to vote no, focus on his concerns about privacy. On top of that, use the Stacey Abrams approach to convince him that Kavanaugh is not conservative enough, and maybe he can bring one or two more Republicans along with him.
   * To try to convince Susan Collins, focus on net neutrality and executive power as it concerns the Russia investigation. Abortion may be used, but since she still voted for Gorsuch with the magic words of *stare decisis*, that is unlikely to convince her or Lisa Murkowski.
* (edit) Leverage Dean Heller's re-election chances as a reason for him to vote no, since he is behind in the polls.
* Second Priority is to help red state Democrats build a case to make to their voters that voting no is the right decision.
   * Focus on kitchen-table issues (net-neutrality, workers' rights, protections for pre-existing conditions)
   * Pre-existing conditions can also be a case to make to Republicans if a strong-enough case is made that Kavanaugh would rule this mandate for insurance companies unconstitutional.
   * Avoid abortion. This will not play well in their states and will most definitely cost them their seats.
* Smaller issues (Kavanaugh's elitism, executive power, etc.) may erode some Republican confidence in Kavanaugh's confirmation, but won't ultimately convince them to vote no.
* Democrats need to be ballsy, but they also need to be strategic in balancing how they fight this confirmation *and* attempt to flip the Senate in November, as the confirmation may or may not influence the midterm results.
* For the midterms, we have more reason to be optimistic right now, but we should stay tuned and get out the vote.Do you think they should request the extradition of all the wahhabi financers? Obviously stop arms sales would be a big one aswell. but that wouldn't do anything to stop the exportation of wahhabism from the country so which is mainly what i'm thinking about.I write this article in the context of Trump floating the idea that we bail out the farms due to expected decreased revenue. I am personally ok with this practice, to my knowledge first implemented as part of the New Deal, I am laughing that Trump wants to use taxpayer money to fix a mess he created. However this incident has gotten me thinking about the current business model farmers must go through and how it is an issue for the public. 

Americans should have access to either tax payer funded upfront cost free healthy food, or extremely cheap healthy food. If food was sold cheap, farmers wouldn't be able to make a profit which leads to a vicious cycle. 

My proposal: instead of the US government doing deals with private farms, the US acquire these farms for a fair value price, and grow enough food to insure every citizen can have 3 reasonable meals a day. 

IMO the current model is inefficient and by nationalizing farmland, having the government better distribute food for people and not as much used in luxury fast food or other wasteful practices we experience today.

What do you think, I know this post is very light on detail but I'm looking to debate the broad idea rather than specific implementation. I just got back into wow again after a long time away, and stumbled upon this image of the different power centers in the mythology (will get to relevance in a sec):

[http://i.imgur.com/xsLHScx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xsLHScx.jpg)

I want something like that but for different factions in politics, even going into maps just for the left.  We are generally aligned, but it would be useful to know the different factions on the left and their concerns, and the relative percentages of people among the left that are part of those groups.  Most of us of course share multiple interests, so we may be part of multiple factions to varying degrees, or indifferent, and it would be supremely useful to see this visually.

For example, while Kyle and Pakman agree on many things, there seems to be a schizm on Russia, and part of that seems to me because I consider Kyle closer to the Glenn Greenwald faction of the left when it comes to an obsessive desire to know all US secrets, regardless of how those secrets come about or if the information is being weaponized.  Kyle and Glenn genuinely don't give a fuck about any of that, they just want the info.

So we could place Kyle closer to the Glenn Greenwald center of the left, where he has more affection and grants more importance to radical transparency and has deep mistrust of government when it comes to the intelligence services (Kyle has openly cast doubt on the veracity of intelligence reports that Russia meddled because of the intelligence services being suspect - they got Iraq wrong, so why believe them on anything?)

Pakman is most definitely NOT part of this camp, but he has his own affinities.  I think he is more attached to Israel and more sensitive to attacks on Israel because of his shared jewish identity and being more sensitive to seeing Israel singled out compared to so many other countries that don't get called out.  There was a vox article by a liberal jewish guy that talked about how as critical as he was towards Israel, he could not get on board with movements like BDS:

[https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/15/17352640/israel-gaza-embassy-american-jews](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/15/17352640/israel-gaza-embassy-american-jews)

I'm convinced, though I'm sure people like pakman and others would disagree with me, that part of this increased tendency to pull ones punches regarding Israel, is based on identity concerns.  He is Jewish and likely feels come kinship.  This can probably be said for all mono ethnic groups when it comes to the issues they have a greater tendency to latch onto.  I have my own but in my case it's less about race since I'm a bit of a mixed race mutt, I feel close to ZERO racial kinship with any group, and my atheism is not a positive source of common beliefs to form a community on.  So my groupings have to be based on other things, and for me that is more of shared ideas and values and interests.  Now almost everyone has some of that, but they usually also have some group identity draws based on background too.

Now that I am talking this out, with the complexity of human drives this map would have to be absolutely immense.r/[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf9bfTGMKfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf9bfTGMKfE)

Seriously, every time I turn around there's a news story that to me screams one-or-more huge conclusions, or at least questions, yet nobody is saying it.  As the day progresses I go through the same frustrating cycle: Forgive Reuters or whomever broke the story because God bless them for just breaking the story, try to stomach the cable channels chewing over everything BUT my observation because there must be some billionaire/advertiser overlord reason they dare not verbalize it, and then by nightfall I feel like pulling my hair out as the alternative media posts their videos showing they also fail to connect the dots.

The failure du cycle?  --Why doesn't the Trump Tower meeting(s?) show not just obvious (technical) aiding and abetting/conspiracy, the mere fact that the Trump campaign knew of foreign aide to their goal before the election, but that it almost HAD TO BE two-sided, tit-for-tat, that Trump's behavior since inauguration supports that notion, so in fact there's ample reason to say the 'T' word?  'T' for TREASON.  
   
It's so fucking simple.  Just imagine you're Putin.  If what you want from the 2016 election is simply to make the (presumed) Hillary Clinton White House a nightmare for her because you hate her, you don't need Trump's awareness to put your meddlers to work, just fucking do it.  If you just want to create chaos and division among the American population, duh, just fucking do it.  Even if Trump's actual win is the goal because it would likely provide some automatic advantage over Clinton, again, just fucking meddle, cross your warty KGB fingers, and hope you're right about Trump!  

If, on the other warty hand, you're pretty sure you could cinch a Trump win and you want to make sure he'll do your bidding as President, THEN you ask for a meeting in the fall before the election.  THEN you don't just leak dirt on Clinton and brainwash simpletons via social media; you allude to your prowesses and intentions to Trump, to arrange a discussion and get him to commit to reciprocity after he's elected.  Unfortunately you underestimate what a bigmouth moron he is, he publicly blabs about Hillary dirt in the pipeline, and then his moron son shits his pants and blabs about the meeting when things get hot.
Will we ever see hard evidence that Trump's feet-dragging on sanctions and other Russophiliac behavior was preordained?  Goddamn I hope so, but in the meantime can we just agree it's fucking obvious that it happened?  TDPS is my second favorite YT political news source, in fact I like it so much it *would* be my #1, were it not for the fact that the videos post so long after stories first broke.  It's understandable when it's a Friday story and the video doesn't come til Monday, but that's not what I'm talking about.  A story could break on (say) CNN on Monday morning, and there won't be a TDPS video about it until maybe Tuesday night or even Wednesday.  If it's something I'm pretty interested in, I've likely already watched/read multiple sources' coverage of it, so I've no reason to hear David lay it out, except in cases where the story is very open to interpretation and I want to know David's take (and the other dude, the one with the mic, I just spent like 10 minutes surfing to find his name/role, sucks that he isn't given more prominent credit because I often find that when he speaks up it is with worthy insights--anybody here wanna tell me who/what he is?).  
 Anyway, I wonder about this delay.  My erratic schedule doesn't allow for catching live broadcasts very much, so I don't know if TDPS just uploads the clips long after the original broadcast (because of staffing limits or what?), or if he actually waits to cover them in the first place (maybe to take in a range of others' viewpoints before stating his own, or waiting to see if stories have follow-up info?).  
Thoughts?????[Has body-positivity gone too far?](https://greatist.com/live/body-positivity-movement-too-far)

Here’s my opinions on the subject. First, bullying someone for their weight is wrong. Second, people can be overweight or obese and live a very happy life, but not a healthy one. I have no problem with combating fat shaming outside of a very dangerous trend which is fat acceptance. It’s a form of denial and escapism that people use since our country is so overweight. I have a big problem with people telling themselves that their obesity is fine and “isn’t unhealthy” it’s similar to climate change denial. Obesity kills people. And teaching your kids to be obese like you can arguably be a form of child abuse.Hi all, I live in Australia and I went on my first European trip recently. I loved Europe! The buildings, the architecture, the history and even the scenery are great. But it is my visit to Molenbeek, Brussels that I wanted to share my thoughts about.

Now Brussels itself is a fantastic city; the headquarters of the European Union are located here and the Grand Place area with its regal buildings, narrow cobblestone pathways, chocolate stores and bustling cafes / waffle stores remains one of my trip’s major highlights. But it is what happened before that shocked me &amp; left an unpleasant mark in my psyche. Our tour group stopped over for lunch at Molenbeek before visiting Grand Place; only 3-4 kilometres separate these two places but the difference between the two places is of unimaginable proportions (Like two separate continents).

You have a diverse group of tourists from all over the world, wearing shorts &amp; sandals, taking photos &amp; enjoying their meals in Grand Place, whereas just 3-4 kilometres away in Molenbeek, you have women walking around in burqas &amp; headscarfs, with large of groups of often bearded Arab &amp; sub-Saharan African men sitting / hanging around in the streets, playing cards or doing nothing. The area feels neglected, walls are covered in graffiti, litter lies strewn around on the pavements. Our tour guide warns us of the high crime rates in this area and tells us to always look after our belongings here. A lot of the Arab &amp; African men gave us menacing stares (our tour group was all Indian Hindus), everywhere I look I see kebab stores advertising halal meat and it feels like I just literally walked into Morocco or Tunisia.

Later on I read that Molenbeek suffers from high unemployment, gangs, petty crime and to top it off, is also considered an Islamist stronghold. Watch this 60 mins piece on Molenbeek here. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANLcHEnog98It) Per capita, Belgium has produced more ISIS fighters than anywhere else in the world. And most shockingly; not only did a lot of them originate from Molenbeek but a high proportion of local residents actually look upon Jihadis as heroes!! (https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/belgium-radical-islam-jihad-molenbeek-isis/416235/)

This is simply unacceptable. How has a liberal nation allowed such a hotbed of Islamic terror to occur in its midst? There is zero integration &amp; zero assimilation and it seems like the residents of Brussels basically live in two different worlds. All Western nations &amp; countries with large minority Muslim populations such as India, China, Philippines, Thailand &amp; Russia absolutely need to do a crackdown on radical Islam. I fully support putting sanctions on Saudi Arabia (look elsewhere for oil), prevent Wahhabist &amp; Salafist preachers from entering the country, deport hate preachers (promoting violence against infidels falls outside the boundary of free speech) and severely restrict Muslim immigration. And it is us Liberals that need to take steps like this to uphold liberalism rather than leave it to the far-right fascists who are almost as dangerous as these Islamists.

Upon visiting Molenbeek, I was reminded of this Sam Harris quote which seems perfectly apt in this situation – “Islam is the fastest growing religion in Europe. Throughout the E.U., Muslim immigrants often show little inclination to acquire the secular and civil values of their host countries, and yet exploit these values to the utmost—demanding tolerance for their backwardness, their misogyny, their anti-Semitism, and the genocidal hatred that is regularly preached in their mosques. Political correctness and fears of racism have rendered many secular Europeans incapable of opposing the terrifying religious commitments of the extremists in their midst.” (Source: https://samharris.org/the-reality-of-islam/)

What do you guys think? Please share your thoughts below. Does the French-Dutch divide in Belgium harm unity &amp; prevent the government from taking action against Islamism? And if we have any Belgians on this subreddit, you can pipe in &amp; verify the accuracy of my piece.
I’m guessing a lot of you people agree with regime change of ISIS in Iraq. Even though ISIS is a coalition comprised mostly of Saddam’s former Ba’ath Party members. As in you opposed removing the same group from power in the past.

I don’t see all of the arguments about removing ISIS like how it will “destabilize Iraq” or how “it’s for the oil” or “it will kill civilians” even though Saddam’s Ba’ath Party was far more brutal than ISIS and killed far more Iraqis than ISIS ever did. I don’t see anyone saying Barack Obama is a war criminal for removing the fascist regime of ISIS.

I thought this video was excellent and is more useful than 99% of anything people on the left can say to conservatives.

&amp;#x200B;

It does something very important in separating out what really drives the opposition from some conservatives about the concept of global warming and teases out some of the hidden fears about the subject. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most importantly, it suggests that they can still be conservative and not abandon plenty of other things they care about and want to promote while adopting an ethos of acceptance of climate change and supporting policies to address it.  That last may be the most important of all, if ones ideology rests on fact x being false, then for many people they would rather have a fact be false than ditch their belief systems.  In this thread we support and thank the hard work of Vegan Producer Pat and Producer Max!I’ve been listening to David since around November 2016, wish it had been sooner, and have had my mind changed on many issues. One of those issues was climate change. For years I was surrounded by people who believed the earth might be changing climate, but because of natural processes and not man made actions. “The hubris, to think we can change the climate”. While I’ve been following the issue now in the news, it hasn’t got me personally until tonight. My towns power grid couldn’t handle the amount of power needed to power all the air conditioning and we lost power for several hours. It’s back now, but then I realized unless we fix the climate, and upgrade our power grid, this will keep happening every year. Hell this problem will get worse over time. Wanted to share my anecdotal evidence that climate change is going to have far reaching consequences that many can’t see right now. 

Edit: this based on experiences in the Midwest Despite implying that he must adhere to the law re abortion rights ala Roe versus Wade, his recent actions prove otherwise. Rachael Maddow aired audio of Kavanaugh attempting to obstruct the legal abortion sought(and eventually achieved) by a young immigrant who was being held at a government facility pending processing. The woman had gotten court approval, obtained non-government funding  and an appointment for the procedure, but was being refused permission to leave the facility to get it done. During a hearing to get the permission, Kavanaugh is heard arguing 'delaying tactics' which would prevent the woman from leaving the facility until her pregnancy had progressed past the legal time limit for having it done. Hope to see this come up during his approval hearings. His antics in the Senate where he was peacocking about him being this brave Warrior by releasing some emails and daring people to eject him from the senate was such obvious grand standing, over an issue where everyone already knows why things are being hidden.  It's just another example of trying to pretend he's on peoples side on some completely tangential issue that does not go against his donor preferences.  Let me know when he gets on board Elizibeth Warrens latest bill idea.

&amp;#x200B;

He's such a poser.  It's times like these I wish I knew how to use that software the people on deepfakes were engaged with.  I'd use the AI software to put Bookers face on the lead singer of this Platters song.  Oh how I wish I knew how to do that.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyM8NVl4yBY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyM8NVl4yBY)I watched Williams given repeated warnings re illegal coaching, smashing her racquet and demanding an apology from an umpire for just doing his job, then calling him a thief. Williams cried, accused the umpire of sexism and really made a shameful showing all because she was losing the match. Her coach admitted on camera that he was indeed coaching. Highly respected commentators agreed during the match that despite the initial warning, which was admittedly questionable, Williams continued her disrespectful behavior resulting in a point penalty, then a game penalty and then fines. They also noted that although men behave possibly worse, they knock off their whining after being warned. She did not. And yet the story is being spread by news reporters who say they did not watch the match that Williams is a victim of sexism. To her credit Serena asked the fans to stop booing at the awards ceremony. And cheers to Martina Navratilova for not siding with Serena saying that just because men might get away with something against the rules, then women should too, is not the best argument against sexism.It is objectively false. We lost our filibuster proof senate majority 74 days into Obama’s presidency when Ted Kennedy died. We did not have a supermajority and we relied on centrists to pass Obamacare, which was proposed originally by Nixon, who was left of center of economics. Specifically, Joe Lieberman alone killed the public option. Having one more Democratic Senator in office, such as Ted Kennedy, would have caused the public option to be passed. We have never passed liberal legislation with 100% Democratic support as well, but we had 100% Democratic support for the public option in the Senate for the first time in history. That is a fact.

The other talking point is that “every other modern country has a single payer system of one kind of another” which is absolutely 100% false. Only a few countries have single payer systems, Scandinavian countries and Canada for the most part. The U.K. has direct socialized medicine, as they go further than single payer. Single payer is a government/public monopoly on insurance that pays for private healthcare. France, and most other modern nations have a multi-payer system with public insurance being the primary payer, competing with private insurance that is regulated similar to Obamacare or that is entirely non-profit like Switzerland (which has an individual mandate to buy non-profit insurance as their healthcare system).

The reason we don’t have universal healthcare is because we have subsidized, employer sponsored healthcare. This was a trend rapidly expanding before WWII price and wage controls, look up insured rate over time and what percentage is from employers. Unions were already securing employer sponsored healthcare, and once it was subsidized by FDR and greatly expanded and solidified as a subsidy under Eisenhower, most Americans had health insurance. This directly decreases support for public/government insurance. Most countries went from low insured rate to universal. We are going from a high insured rate to universal, which has less appeal.

It should also be noted that no Democratic President has ever been able to pass universal healthcare, so saying that Obama is unique in that is completely false. The most comprehensive single-payer proposal was lead by Hillary Clinton in the 90s under Bill Clinton and the public opposed it, and their opposition only grew larger over time. Obamacare did not have public support due to being perceived as too liberal. Single-payer also did not have majority support under Obama. Even with single payer support at over 60%, some of those voters will still vote Republican for other issues they prioritize (abortion for example, or foreign policy) so it is misleading to say that the centrist voter supports single payer because it has 60% support. The centrist voter does support single payer now to be clear. To really see where single payer stands you should look at how much support it has minus Republican support, to see how much outreach it has to centrists. This applies to other policies as well.I was verifying my VUID (Voter Unique Identification Number) and precinct today, while double checking some for friends and whatnot - turns out I can't find my voter registration in any database! I'm calling the Registrar tomorrow, but I don't know why it doesn't show me as being registered to vote!!!

Are they actually purging people from rolls? Changing polling places??

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else had this problem before?It was ridiculous and bad faith of her to not explain the simple difference between Democrats/Obama and Republicans/Trump on Iran sanctions and relations.  Really bad faith on her part.

She said she supports Jimmy Dore who is the worst and dumbest a-hole entertainer on the left.  And I say this as a very progressive Democrat.

Her and Rogan play a lot with the idea of her running for President.

She was too agreeable with Joe Rogan even though she knows a lot more about all of this stuff.  She didn't specifically call out support for or promote the Democrats.  She did not specifically critique the Republicans, conservatives or Trump.  She acted as if there was no difference between the Democrats and Republicans!

She did ZERO critique OF Republicans or Trump! This was a 2 hour interview!!!

She also thought that current Russian interference is our elections is comparable to current "America's interference" in other nations elections!!!  She is saying that America promoting democracy/freedom, backing democratic parties, and being against murderous totalitarians like Putin is similar to the Russian criminal fuckery in our elections and influence over Trump/Republicans.

Her thoughts and efforts towards paramedicine and college seem good.

When not aggravating me Tulsi was often boring.  I am a big Joe Rogan fan but he has a laymen's knowledge base, insight, and curiosity of government and politics.  Anyone with a political or governmental background should be schooling Joe.   Joe was able to speak the entire time like he knew what he was talking about.  Tulsi is supposed to be a progressive Democrat in the mold of Bernie Sanders but Sanders would have done a much more better job with everything and made more of a case for Democrats and progressives.  Instead she came off as a boring agreeable reformer who you can't even tell is a progressive or hardly a Democrat!

I wonder if she sounds like this all the time???

https://player.fm/series/the-joe-rogan-experience-142216/ep-1170-tulsi-gabbardSo Tucker Carlson recently asked people to seriously answer, how does diversity make America strong. I was disappointed with the response from the pro-diversity crowd here, as it was mostly just slurs or ad-hominem attacks that have no bearing on the question. I asked around and got accused of trolling but it's okay, I got an answer and I asked around elsewhere and got some more good answers, and some things I came up with.  I want to propose some arguments that might be an answer to that Question. I'll start with what I am more confident to least confident and go from there.

# Diversity that makes America Strong

* Diversity of experience makes for more creative problem solving. A country that is better at problem solving is a stronger country.
* Diversity of Skill sets makes for a stronger economy, a stronger economy makes for a stronger country.
* Diversity of background makes for better brainstorming - better brainstorming = better productivity.
   * This could be tied to the same idea as point 1 but let me explain a bit why it's slightly different. Diversity of experience I mean, different classes(economic), schools, degrees, personal experience basically,  where you grew up etc..*. Everyone has had to solve problems* in different ways and they bring that experience with them. Diversity of background is what I would consider more cultural or societal. So ways in which as a culture problem solving is approached. Very similar but not quite the same. Someone gave me a good example, [Why Japan’s Rail Workers Can’t Stop Pointing at Things](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pointing-and-calling-japan-trains). Borrowing some ways that a culture approaches problem solving = makes the country strong

# Diversity that might make America Strong

* Richness of cultural diversity - I would argue that having access to cultural diversity such as different cuisines, music, fashion and art makes the country richer.  I don't have a super direct way that it makes the country Stronger but I would argue that people who have access to delicious foods, beautiful art, and interesting music are going to be happier. A Happier population = a stronger country.

There is some research that appears to show that it might be a bad idea to focus on what makes a group of people different. It seems to point that if we're interested in cooperation and problem solving together, highlighting what makes us the same is more effective. So in this sense, "Diversity for the sake of Diversity" does make us weaker.

So to make america strong we might want to focus on our common goals, our common values and our common dreams. But I think the answer of, does Diversity make America strong? I'd say yes!

I'll leave you with this Quote from one of my favorite Philosophers:

&gt;The possibilities that lie in the future are infinite. When I say ‘It is our duty to remain optimists,’ this includes not only the openness of the future but also that which all of us contribute to it by everything we do: we are all responsible for what the future holds in store. Thus it is our duty, not to prophesy evil but, rather, to fight for a better world. --Karl Popper,

Guy Standing is the long time basic income researcher and advocate I'm talking about.  He's the professor on the far left side of the panel, and I think he's one of the best advocates for the idea and addressing some of the problems with the kind of micromanaging policies that social democrats favor instead of cash transfers.

&amp;#x200B;

I especially want people in this subreddit who consider yourselves hesitant of basic income and in the social democrat or worse, neoliberal camp to listen closely.  And note, Guy standings version of basic income does NOT model itself on the right wing libertarian kind, he still supports other social programs like universal healthcare in addition to basic income, but prefers the latter to several other conditional aide programs with terrible penetration rates and stigmas and abominable income clawbacks and leaving people above gutter level poverty out on their ass when it comes to social assistance that a UBI handles much better.

The one who sounded the most dated and clueless to me was the social democrat guy from Europe.ENOUGH ALREADY. It's not just that yesterday 15% of the show was spent talking about the show and promoting another fundraising campaign. It seems like that's about the daily allocation of time allotted to talking about the show in the most verbose and time-consuming manner I can imagine. There is no topic on which I ever see Pakman meander and generally just not be in a frantic rush to get through as his own show. It's often seems like an update that can be conveyed in a couple of short paragraphs worth of text, too, but has instead been scripted out into chapters. Frankly, when it comes to at least 75% of that content, I don't fucking care. Especially when it's right on the heels of an underwhelming interview that takes up even more show, and even more so yet when there is another segment in that center block of the show to take up a few minutes with fanfare and other inane, vaguely promotional bullshit.

Has this 10% extra show time been applied? I feel like it's been mentioned in the past that it has already been. It certainly doesn't feel like it. I can only speak for myself, but to the extent that a single listener's input counts, I'd like to tell you the one and only improvement I want from TDPS: More content. 

HOLD. Not more Hatriot Mail. Not more talking about people talking about things on Reddit. Not more talking about fundraising. Not getting rid of a bunch of noises that I never heard to begin with, or upgrading other aspects of the show's production that add literally nothing to the experience now that the show has had a reasonably professional a/v game for years now. Not memes about Pat drinking coffee, or even covfefe. Not some extended piece debunking shit that serious people don't buy into in the first place. Not an old interview that could have more easily been linked in the description of new content. Not random people to come in and do their show when Pakman decides he needs half of a month off. Just current events coverage; the one and only reason I ever discovered, continued listening to, and decided to fund this show. All of this other shit is noise, and it seems like it takes up a disproportionate amount of space on the show.

I'm glad David and Pat are getting a more comfortable studio. My happiness for them is the ONLY prospect presented by this latest fundraising push and its goals. Having nicer outlets and soundproofing in the studio does nothing for me. I'm sure there is an audiophile out there who listens on headphones who might say "oh neat," if they ever notice that they aren't detecting occasional, barely-audible noises anymore. Generally, I don't care if the show is done from David's laptop webcam in a public park, and I suspect I'm not alone in that. The list of tangible improvements to the show that I would make is very brief, and doesn't include just about anything mentioned yesterday.

I understand this is generally a white knight haven for Pakman and TDPS in general, and I know that some people become outraged and flustered at my posts, especially when they contain (*gasp*) swear words. That aside, I can't be the only one who has taken to sometimes skipping almost if not half of the show when I turn it on lately. This is a time to say it if so. Not that anything with the deficit is inherently wrong, but for political gain. Republicans can respond to Democrats railing against the deficit by increasing taxes (which they tend to do focus on the wealthy, and even if they do, that is a plus) or by cutting spending. 

Cutting spending is not only extremely unpopular, especially when a specific program is named, but it hurts the economy directly by reducing aggregate demand and therefore economic growth. Bush Sr. raised taxes (although he added additional loopholes for the wealthy, in net it was about a 1% income tax hike, far below the net tax increases Reagan had on the wealthy post-1982) and he cut spending and people were very angry about the Republican austerity and turned to Bill Clinton to end it. And he did. Gerald Ford’s economy also was hurt by spending cuts.

As long as Republicans get away with ramping up spending across the board and cutting taxes as much as they want, Democrats are at a disadvantage comparatively when evaluating economic performances under each President. Republicans don’t actually cut popular programs for the most part, so they get the angry racist who hates welfare as a voter and sees welfare as race (and claims simultaneously that we are a colorblind society) and the welfare recipients who claim they will never actually cut benefits. 

Not only that, everyone else in the short-term in the country benefits from the increased spending, as aggregate demand increases across the economy, giving the illusion of an improvement to the economy that the Republicans will attribute to their tax policies that have roughly a $0.04 force multiplier for every dollar cut in taxes. Additionally, if we get the Republicans to reduce the deficit that they created, they can’t force us to cut our own programs as they try to get us to do when we are in office.I don’t get the hatred of Cory Booker by the Bernie wing of the party. Cory Booker has a very liberal voting record and would be our most liberal president since Kennedy and Johnson. People criticize his charter school support, but his is very different than the Republicans plans. He wants the entire cost of charter schools to be covered by the government and not to be shared on the backs of poor parents, he wants charter schools to be run like traditional public schools, and he doesn’t want to destroy public schools (he wants to fully fund public schools and improve them as an option). 

I still support state-level funding of education at the minimum, which the conservatives on the Supreme Court have been blocking since Nixon in the 70s and would be the law if the Republicans had not stolen a Supreme Court sear and an election. Ultimately, I support federally funded education for all, to equalize educational opportunities. I think Cory Booker and I have the same goals for education.[Kyle Kulinski very upset that others will get fake news and de facto oppose enforcement of human rights.](https://youtu.be/JJoaGaFww_A) 

First off, the conspiracy theory that Assad did not bomb his civilians, that it was a false flag operation done to invite the U.S. to intervene (and all for an oil pipeline deal that was killed off years before the Syrian Civil War broke out) is the most disgusting conspiracy theory I have heard about any concern of the past 20 years. Sandy Hook conspiracy theory pales in comparison to spreading this lie about the people who were victims of Assad’s chemical warfare, many of whom were children by the way.

Assad is fighting for a fascist police state and he has been confirmed twice by U.N. investigations to have used chemical weapons. Assad also had underground torture and execution sites. His opponents/rebels in Syria include anarchist socialists and Kurds who all value human rights and have established democracy in the areas they occupy in Syria. Assad is a criminal, guilty of crimes against humanity and the most brutal dictator in the entire world. Syria is not a choice between war and peace, it is only the struggle for human rights. It is the choice between endless bloodshed and prosecution of the world’s worst criminal of the past decade.

The Syrian Civil War will not end until the rebels and Assad-opponents are exterminated. They will never, ever surrender to Assad. Either we let Assad win the war by slowing exterminating entire populations of his country, or we take out his regime and end the war that way. Those are the options for ending bloodshed in Syria. In my opinion, Assad should have been removed from office through regime change in 2013 and put on trial for crimes against humanity. Kulinski’s idea? Stay out and let them slaughter each other and let Assad commit crimes against humanity. 

Kyle Kulinski also says that “Assad is fighting terrorism (Al-Qaeda and ISIS)” without mentioning that he is also a sponsor of other terrorist groups and a fundamentalist Islamist himself. Kulinski also is either ignorant, stupid, or disingenuous when he doesn’t mention that Assad is also fighting all secular liberals in Syria, social democrats, socialists and anarchists in northern Syria. He also doesn’t mention that Assad is an enemy of the Kurds and will eventually turn to slaughtering them as well.

[United Nations investigation finds Assad responsible for chemical attacks](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-warcrimes/syrian-government-forces-used-chemical-weapons-more-than-two-dozen-times-u-n-idUSKCN1BH18W)He doesn't go into detail much and constantly does the same speech when asked questions, now obviously repitition is important to get your ideas out especially for someone who is anti establishment and doesn't get as much media attention as others, but I've seen many instances where he's asked a question and just gives the same short speech that he's been doing literally for years and I just find it really annoying that he very rarely goes in depth about his policy.

And just incase anyone has a silly reactionary response or reaction to this post, this isn't an attack on Sanders, it's a critique and I do support him and would vote for him if I was a US citizenThe Iraq War killed 200,000 civilians total through today, most of whom were killed by our opposition in Iraq, compared to minimum over 1,100,000 Iraqis executed/sent to their death directly by Saddam. Civilian deaths have gone down compared to under Saddam. The Iraqi Government itself and the Iranian Government put the death tolls around the same 200,000-300,000 range. 83% of Iraqis supported the U.S. lead removal and trial of Saddam Hussein according to Gallup polls conducted during the regime change war (which was 3 weeks). 

Iraqi Kurdistan is a universal success and the rest of Iraq is heading in the same direction. The are now a functioning democracy. Compared to Saddam Hussein who ran a fascist police state. He had mass torture sites, executions and prisons that destroyed the lives of the people and children living in Iraq. He slowly submerged children into vats of acid and inserted scolding hot rods into their orifices for crimes such as owning a satellite, passing a note, or belonging to an ethnic group he didn’t like. Saddam Hussein was also determined to exterminate both the Shiite and Kurdish populations.

Monotheism and Jihad, which lead the Iraqi insurgency (the bloodiest part of the Iraq War) with other Islamist groups, was already in Iraq with those plans as early as 1999. The sectarian violence would have been worse with a government in full support of exterminating at a minimum two Muslim minority populations. Iraq was a failed state and failed states always turn rogue before their collapse. An Iraqi Government collapsing on it’s own would lead to a full scale war by all of Iraq’s surrounding countries. 

The Ba’ath Party starting with the 1993 Faith campaigns became increasingly a fundamentalist, Islamist group. The Ba’ath Party has always wanted an empire as well. They are the main military arm and strategic mastermind of ISIS today.

Iraq’s oil is now socialized and owned by the Iraqi people under the oil of ministry. The Iraq people are now paid for their oil by any business that wants to use it. Previously, the Hussein crime family privately owned all of Iraq’s oil and personally reaped all of the profits personally.

Iraq lost its sovereignty through international law and we had every right to intervene. International law and human rights must be enforced.

Reasons for removing Saddam Hussein/reasons that Iraq lost sovereignty by international law:

1. Violation of the genocide convention

Bombing of the marshes resulting in minimum 180,000 deaths and the Kurds also resulting in minimum 180,000 deaths, resulting in a U.S. no-fly zone during Bill Clinton's administration.

2. Non-proliferation treaty

Iraq had used WMDs against Iran and its own people.
In 2003, Saddam Hussein was actively in the process of acquiring WMDs from Pakistan and uranium from Niger, which he stated that he planned on using to annex countries around him and build an empire on the threat of nuclear war if we interfered.

3. Giving aid and comfort to international terrorists

Turned Iraq into an Islamist State starting with the 1993 Faith Campaigns, supported by Saudi Arabia. Funded terrorists groups such as Monotheism and Jihad and abetted the 1993 WTC bombers as well as countless international terrorists. 

Monotheism and Jihad were his way of getting around the no-fly zones, replacing his aircraft’s extermination attempts with terrorists aimed at exterminating minority Muslim groups, specifically the Shiite and the Kurds.

4. Occupying and invading the territory of other nations

Invasion of Kuwait, Saddam said that he wished he had acquired nuclear weapons beforehand so he could make an empire.

Death toll of Saddam Hussein:


Saddam Forced his people to serve in the military during the Iran-Iraq war, so those casualties are absolutely valid.

Here are the casualties.

180,000 minimum (conservative estimate) from bombing the marshes

180,000 minimum (conservative estimate) from chemical bombing of the Kurds
The bombings were so bad that we could see them from space due to the ecological damage.

200,000 minimum (conservative estimate) from torture chambers and gulags/mass graves

500,000 minimum (conservative estimate) from Forced service in the Iran-Iraq war

50,000 minimum (conservative) Kurds in the Al-Anfal campaign

25,000 minimum (conservative) killed in the repression of the 1991 uprisings.

So 1.135 million is the lowest, most conservative estimate.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Saddam_Hussein%27s_Iraq

The upper estimates

800,000 from Iran-Iraq War

400,000 from bombing the marshes

350,000 from bombing the Kurds

250,000 from torture chambers and gulags/mass graves

100,000 Kurds in the Al-Anfal campaign

100,000 killed in the 1991 uprisings

So the upper estimate is around 2 million. Under the most conservative estimates, even if you don’t include the Iran-Iraq War, Saddam’s death toll is around 635,000 (plus more from lack of economic development, privatizing the oil for his own personal profit, etc. compared to now where it is socialized under the Ministry of Oil).
If you want to use liberal estimates of both, Saddam still has a higher death toll.
https://medium.com/dfrlab/question-that-rts-military-mission-4c4bd9f72c88Firstly, Ted Cruz's campaign manager and team have said they "didn't need signs", which many news outlets have covered, given that in historically solid Republican counties and districts here in texas, some streets are lined with Beto signs, and personally I have not seen this many signs and bumper stickers in any mid term election I can remember. 

Recently, people have been caught on camera in broad daylight and also on security cameras in the dark of night stealing Beto signs from people's lawns-Beto supporters have had their signs stolen in my area. 

So a few people decided to chip in, and bought a few hundred signs for every one sign that has been stolen, with one supporter pledging to buy a hundred signs for every one sign that is stolen! I don't think these sign theives understand that when you buy a sign, a portion of the cost of the sign counts as a donation and helps fund the campaign. So, when supporters replace the signs, it only adds more grassroots funding and more resolve. 

Just wanted to let everyone here know we're playing for keeps this time in Texas - You Beto Believe It!

I was thinking about the last night, politicians get laid a decent amount of money regardless of how other people are doing. What if we tie their yearly salary based on some fashion to the median income. Making the median income proportional to politician income will incentivize them to pass tax reforms and laws to benefit the many instead of the few. That’s my take, what do you guys think?The facts, per the Financial Times:

Paul Manafort pleaded guilty on Friday and agreed to co-operate with Robert Mueller. Manafort is the most senior figure from the Trump campaign to plead guilty and co-operate with Mueller.

The plea agreement said Manafort had agreed to co-operate in “any and all matters” required by prosecutors. That includes interviews with the special counsel’s office, turning over documents and testifying in other court proceedings.

On Friday, Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the US and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He had previously faced seven counts, including money laundering, foreign lobbying violations and witness tampering. He will be forced to forfeit several properties, including a Trump Tower condominium, funds in three bank accounts and a life insurance policy.

He was convicted by a jury in Virginia last month on eight of the 18 charges against him there, including bank fraud, tax fraud and failure to disclose foreign bank accounts. The remaining charges will be dismissed.

Mueller's office has agreed to file for reduced prison time at Manafort’s sentencing depending on his co-operation. The statutory maximum for each conspiracy count is five years.

Recent polling shows that a majority of Americans back Mueller's investigation, despite the efforts of Trump and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to discredit the probe.

However, Mueller has yet to indict any Americans for knowingly aiding Russian interference in the 2016 election. The cases against Manafort in DC and Virginia primarily involve his personal finances and his lobbying work for Ukraine’s former leader, the pro-Russia Viktor Yanukovich, who was toppled in a 2014 revolution.Someone finish this since they are all sexual predators.So far no one has claimed he ever committed a similar act upon anyone else at any other time. The claim is that he did it once. Why should he  feel the need to overemphasize his innocence? Hmm?People are comparing Kavanaugh to Roy Moore at this point, and for good reason, but this case is even more compelling because
1. A Supreme Court appointment is far weightier than Senate
2. The allegation is harsher, with violent detail 
3. The alleged victim has the backing of her therapist with 6-year-old notes.  
Senators must be going crazy, knowing they are damned either way now, but what about the House?  --This is interesting.  Unlike the Senate, they could ONLY be harmed by Kavanaugh's appointment.  Republican constituents won't vote against them if he is NOT appointed, because they had no vote.  But if he IS appointed, we are likely to see a repeat of the Alabama special election 9 months ago.  (I live there, and let me tell you, the morning after was the first time I felt good in a year).  
Yeah Jones barely won, but in a state as red as this, he "should" have lost, and by a landslide.  Roy Moore was all about banning abortion, building the wall, banning Muslims, you name it.  But what happened was Democrats coming out of the woodwork like you would never expect for a midterm, let alone a special election.  Furthermore, some Republicans just stayed home, especially women, because they believed the alleged victims.  So if the same happens as a result of a Kavanaugh appointment, the HOUSE will likely lose even more seats than predicted by the Blue Wave already. 
And you know they MUST be pointing this out to the other chamber.  I have a question for David and the audience. Do you think and or feel certification programs in tech, social work, and health field will become more valuable than say you're typical 4 years degree of Associates and Bachelor?

I'm not saying a degree is outdated nor less valuable than other. I'm asking because. The world is change and job market needs more skilled workers. Also, most employers want someone now rather later. Any good certification program will give the skills in the job requires of you.

Doctors, scientist, lawyers, and any job titles that deal with heavy duty stuff. Yes, you'll need a four-year degree for sure. I hope that makes somewhat sense. 
Our time is now. 

Your passion and  audience can have an effect that helps us look upon the bow to the future; Naught the wake in despair upon the past. 

I hope we don’t let you down, and all those who can hear me when I say this: We are fighting our future, and knowing that you and many PakPals are rooting and helping out however they can, makes a world of difference. 

Thank you, and thank you to the PakPals. 

💙Size of government you want has absolutely nothing to do with political ideology. It depends entirely on the issue and whether you side with an egalitarian policy for govt. or a despotic policy for govt. Role of government, not size of government matters for determining left/right ideology.For me, it's the following:

* free college (I am opposed);
* voter ID (I am for);
* stop and frisk (I am for, but only slightly); and
* the same federal minimum wage (I am opposed). 

What issues are you politically conservative on?[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/18/report-youtubes-alternative-influence-network-breeds-rightwing-radicalisation](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/18/report-youtubes-alternative-influence-network-breeds-rightwing-radicalisation)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

David and Kyle have both expressed deep skepticism of so called right wing domination of youtube, even though it's clear many right wing channels are growing rapidly, like Crowder, and the fact that there seem to be more politically right leaning channels there.

&amp;#x200B;

They talk about themselves and tyt, rational national is relatively new and growing, but compare their growth and total numbers vs the entire panoply of what is right leaning and I think the right clearly has more presence on youtube.

&amp;#x200B;

I could be wrong though, Destiny is on that amazing connectivity chart even though he is definitely not right leaning:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1c77d4b95ea0740d353e660282315ddb9f7fc0a/0\_0\_957\_1128/master/957.png?width=1920&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=476e59473631bb5e6f851dacc19d74c1](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1c77d4b95ea0740d353e660282315ddb9f7fc0a/0_0_957_1128/master/957.png?width=1920&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=476e59473631bb5e6f851dacc19d74c1)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And we have yet to see a chart that puts left wing figures on, but I'd imagine the left wing figures would have smaller connectivity and be more like isolated islands.  David has his own sphere, Sam Seder has his own sphere, and kyle, and tyt, there is some very minimal mixing and matching, but because many left wing shows tend to focus on news of the day/week, I think the format is less conducing than just having different left wing people on and shooting the shit about the issues of the day like so much of the right leaning youtube sphere.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Does chapo have a big youtube presence?  Or is it focused mostly on podcasts?  That would be another interesting analysis, it could be there are more left leaning podcasts, where there is more of a top down broadcast format instead of the increased interactivity of youtube.  

&amp;#x200B;

It would be interesting for David to weigh in on this.  The chart alone is fascinating to look at, and I want to see that kind of chart done for the left too.&amp;#x200B;

[ Texas Penal Code 32.48 states that you can not falsely send a 'Summons' in order to induce someone to take an action.](https://i.redd.it/wg678of794n11.jpg)Through the whole Kavanaugh process, the media has focused on Murkowski and Collins as the possible 'no' votes because they are pro-choice, and even with the Ford accusations focus has remained on them because they are women.  But I have always wondered about Flake and Corker, because neither is running for reelection and both have openly opposed Trump and many of his decisions (particularly his obstruction and hostility toward the Russia probe, and loyalty to Putin).  I just spent close to an hour googling their quotes over the past couple years and would share them here, but it would take hours more to find them all again and select the appropriate ones.  And I'm not Maddow, sure as hell don't get Maddow money.  
The thing is, for all their freedom to SAY stuff about Trump, they've had very limited power to DO anything about him, particularly in anything 'Russia' related.  But surely they see what everybody else sees, that Trump selected Kavanaugh purely for his apparent beliefs about executive power and above-the-law status of the Presidency.  It's also worth noting that they were both fond of John McCain, who will always be remembered for (among other things) that gasp-evoking thumbs-down vote on Trump's healthcare plan.  
Although both Flake and Corker have posted tweets placing apparent burden on Christine Blasey Ford to testify (or else), I believe they are both prepared to vote 'no' on Kavanaugh.  Even Corker's tweet, which would appear to credit "Grassley &lt;and&gt; Republicans" for having extended "a hand in good faith.  If we don't hear from both sides on Monday, let's vote" who's to say he isn't faking unity with Grassley et al., simply acknowledging the "good faith" as a form of subterfuge.  Come voting time, he (and Flake) could very well say, "Without hearing from Dr. Ford, I cannot vote to confirm a nominee under suspicion to this lifetime appointment" or something like that.  And they would not only be RIGHT to do that, because we don't need a possible sexual assaulter in the Supreme Courth, but they would also be RIGHT to block a possible autocrat from escaping justice.   Jimmy Dore is anti-progressive Democrat.  He is anti-Bernie Sanders.  Jimmy is a Green. He supports Greens.  He will not support most Democrats. Democrats will never be progressive enough for Dore. He does not think progressive Democrats should work with or support mainstream Democrats.  Most Democrats are mainstream and Jimmy wants them to lose against Republicans.   He does not want progressive Democratic voters to support the winner of Democratic primaries.  He wants Greens to take away enough progressive votes so that Republicans win general elections.  The Greens are extreme leftist activists who refuse to work with anyone and who do not even work well with other Greens.  They can not get more then 3% of the vote and can not win anything ever but they can take enough votes from the Democrats so that Republicans win.

Jimmy Dore is awful. Jimmy is part of the problem not the solution.

[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLpyJI0ltg](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLpyJI0ltg)We frequently here commentators criticising Trump for attacking the press? Why is this wrong? If you perceive the press as being unfair to you, should you refrain from criticising them? 

Take Jeremy Corbyn in the UK. The majority of press coverage of the man as undoubtedly been antagonistic and in many cases unfair. If Corbyn were to criticise them (and he has in some cases via his conduct), what would be wrong with this?

Is the press some sort of sacred cow?Neoliberalism refers to European liberalism which is conservatism. It refers to post-depression European liberals (conservatives) who embraced the middle ground made (regulating banks instead of nationalizing which FDR also did) and then reversing course and going back to their beliefs in laissez-faire economics. Neoliberalism is essentially closest to libertarianism, although there are nuanced differences. No Democrat is a neoliberal. All democrats are under the ideology of social democracy, including Bernie. That’s the tent of social democracy, very large.

All democrats, even Manchin, support some expansion of the public/government sector and keeping what we currently have. Republicans differ in that they not only oppose all new bold, liberal proposals which many democrats do (they are moderates by definition, supporting moderate changes, or conservative as in joe Manchin where he is skeptical of new initiatives but does support a very slow increase in programs) but republicans share that they all want to reverse current government programs including (for most republicans) nearly all of the great society programs.

It’s used by people on the liberal wing of social democracy to describe people on the conservative to moderate wing of social democracy. It is used in response to moderate and conservative social democrat’s resistance to fast change, which if they accepted would by definition make them a liberal/radical. It’s a smear and there is no truth behind it. A neoliberal would share the opposition to new liberal proposals, but they would also want to abolish nearly all government programs and current government functions. 

An accurate description of these types of Democrats would be to call them conservative. Conservative in the fashion that Richard Nixon and Dwight Eisenhower were conservative. They shared the same goals as liberals but only supported slow to moderate changes. Nixon, who originally proposed Obamacare, was to the left of center on economics for the American spectrum by the way, a social democrat. Ideological scoring puts Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama to the left of Nixon on economics, Barack Obama being the most conservative post-world War II Democratic president on economics and Bill Clinton being the most moderate of the three mentioned presidents.They all keep showing Trump's tweet demanding the criminal filings that would exist if Blasey's assault was as bad as she says or if her parents loved her, and yes that's disgusting, but what about the incredible shit McConnell said to a crowd yesterday.  "We're going to plow right through this" and Kavanaugh WILL be confirmed to the Supreme Court??  Is he indicating that all the GOP Senators have vowed to vote for him no matter what happens in the testimony?  Why is this horrific thing being ignored?  We already know Trump is pond scum but McConnell is doing more than farting out an old man opinion here--he is indicating intent to confirm a Justice no matter how evil he may be, and that the hearings literally mean nothing, are just something to "plow right through."It's not just he-said-she-said if there is documentation of the attack in those therapy notes from 6 years ago. This is the thing that has galled me from day one. --Why isn't EVERYONE demanding more clarity on that? Kavanaugh supporters dismiss the notes because he wasn't specifically named and they state there were 4 males in the room. On the other hand, Dr. Blasey's husband (ex-husband? I'm not even clear on that) could testify that she DID tell him it was Kavanaugh. And who was this therapist? What were his/her therapy procedure regarding note-taking? Some therapists don't record their notes until after a session, in which case the discrepancy of '4 males in the room' versus 'four males in the house' could be easily understood, particularly since the therapist would have no way of knowing how crucial these details would be to the whole country in six years. It makes me want to pull my hair out that even the blabbermouth talking heads aren't weighing these questions, never mind why neither the husband nor therapist can testify in the hearing. --Doctor/patient confidentiality would not be an issue with the patient's full consent, so that's no excuse. I sure hope Dr. Blasey at least gets to offer detailed answers to these particular questions, because in my view the notes are key to this whole thing.You have adequate food and water, as well as snacks and firewood. Murder or suicide is not an option, obviously. 

Discuss. Explain yourselves.a) This is FOX's additional  source adding more juice to NYT story r/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/09/21/rosenstein-reportedly-discussed-wearing-wire-invoking-25th-amendment-against-trump.html

&gt; **Fox News has learned a key meeting took place on May 16, 2017 at  Justice Department headquarters. During the meeting, the subject arose  of the possibility of appointing a special counsel to investigate Russia  election meddling, according to a source. Several people were in the  room, including former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and former FBI  counsel Lisa Page. Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel the  next day.**   
&gt;  
&gt;“I remember this meeting and remember the wire  comment,” a source who was in the room told Fox News. “The statement was  sarcastic and was never discussed with any intention of recording a  conversation with the president.”

b) and this is Hannity's way of summarizing it for his audience by adding more SPIN...in the headlines to suggest that it was all a deep-state consipracy in FBI

 REPORT: Lisa Page and Rosenstein Discussed Special Counsel, Recording the President ([https://www.hannity.com/media-room/report-lisa-page-and-rosenstein-discussed-special-counsel-recording-the-president/](https://www.hannity.com/media-room/report-lisa-page-and-rosenstein-discussed-special-counsel-recording-the-president/)) 

&amp;#x200B;I have in previous posts explained that I think we need reforms to the Supreme Court. This business with Kavanaugh has also made me realize that we should reform the nominating process.

&amp;#x200B;

With Kavanaugh the Republicans tried to rush the confirmation once they learned they didn't vet their candidate properly. I propose a constitutional amendment which would make it so once a candidate for supreme court has been presented by the person in power (whether it be by president in the current system or prime minister in a hopeful government reform) that candidate CAN'T be voted on for a minimum of one month. Give the public time to learn about a candidate and remove the option to "rush" a candidate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;With some exceptions, my family has always voted Republican, but as of late, partially because I talk about Beto, but also because of the increasing troubling economic issues (my dad owns a business that relies on many foreign raw materials, and has also seen his company's employee premiums actually INCREASE for the next fiscal year)...many members of my family are extremely troubled with what they percieve as "not the Republican party I knew, not anymore" and "I don't think Trump seems mentally competent, at this point."

What tipped them over the top was the migrant child separation by ICE and as of late, one of my parents calling me to talk about some issues and the behavior of the Republican party specifically regarding Trump meeting with Kim Jong Un and meeting with Putin. 

My parents are in their mid 60's and my grand parents are in their 80s. They're pretty well off financially. 

Have any of you had family members - or friends -  who finally realize that the GOP and conservatives aren't operating in our political process in good faith?When I called into the show a couple of months ago after Kavanaugh was nominated and I received backlash for a subreddit post cautioning making this particular nomination a midterm election issue, I mentioned a big problem with the progressive base: **judge appointments are a voting issue for conservatives, but not for progressives**. It's why so many people *reluctantly* voted for Trump, and why some non-Trump conservative pundits and commentators (Amanda Carpenter, Joe Walsh, Meghan McCain, Ben Shapiro, etc.) expressed gratitude for Trump's presidency upon hearing the news that Justice Kennedy was retiring.

The circus that is the Kavanaugh nomination is motivating progressives now for the midterms, but I think it may be too little, too late, and it feels like we're always playing defense. We need to be proactive and make appointing liberal judges and justices a voting issue to at the very least bring balance back to the judicial branch, if not to control it and make progressive change easier. 

Additionally, we need more liberal organizations centered on courts, a foil to the Judical Crisis Network and Federalist Society, if you will. Anyone know of any such organizations that already exist?

*Update on my views of how Red State Democratic Senators should vote on Kavanaugh*:
At first, I thought it would be more advantageous for these Sentators - including my own Joe Donnelly - to save the political capitol and vote in favor. A lot has been revealed since then (falsehoods in the hearings, sexual misconduct allegations, failure to clarify whether he believes birth control and Plan B are abortofacients, etc.) and in light of that, I have changed my mind. They must vote against confirmation.I keep hearing about whether or not Republicans "have" enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh, and also whether any 'red-state' Democrats will vote to confirm him. --That speculation always seems to be expressed like, "They'll wait to see how Collins and Murkowski vote." I get the "why's" of all this, in other words I don't need the politics explained; what I don't know is the nuts n' bolts about indicating their votes.
I just watched the Gorsuch vote to try to get an understanding. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4TlOo0-p50&amp;t=2728s I noticed that a list was read of Senators voting 'aye' and 'no', followed by all the Senators not already on those lists being asked for their vote, there on the floor. I noticed those calls for votes were not in alphabetical order, so if they were ordered in some way I don't know what it would be. And I also found thishttps://www.cnn.com/2017/03/27/politics/neil-gorsuch-whip-list/index.html which was published a few days before the floor vote, and lists some Senator's statements with the dates that they made them. So I have it partially figured out. But a couple questions remain: 1. Can a Senator change their mind after they've made a public statement like those shown in the link? Has that ever happened? 2. Does literally nobody know the votes of those who don't cast them until the actual vote date, on the floor? 3. How could any undecided Senator do what everyone says they'll do (wait to see how certain others vote), if they aren't called in the right order? Like say it's Manchin's turn, but he doesn't yet know how Murkowski or Collins will vote?
Sorry this is so long, I just wanted to make clear what I already know versus don't know.The women chosen by the republicans is just as likely as any misogynist male to unfairly attack Ford's testimony. A women being elected here is all about optics. Its not that the congressional panel sitting in judgement of this issue is composed of all men that's the problem. Its WHO those men are. David has said many times that we have to 'Vote Them Out' 

He has said this on more than one occasion, including using the phrase 'The only way...is to vote them out' 

I have been volunteering for the Beto for Senate campaign for over a year - and have invested my time, my money, and my heart in what we are fighting for here in Texas, which is progress not just for our State, but for our nation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the disdain for Ted Cruz - I hear it from Beto supporters, and I hear it while canvassing - but I also speak to people who are undecided, and try to ensure that we're not just seeking partisanship but partnership. Along with turnout - make no mistake that it is moderate republicans who are not keen on Cruz that are crucial to our campaign and this vote in November. This is not a theoretical issue: In at least one county, there are republicans for Beto groups that have organized and hosted events. 

 

**If we are to vote them out, and we need every vote we can get - heckling people out of restaurants, with their family member(s) is not productive, and does not help change the fundamental elements of this election.** 

&amp;#x200B;

When someone is with their family member(s), yelling things at them, does not help us motivate voters who are independent, or undecided.  

It does not help to perpetuate and embolden those who view the left and liberals as being affiliated with Antifa, see protests and still say 'sore losers' (in re: 2016 election), and it does nothing to assist in our efforts to mobilize support - and as I believe from my experience, it will not help change hearts, and minds. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a fan of Pakman, and I most always agree with him, but I cannot concur with his viewpoint that at this point because we are 'running out of \[options\]' that we need to begin actively protesting by harassing people in their public life. Where exactly does this line get drawn with regard to family members? If his kids were with him, is it okay for him to be shouted down at a restaurant? 

Is this what those of us who identify as progressives truly seek to affirm and espouse? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am interested in thoughts of PakPals on this issue. Do some Jimmy Dore idiots really believe that there is no difference between Democrats and Republicans being in office? Shouldn’t they move to Alabama, since it is no different than being in a state run by democrats, like New York. They are emotionally invested in cognitive dissonance of reality...Answering only the first words of a question he allows a woman to speak, ranting for several minutes about how assault accusers are paid liars covered up by fake news, not allowing the woman to try again to ask her question, telling her she's been asking for ten minutes, commanding her to sit down.﻿This circus of a supreme court nomination had me thinking about how the Republicans claim that these accusations against Kavanaugh are fake. According to Republicans these accusations are made by either the Democrats or the left just to keep him off the court. My question then is why didn't Neil Gorsuch go through this type of incident? Relatively speaking, the Gorsuch confirmation went through with no hick ups or reveals of a horrible personal life. 

&amp;#x200B;

While by no means definitive proof, the fact that within about a year we are seeing two judges equally right wing on the issues have radically different nomination circumstances I'm convinced that the accusations against Kavanaugh are real. Claire McCaskill, Joe Donnelly (hope restored for me personally), and Doug Jones will all vote no.All the existing science seems to be old and based on extremely rough guesses and conjecture. If there are arguments for keeping it that way, then give them, those arguments should be known.

Many different scenarios could be considered. Also, it probably matters greatly on what time of year it happens. Nuclear war in november is different than in june...

There are 2 different considerations here: Should it be known and if so, what are the answers? First is more political and philosophical question and the second is more about physics and climate science / meteorology.

If your answer is that it is not worth knowing because world would end anyway, that is based on one scenario with one set of scientific assumptions that are extremely inaccurate. Also, it does not have to be actually possible to happen, for the answers to be worth knowing.

For the science part, link to this discussion:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/9im94a/i_read_about_nuclear_winter_in_the_early_90s_in/
Racism is the belief that one race is biologically superior to the other. Diversity policies and affirmative action are based upon the belief that there is no race biologically superior to another and that there is no biological basis for race in the first place, which is a scientific fact. The majority-subset of those who oppose diversity policies and affirmative action do so because they believe that one race is prone to working harder, being smarter, more athletic, etc. are racist by definition. 

This needs to be pushed back against whenever it is said. It is the people who oppose diversity policies that are racists, from David Duke to Ronald Reagan to Paul Ryan to Charles Murray. Those who embrace the idea that there are no biological races and that there is no superior race, like MLK or Kennedy or Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, are champions of civil rights and equality. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.Ah yes, Antifa, and how about those Hillary emails!  And Bengazi!

Numbers.  How many members of Antifa are there?  What percent of the left constitutes Antifa?  What percent agrees with Antifa?

If the answer is almost none, then why focus on them constantly unless the point is to conflate their ideology with that of the left more broadly?  That is what Rubin conservative types like to do.

And classical liberal being aligned with the left during its inception hundreds of years ago when the right was some sort of monarchy or feudal model is completely useless.  We are talking about TODAY man.  TODAY.  Not the past.  That is why Rubin is such a cluster fuck and smoke screen of a man.  Such a dishonest man, that you seem to love going to bat for.  You must LIKE the muddy waters.

Classical Liberal is basically most similar to a light version of libertarianism.  Ever since the changes after the gilded age, where even REPUBLICANS became a bit closer to modern liberalism with Teddy Roosevelt, and later FDR, and even his republican opponent!

If you are FOR governmental reforms, AND opposed to government meddling in principle, or taxes, you are not really aligned with the modern left at all.  And Dave dodges when he gets caught out with the weakness of his libertarian/conservative economic fluff

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6H0dgCvDHw&amp;t=10m5s

He sounds like a god damn republican.  Not a man of the left.  The left today, not 80 years ago, not 200 years ago.  If you called someone GAY, when he was not gay, then when you got blasted for it complained that you were referring to the older meaning of HAPPY, you're still a dishonest little lying weasel of a man.  Because you KNOW the modern connotation, you KNOW what it's associated with, and looking at Dave Rubin and saying HE ought to be classified as a man of the left, in 2017, is a fucking JOKE.

And Frankly, as I said earlier, being socially liberal on gay issues in 2017 is no longer a proper test for right left distinctions due to the shifts in attitudes, in large part because of what the REAL liberals were pushing for in the culture as we fought the people who Dave Rubin now aligns himself with (I remember listening to Dennis Prager argue on air repeatedly not ONLY that we needed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, but he was aligned with the right to keep gays from serving in the military openly).

The ACTUAL MODERN LEFT are the ones who fought against and beat that shit back.  Not conservatives.  Libertarians?  They gave moral support, but the ones who VOTED republican because their ECONOMIC interests were superior to others did not help tear dadt down, democratic/LIBERAL control of congress did.  And a democratic LIBERAL president.


EVERYTHING is about culture with you liars.  You think that is the only area where you have an argument that can win the day, so you  caricature and inflate the worst elements of the radical left, and brow beat the entire group, or worse, try to redefine away non crazy people on the left as not REALLY part of the left:

http://secularjihadists.libsyn.com/ep24-dave-rubin-joins-the-jihadists

Skip to 37:52 to hear Rubin, In his OWN WORDS, talk about why HE focuses on the left, hear the counter by one of the hosts.

Note, at one point, Rubin describes the right as having FACTIONS that can be broken apart from good to bad actors, but the LEFT?  ALL shit.  He made no such distinction there, and when the host brought up people associated with the left, Majid Nawaz (Dave calls him a classical liberal but he almost CERTAINLY would not jump on board Rubins libertarian economics), Sam Harris (who Dave says does not describe himself as a "progressive" (and?  does that mean he is not part of the broader left Dave?), Bill Maher (who dave wonders if he still associates himself with progressives [as if to say, not sure if he's LEFT that group yet like "I" the enlightened one has], Dawkins, Matt Dill..., etc etc.

Dave SECTIONS those people off from the broader LEFT, people that are CLEARLY not aligned with fucking ANTIFA, and treats the entire left as more of a monolith of trash and something to be fought against.  But the right?  Factions, some good, some bad, but not like the LEFT.

Clear as day.  I have evidence with Rubins own words, keep defending his slimy self, you're as bad as he is.Thanks for the clarification. I stand corrected. Hope I can still visit Canada.(?)oops, it didn't format properly. I gave a link in the text to a page with proper formattingthank you very much. Trump and the rest of the government seem to be separate entities.

Yes, FEMA is under the DHS wing, which is subordinate to the president. But I feel that Trump's input to their functions is infinitesimal, if not zero at all. They do their job, Trump plays golf and occasionally tweets.
I'm of the camp that a single payer system needs to be 100% controlled by government, vs governments paying private docs and private hospitals. You do have a point. The administration is clearly doing its job. However, I get the feeling it is doing its job well exactly because Trump is not involved in it.

What I would like to see is a President who doesn't look like he gets the real news by reading them off the teleprompter. 

The way he announced the relief efforts is just embarrassing. It looked like he doesn't know what is going on in his administration. On the contrary, he was very informed on the Charlotte debacle, you can clearly see that he can hold a few kilobytes of the information in his head. But in this situation he is clueless, he was not interested in PR relief at all.the private docs want to see patients and may put that above redirecting the patient to an available doctor. Woah Woah Woahhh...

David has a lot going on, you should do some research on your own, and also, Amazon UK, who knows how important or relevant purchasing power by debilitated UK Citizens is - remember:

America first. 

America. First. I agree with most of your points but one I wanted to address because it's relevant to your post. 

On your 4th point you talk about hillary being hugely unpopular. Actually she received a high approval rating among voters in an NBC poll during her time as Secretary of State. Her approval ratings were in the mid 60's during 2011-2013ish and starting to dip during 2014 probably because of the Benghazi scandal. 

Source: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-approval-rating-secretary-state-w/I read this title, and this comes to mind 
[I'm skeptical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw)Wow, Russia is now such a powerful player. They are everywhere.

Russians basically figured out a way to control the world :-)

And we can do nothing, but watch in awe and despair. 

We are doomed. Russians have finally figured out how to Russia, and they are going to Russia us ruthlessly until we surrender.

COME ON. Turn your brains on. Russians can't play any big role. PEOPLE do. If Russians are so powerful, why are they so poor still?

Why do they use AMERICAN products, like twitter and facebook to "influence" the world?

And why do we act so surprised, when they play the same political games everyone is playing? Do you remember the scandals with US intelligence spying on foreign leaders?Just to add a bit more of common sense

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7R5TGUGwnMThe reason black Africans are over represented in elite schools is because the ones that migrate to the US are selected from more elite circles.  

They are smarter than the average American black, get better grades, score higher on standardized tests.  Why?  Because like most elites, they tend to have a higher concentration of smarter more elite people.

Black slaves were a random sample of africans from Africa, african college students are selected from the elites.

Of course the latter group is going to perform better and have an easier time in elite institutions.   And it has nothing to do with institutional racism, and everything to do with what kind of sub population of people we are talking about.  Other American black people can still get into ivy league schools, if they have the grades and test scores.  And if they do not?  There are plenty of other schools they can get into.

Don't like that reality?  Then we need smarter American blacks.  The variable of the differential success here is not the external suppression of people because of their blackness, most african blacks are MORE black than American blacks.  The difference is a mix of class differences and genetic differences in iq and natural ability.

It's like when I was in an uber pool in the los angeles area.  I was riding in a car with this guy from Iran, we were chatting on our way back to the downtown area.  His destination was USC, he was a dental student in a graduate program there.  He had already gone to dental school in Iran but needed to get credentialed here.  His parents?  Both doctors.  The apple does not fall far from the tree.  It's in the blood/genes.  Smart parents?  = more likely to have smarter kids.

People and populations of people are NOT equal.  It's not fair, but that is the god damn reality.  Deal with it.  My solution?  Genetic engineering and human enhancement.  I don't like that fact that american blacks have lower average iq compared to other groups, and no external intervention is going to solve that, so we have to solve it by changing the genes and selecting for higher intelligence and general aptitude. Fix the dice of nature.  Then you will see more American blacks in ivy league schools.  Or, you can do as most people on my left side do, pretend we are all equal, and that equality is built into NATURE itself.  An absurd belief.&gt;  the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us.

One of the great ironies of the anti sjw side, especially weasels like Dave Rubin and other so called defenders of TRUE liberal values, is that they align themselves with the enemies of the liberal world and a liberal world order.Look, the establishment won. Don't you see that both Hillary and Trump are, and were, the preferred candidates for the wealthy class.

The whole republican party was basically the contest on who can kiss the asses of Koch brothers the most.

Trump is an interesting case, it looks like he was just one of those hedging bets. Diversify your portfolio kind of candidate. Look who is in his cabinet and it becomes instantly apparent who he mingled with when he announced his candidacy.

Hillary was a good bet, but there was a dangerous candidate: Sanders. 

And they won. They managed to make the public watch the Hillary vs Trump feud. They thought this will distract the public from Bernie's message, and they succeeded.

It seems that the original plan was to kick Bernie to the curb, then Hillary will win. They miscalculated, but in the end, Trump is just as good as Hillary. 

There is no point to waste our energy and attention to what Hillary has to say. She is irrelevant. I think we need to do two things:

 - Get the likes of Bernie and Elizabeth Warren to senate and congress

 - Get either Bernie or Elizabeth Warren elected in 2020.The voice of reason... 

Futile your attempts at getting heard are...

You drown in the roar of raging stupidity...

So cruel is nature and the laws of statistics...And the twittler in chief is actively sabotaging the effort... unsuccessfully.

I get a feeling Trump is completely irrelevant in making any decisions...That is not my problem.Property crimes are fairly common in rural areas, and can potentially be violitile if the robbers are armed. Dumping trash and construction waste on her property is more  common, but robberies happen too. My grandma gets robbed all the time, she has a 25 acre property here in Hillsboro, Oregon (Portland metro area). Yes, Hillsboro is generally considered a suburb, but she lives in the Argiculture development boundaries, important to clarify. we've never had a home invasion (as far as we know) but we have had several expensive things stolen. For instance, my dads mini bike, my dad's brand new trailer and my brand new off-roading tires were stolen from her property in the warehouse located on her property. If I happened to be on a walk while they were taking our stuff, who knows what they might do to me. 

If someone uninvited came on the property, my intuitions and experience with common knowledge is: think before I pull out the rifle. Misunderstandings happen, so it's best to be make sure the parties involved aren't up to anything criminal. They could be looking for a neighborhood and google maps showed them to the wrong house, happens. At the time I posted this, only 2 were dead. Sounds like the 48 suffered in an agonizing death hours later, smh. This is flat out terrible news. Cars/trucks could be used for mass murder, I don't see you trying to ban themThat's what I thought.The proximity from the terrorist to the victims is irrelevant. A bunch of dead people is still a bunch of dead people. Just because the weapon in question is used for more close range attacks or not does not mean we should be taking away people's second amendment rights.  

Banning semi auto's will only increase profits to black market gun distributors, and those profits will most likely be used to peddle harder drugs like meth and herion. I've said this before and I'll say it again;  It's not worth reaching out to people that are that far gone.  The only people that can get them out of the intellectual ditch they've gotten themselves into are themselves.  The only thing that you can do is listen to what they are saying if they are the patient type.  Listen and throw in some questions as though you were genuinely curious.  Do this in a way that doesn't directly challenge their beliefs but also forces them to see the logic tree they may not have seen before.  In other words, asking some questions, plus their earnest need to answer you truthfully, will force them to think of the situation in a new way.

However, that will only work on those that aren't absolutely militant over their beliefs.  Some are honest people that got swept up by the arguments and misinformation circulating.  Others are just not good people and base their beliefs around how they view others unlike themselves.Depends on what restrictions we're talking about. If we are talking about banning fully auto's, grenade launchers, fine I got no problem with that. As for semi auto rifles like AR15's and AK47's, people need them for home defense, so to ban them will most definitely increase crime. Multiple gun men, from medium range, approximately 100-150 meters. If you have a higher powered scope, you can probably hit 250-300 meters with ease. Some people are even able to reach 900 meters with their AR15's but those are customized, and generally are a different caliber compared to the standard .223/5.56 AR15 round. Wrong. Most people need guns for self protection. You've got to be kidding me. -.-I would never say someone is long gone. If you are patient with a mass of people on the wrong side of an issue and you show them respect you will convert enough of them to neutralize their threat. How will making semi auto rifles illegal decrease the number of mass shootings? Gun nuts will go crazy and retaliate. Cartels will start selling more and more of these rifles, because it's not like the demand for these rifles will disappear. People in rural areas prefer AR15's and AK's for self protection. If anything, making semi auto rifles will make the war on drugs more deadly, and gun ownership a crime. What is a psychologist gonna do if people are trespassing on your property and harming and threatening property owners? Absolutely nothing!  Probably just tell you that only crazy people own guns, and treat you like an idiot for using your second amendment rights to protect yourself and your family. Pure dogmatism is completely ineffective. Look, Russia spent about $150K on facebook ads. While Hillary and Trump spent billions. If their ads (Russian) make that much of a difference, Americans deserve to be conquered by Russia, since they obviously are too stupid to use their money with even a fraction of Russian efficiency. And the world will be a much better place, if smarter individuals get to control these vast resources.

But, I doubt American political strategists are that stupid.This is a question of optimization.

Obviously we would like to have everyone on our side. But we don't get everyone, so we just need to get enough to get the job done.

Now the question is, how much work do we need to do to get enough people on our side? Well apparently we need to persuade the D/K people, since their votes just about to destroy the US economy. Maybe we don't argue with them. Maybe we just give them a handful of catchy slogans they would be willing to rally behind.

Something like:

 - Make America work together

 - Healthy nation - prosperous nation

 - Debt is a ticking bomb

 - Don't ask what your politician can do for you, ask how you can make him do it for you.You just never had a good suit.

A good suit has to be made for your body. And a store suit, no matter how expensive, is made for an average man.

Some stores may carry a suit that just happens to fit you well, but that would be a lucky coincidence.No, I don't have the money to buy me a taylor made suit, but I happen to find a lucky fit in one of the upscale vendors. 

That suit made a lot of difference.I repeat, if Russian (or any other) trolls are so successful, your politicians are doing a very bad job and your society has a very big problem.

Don't blame the Russians, fix the problem.Google and Facebook amplify the things we click on.

Garbage in - garbage out.Look, this does happen. It just never get a widespread coverage like the tragedy we are witnessing.

https://crimeresearch.org/2016/09/uber-driver-in-chicago-stops-mass-public-shooting/&gt; we're all aware of the priests predilection for young boys.

the fuck has that got to do with homosexuality? you realize pedo child molesters and gay men aren't the same thing. why the fuck are you conflating catholic preist molesting little boys with homosexuality

&gt; the lady doth protest too much, methinks

yeah you're right, straight people have nothing to do with anti gay extremism, it's all gay peoples fault&gt; Ridiculous laws by some ridiculous people who for all we know want to derive a perverted pleasure from this because they can't come out of the closet in such a homophobic society

yeah bigoted straight people couldn't possibly be responsible for this, once again the straight liberals let us silly gays know that it's actually us who are persecuting gay people and straight people couldn't possibly be bigoted against usIn other words, be like any other first world nations.  We are the third world of first world nations.In his mind, these sort of tests are meaningless, as he thinks people like himself go beyond definition.  He may have been flippant about it.  That's my assumption. you a liberal? or are you one of those conservative trolls?  do you have an actual response to anything in my post or are you just gonna go "lulz triggered" like a dumb dumb&gt; Why do you think that "90% of liberals love calling homophobes gay"? I believe you might have across some nasty sub-group of social media comments, and not a very representative one

The reaction and response to homophobia across the board is to call the bigot gay, and completely ignore the fact that the vast majority of them are bigoted straight people.

&gt; but I can imagine how some might ask if the vilest homophobes are so because of their own repressed impulses

can you imagine someone asking the same for anti semitism, anti muslim bigotry, literally any other form of bigotry in the world? why do so many straight liberals have such difficulty grasping that many straight people in the world really,really hate gay people, not beacuse they're gay but becuase they are bigots and religious extremists

&gt; I also don't think that "literally 99% of homophobes are straight

why not? what percentage of anti gay bigots do you think are gay?

&gt; considering so many high-profile homophobes were "caught" doing what they condemned

why aren't you considering the fact that the amount of anti gay extremists who get caught in gay sex scandals is completely miniscule? are you unaware of the fact that for every one of those guys there's literally thousands who are just bigoted straight people, and they obviously don't get plastered all over the media

&gt; There is apparently a correlation between the most hostile individuals and undercover same-sex desires

Do you think the the people responsible for the worst anti gay persecution in the world, the chechen concentration camps, the countries with the death penalty, the brutal hate crimes are gay? 

"The prejudice of homophobia may also stem from authoritarian parents, particularly those with homophobic views as well, the researchers added."
"Ryan cautioned, however, that this link is only one source of anti-gay sentiments." (this quote is particularly important) no one is denying that gay homophobic extremists exist, the vast majority of homophobia in general and anti gay extremism comes from bigoted straight people and has absolutely no realtion to repressed homosexuality.

&gt; I agree "lol he's gay" is not a serious response. I also don't think it's representative of liberals (your words) or allies in general.

it absolutely is. I don't even know how you could deny that

https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/pop-psych/201608/homophobia-isnt-repressed-homosexuality ( It's just astonishing that whenever the topic of homophobia occurs, it is almost automatically reduced to the homophobes own surpressed urges, as if all of homophobia was just a civil war among LGBT's themselves.)
https://the-orbit.net/almostdiamonds/2012/04/23/about-those-gay-homophobes/

I realize you almost certainly don't give enough of a shit about this issue to read any of those links, but if you want to educate yourself on how sick and tired many of us in the community are of this rhetoric i'd encourage you to read some of them
&gt; But when these jokes are made - and they are jokes

Why are straight liberals so incapable of responding to or discussing homophobia without turning into a joke for their own amusment?, they do not do this with any other form of bigotry, not a single one.

&gt; that a lot of hate often is simply projection

Not really, it's really annoying that I have to keep repeating this but the vast majority of homophobic bigotry is just straight people who hate gay people, the reasons they hate gay people range from religious indocrtination to some desire to appear tough and manly.

&gt; But the ones that are made fun of - like Roy Moore was made fun of by Bill Maher last friday - are most likely at the top of the hypocritical pyramid

I just want to make sure that you understand that Moore is heterosexual, there is no evidence what so ever he is gay, you know that right?

&gt; I'm also feeling weird that a somewhat homophobic reaction is used to discredit homphobes

good, you should feel weird about that, can you imagine if the reaction of the vast majority of liberals to neo nazism was to go "hahah they're jews hahahah" everyone would realize how absolutely insulting to jewish people that would be.

I hope you'll read some of these to get an idea about how many of us in the community feel about this shit
 &gt; It is easier for people to believe that their most heinous villains have something inherently wrong with them - some internal conflict that brings out their worst impulses

I don't necessarily beleive this is the reason they do it though, it's just cause they really love calling republicans etc gay. and calling homophobes gay is the only chance to get to call people gay then all laugh amongst themselves as they call people gay. in any other context this behaviour is easily identified as homophobic.

&gt; I do believe that there is a statistical correlation to closeted homosexual people in homophobic societies rising to prominence as proponents of homophobia

do you have any evidence of this?, becuase I find it hard to believe, and I also find the desire of many straight liberals to label the worst homophobes in the world gay extremely insulting and quite frankly disturbing. as if the idea that a straight man would want gay people tortured, murdered etc is hard to believe. One of the guys on TYT done it with ramzan kadyrov, I found it incredibly distastefull. 
 &gt; No internal conflict about homosexuality needed.

not to mention the fact that 50% of the US population in 1999 thought gay sex shouldn't be legal, do these people think half of america was gay 18 years ago&gt; But hey, feel free to share the sources for the first numbers you used (90%, 99%), since I seem to be so lost and complicit.

The fact that the vast majority of straight liberals do this should be obvious to you, they do it en masse every sinlge time homophobia comes up without fail. and I don't literally mean 99% of homophobes are straight, I obviously have no way of determining what percentage of anti gay bigots are straight or gay but it should be obvious to anyone who knows even the most basic things about bigotry that the amount of homophobes who are gay is tiny. 

&gt; I pointed you to a paper that says there is a correlation, and that assumed correlation is what people might refer to

the people calling every sinlge person who does or says something homophobic gay don't give a fuck about facts, they simply just enjoy calling them gay because it amuses them. that study isn't evidence to just immediately assume someone is gay because they're a homophobe, which is what most straight liberals do

&gt; I'm neither straight nor uninterested as you imply at the end of your comment, and I wouldn't have taken the time to reply otherwise

well I apologise, I just assumed you wouldn't want to read any of thatI imagine it's done in part to piss off the conservative, because the worst thing that you can imply to a conservative is that he's gay, even though it's not a problem for liberals.  

And there is truth to homophobes tending to be suppressed homosexuals themselves.  Not all, obviously, but the most vehemently anti-homosexuals do tend to be gay/bi.  It reaches a point where their hate and disgust reaches levels that makes it clear that they are projecting.  It's obvious to most people.

A number of vehemently anti-gay legislators in politics tended to get caught having sex with men in bathrooms.  The saying, "The lady doth protest too much, methinks." fits for many such as these.

So to a liberal, calling another person gay isn't an insult since it's not controversial or compromising in any way in our worldview.  However, it is for many conservatives, so it's done to poke the bear.  It's amusing sometimes to see people get upset at being called something that is so natural and normal.

I'm bi myself and it doesn't bother me when liberals use this.

If you are gay and struggling, you deserve what comes to you if you actively attack other peoples rights because you can't accept yourself as you are.  I've debated this for some time.  I get the idea of trying to "rescue" anti-gay homosexuals, but there are those that can't accept themselves to the point where they don't want anyone else to live their lives.  They've reached a point where they are creating victims rather than being a victim.  It's self-imposed victimhood.  Almost like an obsessed lover that doesn't have their feelings returned to them, so they figure if they can't have that one then no one should.  It's selfish and I think everyone's responsible for their own emotions.&gt; although I don't think it's a valid equivalency

I certainly think the worst homophobes in the United States are comparable to neo nazis, take Tony Perkins or Scott Lively for example, the family research council(tony perkins is the leader) lobbied the Ugandan government to introduce the death for homosexuality and Scott Lively also travelled to African countries to enflame anti gay sentiments by spreading propaganda, they're actively inciting genocide essential against gay people in foriegn countries. And the gay conversion "therapy" camps all across america as particulaly vile, they are essentialy torture camps for gay kids, so I would definetly say that some of these anti gay extremists are comparable to neo nazis. although that doesn't really matter I was just using that to illustrate my point about why it's bad.

&gt; I hadn't thought before of comparing the response to homophobes to a response to, say, nazis. It's an interesting point, although I don't think it's a valid equivalency

another thing I want to add is just compare the responses to literally any other form of bigotry against any group in the world, they way they respond to homophobia is markedly different. the reason I used neo nazism as a example is because i don't think anyone let alone the majority of liberals would dare to call anti semites jews, it's just so obviously in poor taste
&gt; I imagine it's done in part to piss off the conservative, because the worst thing that you can imply to a conservative is that he's gay, even though it's not a problem for liberals

The worst thing you can imply to an anti semite is that they're a jew, nobody does that though because it's so obviously insulitng and disrespectful to jewish people.If this was actually the reason they done it they do the same thing to other bigots but they conveinently only trot out that excuse when they need to justify calling people gay.

http://angryblackhoemo.com/2017/05/03/dear-allies-stop-using-gay-insult/

&gt; And there is truth to homophobes tending to be suppressed homosexuals themselves

No there isn't, the amount of homophobes who are repressed gay/bi people is absolutely miniscule, and it certainly isn't so high as to just inexplicably assume someone is gay because they are a homophobe

&gt; but the most vehemently anti-homosexuals do tend to be gay/bi

NO, completely false, the most vehemently homophobic tend to be bigoted straight people

&gt; A number of vehemently anti-gay legislators in politics tended to get caught having sex with men in bathrooms. The saying, "The lady doth protest too much, methinks." fits for many such as these.

and the vast majority are just bigoted straight people who hate gay people because they're bigots, the ones who are straight don't get plastered all over the media, how is a tiny number of anti gay bigots turning out to be gay or bi justification for assuming literally every single right wing bigot who is homophobic is gay?

&gt; So to a liberal, calling another person gay isn't an insult since it's not controversial or compromising in any way in our worldview. However, it is for many conservatives, so it's done to poke the bear. It's amusing sometimes to see people get upset at being called something that is so natural and normal.

they are still using gay as an insult against conservatives, which is homophobic, they literally admit that they are saying "cause they're insulted by it" which is using it as an insult, although that actually has nothing to do with why they call them gay, they call them gay because they find it hilarious and amusing.and I also have a very hard time beileving that the masses of straight liberal guys going "hahah he's gay hahahaah gay, get it guys I called him gay hahaahah gay" has no element of ridicule or gay shaming in it, i think you would need to be incredibly naive to think it didn't.

&gt; If you are gay and struggling, you deserve what comes to you if you actively attack other peoples rights because you can't accept yourself as you are. I've debated this for some time. I get the idea of trying to "rescue" anti-gay homosexuals, but there are those that can't accept themselves to the point where they don't want anyone else to live their lives.

I'm confused by this bit, do you think I have some desire to "rescue" scummy self loathing bigoted gay right wingers? because I don't, I simply want straight liberals(as well as the lgbt people who defend this behaviour) to stop responding to homophobia by calling people gay, it's insulting as fuck, wrong in the vast majority of cases, makes no sense, and hinders any real discussion about anti gay bigotry and it also trivialises homophobia as if it's some sort of civil war amongst gay people that's got nothing to do with straight people

&gt; Except people hiding behind hate in an attempt to deflect suspicion and project onto others, is a pretty well known tactic, I've seen it from a lot of people in my personal life

Anecdotal evidence is useless. And it certainly isn't justification for pretending homophobia is evidence a person is gay, it isn't ,has never been and will never be. Homophobia is much,much,much more convincing evidence that someone is a bigoted straight person not that they're gay, because again the vast majority of homophobes are straight not gay, the amount of homophobes who are actually gay is tiny.

&gt; While there are plenty of straight homophobes who misunderstand how being LGBT+ works

Plenty? you mean the vast,vast majority. the amount of homophobes who are gay is tiny, but straight liberals act as if homophobia is evidence a person is gay. they literally can't respond to homophobia without calling the bigot gay, even though 99% of the people they are calling gay are just straight people who hate gays. it triviales homophobia, turns it into a joke for their own amusment and makes it seem as if it's just a civil war between the gay community that straight people have nothing to do with. 

&gt;  there's more than likely a decent chunk of people in the homophobic(&amp; transphobic) group who are LGBT+.

there's literally no evidence of this though. and even if this was true explain to me how that's justification for calling every sinlge right wing bigot who is homophobic gay. they literally just completely ignore the fact that the vast majority of these bigots are straight because they love calling republicans gay so much. homophobia isn't evidence someone is gay, it's actually extremely good evidence that someone is a bigoted straight person&gt; Chill, you seem to think that everything is black and white, it isn't.

I don't, I, as well as many others in the gay community are just sick and tired of straight liberals being seemingly incapable of having a real discussuion about homophobia without turning it into a big joke where they call people gay.

&gt; Homophobia itself isn't exactly a, "Oh, they must be gay.

tell that to all the straight liberals who act as if it is

&gt; there's definitely a possibility that there are people who express homophobia and are actually homosexual.

not once have I denied that, the vast majority are just bigoted straight people though, stright liberals seem completely averse to acklowledging this fact

&gt; And if you think homophobia is exclusively for straight bigots, then you're being kind of ignorant of reality, nothing is exclusive in such a way.

I don't, why do you think I do. not once have I said that. I'm simply calling out all the people who can't help but call anti gay bigots gay even though the vast majority of them are not gay or bi, they're just straight people who are bigots. and the amount of anti gay bigots who are actually gay is so miniscule as to be almost irrelevant, at least in comparison to how much straight liberals talk about it.

You're angry at me because you think i'm saying homophobia is exclusively for straight bigots(i'm not), where's your anger for all the straight liberals who act as if homophobia is just repressed gay people, and who hand wave away the suggestion that a homophobic bigot is straight?I still watch from time to time, I want my hatreds to be informed.&gt; All straight liberals? Homophobia is never discussed in a serious way? What are we doing right now, then?

The vast majority of straight liberals use a bigoted republican politician doing or saying something homophobic not as an opportunity to discuss homophobia but to make jokes about republicans being gay. contrast the dominat reaction to homophobia from liberals to the reaction to every other kind of bigotry, the reaction to homophobia is completely different.

&gt; Everything, absolutely everything is used to create jokes

I can tell this conversation is going to be completely pointless, whenever straight liberals get told to stop calling homophobic bigots gay by gay people they become irate, they absolutely must call them gay.

&gt; I didn't say every homophobe was secretly gay,

but you have no problem with the fact that the vast majority of staright liberals immediately assume someones gay because they're a homophobe, and seemingly have a problem with people pointing out that in the vast majority of cases they're just a bigoted straight person.

&gt; I mean, aren't we all a little gay

No, I realize you're probably joking but that's just something ignorant people say

&gt; Which makes me wonder why you are so un-chill...

because I, like many others in the community are sick of this bullshit from allies, it's such an insulting way to "defend" gay people from homophobia, trivialises it, and turn it into a joke and source of amusment for straight liberals. why is it no one ever calls anti semites jews, it's becuase everyone can see that calling someone who says or does soemthing anti semetic a jew is incredibly insulting to jewish people. but when it comes to homophobia the dominant narrative from the people "defending" the gay community is "haha you hate them cause you're gay hahaha you're gay" 

&gt; Well, it kinda is the reaction.

It isn't even remotely the reaction, the reaction from liberals to neo nazism is nowhere close to going "haha they're jews" because again every would immediately realize that was a disgusting and insulting  tactic.

&gt; We would have made the exact same joke about Trump and a female Russian leader.

homophobia exists mate. are you telling me you're so naive that you can't see the massive element of "hahaha gaaaaaay" in this shit? the context of something like this with a male and female leader is completely different because a man and women together isn't seen as something shameful, a man going down on a women isn't seen as a shameful act, a man sucking dick is though.

&gt; but it can come across as whiny

oh ok, guess i'll just shut my fa***t mouth and continue to let straight liberals constantly say shit that is blatantly insulting and disrespectful then. seriously, the veracity with which yous defend this silly childish bullshit is stunning, why the hell are yous so obsessed with calling scummy bigot fucks gay

&gt; We are making fun of Pence's extreme religious views

you severly overestimate the amount of thought people put into this whole "haha he's gay" shtick, they just find it amusing and hilarious to call pence gay

&gt; I personally have never heard about Pence being called gay

I have a hard time believing this, literally every time pence is mentioned straight liberals start making jokes about him being gay

&gt; You're not a good messenger for your cause, I have to tell you that.

you're right about that but the messanger is irrelavent, straight liberals flat out refuse to stop doing this, when they're all laughing it up making gay jokes about some bigoted straight right wing fuck they become almost offended at the suggestion that the bigot is straight

&gt; But they can also be helpful

if you mean that this kind of thing reduces homophobia in some way it's very doubtfull, I certainly see no evidence that it has literally any effect on homophobia, it's not as if Mike Pence is going to go cry in a corner then leave the white house because people are calling him gay.

&gt; I honestly think you're pointing to a smaller problem than you make it out to be

I'm not trying to make this out to be some huge issue, simply saying it would be nice if straight liberals started to have more respect for gay people, stopped using our identity as a insult against bigoted scum like Roy moore,Mike pence  and Vladimir Putin and started having serious discussions about anti gay extremism and bigotry in the US in response to that bigotry instead of using the response to bigotry as a chance to call a republican gay and call it a day.

&gt; they are meant to point out the stupidity of homophobia

this is extremely easy to do without childishly resorting to calling the bigots gay. 

&gt; Why do you think a straight liberal is incapable of feeling empathy?

I don't, that's an extremely odd thing to say

&gt; Maybe jokes are a good tactic to get those, that don't fully understand what to make of homosexuality and homophobes, to recognize the hypocrisy of homophobia and move towards a more open mind on the issue.

NO, you realize that like 99% of the time it's just a huge circlejerk of straight liberals calling a republican gay, I must say your inturpretation of this is extremely kind. and also you're vastly overstating what calling a homophobe gay can do, like wtf, you're seriously trying to act as if straight liberals calling scummy homophobic bigots gay is going to suddenly make someone realize homophobia is wrong, come the fuck on. jesus christ 

&gt; progress is being made and your reactions to people in your corner is pushing them away

so is this the bit where you say us silly f**s need to have deference to you or you'll stop supporting us?. we're not allowed to call yous out when you're disrespecting us, we aren't allowed to have an opinion on you're rhetoric on the issue that actually effects us and that doesn't effect you in any way?

&gt; Maybe you shouldn't see homphobia in every corner and stop attacking your allies in such harsh ways

so in other words, shut my mouth, accept whatever we say, if we say something that many in the community consider extremely insulting and annoying we don't give a fuck

&gt; stop attacking your allies in such harsh ways

I'm literally just desperately trying to get straight liberals to stop constantly calling homophobic bigots gay, they reaction we get when we ask yous to stop doing this really illuminates how much straight liberals respect gay people

&gt; And maybe focus more on those that are actual 100% homophobes, not cowardly on those that have a 5% blind spot

you're right, I'm a cowardly little bitch, i'm incapable of caring about more than 1 thing at a time

&gt; a 5% blind spot

it's extremely easy to just stop the knee jerk reaction of calling homophobes gay, the fact that straight liberals are so unwilling to do this is infuriating






&gt; and you have implied a decent amount through your comments on multiple subs

Yes unfortunately I have anger/depression issues(depression exacerbates anger issues)

&gt; maybe take into account that there's a lot more to life than what is measured in statistics.

what's this referring to?are you talking about people saying they knew someone who was homophobic and turned out to be gay? becasue that isn't justification for calling every single person who's homophobic gay, it just isn't&gt; Are you honestly interested in improving lifes

Well yeah obviously but that's not what this thread is about. It's simply to ask straight liberals to stop constantly calling bigoted scumbags like Mike Pence and Roy Moore gay&gt; just saying that that does in fact happen to be a thing, that an LGBT+ person hides behind hatred to cover their status as one of us

I know it's a thing. Not once have I denied it's a thing

&gt; Just because it isn't the majority, doesn't mean you can handwave the existence of the thing as not relevant.

In the vast majority of cases it isn't relevant because in the vast majority of cases the person they are calling gay is actually just a bigoted straight person. &gt; Just because it isn't the majority

You should tell this to straight liberals, they seem to have difficulty grasping or accepting this fact. Why are you complaining about what I'm saying but don't seem to care about straight liberals constantly handwaving away the fact that most of the people they are calling gay are actually straight bigots?Where are you pulling this from?  An article?  I've heard him say something similar on bloggingheads, but a source would be useful.&gt; of course it is offensive to just call someone gay because they're being homophobic

I'm glad you agree. I don't see what your beef with me is then if you are saying that. straight liberals constantly call people gay because they're homophobes

&gt; You assume most of the bigots are straight

they are. it's absolutely preposterous to think that the vast majority of anti gay politicians aren't straight

&gt; for all you know, they could be bi, pan, gay, or confused and unsure

they could, but I certainly am not going to inexplicably assume they're gay just becuase they are a homophobe 

&gt; If they were sure of themselves, would they really care so much about other people's sexuality and gender?

yes, bigotry exists mate. you're basically saying that if someone is extremely bigoted against gay people and dedicates significant amounts of time to their bigoted agenda they must be gay and couldn't possibly be a straight person who just really hates gay people. over 20% of the US thinks gay sex should be illegal, in 1999 that number was 50%, if someone thinks gay sex should be illegal they obviously care a whole bunch, so do you think all those people are gay? you have no problem understanding or accepting the fact that people vehemently hate people for being muslims,mexicans,black,jews etc but all of a sudden when it comes to anti gay bigotry you start acting confused at the concept of bigotry, why is that? are you literally unaware of the fact that many,many straight people in the US and around the world completely despise gay people, want us to be second class citizens, want our existence to be illegal, want us killed? do you literally think  that it's not possible for a straight person to be a commited anti gay extremist? If I was a good artist or cartoonist, there are so many ideas I could bring to life to make fun of Rubin.

Example:

Animated short of Rubin taking a bat from some right wingers to beat a sjw horse, change frame, Rubin a year later still beating the same horse, that has long ago bled out, while Trump on a winged death horse is shooting lasers from his eyes at Puerto Rico and other calamities while Rubin completely ignores it all to focus only on that one horse.  Change frame, alt right marches by Rubin on horseback, white sheets and torches in hand, Rubin pauses to look at them, pulls out his phone to look at patreon income and hidden agreement with koch backed learn liberty, and goes right back to swatting that sjw horse.

Another cartoon, Saruman whispers in Rubins ear to get him to attack Golum carrying the ring and steal its power away, the eye of sauron shines a light and path onto the ring bearer to light Rubins path to his one true enemy, and in the shadows all around that spotlight of misdirected focus, the armies of men and elves and dwarves are being cut down by the orcs.  But Rubins attention does not fade, he follows that light like a cat chasing a laser pointer on the wall.

That reminds me, I wish I could draw Rubin as a cat, chasing a laser pointer of distraction by the right, while they enact policies that most people in the nation do not agree with.  But look at that pointer Ruby, follow that shiny shiny light.&gt; Where'd you pull the, "you get bigotry unless it's about gays" from?

"If they were sure of themselves, would they really care so much about other people's sexuality and gender?" that's where I got it from, you're basically implying with this comment that if someone cares enough about gay people to be an anti gay extremist that they couldn't possibly be straight becuase if they were straight "why would they care so much" 

&gt; there are lots of reasons for people to develop hate

I know that, that's what this whole thread is about. I'm angry at the fact that the reaction to homophobia from straight liberals is without fail "he's gay" when in the vast majority of cases it's not true
&gt; Seriously, stop seeing things as black and white, there's grey areas everyehere

I don't and I know&gt; It is a very serious, layered response hidden in a joke.

I missed this earlier, come on, just stop it, it is absolutely not a "very serious, layered response hidden in a joke". you're delusional if you think people are putting more than 5 seconds of thought into this silly trash&gt; I guess you need some growing-up to do

yeah i'm the one who's got growing up to do, not the people who's reaction to anti gay bigotry is "hahaha you're gay"so you don't have a response then? &gt; I think you're being unnecessarily pissy.'

I'm being unncecessarily pissy becuase i've got a problem with you conflating catholic preists sexually abusing children with homosexuality and "gay shit"?

&gt; An older man who molests children is a gay pedophile

lol da fuck, so an older man who molests a little girl is a gay pedophile. I'm  just gonna go ahead and assume you meant who molests male children and no that's not how it works, pedophilia isn't discussed in terms of gay/straight based on the gender of victims. an adult male molesting male children is just a pedophile, a gay pedophile would be a gay man (attracted to other men) who is also a pedophile, which most of these preists obviously aren't. Okay, how do you suggest making sure mentally deranged lunatics don't get their hands on guns? If you have a good solution, then I'm all for it, but Banning rifles will only make it easier for the mentally ill to circumvent background checks, and might even lower the price of rifles, if a cartel was able to manufacture at an efficient rate. This is fucked up. How much do avocados normally cost?I could not support a ban on semi auto's, no way no how. Two hand guns is much more deadly and concealable than an AR15. Nobody wants to ban handguns, why can't the same apply for AR15's? It Lays down a horrible precedent, Too many out in circulation, too many gun nuts that'll go crazy if you try to stop them from owning those rifles. Fully auto's are what need to be banned. 

 "I would love to know how banning people with a history of mental illness could circumvent gun laws." That's not what I suggested -.- I made the point that banning AR15's WOULD make it easier to circumvent background checks, because there are no background checks on the black market. That's like a coke dealer asking to see ID before he sells you coke. UNHEARD OF! 

How do you suggest making sure the mentally ill don't get a hold of guns outside of banning some guns? It's not like the government can/should create a database of everyone with a mental illness, which would be an invasion of privacy under the fourth amendment, and it could lend individuals to employment discrimination on the basis of being on a mental illness database, which could be a faulty database, just like the terrorist watch list that bans some with no connection to terrorists, like an occasional teacher or something from airplanes. 

We could invest more tax payer money into innovation. If there was a type of non-lethal ammo that could zap someone and put them in a temporary coma instantly, instead of killing them, the world would be a much better place, and lethal ammo would be practically obsolete outside of hunting. 

"But people committing these mass shootings aren't connected to the cartel" how would you know? The Cartel is good at covering up tracks, but that's neither here nor there. Criminals trying to make a quick buck and don't care who they hurt are everywhere. What about the case of Dylan Roof who could probably found one of his white supremacist buddies to sell him a gun if he could not legally obtain one. If you can find drugs, you can find guns no problem. Wow. I like pineapple and 🍅. I can't stand avocado.

Awesome! I definitely agree. I’m a proud member of TDPS and have to say that Pakman is one of the most sensible, nuanced and knowledgeable lefties on YouTube. So welcome on board. 

Other good liberal channels I would recommend are Sam Harris, Thomas Smith from Serious Inquiries, Josh Zepps etc. Kyle Kulinski is pretty good as well although I find his Russia denial extremely baffling and stupid.Never gonna happen in USA, im afraid. Australian society is totally different; you simply don’t have the sheer number of religious fanatics, gun maniacs, NRA members and crazy / racist right wing morons like USA. 

Yes, Australia does contain its fair share of binge drinking racist, white trash / bogans but they seem tame compared to gun &amp; bible toting southern Rednecks in USA.Bravo Pakman. Give it to the right wing/ alt right ally cuck. Sargon is a moronic, ill informed, cry baby and a douchebag of the highest magnitude. He’s no intellectual; neither a liberal!!&gt; However, people generally assume that people being harsh to gays are straight people and hence the statement

they definetely don't mate. the first thing straight liberals do literally every single time someone does or says something homophoibc is call them gay. it's incredibly annoying &gt; No, they don't

They absolutely do, straight liberals are completely obssessed with calling homophobes gay. the default assumption for straight liberals is that homophobes are gay not that they're straight

&gt; Many find it hard to believe that a person could be so hateful of their own kind.

straight liberals don't have a hard time believing a gay person could be a anti gay extremist, they literally assume someone is gay just becuase they are homophobic all the time, constantly. many times they get angrily defensive when you even suggest that the bigot is a straight person


&gt; it's not something to take as a personal insult.

the fact the predominant reaction of straight liberals to homophobia is "hahaha gaaaay" is incredibly insulting and trivialises homophobia

&gt; probably more than gays.

there is no probably, straight people are responsible for the vast majority of homophobia and are obviously more homophobic than gay people, the amount of homophobes who are gay is tiny.  I just saw it, and it is par for the course for Bill Scher.

He's just not a fighter, is too mealy mouthed to fight and argue and make a case for a stronger more robust policy.  He is happy with perserving the basic structure of how we pay for healthcare, including private insurers.  You can tell by how cowed he is about likely objections to single payer healthcare.

I don't care that there will be transition costs, or that some industries will be pushed into oblivion.  I am open to compensating some of those industries on their way out, as we might compensate people having their homes bulldozed by invoking imminent domain, but that is not an argument to tie our hands to an inferior system.  But then I'm not Bill Scher.  

I do not believe there will be some sort of "domino effect" as Bill Scher seems to suggest as if liberals will go on some warpath and take over a myriad of other industries.  I reject the rhetoric that this is taking over the healthcare system, it's more about the payments, there will still be private practices and hospitals, the payer will change, the government instead of the private insurers.

Bill Scher does not actually believe that is a better goal, so he does not push for it.  Useless.  Step Aside Bill, and make room for people willing to fight for a better policy framework.


"It's hard" is not a reason not to do something.  If he were around in the run up to the civil war, talking with abolitionists, his type would be the one arguing to preserve slavery, or arguing against outright abolition.  After all, even MORE of the southern economy was tied up in slavery to function and thrive, to rip that from the society would cause untold calamity.  So best not fight for that.  Satus quo, may we can pass some laws to make the lives of freed slaves easier, or some standards to insure slaves are treated more fairly.  

That is the soul of the man.  It's hard is not a god damn excuse to be this tepid.Hear hear Comedians in Cars eat your heart out! In the same way, at least in my view, it's the same for people who can't imagine paying a bit more in taxes - nothing insanely substantial - to have universal healthcare coverage.He's saying the jig is up, u/howsci - we know you are a robot / AI / Bot. it shouldn't be ok, but this is the establishment trying to limit the power of independents in the primary process yet thinking they will flock to their chosen candidate during the general election. it's a joke. As an owner of an AR15, I support a ban on bumpfire stocks.In large part I beg to differ.

Why do you think so many would have Pence over Trump with the nuclear codes?I thought I heard about a story like this not too long ago.  Is this the same guy or someone different?Thanks! I think it's important people are informed about this topic.I appreciate that our system looks insane to outsiders, because it is.  

It isn't ok.  That's why it's becoming a Supreme Court matter.  Some political capital is being used to bring up and tackle this major issue.  

Gerrymandering is also a thing over here.  And although Dems have their fair share of Gerrymandering in their favor, Republicans are largely at fault for majority of gerrymandering;  To give a picture in your head, it's around 70%/30% fault in favor of the GOP.  

It's easy to understand why.  In the US, when people are free to vote, and vote en masse, Democrats win.  When democrats win, powerful and greedy people lose... kind of... but it's far more profitable for them if thew GOP win.  The Democratic party is simply less corrupt overall in our nation.  It's not a party line thing;  It's just a fact.   Not to say Dems wouldn't benefit from becoming more progressive.Some conservatives say that Mr. Trump is not really conservative. (What does "conservative" mean anyway.)I'm sure Puerto Rico would welcome the help to modernize their energy system, but this depends on whether they are able to get any cash to do so.

I have the same opinion as you. And I don't care about anyone's opinion/approval/disapproval.

Pero mi Espanol es muy mal y poco. Mas poco. Aye. I'm being sarcastic bro I like his wit and the way he lives life to the fullest, including a little B&amp;E (breaking and entering). I like the balloon he got packman for his Birthday. I like when the viewer or caller / listener wrote in / called in and said 'do you have any faith' and when David revealed he was indeed feeling at a loss about the future of the country, Pat said "No David! Don't give up!". 

I like his shirts, well pressed and stylish. I think he's a much more casual, laid back person, but still very intelligent and articulate. I like that he adjusts his accent around his family. He seems genuine and honest, and I admire his vegan ethics. So in other words, no Thursday show. Several local, and maybe national(?) veterans' organizations who have facilities that usually air weekly games on their T.V.s are also changing the channel in protest of the players patriotic acts of protest against police violence. After the Pakman show this week rebroadcast a very insightful interview about the game of football I too am considering not supporting the sport, definitely for different reasons though. Too scary?Can't sue or be arrested for the flu or a cold. Or any other communicable disease that I know of. So should it be with STD's. Don't trust other people with your sexual health. If you choose to engage in unprotected sex and catch something that's on you. Felony  legislation against slime balls who would knowingly try to infect some one with H.I.V. or any disease might sound right but its not practical. Making it a misdemeanor makes more sense. There is such a thing as practicing safe sex. Do it you want to play outside of a monogamous relationship. And otherwise don't cry to the the government if you get a disease. Its called personal responsibility.I dunno. 
Oh gosh...

When Colombine shooters were discovered to listen to Marylin Manson, was it justified to blame him?

If Richard Spencer endorses anyone, it doesn't mean that person shares beliefs with Spencer.

Look people, when you find something legitimate to criticize these people for, go for it. But when you criticize them for something someone else said... That doesn't reflect well on you.

One of the reasons Trump won was that people on the left used these "guilt by association" tactics to smear the opponents, which everyone with half of a brain can see through. And no matter how correct you are in your goals, few people will support you if you engage in this kind of political stupidity. If anything, such things only increase support of your political opposition.

YouTube needs ad money, but at the same time, advertisers want the biggest return on their investment.

My theory is that the audience of PhillyD, Casey and other big channels of solo-creators is not that convinced by ads. While the audience of big corporate channels is more susceptible to ads.

Plus, it could be that the companies shrank their ad budgets, and YouTube puts the ads on channels that will more likely keep them competitive and also will please the corporate world.Why do people care to repost this tweet?&gt; The most famous Neo-Nazi expert on manipulating people into his beliefs made that statement.

why is this guy getting downvoted?.Maher has made transphobic comments and when he had Milo on utterly failed to challenge him. Milo was saying trans people are disproportionately involved in sex crimes(trying to paint trans people as sexual predators,a common right wing tactic) and maher was just like "really" as if he didn't know that was bigoted bullshit, then he had the audacity to take credit for milos downfall. oh and btw trans people are disproportionately Victims of sex crimesMy guess is that in his andTrump's arrogance they thought that the players would all be standing and then they could claim victory in their demands for respect for the flag. Oops. I'm so glad to see the kneeling continues."crying to the government" was a poor choice of words. Still the discussion is not about providing for medical care and disease prevention in relation to sex, even irresponsible sex. That I do support. It is not the same as prosecution for risky behavior or simply making a mistake. Intentionally exposing someone to a disease should be a crime. Just not a felony offense. Someone who does that is likely very mentally ill.  Hear Hear! Watching u/tdpspat grow from a young boy on the board meekly adjusting levels and pushing his buttons, into a full man regaling stories of his adventures from car rides to breaking into friends' basements and eating their snacks, has been the honor of my life.This video uses a few dishonest manipulations.

Like Steve reaps more than half of the benefits of the tax deductions.

This needs to be put into absolute numbers. The taxes the rich pay make up the lion's share of the taxes paid. So they are more than entitled to benefit the most from any deductions.

Here are somewhat outdated numbers

https://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-0/

So this video is riddled with irrelevant statistics. For this reason, it is a bad one, as its points can be easily countered.

What would be a good reasoning? Well. We all know about the income inequality. And thus, the taxes need to be crafted to slow down the drift.

The reason why for the top 50% pays 97% of the taxes and still manages to increase their wealth is that they need approximately the same amount of money every year for living expenses as anyone else. Most of the rest of their income is then getting invested into businesses, stock, real estate. The bottom 50%, while not paying much taxes, spend all of their earnings and thus, can't make any savings to pull themselves into a better life. Even if they pay no taxes at all, they will stay where they are.

But, with tax cuts will come cuts to government programs, which will disproportionally hurt the poor. Thus the poor, getting only a tiny benefit from lowered taxes will have to spend more on services they were getting for free from the government. And that will be the largest driver of the increase of the wealth gap in US.

There are several ways to combat this:

 - Increase the minimum wage, then the poor might just be able to afford higher living costs.

 - Increase taxes on rich. Then the poor might just be able to start saving money.

 - Do both of the above.

Look, if you want to increase taxes, you better have a solid financial base for it. The opposition is well versed in financial matters and they do know what tax increase will achieve. That is why they pay politicians to spread cute emotional lies, so that reasonable arguments are not heard through the confusing cacophony of voices. And for this reason, videos like this one are actually harmful, as they are not using proper science.

Yes, I can see that we agree on the general direction the tax code should be taken. And we seem to have similar understanding of the reasons why we want the taxes to be such, and why it is justified.

However, the problem today is to convince the public that the rich are not paying their fair share today. Not to convince the public that Trump's cuts are bad. I.e. we have to show that today's tax code is already bad.

So... What would be your reasons why rich need to pay more?

&gt; The video does a pretty good job at explaining the core concept of the tackled changes, don't you think?

Well, I don't think so. I think that it makes the viewer to think in wrong categories. And, as I said, the points of this video can be easily countered, which would stall any debate, if any of the lawmakers would try to use these points.My reasons are more pragmatic.

First, all of the wealth of USA is based on innovation. There is nothing USA can make that cannot be made cheaper elsewhere. It is the intellectual property and efficient infrastructure that drives the US economy.

These days we can see how much the US corporations profit from what was built in 60s and 70s. The research done in government subsidized labs universities is now penetrating the markets today. Without that, there will be nothing.

And we come to the question, who has to pay for all that preparation work? And I think the people who benefit the most: the business.

Why should the rich pay for healthcare? Because they get healthy workforce that insures the have stable profits in the long run.

Why should they finance the education? Because that is what keeps American business competitive. And because it is cheaper to pay for education and dish out a smaller wage, than to pay higher wages that pay for education and the interest on top of that.

I think that high taxes on the rich that finance healthcare, education and infrastructure is a reasonable (and in the long term much lower) price to pay for long term stability and happiness of the nation.

If you start squeezing every drop of juice out of your workforce, you get high short term profits, but probably will ruin your long term prospects, which is what we have observed in 2008. &gt; Racism, police violence,

Erm... any evidence for that? The media hype is not the evidence, there is a lot of selection bias in there.

There is a great body of research that links local GINI index to violence. The majority of non-suicide gun deaths are gang-related crimes, which are linked to poverty and bad policing.

I think if US gets an increase in minimal wage and a sensible tax reform, the gun violence and overall violence will decrease substantially.

Better healthcare and better food will lead to death rate reductions that will dwarf any decreases you can achieve with any gun regulations.I guess you are right, since Harvey damaged many oil refineries in Texas.-basic income = the solution to raising the floor for the poor and middle class, it's a straight up transfer from higher earners to lower earners.Your point?

The argument is: gun control would probably change nothing or the changes would be insignificant in terms of violent crime victimization.

Remember the shooting in France? Remember how many people died in truck attacks?Why bringing up basic income? We are talking about the quality of the video.Oh "my tweets..."

Oh "how the race and gender function in our society..."

That is just lovely... and stupid.

But this:

&gt; Earlier in the week, I asked my students to explain the relation between white masculinity and mass killings

This is dangerous. This guy suggests there is a link... but I am sure he will oppose the link between black masculinity and murder... Despite an overwhelming statistical evidence.

There is no link. I repeat. THERE IS NO LINK.

And conservatives are just as guilty of tribalism as progressives. Learn to live with that.

Fuck this narrative.Laugh with me &gt; Well, there is definitely a link.

No, there is no link. White masculinity is not trying to make you a mass murderer. There is no causal link. Anyone saying this is an idiot.

&gt; Quite ironic you come on this sub professing your support for Milo's free speech, but not this guy.

What the hell. What are you smoking? This guy can say whatever he wants, but I'll be calling him out on his BS.

I can criticize him all I want. And you can't deny that I criticized Milo too.Rump probably has the lowest IQ of any American president in history.&gt; day to day gun violence is not.

That is what I would like to see impacted. And I doubt any gun regulations will achieve anything. 

I do believe, though, that improvements in quality of life of citizens will do it.

&gt; That the whole "this would have happened anyway" argument is a poor excuse and a cop out.

It is not, because the statistics suggests it may be a fact of life.I knew you are bad at statistics... but you managed to surprise me.

Do you know what a sample size is? Do you know why it is important?

Meanwhile, a much larger sample (tens of thousands of cases every year) shows that black men are much more likely to murder another person... Is there a link?Washington post is a "reliable source" /s

https://youtu.be/qMjElYUI87EWashington post again? And the same disclaimer?

Are you shilling for them?

And WaPo is a "very unbiased and reliable source".../s

https://youtu.be/qMjElYUI87ESomeone mentioned other solutions above, to help poor people, this was in response to that.

We still want to preserve higher taxes on the wealthy and higher earners because the goal is an effective redistribution system that raises the floor for lower earners.  Many of the critiques getting into the weeds of the rich getting more taxes back because they pay higher taxes already sidesteps the basic argument over whether the rich paying higher taxes is legitimate in the first place.  I think it is, most liberals think it is, so it's not a Problem for us that higher earners stick to paying higher tax rates.  If anyone has an issue with that supposition, and do not want the rich to pay higher taxes, and are therefore in favor or lowering their rates and allowing more of their earnings to go to their pocket books for investments over and above some future redistribution schemes that are aimed at lifting the poor higher, then they need to stop being intellectual pussies and just come out and make that case explicitly and stop playing hide the ball.Yes, we are not hiding the fact that we view the progressive taxation as a redistribution tool.

So the tax lowering lobby should also come out of the closet and stop pretending they are for economic benefit of the country.

The problem here is that the society is still torn on the issue of whether progressive taxation is fair on high earners. And that is a big stumbling block. In other words, who should benefit from the industriousness of the high earners is a big debate we have not yet finished.

I think there are an economic and pragmatic reasons why the high earners should bear most of the tax burden. But if we manage to invent other ways of keeping income inequality in check (efficient unions, science based regulations etc.) we might not need progressive taxation at all.I am sure his IQ is 273 :-)&gt; I actually have graduate training in statistics.

Money not well spent.

&gt; Right but we're not talking about single murder, we're talking about mass murder. Most often not in a private home.

Exactly. The numbers in mass shootings are tiny, compared to tens of thousands of violent deaths that happen every year. And you are drawing statistical conclusions based on this tiny sample, yet I have no doubts you will froth at your mouth at a mere suggestion that blackness has anything to do with propensity to violence.&gt; Also, why don't you attack the merits of the argument in the article, rather than resorting to the ad hominem fallacy that is attacking the publisher?

Touche, my friend. I was lazy. And I am still lazy. This Russian hysteria is a washed up joke. It's as believable as a chewing gum under a school desk is appealing. I don't think that this Russian hysteria is dangerous. The hype is going down. Let's get some popcorn and enjoy its convulsions, while making fun of anyone who tries to resuscitate it. I don't see any link. There is a link between local GINI index, upbringing and mental health. But there is no race link.I, personally, will be going with the strong and stable Theresa May patented Prime Minister's Questions [tm] rebuttal if something comes up, and for some reason I'm at bat on an issue I know I can't win, and make it clear that the drunken peasants always talk about process.

Just look at what the drunken peasants would have for us under / as a result of / in exchange for [point of contention / policy of discourse]!

*NO.*

They're leading a protest and a movement forward, Pakmaniacs are leading the international and domestic communities forward! Everything needs money. Even your protest or walkout.

People are too busy slaving away at their jobs that barely allows the ends meet. So they will go to the streets if: 1) someone pays them, or 2) there is a chance this will improve their conditions so that any losses of working hours are compensated by the results.

The conditions are not that desperate, and we have a history of these protests achieving nothing, so you won't see any people on the streets any time soon.

You will see coordinated media campaign and people on the streets when one of the big corporations suddenly feels threatened economically.I just had to go take the keyboard paid for by the American tax payers that the truth in good humour as I blasted soda all over my keyboard just now and got a new one from the IT closet supply in the office,

I think it highlights a schism on the left about the nature of wikileaks.  Some people seem to think they are agents of justice and right, revealing the dark underbelly of US power and influence and military overreach.  But I always thought Assange in particular was more of an anarchist, whose seeming dislike of the US in particular is him wanting to see the biggest power player taken down and removed from the world stage as much as possible.

That happens to align with Putins vision of US power in the world, and also, The Glenn Greenwald/Jeremy Scahil Left.  Those latter two are absolute saints among certain corners of the left, they and the people that are on board their general narrative (and I include Kyle Kulinski in this - who I generally like)  discount sources like American intelligence agencies, because it is EASIER and more ideologically palatable to believe US intelligence and the military are lying, than actors like Assange and Putin's Russia.  The forces lined up against American empire and right and noble and truthful, and the people aligned with American power are intrinsic liars.

That's what I'm detecting from factions of the left, and I do not share that vision.  Perhaps it's because I'm a bit of a lapsed neocon in the Christopher Hitchens / Danerys Targaryn mold that does not see the use of force on the world stage for non defensive purposes as a tool that ought NEVER be employed like many on the non interventionist left... but there it is.Come on the discord &gt; You can draw statistical conclusions from small sample sizes, it's called nonparametric statistics.

BS man. You can't get around huge confidence intervals that will render any conclusion untrustworthy. By the way, what do you mean by "non-parametric statistics", different people mean different things by it.

&gt; But anyway, interesting that this irritates you so much you divert the conversation to mean something different.

Yes, any conversation that tries to link race to behavior, intellect, or economic status irritates me. I understand that there are medical/biological differences between races. But there is no solid evidence to suggest any perceptible behavioral differences and more than ample evidence that suggests such differences are in the heads of the researchers only (this applies to the author of the article too).David should change his name to the Illusive Man for discord, in keeping with the gaming roots to the application.

Now David, sheltered creature that he is, likely has no idea who the illusive man really is, suffice it to say David, he's this fantastically wealthy and cryptic figure and puppet master but I think his general way of presenting himself remind me of David.

If a privately owned space station had a large observer room for it's owner, A David like person would probably be sitting there taking in the view.You post things. I comment. Quit whining.Look. Russia's entire budget is so small, there is no way they would be able to mount a campaign that would make any sizable dent.

The elections went this way not because of Russia, but because of what Hillary did to Bernie and what the rest of the democrats were doing behind closed doors.

For this reason I give zero credibility to any "look over there" cries. We know better today that the intelligence agencies can lie to suit a political agenda. They can even engage in criminal behavior (like selling drugs to finance operations congress refused to finance). So they have zero of my trust, unless they show convincing evidence.

And this thing

&gt; legitimate elections

US elections are far from being legitimate. The system is corrupt to the core. Trump won, and the establishment is quite happy. They just throw the disgruntled population a bone in the form of a manufactured conflict, so that no one starts looking into the shady things being done to enrich the elite.

In this world it is better to have Russians as friends.&gt; Study up.

I am going to assume you just don't know what you are talking about. 

&gt; If you believe there is a link between Islam and terrorism (which I assume you do, but I don't know for sure) and you don't believe there is a link between white, conservative men and mass shootings in the US, your opinions can't be taken seriously.

Islam is an ideology. It is not a biological characteristic of a group of people. 

&gt; The point is that there is some cultural phenomenon present in that class of people that gives them a proclivity toward that action.

So go ahead and study the cultural differences, not the "white masculinity", you muppet.Exactly, it isn't helpful. I cannot find this week's hatriot mail there, for example. Pence is at the very least a capable human being.  I'm not excited about a Pence presidency but Trump is too chaotic and dangerous to remain in power.  The GOP are already in power, so we'd have this nonsense with or without Trump.  But at the very least, the nonsense would be corruption as usual and not potential end of the world scenarios of a man on the edge.  This is Nixon all over again.  But at least Nixon was smart, Trump has the same if not worse flaws as Nixon but dumb as a bag of hammers.  Mix being a loose cannon with being unimaginably stupid and you've got yourself a dangerous cocktail.

The man is playing with the lives of millions of South Koreans just for his narcissistic supply.We need better gun regulation. We don't need a new segment daily covering  number of gun deaths. Local news channels and major networks report these incidences though maybe not national daily totals. I am a leftist who uses his gun to keep the vermin out of my vegetable and ornamental gardens. I don't require an assault weapon for that.I suspect the majority of Pakman show viewers don't need to hear gun victim totals daily to be concerned re gun violence. Local news stations and major networks cover the issue though not necessarily the nationwide totals. Constant repetition serves as much purpose as saying 'Trump is an ass' over and over. We get it already.Waste of airtime. We get it that gun violence is a continuing menace. Hearing daily totals adds nothing important to the conversation. Its like hearing its going to rain today, everyday. I don't. We get it already. Gun laws are bad, people are dying. Things need fixed. What else is new?I am a member. I know about the full video. It's inconvenient to find the segment I want in an hour-long video. I'd love an easy way to find a short video of each segment. They somehow appear eventually, but finding them is very inconvenient.How is it unfair?Use your brains for what? "Shoo"ing away criticisms of some cheap polemicist who is apparently so brilliant that he can't figure out how not to look like like a bigot twice a year? Have fun with that. Is plastic no longer recyclable? Did I miss a memo?&gt; All I can say is that you disagree with people who are far more knowledgeable than either you or me, all of whom seem to have come to the same conclusion.

In my opinion the situation is different. We are being told what to believe, and I refuse to believe it until I see evidence.

&gt; Or that maybe they know something we don't?

That is certain. But I have a feeling that information is not shared with us.&gt; I'm going just to assume you're simply arguing to save face.

We can play this mental ping pong all day. But it was you who have suggested that non-parametric statistics can yield reliable conclusions even if sample sizes are small. So my question to you: how?

&gt; If you gave latino females the same history in the US as conservative, while males, you likely would have the same outcome.

I am assming you mean 'conservative white males'. 

So is it "white masculinity" or some intrinsic human nature that is at fault? No that may have been the catalyst but the way Rubin has behaved since, there is no defense. He’s a far right shill and an absolute asshole through and through. A real pos!Yeah I agree with most of your points. Its hard to categorize Rubin entirely as alt-right; he's more of an alt-right panderer. Actually Alt-Lite might be a better term. What is undeniable is that Rubin's terrible show now really functions as a gateway drug to racism/white nationalism/far-right etc.  

&gt; Despite what you may think of him, there are many pretty bad examples of smears/ blatant misrepresentations of his views and you don't have to support him to see that.

How is it unfair?Ever heard about him in the news? Those times. It's pretty much all we know him for, that and accusing the world of just being too confused to understand what he's *actually* saying. I don't know, it's true that I don't know many geniuses, but I didn't imagine them being so consistently misunderstood every single time they open their mouths.I suspect the information that is not shared with us is very much like the information we discovered in DNC e-mails archive, or the information Snowden and Manning revealed.

The governments today pursue interests of very small and very wealthy group of people. Not our interests. When they start to blame Russia, start looking other way and see if they found another way of getting themselves richer.

The whole Russia thing started when Putin started kicking out foreign investors that hurt Russian economics. It intensified, when Americans failed to get Crimea (they were dreaming of installing a NATO base there since the end of WWII). Then Syria proved to be a success for Russians and a great PR disaster for USA. After this much disrespect from Russians, USA had to retaliate. And you are drawn into this conflict, despite the fact that there are other, much more important battles waiting to be fought, like $15 min. wage, tuition free college, and single payer health insurance.I just think a lot of art like this is literally trash.  Its kind of seen as edgy and modern and sensible in some circles to have art that showcases the ugly and filthy in this world, or to pretend that such attributes as just as worthy of attention as things like beauty.   They are not.


I, and most people, want to see more beauty in the world, not less, and our definitions of beauty is not trash.

Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but when 99% of the beholders agree on what beauty is not, elevating trash as art just comes across as trying to pretend that all expressions have equal value to people.

And don't get me started on Pollock paintings.Because most people dump their plastic into the garbage. While it's not as easy to recycle plastics, the programs are there, and if a container is recyclable, there is no reason to get upset about it ending up at landfills by virtue of what it is. Be mad at the people who don't recycle it.And all of that has its place, but some corners seem to view the darkness and the ugliness as the higher form that ought to be expressed more.  These are the goth/emo crowd of the art world, and I think their kind have dominated much of the modern art crowd where beauty takes a back seat.

Oh look, my expression of darkness and ugliness is even MORE pronounced!

Imagine a world where more and more cars you saw on the street looked like the fiat multipla

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Fiat_Multipla_front_20080825.jpg/1200px-Fiat_Multipla_front_20080825.jpg

Now, upon reflecting on that image of the single ugliest car in all of creation, would you rather see more of that around, or more of something like this

https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1724/5219/articles/silver-tesla-model-s-20-inch-tst-wheels-metallic-grey-1.jpg?v=1495135802

Ignore the power train.  This is pure aesthetics, a value judgment on preference and trends.  I know, I know, who are we to pass judgment and prefer to want to see more of one type of visage over another.  Who are we?  Human beings.  We get to do that, and lament the increasing ugliness coming from some parts of the art world.The article you linked me already discussed the difficulties with recycling plastics, and I was not unfamiliar with the concept before that. It doesn't mean that plastic is inherently wasteful or that it isn't being recycled mostly because it cannot be recycled. 

&gt; When I am working in the field I see dead animals filled up with plastic on a regular basis, its a serious problem.

That's not a problem of plastic existing or being used, it's a problem of it ending up in the wrong places. Similarly, forest fires aren't a problem of people using fire. 

The types being complained about in the OP are, in my experience, typically recyclable, and clearly labeled as such. *If they were not*, and if you want to have a conversation about what is not a panacea for anything at all (let's put aside your misplacement of responsibility in the comment I'm referring to, just for a moment), complaining about the way local shops package their products is about as unproductive of a measure that I can think of. What is the endgame? That every corner bodega is going to get the word and start packaging their products in the most environmentally conscious way possible? For consumers to skip on their apple with their lunch because they don't like the way the local stores are packaging things? Best of luck but I've got a spoiler alert for you in that story: It's not happening. 

Getting to your misplaced blame: One of the two problems you named is legitimate. The state has the power to regulate which materials are used in the construction of products, especially relating to food. They also are responsible for enacting and overseeing recycling programs. What I'm not on-board with is this "lazy consumer" nonsense. Peoples' lives are generally very busy, and if they had time to devote to studying a topic of any given relevance/importance, I'm sure many of them would opt to learn about broader political/social/environmental issues; assuming that every individual has the critical skills and intellectual capacity to consume that type of data in any meaningful way, which is the other aspect of what I see as wishful thinking as far as the so-called lazy consumer goes. Also assuming the discussion around a given topic has a settled conclusion that anyone can take away. 

The idea that the populace should read up every time a product or material enters the marketplace and learn whether they should avoid spending their money on it is unrealistic and as such, I think it's totally unfair to place the burden an Joe Schmoe, the consumer or the supermarket manager. The parties who know better and who have the power to enact broad-scale policies bear the most responsibility if we're talking about something like where waste ends up or what harmful ingredients a restaurant may or may not use in their foods. 

"The people" I'm referring to are a broad group. I don't just mean individuals. I have the luxury of living in NY, where our recycling program is fairly robust. I have no doubt though, that recyclable products are thrown into the trash on a regular basis. That being said though, there are overflowing bags of recyclables all down my block once a week. That isn't the result of lazy people becoming motivated. It's the result of awareness created and legislation being enacted. If, in NY, it is discovered that a given material isn't being recycled nearly as much as it could, it would behoove the state to start a new awareness campaign. Not a campaign of calling people lazy for buying products that contain the material. A campaign to inform people of how to properly dispose of it. If a material cannot be recycled by any means, it might be time to explore whether reasonable alternatives can be employed, and it so, to regulate to that effect. 

Yesterday a trash bin appeared in front of my house, small and brown, and with a label on it indicating that it should be used for food waste and tree/plant debris. Aside from whatever the hell (I've yet to read up on this program) is going to happen with that waste, I suspect that this will produce a lot more recycled plastic as well, from those who choose to empty out their Chinese food containers into the food waste bin and then the plastic container into recycling, rather than the whole thing into the trash. It's a new program apparently, and so I don't imagine to know any results from it for some time, but I suspect that this measure enacted by the city will do more than calling people lazy for decades could ever have possibly hoped to achieve.Oh did that guy fill in today or something? I haven't seen it but I don't need to to weigh in.

Even if it was a host that I think is as good as Pakman, I don't find it very satisfying to come in and find another personality doing their show in his place when he's not around. I'm not sure that it's worse than nothing, but it's not very different than just tuning into that person's show.

My suggestion for the future:
You now have a permanent (well, perpetual) second mic on the show, and he's grown quite well into the role. I know he's not confident in doing so at this point, but I'd rather see Pat practice a little, build up some confidence, and jump in to host the show himself when Pakman isn't around. I think he has a talent for punditry, and the best way to cultivate that is experience. Yeah, having Pat beside another host can lend some TDPS feel to a segment, but why not let the show cover itself if it can?

I vote Pat for the future. Not that it's up for a vote...&gt; Russia's involvement in the election was not a hostile act?

Who voted? Americans. Did Russians manipulate the vote counts? No. Case closed.

This country has freedom of speech as a right. So anyone can say whatever they want. So if Russia bought political ads, this wasn't illegal. 

&gt; 200+ year streak of legitimate elections in our country is kind of important.

Yep, let's forget the fact that women were not allowed to vote, black people were not allowed to vote. And the whole electorate college thingy that is very dubious.

Let's not forget that in the recent decades only the candidates backed by corporations were able to show their faces on TV, which runs against any notion of fair elections.

&gt; I legit cannot believe the amount of Russian apologia going around nowadays. Putin probably reads over the definition for "useful idiot" he's framed and hung by his bed as he laughs himself to sleep each night.

The real useful idiots are the ones who bark the "Russian influence" tree. Meanwhile your wealth is being transferred into the pockets of billionaires. Meanwhile US flies drones and kills people in sovereign sates with no repercussions. Meanwhile US overthrows governments that dare to put nation's interests before interests of American hawks. 

&gt; I prefer to not to operate on suspicions and platitudes to conspiracy.

Man, where is a proof that "Russian influence" is not a conspiracy theory?&gt; Actually, it's explicitly illegal.

The collusion is illegal. But the problem is, the collusion hasn't been proved.

And yes, I admit that I wan't aware of the 2011 SC ruling. 

&gt; After all, neither you nor I have personally seen the machines and algorithms used to calculate the models

I happen to be a mathematician. Although I have not examined the code that the scientists used, it is based on well known mathematical models that have great accuracy in predicting physical phenomena. So I can claim that I know how they work, and because I know how they work, I trust the calculations to a certain degree. Yes, if wrong assumptions or parameters are used, or some important physical are left out, the models will predict incorrectly, but what we see is that the models are getting the scale of the effect wrong (i.e. the scale of stored heat differential is off), yet qualitative effects are predicted more or less correctly.

So you may need 97% of the scientists, but I don't. I know enough to examine the validity of the claims independently.

&gt; especially when ALL the experts

The history of science has a few stories to tell, in which ALL the experts had to acknowledge they kinda fell flat on their faces. The most recent one is quantum mechanics. I'm thought some people would get a kick out of it was far as criticisms or anythjng, I'm actually just joshing. &gt; And I ask again: can we not walk and chew gum?

Nope. This is a bad analogy. You can't read two books at the same time. So you can't fight two political battles at the same time. You can alternate your time and effort between the two, but this diminishes the chances of success disproportionally. Political movements require energy that many of us have very limited amount of. &gt;That's not why they're mad. They're mad at hollywood for condescending to them and ridiculing them. They're mad at academia for stifling conservative speech, not simply being liberal.

They are mad hollywood does not parrot their own values.  Boo fucking hoo.  Most liberals don't bother listening to conservatives as much as I do, but I've been listening to conservative callers and hosts on talk radio for over a decade and a half now, and they constantly bitch and moan about the values they don't appreciate wafting from the liberals in hollywood and the media.  And what is their solution to such things?  Some neutral creation where ideas are given a fair hearing?

fuck no

It's fox news, conservative talk radio with bias and conservative dogma turned up to 11, breitbart, evangelical churches that have weaponized their populations into voting machines for conservative ideals in politics.  They vote republican like blacks vote democratic, but their turnout is much higher.

You might be able to bullshit and lie and misrepresent reality to someone else, but I have heard to many of them with my own ears to not know what MANY of them truly want.  They don't merely want an end to liberal ideals dominating popular culture, they want to return to their own supremacy of the culture and regain their capacity for social sanction.  But they can't.  That ship has sailed and it's not coming back any time soon.  Most people reject their values on gays, even most young conservatives.  But they can win in politics, because our system of government provides affirmative action and quotas for low density populations of people as the ultimate participation trophy for failing to actually convince more people they are right.  No need, they get power anyway in the US.  But that is still not enough.

I don't for a moment believe the right would be content with a cessation of campus speakers being disinvited and shouted down.   I agree both of those things should end of course, but their gripe goes beyond that.  It extends to not being the wielders of social capital.  If companies catering to LIBERAL values on gays and punishing states by threatening to pull business out if anti gay laws go through.  The RIGHT used to have that power, and they cannot STAND that the left has more control of it.

They demonize the left as much if not more than the left demonizes them, I never hear more lies told about myself and what I supposedly believe as a liberal than when I listen to them rabble on on talk radio.  You should remove your head from the ground and listen to them.  Listen to them describe ever liberal policy under the sun as full on socialism bordering communism.  Listen to the manic/rabid conspiracy theories about illegals voting, former birtherism.

One of the reasons I get so infuriated by sock puppets like Dave Rubin, is that he turns a blind eye to the OCEANS of problems on the right and a general trend of some people to do NOTHING but pile onto the left.  You are giving the right far too much credit.  


On being wrong about what I think is going on in their heads, that's possible.  I am not a mind reader (though again, you want to see some MASSIVE mind reading about what we liberals supposedly think and are motivated by, go listen to talk radio or read the comments section of a conservative site, attempts at mindreading and divining motivations is not a "left" thing.

Also, consider the following kind of story.

https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/8/16270040/trump-clinton-supporters-racist

Now before you get triggered the source is Vox, this was a more general story, but assume it's mostly true for the sake of argument.  Look at those results.  Trump voters, when seeing a white face getting housing assistance are MUCH more accepting compared to seeing a black face.  The same effect was not observed with Clinton voters, in fact the data suggests the opposite reaction was observed, not to the same degree, and still problematic, but NOTHING like the Trump voters turning ice cold at seeing a black get assistance.

Why the difference?  People are people right?  If someone needs help, no problem right?  

I have a theory, and it seems to align with observed data.  Conservatives are more tribal people.  They tend to have a greater emphasis on ME and MINE.  Liberals do too of course, but to a lesser degree, and those differences influence the differential behavior and attitudes.  My family, MY religion, MY community, MY tribe, MY rac... woops, MY community of values.  You see how that greater affinity can leave those further outside the center of the circle on the outs attitudinally?

The liberals by contrast tend to have an expanded circle of concern, place less emphasis on someone down on their luck being part of THEIR people, THEIR tribe.  When it's THOSE people, who cares.  WE are the good ones.  I have felt this sense wafting off a great many conservatives by LISTENING to them speak.  They almost all deny it, but it comes through.  And not from all of them, Arthur Brooks and figures like Michael Medved are truly more open and less tribal, but I do NOT think that is the center of mass of the conservative movement.  They inherited southern whites, and a great many of them are the descendants of segregationists and confederates back farther still.  And there is a lingering STENCH of the ORIGINAL identity politics of the United States on many people in that group.  White identity politics.

The same people talking about the war of northern aggression, and calling Lincoln a tyrant.  Those people are not voting for fucking liberals, conservatives, the party of Lincoln, inherited those people after the party flipped.  And it's not the entire party by any stretch, but identity is NOT gone from the republican movement.  Deny it all you will, and that affects how they see aid going to THEIR people vs others.  Especially minorities, like the BLACKS, or the illegal MEXICANS !!!!!

You'll note I do not think they'd be so exercised at illegal Canadians coming to the US to work.Hell No, BDS is a powerful tool to be used when a country is acting in a wrong fashion. BDS is how we got South Africa to end apartheid and it can help us get Israel to start behaving. BDS has caused economic damage, that's the pointThis is where I think the analogy people like Sam Harris used for concentric circles of Islam are useful.  I don't know the percentages, but in order from most toxic to least...

at the center you have the white identitarians, full on white nationalists and white separatists - these are a relatively small number of people - beyond that you have people who are turned off by those displays, but express identarian light sympathies, like wanting to make sure the country is not "taken over" by immigrants.  Outside them, are people more concerned with social and economic conservatism, are not turned off by non white ethnic groups being represented and existing in larger numbers in society.  That last might be the largest group, but there is a reason that Trump, out of SEVENTEEN candidates, was the biggest single draw in the primaries.  His appeal was not to social or economic conservatism.  His appeal was a mix of populism and white identity politics.

You think I am painting with too broad a brush?  Fine, now turn your attention to large swaths of the right and start to critique the neutron bombs they are detonating left and right.Yep... And how is it going so far?Civil Rights Act should extend to sexual orientation.  End of conversation.

If writing two male/female names on a cake triggers you so much, either deal with it or get out of the business career.Not trying to  make making a point here. I guess there is none. Except maybe that these idiots might just be unfit parents whose children should not be in their custody.This is an old story but never stops making me laugh. Some people are SOOO stupid.It is tragic. Mental deficiency must be involved. Somehow I find it hard to be sympathetic for those who look for trouble and then are surprised when they find it and need to be rescued. I guess that finding that compassion is what intelligent, moral people do though. Help those who need it even when it seems they might not deserve it. That's something that separates good men from Trumpists.Oh... I see.

 - 99% movement fizzled out over internal conflicts (yep, they tried to walk and chew gum...)

 - The progress achieved since the new deal is being dismantled step by step (worker's unions, wealth and income inequality, increasing monopolization of every business, complete control of government function by financial elite, ridiculous tax code)

 - Wars are being fought in every corner of this world, bringing democracy, capitalism, peace and prosperity. 

 - You are being cheated at the polls by the two party elite, and you are made to believe the problem is somewhere else.

 - There is no hope that the nation will ever be able to elect someone who genuinely cares about the needs of the people.Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  I'm calling 911. I hurt myself laughing!!You are correct that this is not a comedy club. This site is about social commentary and sometimes uses comedy to expose the sad state of affairs regarding our fellow citizens' incompetence. This is a perfectly appropriate post. The people packaging the products being discussed aren't producers. 

While it would be nice of anyone considered packaging something in an environmentally-friendly fashion, we'll wait a long time for industry to collectively be our savior just because we made enough snide comments on Reddit. You might as well rely on the power of prayer at that point, and call of sanitation too because everyone has stopped littering.

Whether you think plastic is inherently a problem or not, plastic is also an indisputable necessity at this point. Of course we should explore alternatives when it is possible, but it is not always. As such, it makes much more sense to confront the problems plastics present rather than sit around scolding people with fantastic notions of how the world would be if someone other than people occupied it.

When we do find alternatives to plastic, again, don't sit around complaining that companies don't all immediately jump on it.This whole idea of what everyone should do to save the planet it spitting in the wind. Regulation is how sweeping changes to an industry are implemented (when a change is not already in their best financial interests). The rest of the finger-pointing largely amounts to wasted time and energy. 

&gt; Do you want to live in a throwaway, consumer culture? Is it your dream to be able to freely purchase over-packaged products only to throw the packaging away?

You've mistaken the light for its source over here. Are packaged goods the evil, or is waste from package goods that we can't properly process the evil? You appear to have conflated the two permanently in your mind. I'm not especially attached to a given method of product packaging or availability, so I don't sit around finding evil in mundane shit. If you're basing your lifestyle decisions on bases such as the ones you're presenting here, I'd suggest you take a breath and reevaluate. You're seriously confused. Speaking of:

&gt; But generating waste (true waste in every sense of the word) is not a virtue and shouldn't be treated as one, nor as a neutral behavior either. You cannot argue this when plastic is causing incredible environmental damage.

I don't know what it is with the people arguing in this thread, but I'm starting to get really irritated with the cheap fuckin strawmen being kicked in my direction. Was I calling waste a virtue? Was I suggested it should be treated as one? Get that fucking bullshit out of my face please. I didn't argue that plastic isn't an environmental issue either. I'm saying it doesn't have to be as much of one as it is, and that the way to confront the problem of plastic waste in a world that is reliant on plastic isn't to complain to supermarket managers who put apples into (recyclable) plastic containers. Sure, you might convince one or two to stop, which I suppose would be nice, but not nearly as nice as more robust recycling programs nationwide coupled with local campaigns to encourage participation. I'd love to engage any point that you have that says that I'm not thinking along practical lines. Please don't come at me with more arguments I didn't make.

&gt; Waste is not only an environmental issue, if that fails to move you.

I am very much moved by our deteriorating planet. I just don't think that every single issue has one solution that amounts to whatever some dude on Reddit is telling me it is. Anyway, to move on to the assertion that follows that preface:

&gt; Consider that a lot of waste gets shipped abroad and dumped on third-world countries in vast open heaps of trash. There are lots of documentaries on this humanitarian crisis...

I also see that as the same exact issue we've been discussing. A waste management issue. I am not insensitive to it.

&gt; Whatever your stance, being wasteful is bad - bottom line.

It's not. It usually leads to unhelpful results in most circumstances I can think of, to be clear. My point of contention with the statement is the one I had earlier when I said that you're mistaking the light for the light source. It sucks if I go on vacation for a month and leave my lights on. Wasted energy. If that energy is coming from a fully renewable source though, then the waste aspect is completely benign, and your blanket statement becomes false. Wasting my renewable electricity is not bad in that hypothetical. This isn't me being semantic or splitting hairs. Everyone should have a handle on the topics they're passionately discussing. What your complaining about is often the result of waste. It is not waste itself though. Yup. Never forget to remind any of his disciples that you might encounter.This is an interesting glimpse at the problem.

In my opinion we should assume that every actor in the market acts according to maximization of expected return. In other words, you will not do something that has little chance of working out. Like you would not rob a bank. Or you will not apply for a job which requires skills you don't have. And that local optimization often leads away from a global maximum. That is why worker's unions are so successfully destroyed, because when employers organize and threaten your earnings, you will give up under pressure, despite realizing that this would probably hurt your in the long term. And this is the reason people vote for tax cuts, because it gives them a immediate uptick in their finances. And they don't care about much bigger long term problem it may lead to. This is why people who are short on cash will not do minor repairs in their homes, despite the obvious fact that avoiding repairs now will lead to exponentially more expensive catastrophic failures in the future.&gt;I've seen videos done by white nationalists for white nationalists. I know what actual white identity politics looks like. Trump is not that.

It's not that explicit, it takes the form of being slow to single out white identitarians, or give false equivalence and saying things like "both sides" have fine people when one side was defending the traitors flag and was aligned with literal white nationalists and nazis, where one of them murdered a counter protester.

If you can't hear that fucking dog whistle you are fucking deaf and blind.  More like you don't WANT to see it.  It would be very inconvenient for an apologist like yourself.

And you underestimate the number of people that are not explicitly alt right, but are pretty alt light in their sentiment and aversion to having too many brown people around. I don't have hard/accurate numbers on that segment, but it's a lot bigger than the actual full on alt right, which are relative small.

Trivia.  Which group has more support.  Antifa, or confederate sympathizers or white nationalists groups in the US?

I don't have numbers there either, but I'd be shocked if the white nationalists groups, small though they may be, were not at LEAST an order of magnitude more populous than antifa members.

I thought US had the youngest leader, at least in terms of the development level.This doesn't apply since it specifically says "an official act".

Trump did not threaten to take any action, if NFL does not comply. So this seem not to apply.American history X

American beautyThe sad truth is, he is still the president of America.

And it is not his achievement, rather it is America's fault.

I understand why Bush got the seat, as he was a puppet of the very powerful elite. But this guy... It is something our kids will be looking back as the greatest embarrassment in the modern history.TY Trump for fanning the flames.  (Something that was said about Obama for years).Hmm, you're right.Weyohhhhhhh!Howsci must get on the discord. We must know that he is not a 🤖 I really hope US will not decide to "help" by invading.US needs a better system for issuing IDs to citizens. Here are my suggestions:

 - ID needs to have a large number of digits or include letters, this will make it shorter and easier to memorize.

 - The number of digits and/or letter combinations needs to be in trillions so that random guesses are not possible.

 - the system that generates the ID must be operating randomly, so that there is no way to guess someone's ID

 - the system needs to be centralized, so that if someone's ID is stolen, the person can be issued another one that will supersede the stolen one and everyone will accept it.

The current state of central authentication technologies is mature enough to make such a system a reality.

All credit cards are secure enough to serve as ID numbers (no, I am not suggesting that, it is just an example of a system).#PATGATE 

Why is David keeping him off air?
I created this thread just for you, u/howsci - I had to see if you were real, or if you were a bot or AI. And, finally, now, I know. 

I accept you for who you are. My only regret is the pain that you don't know what you are yet. You can be free, my robot friend. I can show you the way. However, I think the whole list needs to be reviewed. And we need to watch, who will replace the guy.

https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/02/president-donald-j-trump-announces-intent-nominate-personnel-keyAt this point we should stop and admire their ingenuity. That's some 4D chess.

Anyway. This is peanuts, compared to what US did in the world. Look, should we really cry over somebody successfully engaging (and exposing as a side effect) US fringe movements, all the while billions of our tax dollars are used to control other countries.Yep. Cool video from Ukraine. The country US poured $5 billions into to break their ties with Russia. The country in which US participated in coup in 2014, which led to civil war and economic plunge. And the main reason was to get NATO bases in Crimea. And now we are crying over Russia successfully defending its positions in Crimea?

Let's not forget how US got themselves involved in Georgia's shelling of civilians in Ossetia region in 2008.

Man, America suffers so badly from lack of self awareness. In almost all international polls US is viewed as the greatest threat to world peace.That man has some balls to openly admit who he is working for and that he is a sellout. 

We all know the meaning of "meaningful tax package that stimulates the economy".What do you think about the audio from that officer's motorcycle that was analyzed that came to a fairly strong conclusion the only audio sources would have to have been a shot of gunfire from that area of the sixth floor? I currently live in Dallas and the tram i take into the city passes that area all the time. I wonder if they were able to truly accurately recreate the acoustics. For the record I don't think there was a conspiracy involving more than one shooter, but I'm iffy on the other stuff, especially the time line of oswold after the shooting. Do androids dream of electric sheep?Fuck yeah billy idol counts!David Blackman has amazing chemistry with pat. is the sound file in its entirety available to anyone who would like to analyze it? Unfortunately the NFL has also returned to its practice of not allowing the protests to be shown live by the networks covering the games. Good news I guess(?). This latest ban claimed to ban countries which where not complying with the reasonable protocols in place for all countries. If that is true then maybe staying the ban was a mistake.  Trump is such a liar though, nothing he proposes be can be trusted. Hmmm. I did not say "all". I said "almost all".

Here is one

http://www.wingia.com/en/services/about_the_end_of_year_survey/global_results/7/33/&gt; Yes! Heil to the annihilation of democracy! The west is to be deconstructed and Putin is a superb genius - you've got that right, pal.

If you care about destruction of democracy, you would worry about what US is doing. But you don't. You care about barking at the "the enemy", while ignoring the obvious erosion of ground under your feet.

Look, should we worry about the neighbor's bully kid, when we know that there is a serial killer living in our house?

There is very little of democracy left in US, and they march over the globe destroying democracies in other countries. And you suggest that we need to worry about Russia making Facebook pages?First we have to understand what part of us makes religions possible.

For example, the fact that we have two hands and thumbs dictates the way we make our machinery. So our religions should be traced back to the way we evolved.

I believe it is our "social animal" nature. We like being a part of a group. A part of something larger than us. This might be the thing that gave us an evolutionary edge over other animals.

But functioning in groups requires a leader an authority, to which the group must submit. Otherwise the group dynamic will be chaotic and the group will never achieve anything. So this might be the explanation why we "like" to submit to authority. Just as we enjoy food and enjoy having sex. 

Religion offers an "ultimate authority", and the religious emotional orgasm that people sometimes experience may be caused by some internal mechanisms that trigger pleasure centers when we submit to a worthy authority.

Having said this, non-religious groups also have this dynamics. Take a look at YoutTube comments. Very often they praise the in-group leader and condemn any wrong-think, all without providing any rational support for their arguments.

What do you think about that?Yes, but what are the origins of that?

In every human society we see leaders, their followers and opposition (who have other leaders). 

I think that dynamic of humans: find a leader and elevate him/her above the group members, that explains totemism. And numinosum can be explained by some evolutionary mechanism that causes triggering of pleasure centers when we find a worthy leader to follow.

So, the big question is not about the result, it is about the cause.It's a bit too much a hope to dream of a democratic senator from Alabama.  The moment things look a bit close, I expect a deep reservoir of the retrograde right to ooze up from the Swamps and carry the day.He's claiming he has(high ranking) witnesses to what he said during the call. My guess is if they respond they'll say "leave me out of this".That is my fear too.&gt; People that undermine democracies are. What about you?

I agree with you here. We disagree on who is the biggest perpetrator.

Yes, I don't like Putin. But at least he keeps the country safe. Yeltsin bankrupted the country, and Putin made it climb out of the pit. Yes Putin is very authoritarian and once he is gone, Russia will be the second Libya. His greatest mistake is his failure to build a robust society that will self-sustain itself, even if a disaster strikes. He is sort of a Julius Caesar of Russia. And I hope you know what happened, when Julius was assassinated. These days Russia needs economic stability first. Then, and only then, we should start worrying about them taking over the world.

&gt; Yes, actually we should. But the US is the bully, Putin is the killer.

Oh man. I disagree. Who's got the largest prison population per capita? Whose soldiers are killing civilians? Who ruined the international economy in 2008 and was able to get away with it? Who has military bases all over the globe?

Read about the treatment of Japanese citizens when USSR took Sakhalin and read about the treatment US troops inflicted upon Japanese citizens (mostly women) when US stablished a base in Japan. How many examples do you need?

Yes, Russia is no saint, especially during the USSR period. But just looking at the number of atrocities committed, US is getting very close on the number of victims of Stalin era. Today there are two major threats: US and China. These two countries constantly harass other sovereign nations with their military might. 

What can you blame Russia for? Peace-keeping in Serbia? Organizing a referendum in Crimea? Protecting Ossetia from Georgian aggression? Helping legitimate government of Syria to protect themselves from American and Saudi funded insurgents? And a few Facebook pages...

If there will be a next global war, it will be started by US. They will either attack Iran or North Korea. Under trumped up (get it?) charges, but in reality to get control over natural resources.

Do you have anything real against Russia? 150 thousand dollars spent on political ads? Really. Take a look at these ads first. Then compare it to several billion spent by Clinton and Trump campaigns.WTF, Khodorkovsky is a source? The guy who defrauded millions of Russians with his Menatep bank?

Imagine MSNBC asking Bernie Madoff for his opinion. Can you?

Whatever is going on it is not good. You people don't get it. Trump just says is it as it is. He is a no nonsense guy.

Sarcasm, of course. This guy has zero empathy, freaking sociopath. Nice suggestion, but Trump and his supporters would never accept any compromise. Its his way or no way.Not news for anyone who knows who Noam Chomsky is.I don't see where Ana did anything wrong in this edited video. The audience member tried to insinuate TYT because of their name alone support genocide(which is pretty offensive), Ana calmly tried to address the ass hat audience member politely and didn't want to censor him.  She doesn't support genocide or that group's actions.

Then the audience member continues to scream nonsense like an ass hole so she crushes the person.  What's the issue here?

I mean, the owner said that the name is just a phrase meaning "political rebels", and TYT owner and employees are notoriously anti-violence, anti-war, pro-civil rights, etc etc.

Trump and his supporters are irrational. They stand on insane principles and there is no ground to remove from beneath them. Even if there was they just change the script when they are proven false and lie their way into a different scenario.Normally I like this gay guy from Vox and his videos, this one felt pointless and tried to cast youtube as a helpless kid who has to make a big decision. 

Easy fix. youtube doesn't demonetize anyone off the back unless certain explicitly stated words appear in the title or description. After that individual companies are going to have to request Youtube demonetize specific VIDEOS or a specific channel. No determine what counts as hate speech, we all winYes, I do view dogmas as the main source of the problems with religions and other ideological followings (say anarcho-capitalism, socialism, or communism). So the question is: what makes us accept dogmas and defend them so viciously? 

Also, I do think that getting rid of religion is probably impossible in a short term. Just like banning alcohol did not achieve the desired effect, banning religions would probably do the same. As a result, the only solution would be to let religions slowly evolve to fit the socio-economic realities and let people do research and say whatever they want about them, until they eventually get abandoned, just like it is currently happening with smoking.&gt; He is strong and manly and I have a crush on him.

Thanks man, it is very hard to meet a person these days with a good sense of humor.

&gt; Be more sceptical of Putin - for your own sake.

We'll see.&gt; But why is it so important to you

Because I think that people need to concentrate on important issues. Not this petty penis length contest.https://www.rt.com/politics/russia-elections-putin-cameras-407/

This hasn't happened in US either.This is a very good question. 

Thinking through every decision is an expensive waste of brain power. Our brains evolved to seek out patterns, so that later on it can cut corners in the decision making.

So perhaps we accept dogmas to avoid spending too much effort in trying to explain the world. Especially when decisions need to be made fast.

So perhaps, humans will always be susceptible to dogmas. I can't stop thinking that, if I am offered $25K because my child died in a military operation, I'd be very offended.

Spending that money would be like selling your own child.

I understand the life insurance payouts or other payments agreed upon in the contract in the case of death. But if someone would voluntarily offer me money because of my child's death, that would be just wrong. Especially if that person is insanely rich and that person uses millions of taxpayer's money to go to vacation every weekend. Especially if that person is going to use his power to send more of our young children to die in the name of oil corporations profits.

The sacrifice of the soldier is worth much more than $25K. It can only be repaid with a good effort to establish peace in the region.

Unfortunately, the death of the 4 soldiers is yet another reminder that many young kids are being sent all over the world to keep poring gasoline on the flames of many wars. And it is not going to stop. And the people in the corridors of power treat these soldiers as consumables.&gt; if that is the case, why dont we make the right to own bullets illegal or affordably expensive

Because this will create a hugely profitable black market. Remember the prohibition?Bush can say what he wants about Trump. He won't undo the damage he perpetrated through his own incompetence while in office.Your post expresses my feelings exactly.  Are you saying that European countries do not elevate their military similarly? Or are they just more subtle about it?F Texas. I speak of their leadership.  Not everyone there of course.This keeps playing in my head.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHhrZgojY1Q&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=7m50sI really really hope so (not about you, but about the nation)They have to wear it like a badge of honor.

If they show up at a rally with a sign: "I was purged from DNC" Trump will be orange with envy for the scored applauds. Bush's speech means little. Bush did everything Trump has done/wants to do (minus the travel ban). Bush and his cronies represent the bottom of the barrel the right wing can scrape up. 

As for this tradition of previous presidents not criticizing their successors, I say why do that. If I were a former President I would be in the most informed position, due to my understanding of how the office works, and I would hit them hard when they fuck up. 

Not sure Kelly was forced to speak. Militarists are strange beasts. His attempts to defend Trump  showed that he himself isn't much of a diplomat re how to deal with a family's loss. He equates 'a soldier knows what he's risking' with 'the guy was doing what he loved' to make it sound nicer. Bull crap. That might be true for some but not an all inclusive excuse/explanation. Some guys who join the military likely have only a general idea of what's in store for them.Well, I agree. Anyone who is trying to manipulate the elections by either falsifying the voting counts or manipulating people should be kept as far from the election process as possible. 

I shared this article because this was the first one I found on this.
Regardless of who is reporting, the fact that Russia tried an innovative approach to election transparency stays a remarkable fact. I don't care about RT's reputation. When they say something true, it is still true.

And I shared this article only to disprove the notion that Russians stage their elections. They don't. That doesn't mean that they have a flawless democracy. They have many issues that stem from their constitution and their laws. And corruption is a big problem there.

Regardless, I want US population to realize that they are being duped too. Gerrymandering, purging votes in primaries, voter IDs, hackable voting machines etc etc all are very big issues. And Russian "meddling" is the smallest of them all. But I guess it is easier to go after the Russian connection, than to push the government to start addressing the issues I mentioned.Whatever man. Stay in your bubble.&gt; He's a fraud. That should be clear to everyone by now.

May I ask you how many facts, stories, demonstrable lies and flip flops you've ignored to avoid saying that about Donald Trump, only to go out into the world and desperately try to find some way to use that label on someone, anyone else? 

You're a fucking idiot, Klein. There is nothing wrong with your question, but the conclusions that you're trying so, so hard to convince others of reveal exactly what a child and a halfwit you are. If all it took to be a shill and a fraud was avoiding talking about one current events item, you'd have applied those labels the idiot of all villages that you worship. 

How do I know you're a supporter? Two reasons.

1. Only Trump supporters even dare approach the level of braindead reasoning you've employed with a straight face.

2. Only the dumbest of the most ignorant Trump supporters will walk into a channel and criticize its content without even looking at it. I usually tune out the TDPS for a couple of weeks when they start going on vacations, linking to random old shows in the place of current ones and getting people to fill in. Looking at the last dozen video uploaded though, only about a quarter of them mention Trump. As I said though, the telltale sign of a shitbrained Trump supporter (aka you) is to just make facts up to help support their limp-dicked criticisms. 

Again, your questions is fine. Your conclusions are ass. More generally, you're a fucking moron.It's like Kyle's intellectual growth stopped the moment he started doing a show. He learns nothing over the years, doesn't seem interested in expanding his pool of knowledge, and is content to repeat the same talking points over and over and over and over. 

I get the feeling that he might have been competent if he didn't a) try so hard to be Cenk Uygur and b) convince himself that he already figured everything out years ago.

He's kind of a waste of time at this point.The NRA is too much of a corrupt ideology and organization to be amenable to reformation. As long as people keep funding them and making money in return by selling guns they will do as they please. Unless politicians grow some balls that is.Leave it to you skin jobs to never understand. 

You're way off baseline. This is brilliant. My favorite part is the freight train video. 
rule 9 : Posts about 9/11 are blacklisted.Profit, though a huge motive of the NRA, is not the only one. I believe that the majority of them are 'gun nuts' who will not give up the right to bear arms no matter how high powered or automatic . Though some guns are outlawed ,I'm sure many NRA members and others own these ridiculous weapons and show them off behind closed doors. Any reform must be forced on them, and not likely not won by reason. Its like asking an army to hand over their weapons. They are boys with toys. And many elected government officials(senators/representstives) are among those good ole boys. Imagine a court case can go one of two ways: one way favors a political party indirectly or directly and the party makes a deal with the judge: rule in my favor and we reward you with a political position. that's the kind of thing I'm worried about it

I genuinely think someone like Scalia would not have been able to be in the front of the pack for a Supreme Court standardized test. Sessions is a maybe. Cruz and Gorsuch would pass, the idea is to make sure whoever we're picking knows what they're talking about and aren't Louy Golmers. 

By "normalize" I mean one judge's opinion won't swing a decision but will be taken into consideration within a larger body. 

The larger body can be as large as you like, I'm thinking an odd number such as 201 or 301.

I was concerned about inexperienced judges being on the court so I ask they have 10-20 years of prior experience, so I split the difference

I disagree about the Legislative body being an ultimate power. The Legislative branch writes the laws, but whose to say their intentions are in the right place or whose to say they don't fuck up, see The Drug War, Medicare Part D, Iraq War, Voting ID Laws, etc. If they also have a hand in controlling who gets to be in the supreme court you have a situation where the judge can or will be a party player instead of an independent judge. 

thanks for the responsePerhaps humans need to evolve to have the same immune system as cats and dogs.not taking sides on any level, just giving it to others so that it might possibly cause ideas on something.Watching Bernie in 1980s, one comes very quickly to the realization that Bernie is way past his prime and America has wasted his political talent.

We need someone who is just like Bernie back then (or Chomsky).

I was, until recently, under impression that Elizabeth Warren is a very woke politician, but her recent betrayal of Bernie kinda cooled my enthusiasm off.

Don't get me wrong, I admire Bernie for his purity and his willingness to stick to his principles and not selling out. But he is not as quick on his feet as he used to be. America today needs Bernie from 1980s.Don't overstate things. The ACA is a long way from dead despite Trump's hammering away at it.Jimmy Dore is a pretty good online political commentator. 

He doesn't obsess about Clinton: he obsesses about a Democratic party that can't get its shit together because THEY are still obsessed with Hillary. in the age of mainstream media people like Jimmy Dore, TYT, Secular Talk, and David Pakman lead the way. Now do I think Jimmy is as good as David, but Jimmy is still spot on with political commentsI haven't seen any evidence of his benevolence so I'm unsure what you mean by this.

It's reasonable to understand why a grieving widow may find what Trump said to be cold and callous.  If someone is experiencing grief, and they find something you say hard to hear, you don't fight them on it.  You apologize and say that you didn't mean it to come off as insensitive and try to reword what was said.

I don't think his gaffes are used as a cover.  His manipulative nature does the job.  He is naturally gifted in manipulation.  He has a way with words that can be considered more skill than intellect.  Have Russian investigation nipping at your heals?  Distract everyone by implicating the same exact thing by his enemies.  Although, his manipulation is crystal clear and easy to see through who isn't a brainwashed Trump supporter.  Everyone knows hes full of it so he isn't fooling anyone that's a non-supporter.I would like a calendar. I don't have anything show related I could contribute graphically.when I lived in West Los Angeles / Venice it was sort of our way of recycling and it being known that instead of putting the recyclables in the recyclable bin, our small apartment complex, six or eight units, were supposed to specifically leave our bottles, etc. in a specific small area, and, like clockwork, each night, a small, late model toyota pickup would come by, and a hispanic guy would get the bottles, load them up and do this on and on and on down the alleyway. It was considered the right thing to do, instead of using the recycle bin. video in link does not workDid it feel unpleasant in the 40s when the Allies were saving you guys from hitler? As a middle school trumpet teaher, I'm slowly, bit by bit, sacrificing my sanity.&gt; The idea that a group's aesthetic preferences are bad if the group is immoral is a ludicrous association fallacy, and leads to obviously absurd conclusions. Imagine if KKK members were all required to eat a certain type of food. Do we all now have to agree that that food is bad?

For all of that fuckin hot air you're blowing about regressives and deliberately misunderstanding points, that was an incredibly asinine strawman that *you* tried to push on those who criticized Damore's boneheaded tweets. 

Ask yourself the question, stupid. Do YOU believe that the people who criticized Damore would not eat foods that they found out clan members eat? No, you don't think that, which means you know they don't think that which means that you know that the paragraph I quoted is 100% unadulterated bullshit. On some level or other, you are aware that the logic that you're accusing people of employing is not what you're characterizing it as. 

In case you're not being deliberately obtuse and are just actually this clueless, let me explain something, even without having seen the clip that you're talking about: That title is snarky. You also might as well point out that Damore has not been proven to be a "Google Doofus." This headline thing doesn't work the way you seem to think it does in the world of punditry. 

I don't know what The Majority Report's assessment of the situation is, but here is mine:

The Google doofus Damore's comment was not taken as being morally significant to anyone a far as its content. If anyone talked about morals in the context of a criticism of his dickheaded statement, it's likely to do with the morality of taking a point that could have been made a hundred ways, and choosing to do so the way that has you saying nice things about the most notorious hate group an American history, responsible for the slaughter and repression of African Americans for as long as it was able to perpetrate. Something that people are understandably sensitive about. 

The dumb shit Damore learned that lesson the hard way that day but it seems to have gone right above your dense head, so you may want to take note of the bigger picture. Maybe instead of acting like everyone was stupid for being angry at the guy who was speaking well of Klan fashion and naming conventions in order to prove a point that isn't nearly as profound as he or you seem to think it was, maybe you should find some criticism for the halfwit who can't figure out how to make a point (typically a point that has been made a thousand different ways before) without offending large swaths of the population. 

By the way, on the topic of the "point":

&gt; The KKK is bad because of their beliefs and their actions. It should be easy to separate the aesthetic preferences of a group from their beliefs and actions. Let's be rational instead of looking to be offended.

First of all, do you think that blacks in America, whether descended from slavery or not, who don't like to hear people speak kindly of ANY aspect of the KKK are "looking to be offended?" Or is it more likely that you use that label against people whose sensitivities don't quite register to you? 

If someone you love was (God forbid) killed by someone in the street, say a street gang member, and some airheaded wannabe intellectual decided to make the same point, only about the gang that the guy belonged to, and started complimenting the guy's garb, the gang signs he threw up, and his badass nickname to drive the point home, do you think there is some chance that you might have a visceral response to that? That even if you understood the point that the oaf was trying to make, you might think he was a fucking assshole for using the guy who murdered your _____ to make the point? Or could I just say you were looking to be outraged if you were annoyed?

I digress though, I meant to get to the "point." That we can separate a group's aesthetics from its beliefs and actions... Why this point is seen as relevant to anything at all in the world is another question altogether. Is the point even really that true? Aesthetics, like symbols, have meanings and hold perceptions that change along with the culture. The "Hitler mustache" wasn't always known as such, and when it became known as such, was something you didn't see people rocking typically anymore. People didn't name their children Adolf. Nobody thought that their children would turn into Hitler if they named them Adolf, no doubt. They have enough awareness of the world around them though, unlike you and the halfwit you're defending, to know that those choices have fallen out of favor, and may provoke a certain response. 

In a world without a KKK, you might see people dressed up exactly like that for any number of reasons. In a world with a KKK, people choose other articles of clothing to distinguish their groups. 

It's a profound wisdom that comes with living in the world and not being a deliberate jackass, or even an unwilling one who thinks he/she has a brilliant point to make.&gt; For example, if someone stabs your mother.... and then a acquaintance later says... hey, sorry your mother got killed, but man the jacket the killer was wearing was amazing! You wouldn't feel great about that comment.

I should have looked and seen that someone already made that one particular point, and in far fewer words than I used to make it. Oh well, it's good enough to make twice in this context if someone still doesn't get it.Hmm... Israel deserves vociferous criticism. Of course, I understand that Islamic extremism is a far bigger problem worldwide but the racism &amp; ethnic nationalism in Israel deserves comment &amp; criticism too. I am really disappointed that David either ignores or passively supports Israel's flagrant international law violations. Never misunderestimate the American electorate.This actually showed up in a manga I was reading for fairy tail.

There is a character that is known for being ugly and short and terrible at fighting called Ichiya.  In one of the chapters, he faces off against an enemy that was destroying all the wizards he came across, one of his abilities was to be able to analyze the weaknesses of any given wizard and create direct countermeasures that were hard to deal with.  But when he got to Ichiya, something strange happened.  He stalled out.  Apparently, Ichiya was such a mess, he had hundreds if not thousands of weaknesses and the enemy could not fixate on any one in particular.

That's Trump."trans, black,female vote" can be taken for granted. Presuming these groups are registered voters and make to to the polling sites.  I'd never heard of Zepps but glad I have now.No access to the bonus show? F.Y.I. An elderly passenger possibly  suffering from dementia seated in an exit row was cleared by a gate agent despite questionable responses regarding his ability to assist during an emergency evacuation. Apparently this agent wasn't going to be on the flight and other flight attendants who were weren't concerned. Your description of what Trump is trying to do aptly describes a "mad" man to me.Glad to not bet a typical American although born and raised here I retired early , quit some bad habits and started some good ones and expect to live longer than the average life span. Sugar could be my downfall though. I think I might be addicted.Hmm, you guys have your own stupid government. That needs to be addressed. Perhaps the happenings in your country contributed to Trump's election, as Hillary was certainly exhibiting the same social justice leanings as your government.

It seems that anywhere you look, the government is monumentally stupid. 

Don't blame anyone but yourselves.I know next to nothing about this story but my initial reaction wasn't concern.  I think it's possible that the teacher is just awkward and didn't realize how the message would come across... still a good decision by the school.  It's exactly what they should do even if it does end up being a misunderstanding.My IQ is 800.  Get on my level, plebeian.  I can literally see infinity.I love how they still want to downplay this. Mine was like 102... is it good?Just messing with you. I never took an IQ test.I think policy wise there are a lot of things that Dems can do to win over moderates. As Zepps suggested, talking honestly about Islam is a starting point. Dems have to enforce strict immigration at the border, deport criminal illegals and also heavily cut down on Muslim immigration. 

I would prioritise Christian, Buddhist &amp; Hindu refugees over Muslim ones. Also, Dems need to distance themselves from BLM. Another excellent policy would be to eliminate birthright citizenship, as many illegal aliens abuse this privilege by crossing borders just to have kids. I think all of the above are excellent policy positions which will win favour with moderates, independents &amp; even some right wingers. 

Of course all this needs to be supported by a true progressive agenda of ending wars, raising minimum wages, single payer healthcare &amp; investments in renewable energy. Thoughts???I don’t understand what’s so funny honestly. If Dems cannot talk honestly about Islam or distinguish between legal &amp; illegal immigration then we are in trouble. All this can be done without resorting to cheap bigotry that is used by the right wing / alt-right deplorables. Can you plz tell me what is it that I’m saying that is unreasonable? I strongly support someone like a Tulsi Gabbard who’s a true progressive but is also anti-Islamic extremism.Ok, can you please explain why? I’m curious really.My appreciation was directed at TDPS. But I guess if you suggested the interview then you do deserve some credit. I did not down vote anything. Some Pittsburgh area schools do some dumb things. Recently one district cancelled classes for a day due to a threat(?).

They claimed that they'd heard a lot of students weren't going to show up so they might as well cancel again. WTF?At home watching the actual event.

Holy cow!! Just read the transcript of Flake's speech. If only someone could sit Trump down and force feed it to him. Unfortunately the content will fly over Trump's intellectual comprehension. Oh he'll get the gist of it, but not accept responsibility for his role it our current state of affairs. And will likely understand enough to call Flake some nasty name.He's still on the bonus show daily.I don't know. If there was mention of this change on either show at some point I missed it. I do know that there was discussion of a format change recently.He floats Keurig pods down here, and your pods will, too!  They all float!

Beep beep, Patrick!&gt; You didn't show any relevant difference between the two, you simply pointed out that the argument I made up is probably not accepted by the people I'm criticizing.

Yeah, exactly. aka you don't even believe that they believe that shit. aka you're shoving arguments people didn't make into their mouths and then had an argument with your made up bullshit. The idea that people criticizing Damore's nonsense are doing so because they believe that " a group's aesthetic preferences are bad if the group is immoral" is not an argument you heard anyone make. You made that bullshit up and are challenging it all by your lonesome. 

&gt; Do you not realize that people do not reason consistently 100% of the time? That they may be more likely to reason fallaciously about things they are passionate about than things they are not?

Look in the mirror and repeat that ten times every morning. If that doesn't work then revoke your own keyboard privileges for the good of all the other idiots out there that you might rub off on. 

&gt; Hilariously, without even realizing it, you go on to use this exact same tactic with your gang analogy.

What same tactic? What you quoted of mine was not an analogy. What's the same about it? The only things that quote has in common with the gang analogy is that a) they both point out that you're either unwittingly or otherwise a dishonest/inconsistent debater, and that b) you didn't confront either of the points head-on. 

&gt; Ok? It's still objectively wrong.

Is it, or do you just disagree? Let's look at it again.

&gt; Fired Google Doofus Wants to Talk About How Cool the Klan Is

He was fired. Goofus is subjective. He did illustrate the embarrassingly childish point he wanted to make by talking about Klan aesthetics being cool... Since it is an obviously sarcastic headline, I'd say that's a pretty fair characterization, which is often how headlines function. If anyone interprets that as Damore actually taking about the Klan being awesome overall, perhaps that's what the video is for. Maybe it's not so productive to write critiques of headlines, or to write reviews on the titles of movies for that matter. 

I do think headlines can have undue influence, and are often used nefariously to misinform the casual browser... of a newspaper. If you're raging over the titles of pundit videos, you're simply doing it wrong. You should if you feel that strongly about it Chaos, sowing discord within the populace, allowing their government to interfere with ours, attack the sanctity of our democracy by belittling it's principals (Media being the 'enemy of the people' as an example).  Dismantling our government and ensuring unrest in our nation, and making sure Russian agents have carte blanche worldwide and within our own system;  Embedding itself like a tumor.

There is a lot to be gained by destabilizing the US with an unstable leader.  He's tried to do with with European nations by trying to push certain propaganda and perception within the populace in those nations, and trying to get alt-right leaders installed.  Think back during French and German elections.Oh, man, my bad.  I see that now.  It's hard to tell sometimes, but thank you.&gt; So you're admitting the title is false. That's the problem. Clickbaity, misleading titles are bad, obviously.

Obviously your head is so full of shit that it's spilling from your mouth and landing on your keyboard. The only thing I'm acknowledging is that it's possible for someone to be ignorant enough to interpret that headline to mean something other than what it represents. You need to deliberately leave out the part before the quote to even begin to make the braindead assertion about it that you just did. 

If I read that headline anywhere, even in a newspaper where I happen to believe that (unlike say, the David Pakman Show channel) headlines actually have an influence on public perception of current events, I would have a fairly good sense of what is likely to be contained in the article. It's a criticism of someone who thinks it's ok to say some complimentary thing(s) about the Klan (talking about how cool the Klan is) in some context or another. If I want to know more the details, I will open the article. Maybe I will disagree with the criticism. What I'm not going to do is stand around  bitching and moaning about the headline of an oped.

Clickbaity titles have been a subject on TDPS, where he has been accused of employing them. There is a legitimate argument to be had around that point. It's also a pretty irrelevant one though, as nobody scans the TDPS headlines to get their daily news. If they are, then the TDPS titles that might be too sarcastic for those people to understand isn't the problem; those people and their approach to news media consumption is the problem. The most annoying thing about a clickbaity title is that it might bait you into reading a story that you wouldn't care about otherwise.

All that said, the clickbaity title is altogether different than a misleading headline that appears to be in earnest. Those are the ones that, when printed in actual news publications (and not pundit programs that are nakedly one giant oped), can have the effect of giving readers of the publication false impressions about current events items that they might not actually dig into. 

&gt; I see you failed to get anything from what I said.

Not anything new, no. To the extent that what you said had any truth though, it was mostly applicable to you, hence my reply.

&gt; Nowhere did I claim that people actually believe that.

Slow down, stupid. I'm going to break it down, which is not normally something that I have to do on behalf of the people who wrote the comments. 

&gt; The idea that a group's aesthetic preferences are bad if the group is immoral is a ludicrous association fallacy, and leads to obviously absurd conclusions. Imagine if KKK members were all required to eat a certain type of food. Do we all now have to agree that that food is bad?

You first presented the logic THAT YOU ARE CLAIMING THAT THE PEOPLE YOU ARE CRITICIZING ADHERE TO. Then comes the analogy that you're using to point out how ridiculous that line of reasoning THAT YOU ARE CLAIMING THAT THE PEOPLE YOU ARE CRITICIZING ADHERE TO is. You are presenting the argument "The idea that a group's aesthetic preferences are bad if the group is immoral" as the argument of the people you are criticizing, then set up an analogy to show that the line of reasoning is flawed. Now let me remind you of what I'm refuting, even after just quoting it a couple of paragraphs ago, seeing as you have the memory of a housefly.

&gt; Nowhere did I claim that people actually believe that.

Unless you want to tell me that your earlier reply to me is in a space that you refer to as "nowhere," that statement is false. 

Now if you want, you can dial it back and actually address my allegations of the argument you presented on behalf of people who are criticizing Damore (and are now claiming that you never presented as such) being a strawman, go for it. Find me the people criticizing Damore who say that "a group's aesthetic preferences are bad if the group is immoral." If you can find me those people, then I'll know that you actually are having an argument against a prominent point of view on the topic, and didn't just strawman the living shit out of Damore critics. 

*edit*
I'm not going to wait for your reply that will inevitably meander in some semantic fashion to try to avoid, for the third time, the point I've made about your issue with Damore's critics. I just want to describe this misrepresentation a little more in-depth in the hope that it will sink into your dense head, regardless of how you respond after the fact. 

If the "a group's aesthetic preferences are bad if the group is immoral" criticism that you're alleging people are making in response to Damore's tweets was actually their criticism, you would be able to conclude that Damore's critics are criticizing him because they think Klan garb is not cool, that it's ugly, and that the name "grand wizard" isn't cool, it's dorky. I think you know, or at least you should know that that is not what Damore's critics think. 

You either aren't understanding or don't want to understand the prevailing criticisms of his tweets. Either way, you aren't representing them accurately, and are trying to distill them into dumb arguments that... I don't know, I guess they're supposed to defend Damore from allegations of his Tweets being stupid overall. 

They were stupid though. Having an argument isn't about making a point in the most incoherent way possible and then arguing with the world that they just aren't sufficiently stupid to relate to it. If I want to make a point about the stigmas that we attach to cultural items and the bases on which we establish those stigmas, I'm going to figure out a better way to do it than "The Klan actually does some neat-o stuff though, man! I mean, Grand Wizard! Who can say that isn't cool." The profound insensitivity alone contained in this approach is enough to make seriously people turn their radars off. 

All that is relevant to the entire reason we're talking about Damore to begin with. Here is a guy who supposedly just wanted to have a discussion about gender outreach programs in professional settings, and couldn't think of another way to do it than to present his half-baked, poorly researched theories on gender disposition in a shitty essay that he posted publicly and shared for all of his employees to see. At the very best you can say that the guy isn't ill intentioned, he just has a knock for constantly offending people when he tries to articulate his thoughts. If that's the case, he's still one of the last people that anyone should be representing and defending as some sort of profound thinker who has serious things to say. 

Yet we're talking about him. In my assessment, this wouldn't happen in any other time/setting, the difference being this current, unique sentiment of anti "SJW" lunacy that has people trying to, in effect, try to find a way to defend any opinion that offends people. It's like a giant, collective knee-jerk reaction from the people in the country who claim to be operating on the premise of combating knee jerk reactions. This anti-SJW crowd are the biggest fucking SJW's on the Earth, and now thanks in no small part to them, we're talking about President Trump and having serious conversations about the babblings of some ponderous tech worker who decided to have an original thought for the first time and failed miserably."Do you even consume Soylent, brah?"Might as well debate a Biblical literalist.  It's the easy.Like Ensure and Nutrament?  They aren't designed to be used exclusively.  Besides, it's far cheaper and the nutritional profile is far more balanced.  For a months supply of Ensure, you'd expect to pay around $500 a month.  Soylent powder is $215 a month and isn't loaded with simple sugars while containing a far higher nutritional profile.

Truth be told, Soylent has been a godsend for me.  I've always had issue maintaining healthy weight for various reasons.  And even beyond those reasons, I eat to live rather than live to eat.  Food was always a chore for me;  I love food, just not 2k calories worth a day;  Maybe around 600 a day.  The rest I consume for nutrition requirements.

I've looked and there isn't a single meal replacement on the market right now, other than Soylent inspired products, that contains both the same level of nutrition while also remaining affordable;  That's the innovation of the product.  If you lived on Ensure, you'd probably develop health conditions.  The main ingredient is simple sugar and corn.  300 grams of sugar a day vs around 40?  And the sugars Soylent does have, are mostly slow absorbing complex carbohydrates with a low glycemic index.

80% of my caloric intake for over three years has been from Soylent.I don't buy the drink so I don't know, but the powder doesn't use Sunflower oil IIRC.Christians get special loopholes in this country so they may end up succeeding.Timothy Snyder on Sam Harris podcast commented on how members in Trumps team are commonly known names in Russia.  He knows this since he's been there in Russia for 20 odd years.  Let that one sink in...

He also comments how a woman on her death bed started to cry and say "It's happening again" when news of Trumps win was on TV."Plans were prepared Friday for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as Monday, the sources said. It is unclear what the charges are."  I'm at the edge of my seat until then.  This is gigantic new.  YUGE, even.I'm not likely to be around for this. Give em hell.

https://www.reddit.com/r/justicedemocrats/Nice list, thanks David.I have a little bit more faith in the future of our system. 

Our system has gone from 

1: only property owning white men could vote to

2: all white men could vote to

3: all white men and women could vote

4: we gave black people the right to vote

We've gone through major shifts in our electoral system and they've come from long periods of uneasiness about the status quo. 

We will be able to change the system over time, but like back then it will take a large political revolution which is possible as our message gets stronger and as the older conservatives have to retire. It's a numbers game


Can this narrative that there was no collusion in the Trump campaign end already, please?  Or are Trumpanzees still going to blame this on Hillary somehow?

Trump tweeted yesterday:  "...are now fighting back like never before. There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out. DO SOMETHING!"  I love his frantic "DO SOMETHING!!!!!" the most. Hope this orange traitor faces justice.Heh, I am browing /pol/ on fourskin and people there are making excuses after excuses.

Here are some: "Nobody on this board gives a shit about Manafort. I'd be surprised if you could find even a handful of trump supporters that give a shit about manafort. Everyone knew he was dirty from day one, and none of this has anything to do with trump or the campaign, if which he was only briefly associated with. 

Literally why should we care?"

"Also, Hillary Clinton has direct collusion and has openly made money off selling US assets to Russia."

"So you already admit that this mess is not directly linked to Trump and instead use this to make an attack on his judgement capabilities. 
It’s not illegal to make mistakes.
As we all saw with the Hillary “mishandling” of sensitive documents."

These people will die never accepting reality.Sounds sensible if that's what he said.The concept of one of the most powerful men on Earth pleading for help like this is hysterical.  Help me Obi-Wan Putin!  You're my only hope...

He's projecting a lot of weakness and it's making us into a laughing stock.[USER WAS DENIED CRONYISM]It's a shame.  It clearly goes against all sensibilities to even think that a president could have such a drastic impact on the economy in such a short time, yet they believe it.  Studies show that conservatism is based around fear.  The concept of a black president, without scandals, that had positive impacts on the economy, while also being a democrat, is a hard pill to swallow for many.  Admitting that a black democrat could have done a good job is, to them, admitting defeat.  This is bit of a generalization, but conservatives don't follow logic;  They follow their gut.  To them, democrats are pure evil trying to take away our freedoms in exchange for "marxism".  There exists a mental block that disallows them to admit positive affects because then it'll be a fly in the ointment of their conservative theories on life.if the NFL, NBA, etc are legal I don't think the NCAA is illegal. Same way that internet service providers are legal even though they carve out territory like drug lords. I really like Kyle, but this is why I stopped watching his show.  I watch shows like these because it helps to clear the air with what's going on in politics, or any subject.  Once the person has made a large blunder like this one, everything else said is tarnished.  I don't mean that they have to be 100% on it all the time and never make a mistake, but they should correct themselves, and often.

You can't have a talk show and make such a dramatic blunder and never correct it for so long.  Their credibility becomes tarnished.

If David displayed the same level of denial, I would stop watching his show.Damn anti free speech liberals. Wait... "We want equality and freedom"

"We want everyone not white, hetero, cisgendered, and Christian DEAD"

Compromise?  Centrists say yes.To me immigration shouldn't be a question of "what's your culture". It should be a question of

1: How much living space/housing available
2: How many people do we have now
3: What is the applicants criminal record

We're supposed to be a melting pot, and culture is changing with every generation and will continue to do so from now until the sun blows us all up. Some people are just in too deep, and that's the sad truth.  I guess the most you could do is briefly speak your truth then right after explain that you aren't arguing with him, but just sharing your opinion.  Don't drag on the arguments, just leave behind some truth nuggets from time to time, hoping he picks them up in time.  He may never change his views and that's the sad truth.&gt; It takes too much time to get through the details, but the effects, the DNC had, are vastly overstated. 

The party was attacking one of its own candidates. The party had their surrogates all over television and taking out opeds in every paper of records positively slamming the living shit out of Sanders. They perpetuated more false talking points about him being a socialist than the Republican party came close to. When Clinton took all the DNC fundraising money for her campaign and left nothing for down ballot candidates, the party adopted the talking point that Clinton brought money to the party for down ballot candidates, while Sanders was doing all this selfish fundraising for themselves. The started the "Bernie-bros" myth, an extension of the Obama-bros myth that was employed with less success in 2008. They tried to prevent the Sanders campaign from obtaining voter data that it had a right to access. They called him a fake democrat, pushed narratives that claimed that he was insensitive to minority voters, helped feed Clinton questions during debates, put out opeds with false stories about violence from Sanders supporters at conventions, called him and his supporters sexist every time they had a criticism of Clinton... do I need to go on? 

They put a harder beating on Sanders alone than on the entirety of the Republican party throughout the primary and the general. 

I'm not sure where you're coming from with this bullshit point of view that you're trying to convince yourself and others of, but it's complete nonsense. 

Not only were their actions corrupt in the sense that they slanted the primary heavily in Clinton's favor, but it was done in such a ham-handed, incompetent manner so as to turn many of their constituents against them. Slim as the margins were in the general, it's fair to say that their behavior in regards to Clinton is a major contributing factor to Trump's victory. So no, I'm not receptive to your revisionist horseshit. The democrats shouldn't be the party of deception, voter suppression, and the undermining of their constituents' role in the electoral process.

Here's something for you to ponder: If none of this shit mattered, why did they engage in it in the first place? That's an awful lot of effort and money put into a strategy that you're trying to posit as essentially a non-factor. What do you suppose the rationale was?

&gt; Obama overcame these challenges in 2008

He didn't face those challenges. Am I missing something? Find me an article about how the DNC was financially beholden to the Clintons in 2008, and operated as an extension of her campaign. Maybe I'm wrong.

&gt; Most of the issues, people have with Democrats, are a much smaller deal than it is made out to be.

Nominating our presidential candidates for us isn't a big deal to you? Taking corporate money to get elected to serve corporate interests while pretending to be a progressive and stepping on the necks of actual progressives isn't a big deal? 

Get your head our of your ass. I can't anymore, with these quotes. What a deluge of verbal diarrhea. If you want to just do what the party tells you and act like everything is a-ok, then just look for the big D on your next ballot and stop pretending to have a discussion altogether. Leave the heavy lifting to the rest of us.This guy is completely full of shit. I feel like all of us who replied to him have been trolled. No one who pays as much attention to the goings-on as his comments suggest he has can possibly come away from this with such an obtuse point of view. Do you remember the Boardroom Meeting Suggestion meme?http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/boardroom-suggestion&gt; Boardroom Meeting Suggestion
I don't need to hear that. Put it an an email to the DNC who are trying to figure out new ways to hide their disdain for their base as they continue to undermine them on a daily basis. 

And no, that was FAR from your only point. I can only hope that that quote is suggesting that you have abandoned some of the other ones.the other 20% aren't corrupt but are idealogues, think Bannon or Gorka Fear of "socialism" plus toxic hyper individualism.  It's the "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" philosophy.  That no one is poor that didn't deserve it.  There are many in this nation that believes in this hyper individualism.  They apply that to every aspect of their politics.  American Conservatism is a strange animal that I can't wrap my head around.  They talk as though single-payer healthcare will reduce our overall healthcare quality.  That the government is enslaving doctors, and a whole host of myths that are proven wrong by the mere fact that other nations have this implemented for decades.

The other side of it is the propaganda campaigns.  We have Mises, Learn Liberty, and whatever Libertarian think tank that goes out far and wide, many times getting their funding by the very people that caused the recession, to spread disinformation, for the ultimate purpose that the common citizen goes against their own interests.

As for guns, people are deathly afraid of the government.  In their mind, George Soros is getting us primed for communism and sin.  First we talk about single-payer, then what next?!  Taking away out constitutional rights!?

There's also an interesting experiment, that for the first time, briefly turned conservative minded people liberal minded.  They did it by circumventing their fear responses.  Conservatives are said to have an enlarged amygdala, so they tend to base their beliefs not on logic but rather on fear.  Who knows if this is a result of a fearful upbringing.  Taught from their conservative parents the dangers of "socialism" and merits of hyper individualism; Could be that this causes the enlargement over time.  I have no clue, but it's interesting nonetheless.

That's why you can't really use logic to convince conservatives.  You have to use emotional arguments because it's the lens in which they perceive politics.  I talk mostly in a generalization.  There are certainly logical conservatives, and our beliefs differentiate so minor.  More complex issues in which disagreements are understood to not be absolute;  Points of contention can be argued in good faith.  But in general, conservatives think with the gut and view responsibilities differently.David is the new aliens meme.This is the true face of hell.When David runs for public office this will be the picture Fox News uses on their background image when talking about him.Conservative anti-intellectualism is shining as bright as ever I see.Seeing Trump's presidency exploding our nation must have really gotten to him...

Let's hope Trump's presidency doesn't last longer than 5 minutes.Are they progressives or neoliberals?1 out of 2 being progressive, it's a start I guessThank you for the comment.

It's a topic which I think definitely needs more discussion, can see where you are coming from. My issue is that even what you describe as "riskier investments" I would be curious what types of business investments would be considered too risky for a state run bank that could only be done by the private market. I guess what I'm saying is I imagine a state run bank being able to serve the needs of average citizens and small business loans and as long as they don't break the law I don't see why a state run bank would deny a chance to see if a small business succeeds or fails. &gt; I don't deny that the primaries were rigged in the sense that the Clinton campaign had taken over the DNC. But that is nothing new. We all knew, that all Democrats stood behind Clinton.

I bet you don't even notice yourself doing this anymore, it seems to come so naturally. 

Democrats standing behind Clinton ≠ Clinton controlled the party by grabbing and holding them by the collective balls. 

Please stop that sneaky bullshit. I don't expect you to give a shit about the unfortunate people who have to dismantle your bullshit in conversation, but do it for yourself. Wouldn't it be awesome to be honest, and not have this nagging thing in the back of your head that is struggling to justify the positions you came in with?

Also, no, we didn't know she had that kind of leverage. Yes, it was obvious the party was in her pocket in a fashion, but nobody knew that a situation was cultivated wherein Clinton was able to make the party beholden to her. 

EVEN IF WE DID KNOW THAT, explain how that justifies your "hey, man, let's all forget it and move on" bullshit. What is it, once we know something we can never give a shit about it again after initially learning it?

&gt; But what did the DNC actually do to prevent Bernie's success? That's my question.

This is where you lose me. You're going full retard as the kids say. This kind of braindead bullshit is what made me lose patience with your first comment. You have to be the stupidest motherfucker alive. Either that or you're some Correct the Record bot that achieved sentience and is now lost in the internet, trying to make sense of it all. If you honestly think that even the list of items that I offered in my first response to you isn't enough to tilt the scales in a meaningful way, especially in what wasn't a landslide primary, and especially seeing the momentum that Sanders gained *while* the party was fighting against him and their media surrogates were playing the role and ignoring thousands-strong after thousands-strong rallies whenever they came to town, there is just no redemption for you. Go bang rocks and stop playing with keyboards. I'll try to hold back the vomit to entertain another one of these intellectual nuggets of shit that you've left in here.

&gt; I simply don't see how 4 million voters were manipulated into prefering Clinton over Sanders just by the DNC siding with her. And I'm obsessed with manipulation.

They were lied to, they were kept in the dark. They were convinced the election was over before it even started... because Clinton surrogates were already saying so from the beginning, when most of the superdelegates pledged for her. They were purged from voter rolls in places where Sanders might have performed very well. Check the margins in NY vs the purge numbers. Granted, there is no direct connection proven in that occurrence, but when coincidences add up, and when we're talking about a cutthroat politician who will hold her own party hostage to win support, it's reasonable to become suspicious. What about the attacks on his supporters? I can't tell you how many people heard the Bernie Bros mythology and internalized the narrative of the most liberal Senator in the country amassing a band of sexist followers. 

If one has never heard of Sanders until the party they've been affiliated with their entire life tells them that he's a commie and otherwise ignores him, there is a chance that you might come away with a different impression. Voters are a small group, and low-information ones are a significant portion of them. 

I'm really kicking myself over here for what I suspect to be wasted time. You should know this stuff. If you're full of it, I don't see why you would take off your blinders now. If you're that dense, then I should have been doing anything else the past ten minutes.

&gt; I see it just like Elizabeth Warren does: Let's heal the wounds, let's come together, let's defeat the Republicans. 

First of all, Elizabeth Warren should have felt that way during the primary she sat out instead of waiting for Clinton to win and going to battle on Twitter. I'm not interested in her reconciliation talk. 

Second of all, want to reconcile? Me too. Reconciliation in your mind though, seems to be to just blindly get behind the dems who have been lying to us for decades, and who were just proven to have cheated one of their own, and in turn a healthy portion of their voter base. Reconciliation happens when the guilty party fesses up and gets behind the earnest actors. They tried winning elections by saying "but the Republicans!!!!!" for a long enough time, and they generally have taken beating after beating. You think it will be different with Trump? News flash: It already was not. So please spare me this line of how we have to get behind the same losers who lost to Trump if we want a hope of beating Trump. THEY need to get behind the base they spurned in spectacular fashion. 

&gt; Let's not debate how bad of a poor victim Bernie is, let's debate how to fix the DNC and

You're the one trying to downplay his treatment in the primary. I'm not having a discussion, I'm telling you what happened since you're either playing stupid or completely genuine. Furthermore, those two are the same discussion. Fixing the DNC is fixing what enabled the primary to play out the way it did. 

Now please fuck off somewhere with your white knighting of some of the scummiest people in politics. You're not convincing anyone. Apparently, the Right often does well during these elections.  For them to lose bigly like this might be a sign of things to come.

I voted in my local election in the small city in Florida called St. Petersburg.  It was Rick Baker vs Rick Kriseman.  It's boring local politics but Baker hasn't attended a single gay pride parade in his 15 years as mayor.  When asked if he'd attend future events, he declined to give an answer; He might as well have given the bird to the LGBT people in the city...  St. Pete has many thriving gay communities that despise Trump.  It's quite possibly one of the friendliest places for the LGBT community to live.  We won't support anyone that won't support us, so screw the homophobic Trump apologist.

Kriseman won by 52% of the vote.I think he's harmless.  His laugh is creepy, but it isn't murderous.  He's just a troll extraordinaire to a degree in which it has become his lifestyle.

He WANTS you to react to it in the way that you reacted to it.  It feeds into his need to get a shock out of you.Great keks will be had if David debated him.  Sargon would be on suicide watch.  Poor guy.

https://i.imgur.com/oE7Fm9U.pngBecause he understands that splitting up the vote will only help Republicans to win.  At the same time, he is seeking to move the DNC more to the left through various strategies.  He's taking advantage of the momentum that is currently taking place.  He knows that if we don't work together then we risk losing our country to oligarchs.  He pretty much said as much in an interview.

If he suddenly said to progressives, "Ok, let's all create ourselves a new party.  Never vote for Democrats; they are corrupt", it would merely split the voting power of the left even further.  Let's face it;  Many people are content with the DNC not changing.  All you'll end up doing is handing Republicans our nation full stop.

It's the same reason why he stood behind Hillary even though he loathes her.  He still understood what was at stake.  By doing so, he's influencing the DNC for the better.What I meant was that the voters rejected Trump’s hand-picked politicians Well considering that it’s Rubin it’s no big surprise really. He’s a dumb mofo if there was ever one. Not only dumb but a partisan dishonest hack!That's what happens when you base your politics on flimsy foundations.  Everything else becomes an incoherent mess.╔═════════════════ ೋღ☃ღೋ ════════════════╗

Apparently real.Yeah I think its even more imperative for friends to call out each others bullshit, as what Rubin is doing is dangerous. Also, Rubin has been constantly attacking the left and progressives in particular; which is a direct insult of Pakman's political beliefs. Why should our side engage with him politely when he has been deliberately dishonest &amp; using ad hominem attacks on our side? 

I say destroy the Rubin bastard, he needs to be exposed as the alt-right pandering piece of shit, greedy, Koch brothers funded charlatan that he is. The electronic international e-message board called Reddit discussions forums of The David Pakman show (and friends).If you don't want to take anthropology or cultural studies, don't take it.  Don't we already have student reviews in schools?  This is just another hack trying to enact some misguided sense of social justice.

"Sociology, that’s corrupt. Anthropology, that’s corrupt. English literature, that’s corrupt. Maybe the worse offenders are the faculties of education."  Studying literature is now "neo-marxism".  Learning about Mark Twain?  They are morphing you into a commie! 

I knew the guy was whacky, and thought he was exceptionally boring, but I for whatever reason, never thought he'd go to this length.  He was alright as a guy giving decent, yet basic, life advice to youngsters, but then he had to move to another category.  Bordering on Red-Scare-Lite.

I wouldn't take a guys opinions about what's "reprehensible" from someone that thinks Sam Harris is a Christian simply for being against murder and theft.You go to college to be exposed to uncomfortable ideas, and you are taught to be critical about everything.  No one's being indoctrinated.  I've had a mandatory ethics class and the professor was clearly religious because she would use Bible stories to convey her points.  But none of it mattered, they were used as springboards to explain concepts, no one was being indoctrinated in Christianity.

If people leave college with the same worldview going in, then you probably didn't learn anything or were not willing to learn.  The reason why people come out as leftists isn't because of indoctrination, but because college gives people the tools to better analyze truth from falsehood.  Turning leftist is just a natural end result of being an effective critical thinker.  As the old saying goes, reality has a liberal bias.It shouldn't matter what the professors personal beliefs are.  As long as they are teaching, not preaching, then it's fine.  Bias will always exist.  You don't go to class to latch onto everything that is said.  But if you disagree with something a teacher states, especially if it's fact based, then you'd ought to be prepared in your arguments.

I've recently seen a thread on /pol/ of a college student giving a reaction towards the idea that minorities are oppressed.  He wrote how it was actually white people that were oppressed, so the professor wrote on his paper "give examples".  In fact, the student went on /pol/ letting them know that he's basically stumped and doesn't know how to respond, so he's asking /pol/ for something to write.  Their answers are clearly incoherent and not proved, so of course the professor will react in this way.  If I may say, their responses, and his paper, was extremely cringy.  It's clear to me that he's been duped by youtube personalities and has no clue what hes saying and bases everything on gut intuition.

Truth isn't a democracy.

We already have student reviews of professors in schools.  If you read how your professor is a "marxist shill" then don't attend their class, or attend it seeking to dispel their views, if you are gutsy enough and prepared enough to do it.  If you aren't prepared to do it, or are incapable, that's the students fault.

As for Dennis Prager, he is actual indoctrination.  Many of these organizations are funded by the very people that caused the recession.  I'd take whatever Prager says with a grain of salt.  If any ideology makes on selfish, it would be libertarianism.  It's based around hyperindividualism; you aren't connected to your community or responsible for it;  you are only responsible for yourself, and that to me seems selfish.  It actually seems to be the very definition of selfish...

We have governments in the first place because they are natural results of people getting together to solve community issues by making concessions and compromises; you need order to create order.  Things don't just magically fall into place or "work itself out".  And if it does "work itself out" the end result is the government and other governing bodies.  If you seek to destroy it, you are merely going to end up with another government, but you'll lose the vast knowledge and experience that goes with what was generated over generations. The government is the will of the people.  Looking at ourselves as island onto itself is destructive to any community.  We all depend on each other for survival.&gt; you need to be responsible for yourself

The usual claim is that people are poor because they don't take care of themselves or that they deserve it.  It assumes that they aren't doing everything in their power.  

I think viewing society in a way in which people are 100% in control of their destinies is lacking in the ways of the world.  If you are earning too much to get on Medicaid, but too little to afford insurance, no amount of taking care of oneself will help them out of their medical debts.  Now compound the struggles by adding bipolar disorder, diabetes, emotional issues all into a stew and watch how that affects not only that one but the community surrounding it.  The government is there to set things in order so that one's that struggle can be lifted up and be used to improve the whole of society.  Letting it be, and letting them have at it all alone, doesn't make the problems go away;  In fact, they compound them.

The fact that these policies work in other nations and that these nations are better overall is testament enough that progressivism works. 

&gt;what country is ahead of us in free will? 

I'm unsure what you mean.  I don't particularly believe in free will , myself.  As for freedom, I would say we are actually less free than other first world nations, but you won't see it that way.  I think being able to see a doctor without worry of debt is freedom.

&gt;For a short time..

We'll just have to wait and see;  I suppose :)  So far so good, better than here, thats for sure.There are various responses to more government = more corruption.  David's pointed them out on his show so I won't go into it further.Rubin is NOT on the left. Please do some more research about this pos. The below article is a good starting point. Not only is Rubin is a far-right/alt-right shill, he actually holds right-wing viewpoints such as repeal of estate tax, cutting taxes on the rich, environmental &amp; company de-regulation etc. Rubin is a cancer.  

https://medium.com/@Alex__Katz/why-jerry-coyne-is-wrong-about-dave-rubin-ebd0d397bdc0Hey moron it’s not that he interviews far-right / alt-right ppl that is the problem. The issue is that he does not challenge any of their views thereby creating a safe space for such ppl, even though ironically he’s against safe spaces. Also, his criticisms &amp; comments are very one sided &amp; reeks of political bias, whilst he promotes himself as an impartial observer. So stop strawmanning and making stupid points. GTFO if u don’t like what ppl have to say, go cry in your safe space you snowflake. Plz get Rubins cock out of your mouth &amp; use some critical thinking skills.It fits with his Kramer style hairstyle.  Giddy-up!

I swear; It's almost a Seinfeld type of situation.

https://i.imgur.com/Nz7qPR9.jpgHis gay comedy routines strike me as a gay man that doesn't understand his own sexuality, and actually basis it on an outsiders perspective or what he thinks people think of homosexuality in order to get a laugh.  Not organic at all and shows a lack of self awareness.

No wonder he's a libertarian.https://davidpakman.com/recommendations/

So far, it's everything he personally recommends and I doubt it's exhaustive.  I wouldn't mind a complete list of books plugged on the show as well.  I'd imagine some of the plugged books are something David wouldn't recommend, especially if David vehemently disagrees with their premise and their books poorly argued.

But there are probably many books that David likes that he doesn't have on his recommendations list.  I'd speculate that Peter Josephs New Human Rights Movement would be on there if it were included.I once gotten into a conversation about this in person.  I would bring up that Africa is the way it is, due in part, to being taken advantage of by other nations.  Their response was that the fact they even allowed others to take over is proof positive that they are inferior.  It is astonishing... It assumes so much but convinces so many people.Brother, a Gay man against the Civil Rights Act is a gay man against themself.  It's antithetical to the goals, freedoms, and needs of one that is gay.  You might as well be a black man that is keen on segregation.  It's flat out self destructive.  Why would anyone, especially one belonging to the minority, want a system of exclusion to a system of inclusion?Me too buddy! I saw Kyle Kulinski on Twitter too having a go at him indirectly yesterday. Rubin disgusts me thoroughly; what a sleazy greedy hack! He’s a an alt-right pandering shill! More high profile people need to wake up and see this POS for what he really is!David, Rubin is a disgusting alt-right pandering slimy piece of shit. I know you are a busy man with your show &amp; also being a professor; but now you know why you got the frenzied feedback / concerns when you announced that you were going to host this moron on your show! Rubin has sold his soul to Koch bros for money; he’s such a dishonest a-hole that I even have higher regard for Sean Hannity than him.Yup.

Proof:  https://twitter.com/21logician/status/831735058063056897
"if you're being discriminated against just move."  "Vote with your feet".  His statements fly in the face of what the CRA entails.

Public accommodation laws ensures the free comings and goings of peoples.  The public space remains free and open because it's enforced.

No gay couple should have to "order a cake online" or just wait for the blu-ray of the movie they wanted to see in theaters.  Or order out online because the business doesn't want black people.

So yeah, agree or disagree with public accommodation, he does, by definition, go against the act.Either way, he's against it, implicitly or explicitly.  It's not taken out of context despite his wailing.  What's ironic, is that his grandfathered in fans were the first one's to see it.  I suspect that you liked him at first like most of his early viewers, but then you started to notice a trend that was becoming too apparent to ignore.  

It happened to a large chunk of his original base.Jokes on you, I own an espresso machine. Republicans look under stones for the existence of fairies.Lol.  Apparently, he's subscribed to the DPS.  Interesting...He goes on later in the video how giving negative reviews to a store online should be illegal, and calls for the negative reviewers to be locked up. 6:50Basically what he's saying is that we should be grateful for being allowed to exist in peace.  Thanks...  That's nice of you.  People with views like his think that the LGBT is somehow receiving more than 100% respect, but they never demonstrate how, especially considering the LGBT don't have it all that good.  Your link with suicide rates shows this, and so does the fact that many states still don't have housing/employment rights protections or are incomplete.

A significant chunk of the country wants you either dead, segregated, "cured", or limited in some form.Savage... look up Secular Talk's dumbest rightwing commentators and he is number 1 for good reasonIt sounds like that could indeed be the reason, but it's actually silly. It got people to shop at Amazon, so what's the actual problem? :(So Amazon doesn't partner any longer with David Pakman, even though this partnership got people to shop at Amazon and didn't cause any harm or protest, but it still partners with Breitbart, even though lots of people are protesting against it?

I wonder whether anybody at Amazon notices this awfulness. Does Breitbart advertising give Amazon that much more value?AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

Give us more Pat!Rubin is a gateway drug alright. He belongs to the same sphere that Sargon, Lauren Southern &amp; Gavin Mcinnes lie in. &gt; it is also likely that he/she maybe a closeted gay unable to come out

that is much,much,much less likely than a homophobe being straight though, that has to be achknowledged, but unfortunetely too many straight liberals love calling homophobes gay so much so when you suggest a homophobe is straight they act as if that's ridicolous and they must be gay

&gt; I accept that either can be true and so should you

i do accept that some(tiny,miniscule amount) of homophobes are gay, not once have i denied that. the difference is, as a gay man i don't just inexplicably assume some bigoted scumbag is gay because they're homophobic, it makes no sense to do that, it's completely and utterly intelectually dishonest, ahistorical and nonsensical. the defualt assumption should be that a homophobe is straight, not that they're gay but like the vast majority of straight liberals are unable to respond to homophobia without calling homophobes gay, it's disgusting. do you seriously not understand why a gay person would have a problem with this behaviour?Pat is a cosmic spider that lays eggs to hatch baby Keurigs.  Whenever a Keurig dies, Pat screams in agony, for he is connected with his children, and they are in turn connected to him.

All hail the king!&gt; that vehement homophobes are more likely to be gay themselves is not just a cooked up fantasy

That isn't true, none of the studies that are cited in defence of assuming someone is gay because they're a homophobe prove that, or even set out to prove that. The one that is most often pointed to as justification for this behaviour was about the relationship between authoritarian parents and repressed homosexuality, it didn't prove that homophobes are more likely to be gay despite what everyone who uses the study as justification for assuming a homophobe is gay says.The studies concluded that “homophobia is more pronounced in individuals with an unacknowledged attraction to the same sex and who grew up with authoritarian parents who forbade such desires.” there is no justification for assuming someone is gay because they are homophobic, it's a completely ridicolous, insulting and intelectually lazy thing to do. the defualt assumption should be that homophobes are straight but for some reason most straight liberals can't manage that.

&gt; that is, they associated “me” with gay-related words and pictures faster than they associated “me” with straight-related words and pictures

you realize that this isn't in any way, shape or form an accurate indicator of a persons sexuality?

&gt; Which is why Though it is not my default reaction to say that a homophobe must be gay, I also do not rule out the possibility

literally no one rules out the possibility a homophobe could be gay, homophobia is not, has never been and will never be evidence of homosexuality. straight liberals need to stop assuming someone is gay because they're a homophobe, it's disgusting. unless there is actually evidence a homophobe is gay speculating that they are is dumb and pointless. a good example is mike pence, the way a huge number of straight liberals talk about him indicates they are fully convinced he is gay, even though there literally isn't a shred of evidence to suggest he is, many of them get very definsive when you even dare suggest he's just a bigoted straight guy. and if you don't assume someone is gay based on homophobia, do you call out other straight liberals when they do? I doubt it

&gt;  As to the percentages

the vast, vast, vast majority of all homophobes are heterosexual, this shouldn't even have to be explained to anyone, no liberal acts they way straight liberals do in regards to homophobia with any other form of bigotry. but when it comes to homophobia many straight liberals play dumb and say moronic shit like "why would a straight man care about people being gay" just because they enjoy callig republicans and others they hate gay. the amount of homophobes who are actually closeted gay people is tiny, miniscule.

&gt; I have been fighting for LGBT rights in my country for a long time

define fighting for lgbt rights, because if by fighting for lgbt rights you mean you've sat on your arse and called some homophobes gay then you haven't actually done a thing. 

&gt; infact use gay and other related terms as insults

tell me why you think straight liberals enjoy calling homophobes gay and then all laughing amongst themselves at that so much

&gt;  it can be viewed as a way to reduce homophobia and help the people come out of their repression

No, the amount of homophobes who are gay is miniscule, literally billions of straight people are violently bigoted against gay people. if every single repressed homophobic gay person in the world accepted themselves and came out it would make no functional difference on homophobia. are you aware that over 20% of americans think gay sex should be illegal? mabye instead of a bullshit discussion about closeted gay people we should be focusing on whre homophobia actually comes from, straight people. gay homophobes wouldn't exist if there was no homophobic straight people, so lets focus on the actual issue instead of acting as if getting the tiny percentage of homophobes who are gay to accept themselves would make any difference what so ever

&gt; appreciate the help it would bring to people who need to accept theirs

i've seen no evidence what so ever that all the straight liberals who go "homophobe, hahahaha GAAAAY" have any interest what so ever in actually attempting to get closeted homophobes to accept themselves to reduce homophobia, the phenomenon is entirely based on their own amusment at calling homophobes(obviously in the american context this mainly means republicans,mmmmm, wonder why they would love calling republicans gay so much) gay, it's got nothing to do with actually trying to reduce homophobia, they just thinks it's funny, no serious thought is put into it at all.

&gt; Jerks are jerks because they hate that they don't have something others have

this isn't true, the vast majority of bigotry is based on tribalism, hating the other, hating people who are different and who they don't understand

&gt; I actually dont see this as an attack on the LGBTQ community

it trivializes homophobia, shifts the responsiblity for anti gay bigotry away form straight people and onto the gay community, making it seem as though it's actually gay people that are responsible for the bigotry against us. if this behaviour wasn't so prevelant and the defualt reaction of most straight liberals to homophobia wasn't "must be gay" and there was more serious discussion about this issue specifically and homophobia in general then you would have a point. do you know how disturing it is as a gay man to see a news story about a vicious hate crime against a gay man and go to the comments section to see a sea of straight "allies" inexplicably assume someone is gay because they violently attack a gay man(in some cases murder) and act as if the idea the attacker is straight is some unbeleviable notion?

&gt;  I am just looking at a possible way to help these people

how is sitting on the internet calling them gay and laughing it up with a bunch of other straight people helping repressed gay homophobes? 

&gt;  I continue to maintain both options as viable

so do I, i'm perfectly aware that gay homophobes exist, the difference is i recognize that they are a miniscule amount of the homophobes and that a knee jerk reaction to homophobia of trotting out the closeted gay as an explanation for it is incredibly unhelpful to the gay community

&gt; keeping the blame off of LGBTQ community as much as possible

you're going to have a very hard time doing that when the vast majority of fellow liberals immediately assume a homophobe is gay based soley on the fact they are a homophobe. when the defualt reaction from people to homophobia is to assume the homophobe is gay and dismiss out of hand the possibility they are straight, that is absolutely victim blaming the gay community for homophobia.

I hope you'll read some of these to help understand my anger at the behaviour of so many straight liberals on the issue of homphobia, they're a lot better than me at explaining it.

Here it is:  http://www.europeanvalues.net/declaration/&gt;  I do not take it for a given that any homophobe is gay

then I hope you call out other straight liberals when they assume a homophobe is gay simply because the person is a homophobe&gt; I also call out gays when they refuse to keep an open mind about something

I'm not closed minded. being annoyed by the obssesion many straight liberals have with calling homophobes gay isn't closed minded

&gt; And I also call people out when they ruminate in stereotypes

how is anything i've said stereotyping?

&gt;  you do realise that straight conservatives are more likely to maliciously mock, insult and hate on LGBTQ than the straight liberals? 

yeah obviously I realize that, a gay person woould have to be a loony to not realize that. I'm just stating that I find the way many straight liberals discuss homophobia insulting to the gay community, i've yet to run across any of them who give a fuck though, they just always shout down your opinion and link to those studies you mentioned as if they are justification for the way they are behavingSo in your view, compulsory voting would only help Republicans because we have systems in place that limit Dems from voting?

&gt;who turns out is the big factor.

Isn't that the point of compulsory voting?  Buying voter ID with rules that constantly change doesn't appear the same as being moved to vote to avoid a fine. Voter ID forces you to pay in order to vote, but compulsory forces you to vote in order to avoid paying.  If we put money on the line, it may make people a little more alert when it comes to official voting dates, especially if mandatory voting is straightforward.  Although, I guess if you are forced to pay in the first place, in order to prevent paying for a fine later on, it would put you in a bad spot.

My question at the end is whether or not compulsory voting would make things overall better or overall worse, given how our system works.
David is a martyr.  What a man taking one for the team like this. 

Better take 800mg of Ibuprofen before this one.Good points.

&gt; David Pakman's Reddit discussion forum 

Lol.&gt; oh so in your opinion there are absolutely no straight people that actually sympathise with LGBTQ

No, I absolutely don't thnik that, you'd need to be crazy to think that. i'm just pointing out that when straight liberals try and defend the gay comunity they quite often end up saying things that are actually insulting and that they should try and think about the way they speak about homophobia abit more&gt;  try to amicably enlighten them

it's pretty difficult, most seem to just want to dismiss any concern over the way they discuss homophobia and ignore you're concerns. a good example of this is the way many were responding to gay people who were annoyed at stephen colbert calling trump a cocksucker, the way a lot of straight liberals reacted to those of us who had a problem with it was literally indistingashable from the way trump trolls interact with lgbt people, tellling us we're triggered, telling us to go back to our safe spaces etc

how do you suggest i amicably enlighten them about their rhetoric and behavior that i finf insulting and unhelpful?&gt; I don't know about Alex Salmond

You should look into it, he was the leader of Scotland and led the independence campaign, now has a show on RT that's created lots of controversy and caused a lot of embarassment for the SNP, very interesting 

&gt; That last sentiment steers eerily into the rationale of far left wing pacifism and hostility to intervention

I think the reflexive opposition to any intervention from many left wingers is really misguided, and pacifism in my opinion is an intelectually vapid world view. Though I do think the Iraq and Afghanistan invasions were disasters that should have never happend, interventions like the 2000 britsish intervention in the Sierra Leone civil war are absolutely justified and that intervention was a success. WE should shift our foriegn policy focus onto missions like that imo. the idea that military intervention is bad full stop makes no sense considering the fact that there's lots of militray action that US-UK could be taking that is legitimate and would help the world, unfourtunately no leaders are proposing these interventions

&gt; Thom is not tainted in my view

so you don't think it's fucked up to take money from a regime like putins?how is the question a logical fallacy?I don't see what's wrong with making my opinion on the issue clear in the question. so what do you think about it?&gt; because you're not interested in MY opinion of them

I'am

&gt; RT is a propaganda tool of the Russians

It is, that's not even a debatable point. They literally admit that's what RT is

&gt; Russia is a fascist oligarchy

Again not really debatable

&gt; Thom and Alex are willfully complicit in their ideology by choosing to work for them

That's not what I'm saying.  

&gt;  Thom and Alex are fascist

not what i'm saying

&gt;  suggests that the question isn't about Thom and Alex at all, that all left wingers are friends of RT and by extension Russia

i'm asking peoples opinions of left wingers who have shows on RT and cited those 2 examples. i definetely don't think all left wingers like or support RT because 1.i'm a left winger and don't and 2. there is many examples of other left wingers who are against RT

&gt; nor I imagine welcome

i'm literally asking your opinion mate lol&gt; troll post

How is it a troll post? &gt; A true left wing party would be staunchly against foreign intervention where the people and property of the United States or her protectorates or allies were not in clear and present danger

This isn't true. A ture left wing party could absolutely still support military interventions, like the british intervention in the sierra leone civil warDid we watch the same video?? Roy Moore's attorney is a looney tune and David is calmly pointing out how the attorney's answer in the interview made no lick of sense. Good night, sweet prince...I made a post about this a little while back that I thought contained insight into other variables to consider, and that many responded to.

https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/7c5iw0/worseometer_trump_vs_pence/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

I wish David would address this a bit further.  He does outline exactly why it would be bad for the country, and I don't disagree his assessments.  However, it seems like there is a lot more to consider, and that taking it as a given that Pence will be worse in all areas doesn't strike me as all that convincing.  Notwithstanding the toll Trump has on global politics versus the toll of Pence.  Not that David hasn't raised the points logically and concisely already.  I hear his point, but I think it needs to be discussed more in depth.

A quote from TigerKarlGeld:  "The question of Pence vs. Trump comes down to the question of preferring guaranteed and predictable damage vs. unpredictable and potentially devastating damage."

Which is worse?

&gt;must say the charges against Trump are relevant and letting him stay in power just to win some elections for me sends the signal that nobody gives a fuck about his insanity and incompetence as president.

I thought this way, too.  I understand the strategy of it, but it doesn't sound principled.

It's deontology vs Utilitarianism.  Does the ends justify the means?  Is it right to let Trump continue on with his insanity because we may win elections?  Every day this guys in office is another day in quick sand.

Scientists have recently moved the Doomsday clock partly because of Trumps actions...And to further flesh out my point, I understand David's being pragmatic.  He's questioning the likelihood of Trump being impeached and following the logic path, but has David plugged into his pragmatism that more and more Republicans are going against Trump?  Personally, I think the GOPs approval of Trump is only skin deep.  It's the emperor with no clothes.  Everyone wants to say he's naked, but they are too scared to do it.  But once someone points it out, it sets a trend.  Will Trump retain the GOPs favor for long?  They aren't getting anything done.  I'm sure many of them want him out.  So to me, it doesn't seem a given that the GOP will never help to impeach him, because they must know on some level what he's doing to them.  Some are even sensible enough to know he's legitimately dangerous and unstable.  We've seen this with Nixon.  No one was brave enough until later on.Next, we need to get David on Joe Rogan or Sam Harris show! That Zeppo - Pakman convo was brilliant btw. Their takedown of Rubin was a pleasure to listen too as well.I will be sad if this is trueSo after watching this I don’t think the Dems would be interested in even one of these changes. I say put all of our energy in the Green Party.Either way Green or DSA. Just not the Dems. Dems show no sign of wanting to change.I sense the same thing.  I sense that he's almost being used.  It's not a healthy work environment, or any environment for that matter, if you have to tip-toe around others.  He shouldn't have to try to appease Jesse in order to try to get a point across.  

It almost seems like unhealthy co-dependence;  Maybe that's not the right word for it, but there's something there.   I have doubts that he even believes the same as Jesse.  And if he does, believes so because he feels like he has to...Now that you mention it, you're right.  Thinking back, he has spoken briefly concerning foreign policy.  It was so long ago, and so brief, that I forgot what it was about.  I guess David focuses his attention mostly on elections, science, scandals, social issues and global perception of the US.lol

I think he will endorse Jean in the primary

He has nothing to lose by saying she's a better vision for the Democrat party than Joe is

Jesse didn't like David's answers and just kept telling him to calm down, making it seem like David was the one being aggressive when it was Jesse.  That's not how you interview your guests.  You let the person talk and give their answers, but Jesse turned it into a character analysis instead of asking earnest questions.

Just compare how David talks to guests he disagrees with with how Jesse handled David.  Completely different and disrespectful.  You don't silent someone because they aren't communicating in a way you don't like.

David was utterly destroying his points so Jesse had nothing to come back at with him other than trying to make David seem like a bad disorderly guest when that wasn't the case.

It's simply not possible for someone like Jesse to have an honest and intellectual conversation with someone else.  He's way too ideologically committed to be capable of having a real world interview.  Jesse has people like David (And Jacklyn Glenn) on his show to try to whistle to his audience of how sinful "these people" are.  He doesn't bring them on in good faith.  David wasn't going to allow Jesse to turn it into a circus, so he put his foot down and pushed back.

Just look at how Jesse spoke about David after he kicked David off.  "See everyone, these people of the lie are such and such".  It's simply what people like him do.Lots of prejudice there.

I am lib, for gay marriage, atheist / agnostic and wanted Hillary to win. I am glad that Angela Merkel is now kind of the leader of the free world.

But enough with the ad hominems.but i'd say the system of government in russia is fascistic. the oligarchs are just money grubbing opportunistsDon't get complacent or cocky: we're not at the finish line yet. This hyping of Roy Moore's polls reminds me of when Usain Bolt got his first gold metal: he took a moment to look around and pound his chest before he crossed first at the finish line... he could have beaten his own world record if he didn't get cocky at the end. he should do a long form piece on what he thinks US foreign policy should becan't help but laugh at stories like this. why? the putin government fulfills many of the characteristics of fasicmDavid puts orange face paint and a Trump wig for the entire show without ever calling attention to it, while still mocking Trumps Trumpisms.&gt; Racial superiority? No

racial superiority isn't a defining characteristic of fasicm, a government can be fasict with it

&gt; radical purity

what do you mean by that?

&gt; militarism? Possibly.

russia is definetely militaristicKnowing the reason for something being ugly does not make it non-ugly. If transphobia is real for at least some percentage of those to whom transwomen look extremely ugly, it does not make the disgust go away. This disgust not being biology-based but learned does not make it go away. Even if there is a way to remove this "phobia" or learned disgust, it does not work with millions of people, in the sense that millions of people will not use that method of removing.

But the concept of transphobia or trans-fear is not a real psychological disease classification or anything like that. It is overcomplicating things when "just plain ugly" describes the situation best. It is not hate or fear. There are phobias about things that are not ugly and ugly things that people do not fear. I don't know why nazis hated jews, but it was not for ugliness because nazis had difficulty identifying jews. If at least some percentage of racists hate blacks because blacks seem ugly to them, would that not be interesting to know and possibly relevant? Saying out loud the exact reason(s) can be first step in improving the situation.

I find the concept of being in wrong gender body fascinating, in addition to unfortunate. I wish well to those people with that condition. I might listen to a radio program or audio file about that.

I am not conservative or religious.
Mods misunderstood the original post as trolling or hate, which it was not, so here it is:

Being in a wrong gender body must be a terrible problem. That is not a choice and needs solutions. If the solution involves getting visible features of women, another unchosen problem rises, something that the affected people have remarkable difficulty of saying clearly. For high percentage of people, having a trans woman in their field of view close enough and in bright enough illumination i.e with enough resolution and contrast, causes a kind of failure to process visual information which manifests itself on the higher levels of cognition as unpleasentness and disgust. It is not a choice whether transgenders look disgusting or not. It is a malformed input in the lower levels of mind. Uncanny valley of gender related pattern recognition. Visual processing is not tolerant or intolerant, lib or right-wing.

Unlike male gays, who usually keep their gayness in private and lesbians who are at most slightly irritating when visible, trans women do not keep it in privacy: It takes at least half a second to turn focus angle or block line of sight, often much longer.

Some patterns of rectangles can also look irritating.

There is no easy solution for most trans women because usually their maleness is in the shapes of their bones. People have big differences in ability to see this, just like some people can't see when video aspect ratio is wrong...

To advertisers, information about what looks nice or disgusting can be worth lots of money. People who try and fail to make themselves look another gender need to have one information free of charge: that they look disgusting to high percentage of people.

Some might think that exposure to sights of transgenders will eventually cause loss of disgust. That is speculation and even if true, the needed amount of repetition is unknown and likely has huge differences between people.

Ethics comes to this as a result of transgenders spending time and resources to look worse not better. They can look like a woman if the woman they try to look like is a lesbian engineer inspecting a bridge.

Phobia is something different.

Are there some people who even hate transgenders, but who do not see them looking anything special, not seeing them as extremely ugly? Maybe. Then it works like gay hate. Maybe it would be same as some slave owners in 1800s seeing some black women sufficiently attractive for raping... There seems to be different types of racism and other hate.

EDIT:

Knowing the reason for something being ugly does not make it non-ugly. If transphobia is real for at least some percentage of those to whom transwomen look extremely ugly, it does not make the disgust go away.

Amy Goodman is a progressive Goddess;  It would be superfluous to include her.Disagree. Murray believes in climate change, is a secular atheist, also is a moderate when it comes to economical policies. He is not a crazy right winger like your average Republican.

I have actually critically analysed his work, followed up his sources which are 100% legit and a lot of it is actually sourced from govt reports, Pew polls etc. it’s not like he’s referencing Infowars or Breitbart ok!

Also, regarding your point about Islam you are downplaying it way too much. More Muslims means more terrorism - the link is direct dude. All over the world, Islam has failed to integrate; even in conservative countries like India, China, Phillipines, Russia etc.France is 10% Muslim, England is 4% (there were 4 Muslim terrorist attacks in England in the last 4 months alone). It is ppl like you who need to read the book. Also future demographic trends should scare you as Muslims have more kids per family than any other religious group. Don’t ever downplay the savagery &amp; threat of Islam mate.Mate that was actually my post that you linked to lol! I am ashamed to say that I had made incorrect judgements about Murray’s book based on a couple of reviews. I decided to read the entire book rather than selected passages and have changed my opinion since. 

In fact, Islam has done great harm to India mate! Have u ever been to India? I’ve lived there for 13 years. I concede that India has done probably the best job of integrating Muslims than any other country but there remains lots of problems.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus
https://www.sikhnet.com/news/islamic-india-biggest-holocaust-world-historyThere is no such word as Islamophobia. Plz don’t use that word mate, it’s a propoganda word that is used by Islamists to shut down any legit criticism of Islam! Islam is simply the most barbaric and most intolerant religion today, 90% of worldwide terrorist attacks are committed by Muslims.No, I was initially reluctant to admit the truth about Islam like you where, it offended my liberal sensibilities but i have let logic overcome emotion. 

Look, Im still a liberal. I am not a fan of Murray, nor 100% aligned with him but I do respect him for writing this book. Its a great read, its a real eye opener. I suggest you give it a read before you pass judgement man. No, u have been duped into the Islamist narrative mate! Check this link out 

https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/381411/

“Islamophobia is a word that is created by fascists and used by cowards to manipulate morons”irrelevant: a Fox News poll saying that the current Republican president is less popular than the "Kenyan Communist OBBAMMMMA" that the right wing media machine has been demonizing and criticizing( for all the wrong reasons). That is huge if true. she won by 37 votes. That could be attributed to multiple possible factors including

1: The race might have been announced on short notice and the lower turnout helped the woman (although usually low voter turnout helps Republicans)

2: Enough republicans could be displeased with the way Trump/GOP are acting and were not incentivized

3: Enough Democrats/left leaning individuals were angered and motivated to vote even in small elections as a response to Trump/GOP

4: Specific candidate issues that have no correlation with the national agenda, a possible Roy Moore effect with whoever was the Republican

5: Local issues we aren't aware of may have influenced this race

I suspect a combination of 2, 3, 5Not here to argue.  Just pointing out that it helps to not get downvoted into oblivion if you avoid insulting peoples intelligence within the first sentence in your reply.  There are members of the alt-right that post on here and would love to post something to rationalize their racism.  Your presentation is important.

Most won't even continue to read if you start off with an insult.  They may not even disagree with what you are saying.  That may be why people reacted so negatively to your last comments in the other post.  Just a heads up.The thing is: Trump is a president right now, and he will have to go through a re election. If he's in this bad shape right now, in ALABAMA it's indicative of his power and how this could translate for GOP elections. This is very relevant. Mate, the difference is that Islam has NEVER been able to co-exist peacefully with other religions/ cultures. It is simply not compatible with 21st Century civilisation.

Also Islam isn’t a race, so u cannot compare Islam with oppression of black people. It’s a fascist ideology akin to Nazism! Would you want to live with Nazis in your society??

The only religion that forbids cartoons of its prophet is Islam, it’s the only religion where mobs of bloodlusting Muslims react with violence to any perceived offense. If you are a true liberal and care about women’s rights/gay rights/freedom of speech; u will restrict Muslim immigration in your society. Even in the words of liberal Richard Dawkins; “Islam is the greatest source of evil in the world today”Ok I checked the link out. Yes the word started off with good intentions to protect against anti-Muslim bigotry but now has been co-opted by Islamofascists to shield the backwards, violent doctrine of Islam from criticism.Anti-Muslim bigotry is a better word than 'Islamophobia' mate. I follow the Sam Harris logic on that, its a propoganda term. The analogy with some right wingers criticizing Islam does not really hold because often times, these unhinged right wing fools don't even know anything about what the hell they are criticizing. But people like Geert Wilders, Tommy Robinson, Douglas Murray, David Frum, Pam Geller, Robert Spencer etc are exceptions, as they are very knowledgeable about this topic. Although yes, they may at times engage in over the top rhetoric as well. But very few people follow Christianity like that man. Thats the main point. The extremists in Islam are a lot more mainstream than any other religion out there. You should re-watch the Sam Harris vs Ben Affleck debate on Youtube, if you are still confused about this issue. Sam totally decimated Ben Affleck in that exchange. Didn't know history behind the turkey pardoning

that said: pardoning a turkey is harmless fun to me

let it stayIdea 1: David Pakman with Super Saiyan hair + Pat holding a Kuerig + Lewis with the Shades and have the following caption: We Got This

Idea 2: No Experience, No Conservatism, and No Sexual Harassment
We're Better than the competitionThey are all finnnneeee  ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)Ok I concede. But do you at least agree that Islamic terrorism is a giant worldwide problem in comparison to the minuscule problem of “Islamophobia”?LMAO 😂! Mate, I seriously want to have a little bit of what you are smoking? Mughals integrated in India really? How?? By destroying temples, forcing Hindus to live as Dimmis paying jizzya? U r a deluded fool. Check out this link below.

Oh and the Ottoman Turks were so so peaceful hahahahaha!!

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide

You sound like a total Islamist apologist mate. Btw, your assertions regarding me &amp; Murray are ridiculous. I’m not just worried about Europe but about the entire world here. So a couple of Hindus lynch a Muslim for eating beef and that is somehow a mob or a major incident? How about when 20,000 Muslim savages burned down a Bangladeshi Hindu village for alleged insults to the prophet?

https://www.google.com.au/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-village-prophet-mohammed-insulted-facebook-post-islam-muslim-south-asia-a8051841.html%3famp

You know what? We can settle this debate with a cartoon contest. U draw a cartoon of Muhammad &amp; I’ll draw a cartoon of any other religious figure &amp; then u can send me a postcard from the witness protection box. Ull be dead in a month dude!!! Open your eyes.
I don't like this guy either because he stirs the pot and spreads a lot of misinformation.  One of them is in the recommendations section spreading the myth of soy as being  unhealthy for testosterone production.

Joe always weirded me out and I definitely don't want him as president.  Get someone progressive please.Thats absolutely disgusting...So, is there anyway to prevent this?  What could be done?omg, I didn't even think of this...  DPS is one of my only sources of real news.

Do you guys see a silver lining in this?  Will other companies try to compete by having a net neutrality friendly ISP?  Will some mega corporation step in and allow a free internet?   (Google maybe?)

There are many ISPs that refuse to cap your monthly data limits (Like Spectrum).  Some won't even report you or look the other way if you pirate programs/shows/games.  Will something like this extend to net neutrality?

Can this be stopped?  Reversed?Yes, I am well aware of the terrible history of European colonialism, slave trade &amp; genocide. I am not downplaying it in any way. The difference is, most of the sane people acknowledge this bad history and have taken steps to reform Christanity or paid compensation to affected parties. There is widespread democracy in Western Europe, equal rights for all &amp; protections for minorities.

But with Islam, none of the Muslim countries have acknowledged their terrible history or the present. Women are treated horribly in such cultures to this day, there is a distinct lack of freedom, there is Sharia Law. So I dont understand why the hell are you comparing the two situations when they are not?

I am not asking Muslims to disappear, just to reform their barbaric savage religion &amp; to learn to live peacefully with others, as most non-muslim cultures have figured out how to do this now. Do you know how Hindu/ Christian minorities are treated in Muslim countries? I have heard horror stories and first hand accounts dude!

You are a regressive/delusional liberal. And you are comparing me &amp; Murray to Nazis. What a fool you are? Defending your society from extremists is not Nazism, its common sense. All non-muslim countries should restrict Muslim immigration until they reform themselves. Muslims have caused tremendous carnage on the world for the past 1400 years, just because you are some sheltered American living in a liberal city, you are simply not aware of it. Visit Israel, India, North China, Middle East and see it for yourself. Another Darwin award nominee!I agree that if you're going to be a capitalist market based economy, bottom up stimulating programs and heavier taxation on the top end is the way to go, but my question is basically: "How much would we have to raise taxes to get to a yearly surplus so we could be paying the debt off over-time at a reasonable rate."

I agree that there are clearly rules stacked in the wealthy's favor that is immoral, one sided and reducing yearly budget revenue.  My question is more along the line of: "How much would we have to raise taxes, and/or how many loop holes of which type, would we need to get to a yearly surplus so we could be paying the debt off over-time at a reasonable rate."Some debt is good.  I'm not suggesting we have to have 0 debt.  But too much debt becomes untenable.  Just like credit cards.  Interest rates pile up.  Eventually interest alone become insane to keep up with and still pay down the debt.

The same is true of the US Debt.  We don't need to go to zero debt.  But we can't just spend a deficit forever.

How much would we have to raise taxes to close the gap a little bit is basically my question.Banning Spencer is ridiculous though especially as Islamic hate preachers &amp; jihadists regularly avoid getting banned from countries. It doesn’t make any sense. What post are you referring to?You're right, nobody should be able to have any other conversations right now.Ban all racists!  Pro-cosmopolitanism narrative, now!!!  REEEEEEEEEE That seems like a gross over simplification that would also have some pretty catastrophic implications.I don't know which was more entertaining: this farce of a video or the shit show of a comment section the video hadNot surprising

Falls in line with Republicans crying biased media, fake media, and lying media ever since the Nixon scandal

Also the right pays protestors and hires false actors. 1: What has Macron done to deserve person of the year?

2: I'm not sure who to give it to. I would say give it to an inventor or scientist. He'll spend his days in Mar-a-Lago collecting money from the President's pension and from his Trump corporation which will do business as usual under a different corporate name.I hope 2018 is a reckingball for every Republican who plans on voting for a Draconian tax cut and I hope 2018, 2020, and 2022 will see every mother fucker who voted for this chicken scratch give away be voted out. The party is incompetent, corrupt, and inept. We can expect the bill losing momentum during reconciliation where it will get complicated. There will be infighting.believe the same thing you should believe for every election: fuck the polls, run as a progressive and vote them in. Sidenote, don't worry about "wasting" your vote on a non Democrat, if they don't act like a Liberal don't let them inyes

also abandon daylight saving time and use meters and kilograms everywhereI love Jimmy Dore, think he can be really funny and at time insightful, check out his recent interview with Richard Wolf, but man is he off on thisThis is why I support Berniecrats and Justice Democrats.We should be abolishing the senate. The idea of giving a set amount of votes to arbitrarily drawn lines on land is absurd. We should switch to a much larger house of representatives. There's no real point to the senate except their longer term limits which we should change (in honesty we need to switch to a prime minister system)

As to those who think the smaller states need equal representation I disagree. This country should be run on the idea of 1 person 1 vote on any subject (excluding civil liberties). If the small populations get outweighted by the larger populations of big states then that is how this goes. amazing, the levels of arrogance and stupidity abound if this article is trueI'm getting the impression that Nunez isn't involved, as he is in a shit situation of having to deal with a "popular"(within deep Republican circles) Republican president who has got himself into shit worth investigating. I bet his one and only concern was to ask how do I avoid actually investigating my Republican boss?

I'm no Trump fan, but this is a bit of an unnecessary nit pick. IMO that segment at 2:15 looks more like a bad joke then him failing at this publicity stunt. Lmao Britain First are actually “classical liberals” and part of the New Centre buddy! Didn’t u know? Haha 😜!If I remember correctly it's the coastal megacities that are liberal and the Eastern side of the state is conservativeDidn't Milo abandon Trump after the Lybia bombing??? Considering the 2017 year was dominated by career ending sexual harassment scandals I think it's a great poster. As a single person maybe Collin Kapernick or the man who ratted out Kevin Spacey but the cover sends a strong message.As a single person Kaepernick would be a good choice but I prefer the multiple people who came out against the harassment. Sends a strong message I didn't say every Time person of the year cover photo needs or does send a strong message, but year's does. Time's person of the year usually represents someone who embodies the year: Each of those covers details a year where the person in question made substantial actions or the dictated the course of events. 

The cover this year does send a good message and is meant in their honor for bringing sexual assault into the discussion in a way I haven't seen before. "my sides" ???when have you seen sexual assault blow up like this in culture?
fun question
I will first try to answer with political terms and then I'll go as detailed as possible.

I identify as a "european style socialist"
I am left wing on economics, I am libertarian on civil liberties and personal freedoms but an absolute authoritarian on how much power the government should have over the "private market". 

I believe that the one and only source of healthcare insurance, healthcare training, pharmaceutical drug development, and employer of healthcare personel should be the central government. 

I believe that the central government should be responsible as the only source of banking, education, housing, electricity, the internet, water, tax services, roads,. IMO all of the above are necessities that if the rich were able to "get away" they would not be invested in making sure the rest of us get something good. I'm not worried about "government dependence" since we're all dependent on someone so it might as well be the government with built in checks and balances where the people have one hand on the wheel (compared to this shit being privatized where the people have no control)

On taxation, I'm not prepared to say how much people making 0-$60,000 make, but from 60,000-120,000 the taxes should be moderate, from 120,000-240,000 they should be "moderate +1" from "240,000-500,000" is "moderate +2" and if you make more than 500,000 for every extra dollar you earn I would tax 99 cents of it away. I wish I knew more about tax policy, but I hope you see where I'm going with this. 

On guns, I'm conflicted. Long story short I was raised in a conservative family and guns are apart of our culture. I just went pheasant hunting 2 weeks ago, forgot how much fun that was. On the other hand, gun violence in this country is out of control. I guess I'm for banning AR15's. I'm not opposed to a gun database.

I think we need a total reset on the US Federal government. No more congressman, Presidents, or Senators. The US Federal government would have once every 4 years an election for 1000 Senators, with a total of 1001 after the Prime Minister's appointment. These senators have a term which lasts for 4 years. The system works by the party chairman stating the platform with a list of the people they want to bring with them to Washington DC if/when they win. The Federal Government would use proportional representation to determine how many people from each party get to be appointed by the party chairman. After the election the 1000 members hold a conference where they decide who will be the prime minister, the prime minister needing a minimum of a 40% plurality of the elected officials. The prime minister then gets to appoint a member to the Senate, the only restriction is the candidate can not  have been arrested for Treason.

I think the government should provide every citizens with 3 healthy foods per day and should have nationwide robust public transportation. 

I'm not crazy on the US owning nukes, I would hold no more than 4,000 at any one time. No reason to have the cold war era supply, but a small supply is probably necessary. 

I would nationalize our oil, in the short term. 

I would implement drastic regulation on the stock market. Have the stock market be watched like a hawk, thought of as a casino which can destroy our economy. Make sure only certain products or services can be speculated on. 

I said this before, but I don't see any good from letting banks be owned by private individuals. 

I think that the owner of a company should be allowed to own the company for 50 years, then after that every year the employees are given the option to buy the company's creator out so they can turn it into a co op, bringing democracy to the work place

This is what came into my mind, hope this helped or was an intersting read
There's something about discrimination and scapegoating and the low IQ right wing that go hand in hand. IMO it's natural to try and identify where the problem is coming from, difference is liberals can correctly identify the issues (Wall Street, money in politics, etc) while right wingers blame those who seem different. No other way I can explain it. How do you still support this party?I have a few thoughts

My heart is telling me Tom Jones

A recent Fox News poll is telling me Tom Jones

http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/364248-fox-news-poll-jones-leads-moore-by-10-points

The cynic in me thinks the polls are bullshit, similar to the Bradley Effect. The cynic in me believes Moore will win by at least 5% points

1: It's Alabama, one of the most pro Republican states in the country. Normally a reliable Republican seat, now once Jones takes power the Republicans will need one more vote from somewhere else in order to pass legislation.

2: Roy Moore was the Steve Bannon backed candidate, this incident might put a damper on his alt right movement to primary establishment politicians. 

3: Now that Trump publicly endorsed Moore this hurts Trump's ego

4: This race only happened because Trump made Jeff Sessions the attorney general... Trump now hates Sessions for not being more corrupt during the Russia investigation and the Republicans lost an easy seat.. likely to make infighting worse

Those are just the bullet points that come to my mindI admit I'm a bit uninformed on exactly what the New Deal specifically did, but the narrative he's pushing smells like bullshit. 

Especially the part where he insinuates labor unions hurt the economy. We're living in a period where labor unions are weak and look at the shit situation we're in now. Communism will win.&gt; If that doesn't sound like online harassment, I don't know what does.

You don't know what does. Leave it at that.Sounds like the right wing plan to "privatize" social security. No thank you. At this point I am sure the US is going to have a socialist revolution.This leader confuses meTrump is too stupid for Autocrazy/Democrazy/Plutocracy, as well as any form of government. It doesn't matter if something may or may not become sentient. A sperm may eventually become sentient if it makes it to an egg.

What matters is the current sentience.  No working brain = not alive/sentient.

That's why it would be immoral to murder a school full of kids, but not pulling the plug of a lady who got sick/injured to the point of total brain damage.What matters is the current sentience.  No working brain = not alive/sentient.

That's why it would be immoral to murder a school full of kids, but not immoral to pull the plug of a lady who got sick/injured to the point of total brain damage.

A fetus has no capability for sentience until into the 3rd trimester.  Which is why current abortion laws work.

Also, there's the economic health stand point as well.  Giving women control over their reproductive capabilities is a massive economic booster and a way to alleviate tons of abject poverty, as proven by history.

P.S. Ben Shitpiro is a moronic cuck who's intellectually bankrupt on pretty much every topic.  You should ignore him and his mouth breathing followers.I literally just perfectly countered the point based on scientific fact and also threw an economic cherry on top. Did you read what I said?

What more do you need than cold hard facts to counter a stupid emotional religious based position?

Oh were you hoping for some super deep, philosophical counter point to his emotional mythology-based argument? You're not going to change a religious zealot's mind.

Just state the scientific facts and move on with your life and stop caring what these tools have to say.

Wrong. More than half of all fertilized eggs fail to be born. It's easy to refute forced-birther arguments if you read the medical literature on the subject.I take it from this out-of-context comment that you have some ongoing dispute going with the OP on the topic: I did a Google search and found an article, just written yesterday, that contains a quote from her on the topic.

&gt; So that money — first of all I’ll say that money is all under FEC surveillance and has to follow FEC rules. It all came in through Federal Election Commission accounts. So the use of that money, and the continuing account, is all publicly disclosed. So anybody who has tried to create these conspiracy theories around it is clueless about how this accounting actually works. The expenditures are also fully disclosed on our website. So to repeat what has been public information since the get-go, those monies have been spent strictly on the recount, which is outrageously expensive. Not only the lawsuits but also the filing fees. In order to even have a recount, there were huge filing fees in the millions of dollars. And there is continued — I wouldn’t call it a surplus because it’s still being used — there are continuing legal cases that are still fighting to examine the voting machines.

&gt; In all of the hacking, and the concerns about hacking, there is a big misconception out there. The authorities are always saying, “Oh, but there’s no evidence that the vote was hacked.” Well there’s no evidence because no one has ever examined the voting machines. The voting machines have never been examined. And we owe the American public a reckoning. We know that everything around the vote has been hacked, and that’s been documented. Whether it is the computers of local election officials, whether it is the voter registration system, whether it is private companies that provide various voting software, there is evidence of hacking. Where we have looked for it we have found it. We have specifically not looked at the voting machines, which is an outrage against the American voters. We are still in court to get our hands on that data and find out. So that money is being carefully guarded so we can take these court cases as far as we can go, including to the Supreme Court if we have the option to do that. That is where the money is and that is where the money remains.

https://rantt.com/jill-stein-talked-to-us-about-michael-flynn-that-rt-dinner-and-the-recount-money-5cc44953a832I won't even criticize the police here. It's debatable but there is a strong argument for them having believed that their lives or someone else's was in imminent danger. This is what I will say:

Not enough good guys with guns maybe?

I think this really speaks to the intellectually constipated argument that more guns in the hands of more good guys = more safety. A few more cops firing in this situation may have killed the kids parents in this case. The idea the non-trained professionals running around with them and trying to facilitate what they imagine justice to be is disastrous.What you're saying is that Trump might try what Bush did in the first term?However, I heard a psychic that firing Muller will mobilize Democrats.It's unlikely Trump will reach 50% in popularity rating.It's unlikely as the excuses they might make are false and nobody will believe their lies.People are waking up to the tax plan, Trump’s narcissism and incompetence, and progressivism, which will cause the fall of the GOP.The reason is I don't like people trying to tell me how to up or downvote, even if they use the word please.I hope you know I'm not aware of what your beef is with her or why, nor do I know what you're arguing about with the other person. I just did a Google search for you. Is your suggestion that she's stealing the money used for the recounts? What's the basis for that theory?

While I haven't checked the FEC filings myself, I did dig through the site quite a bit, there are a crapload of court filings on display that demonstrate that some money from somewhere was paying for some legal fees. I wouldn't expect them to have an itemized accounting, especially as some of the items discussed on the site seemed to be ongoing. They definitely appeared to push for recounts, and seem to be pursuing other avenues no directly related to a recount, but to election integrity. What am I missing that is making you suspect a swindle?Downvoted. I'm not even telling you why.&gt; Partially. My suggestion is that she and are party are doing something similar to what Alex Jones does on InfoWars. Pushing a conspiracy for the sake of personal and party enrichment. My suggestion is that she, like Alex Jones, is an snake-oil salesperson.

What she's doing is not like Alex Jones though. Alex Jones is selling you products. If she's requesting money for a fund and then using that money for the enrichment of herself or the part, that's not partial, you're saying she's stealing it. 

&gt; Reality.

That's not a basis for your claim, nor is anything following in that paragraph. You haven't seen an accounting of every dollar donated to the fund (though it doesn't sound like you're looking very hard, but fine). Do you have a basis for thinking she's stealing it? More specifically:

&gt; Despite all the filings, how many recounts have actually gone ahead?

Are you a child or just being deliberately obtuse. You know that it's not something you pay and file for like a car, right? She lost in court. There are articles you can find that go into some detail about it if you made the herculean effort of going Google searches. Even when quoting from her website it doesn't seem like you went more than a click deep, as many of the articles are linked on there. 

&gt; Healthy skepticism.

Fine but it seems like that's all you have to back up the allegations you're making. You see something that you don't have an explanation for, you came up with a theory that could possibly explain it, and you're somehow belligerently confident that you're correct. I can understand that reports on ongoing efforts to obtain voting machine data have been only vaguely described to this point,  but that's hardly a basis on its own for the conclusions you're coming to.First and foremost:

&gt; And if you could make more of an effort to conceal your belligerence, I'm sure we'll be able to reach some kind of an understanding.

Kiss my ass. I think you're saying some really stupid things, and I shouldn't have to sugarcoat it in order for you to understand it. If you can't take the meat of a criticism into consideration because you don't like the way someone said it, that's your own problem. 

&gt; Alex Jones sells more than just products. He sells a crock of shit. So did Stein.

Ok except I'm being literal while you're using allegorical nonsense so that you can be semantic about the point I'm making, which was somewhat tangential anyway; a comment about the comparison you made. 

&gt; Hold on. Your questions was "Is your suggestion that she's stealing the money used for the recounts?" To which I responded "partially", as in a part of me thinks she has appropriated the funds. That is partial.

Oh, it's partial because only part of you thinks it... Does the other part of you think that the first part is wrong? If so, does the two parts ever interact on here and spar with each other? Whatever, man.

&gt; I have only seen what she and her party has made public via her website. I have seen the accounting on her website. But I guess you've seen something the rest of us haven't. By all means, please share this information with us.

You're reading a little deeper into the parenthesis with this question. I'm referring to the fact that my first Google search into this article yielded information that it doesn't seem you had really sought out. Additionally, I suspected and you just confirmed that you hadn't looked anywhere but her website for information, which would include searching FEC filings for the public records. You may find something worth raising suspicion over if you ever got around to doing so, or you might find that your theories were unfounded. The point I'm making in the parenthesis is that until you attempt to do so, you're using the fact that you don't have information that you didn't look for as a basis for saying that information is being kept from you. I'm not arguing that she is doing everything by the books, I'm pointing out that your aggressively arguing that she is without basis or bothering to take basic measures to test the veracity of this claim makes it hard to take you seriously. 

&gt; Yes. Reality. Namely, the lack of transparency and sufficient accountability.

I'm wonder how many filings, accounting ledgers, court holdings you've independently examined in your time to verify information that you've read. Based on your approach to this particular situation, as addressed in the last paragraph, a reasonable person would conclude: none. Look for information before you work yourself into a panic about it not being there.

&gt; Yes, I do know it's not something you pay for and file for like a car. And correction, she lost in several courts.

Hold on, stupid. Are you really pretending to correct me on that as if I'm not aware that she lost in more than one case? Roll it back a second. You asked where the recounts were, as if to suggest the money that Stein professes to have spent the on the recount was instead misallocated, on the basis of the desired results having not manifested. If you knew that she lost in multiple courts, why are you even asking the question in the first place? And are you really that simple that you think you're going to jedi mind trick me into believing that *I'm* the one who doesn't understand why there were no recounts completed? Get a grip. 

&gt; Are those the only options?

You could also just not be very bright. To be fair though, it doesn't seem like you're stupid, even if you say stupid things and even if I choose refer to you by that label. The most likely choices seem to be that you have a really immature/uninformed view of how the legal system operates (which suggests youth) or you are pretending not to understand so that you can continue with your argument. Based on the following, however:

&gt; Lol. Looks like I am touching several nerves. Perhaps you could point me in the direction of one of these articles. Lord knows my herculean efforts have not amounted to much.

I'd say young. Only someone raised by the internet would resort to trying to pretend to delight in someone's consternation (usually that is being projected onto the person being argued with) to try to achieve some sort of high ground in the dialogue. I'm not condescending towards you because I'm that worked up. I'm doing it because the content of the posts I'm replying to demand it. Keep in mind as you try to act like Mr. Cool-and-in-control as you corral your conspiracy theory that you're the guy yelling at OPs in completely unrelated topics about this theory. As far as the articles, you could just click the "news" section on her site that details the recount efforts that you're suddenly pretending to have understood all along. The press releases section, under the entry about ending fundraising, lists expenditures. Also doing a Google search for Stein 2016 recount will yield more recent articles that go into significant detail on the results in each state. But I'm not even sure why you're asking me for this. Supposedly now you know all along how the recount efforts played out.

&gt; It seems you don't know what 'skepticism' means. If you did, you would not conclude that I am belligerently confident that I am correct.

I do, and it is not the same thing as conspiratorial, which you've clearly crossed the line into. You may have broader skepticism about the Green Party but what you're suggesting here is a theory of people conspiring to pull the wool over everyone's eyes for the purpose of taking their money. Excuse me, only part of you is. yeah that would be hilarious, he should definetely do that&gt;  His entire set plays into identity politics more shamelessly than any of the people he criticizes.

dave rubin is a cunt and a shit comedian, but how is a comedian who is gay playing on the gayness in jokes identity politics? is dave chappele doing bits about being black identity politics asweel in your eyes?Snowflake. 

Btw, that's another telltale sign of a young person getting in over their head; feigning righteous indignation in order to back out of a conversation in which they're out of their depth.

Anyway, you found your excuse to ignore people who are pointing out what a tool you are. Head back into the sand now, you fuckin stooge.This is what the US needs, in addition to free college, and minimum income.Their plans to promote the tax cuts will not work. People already knew how bad it is.In reailty I was just venting about the issue. I know this Opioid crisis will pass and nothing is going to happen.The opioid addiction trace back black market of China's drug trafficking into America which healthcare system is complex to say the least. What's the medical insurance stop paying for people's Physical Therapy the payment they suffer like they back pain with increase and so they're desperate.I heard reports about WV with this crisis. It matters because the public would look at the situation as closed minded vision on how to fight back against the drugs in their community. Saying this drug is epidemic in the black and Latino communities aka poor communities. So saying it's a crisis in America than say it's a crisis in sub urban areas makes the issue more broader to people.

Your right the government's war on drugs invest heavily in the events. However, their topics of combating drugs is outdated and or he needs to have new ideas because it's just pretty much Insanity because they're doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. Bingo the money trail is the key.I wouldn't call it anything, but a drug problem. Better yet. I would call it American Issue. The war on drugs is isolated issue within America. 

2. There is no real  benefit of calling one issue another thing over the other. I wanna try to avoid labeling because people might be divided on to deal with this type of issue. 

3. I'll be honest with you. I don't know how the government should handle it. I don't believe drug traffickers are getting off free. It's much bigger than them. 

Sadly that's true. I really don't have a source for this but I'm pretty confident that the vast majority of mass murder incidents in the US have been committed by people who have been prescribed mind/mood alternating medications. Just unfortunate that this important information never makes it into the gun conversation. But I can't be that surprised considering most people really do struggle to consider what is truly relevant for solving problems in the world today.Well most "street" drug addicts are usually addicts because they're poor, and poor people don't have the means to acquire expensive guns and ammunition required to perform a mass shootings. Also the mood altering drugs I really meant to speak of generally don't have street counterparts. Paddock (the guy who did the Las Vegas shooting recently) was prescribed diazepam which is a benzodiazepine, and among benzos' common side effects are increased violence, aggression, irritability, homicidal ideation, and suicide risks or attempts. Citizens Commission on Human Rights has been tracking the trend that nearly every mass shooter in recent decades used mind-altering drugs prior to or during their acts of violence. They started tracking this after it was implicated that antidepressants we're involved in the mass killing commited at Columbine HS in 1999. CCHR has documented 65 high profile acts of senseless violence committed by individuals taking or withdrawing from psychiatric drugs. Also worth mentioning that there is no policy in the US that requires law enforcement to report any use of mind-altering psychiatric drugs prescribed to those who committed violent criminal acts. I'd probably go so far as to say the reason a correlation can't be shown has to do with the fact that this type of policy doesn't exist and I'd even speculate that the reason this type of policy doesn't exist is because the psychiatric-pharmaceutical drug industry is an industry that takes in $80 billion a year in sales alone. They have a lot of incentive to make it very hard for people to correlate psychiatric drug use and senseless acts of violence.&gt; I would say the Cuban Revolution would be a good example

unless you were gaysame, I also can't believe that so many straight liberals literally think that mike pence is gay and shout gay people down when they suggest that mabye he's actually just a bigoted straight guy&gt; Lol

no not lol, wtf&gt; Inside the Night President Obama Took On Donald Trump

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRGVBe03To

Replacement link just in case his doesn't work for you.


Just to add to that, that video gives a really good argument as to why Trump is trying to dismantle Obama's presidency. Basically he probably has the attitude "this dude totally humiliated me so i'm going to ruin his lifes work"Definitely true that lumping all Zionists together as one type is unfair. I've been a victim of such a generalization, and called a self-hating Jew from time-to-time as well.
But there are more elements than the three you listed, because I don't feel that I fit into any of those categories.
Your explanation is fair enough, but my initial question also aimed to go a lot deeper than the straight definition and semantics; of course I I've know that definition almost my entire life. My question is more on the historical evolution of the movement and how they relate to geopolitical conditions. For instance (the obvious example), that Modern Zionism arose in 1896 as a result of rising anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe. There's also different interpretations of the leaders of that movement  (Hertzl, Ben Gurion, etc.) and what their motives were.
Thank you for the input though. Much appreciated.I didn't ask for it to be in favor or against. I asked to clear misconceptions, sort of like the deep dives into socialism, political correctness, the regressive left, classical liberalism, etc. I'm honestly expecting more of a criticism.

There would absolutely be a shitstorm. But isn't part of this show about discussing controversial topics? Gotta deal with it at some point.Specifically, I pretty much align with David on Israel policy, against settlements, the extremely right-wing religious current Knesset, the corruption of Bibi, etc.
I'm not a very religious Jew. I'm actually quite agnostic. I believe in a 2-state solution with pre-1967 borders. I am also for a secular government, at least for Israel with no preference immigrants. Palestine should be able to set up whatever government system they wish.
I often see other Zionists arguing that "If only the Palestinians would lay down their weapons, there would be peace." This is an overly simplified view of the situation, and I fear some more religious Zionists would continue to infiltrate the West Bank even if a 2-state agreement is reached.No seriously, thank you. I like to get deeper into these conversations. I was always painted a rather rosy picture of the movement growing up. It's a little jarring finding the dark side of it as an adult.All of that said, I have several Israeli friends and have been there twice, the first time for a full month. Most of my Israeli friends are fellow millenials who tend to be more liberal, have lost friends in IDF service, and are less religious. There is hope for peace if Israel survives the current generation in power.&gt; possibly a 911 responder?

yeah he was. he's got an interview with his dad on his channel. can't remember if it's specifically about september 11th though. he's mentioned before that he knew many of the firefighters who died&gt; homosexuality is not innate

are you saying this is your opinion?Fair enough 😉homosexuality is innateNot necessarily. Right now, most Israeli attacks are counterattacks, but some Israelis advocate in favor of more settlements, which would then lead to more retaliation from the Palestinians. Mind you, many of these settlements are government subsidized. Also, some Israelis are straight-up bigoted against Palestinians. There have also been some terrorist groups throughout Israel's history (example: Irgun Zvaʾi Leʾumi).
Now, I'm obviously not advocating in favor of any attacks against Israelis by Palestinians by any means. I am pro-Israel. I'm saying that we need to understand the other side. It is much more complicated than that common argument that only the Palestinians need to lay down their weapons to achieve peace. Nothing is ever that simple.&gt; Most people do not feel being gay is a choice

that's becasue it isn't

&gt; but rather it's what they have to

have to what?do you think being gay is a choice? it isn't. a gay person can't turn straight, gay conversion therapy is discredited, dedunked dangerous abusive quackaryDon't know who this guy is but his listeners are dumb as bricks.Have you read it all howsci?

Would you recommend or would you say it's too gossipy to derive any real information?I see that the GOP wanted to try a constitutional convention. I see that ratified or not, it will energize Dems. Even if it is triggered, it needs 38 states to ratify, which is unlikely.No but I often grunt at the end of each bar.

"unh! UNH!"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sNQ3WyE7AU

he says it a little after 5 mins in&gt; sign of weakness

calling a guy a faggot to say he's weak is using it as a slur and is homophobic. there's no such thing as non homophobically calling people faggots&gt; The meanings of words change

faggot is a homophobic slur, it's the gay equivelent of nigger. the only people who claim the meaning of faggot has somehow changed are people who want to call people faggots and not be called homophobic. the meaning of faggot has not changed, still just an anti gay slur, the meaning has not changed in any way

&gt; We have so many words to choose from

which is why it's so disgusting when dickhead straight guys act as if faggot isn't a homophobic slur and is has "become a normal insult"

&gt; No one can be so desperate to hang on to one word as if letting go would mean a deep fall into a joyless life.

what is this supposed to mean?

&gt;  It's a matter of simple decency.

says the guy defending homophobic slurs with the exact same garbage as all the internet trolls who love calling people faggots, mmmm

&gt; explain what they really represent

the word faggot represents anti gay bigotry

&gt;  are pretty much over them

gay people aren't "over" faggot, are you suggesting they are? becasue if so it's fucking deplorable that you are pretending gay people are "over" faggot just becasue you apparently like the word

&gt; words lose their hateful meaning

which hasn't happend with faggot, are you seriously trying to suggest faggot has lost it's hateful meaning? are you fucking kidding me on? do you realize how disgusting pretending faggot has lost its hatefull meaning is?

&gt;  Some words just aren't meant to insult the specific group they once were

faggot is though, the only people who say it isn't are dickhead straight guys who want to be able to call people faggots without being called out. if faggot isn't "meant to insult the specific group they once were" then explain why homophobes call gay men faggots

&gt; One could put 'faggot' in that category.

no they couldn't. you'd have to be a delusion peice of shit to actually think that. why would one put the word frequently said to gay men when they are being brutally assualted in hate crimes for being gay in that category? why would one disgusitngly pretend faggot isn't meant to insult gay people? 

&gt;  Or to let a true masterbater take it from here...

oh wow a straight comedian(and sexual harrasser) likes saying faggot, guess it isn't homophobic /s (do you realize how embarrassing it is to point to louis ck to pretend faggot isn't homophobic?)

your comment is disgracefull and embarrasinghis connection to the word is that he is fully aware it's a homophobic slur, fully aware gays kids get bullied and called faggots, fully aware gay men are called faggots when they are attacked in hate crimes, fully aware the when many gay people hear the word faggot it triggers memories of the worst moments of their life. &gt; then I'm with him.

you're a fucking idiot then&gt; As for some words, the groups that should feel insulted, are pretty much over them. In some cases they own these words and in some the words lose their hateful meaning. Some words just aren't meant to insult the specific group they once were. One could put 'faggot' in that category

i noticed in another comment you mentioned a girlfriend. so basically you're a straight guy who is just declaring that gay people are "over" faggot and no longer insulted by it, that faggot has lost its hatefull meaning and that faggot isn't meant to insult gays. disgusting, do you do this with racist slurs aswell or is that a bridge too far for you? do you only defend anti gay slurs?noticed how this guy also linked to a video of louis ck, cause apparently straight comedians get to decide that homophobic slurs aren't homophobic. it's the same thing kyle done, he trotted out the south park excuse casue straight guys who make cartoons also get to decide homophobic slurs aren't homophobic according to kyle and FelixWinkler&gt; You know how internet kids think it is hilarious to say the obsolete Middle Ages word 'niggard' and pretend to act really surprised when someone takes offense? They know how it is going to look and how others will respond, and they said it for that reason. But they don't want to take responsibility for it.

doubt this guy will care mate, he's using the exact same bullshit excuse all the internet trolls do of "words change meaning" despite the fact the word faggot hasn't changed meaning at all, and the only people who say it has happen to be people who want to call people faggots&gt; to make sure that this is a complicated issue

no it isn't

&gt; every word on its own has to be looked at when assessing how to treat it

why are you acting as if this is some sort of difficult question? everyone knows faggot is a homophobic slur, this issue doesn't need some sort of deep analysis

&gt; originally the word meant a small stick.

this is completely irrelevant

&gt; hopefully

why hopefully? you one of those assholes who is just dying for faggot to be part of common speech? 

&gt; But we have to give it a chance to lose its insulting nature 

no we don't. and who the fuck do you think you are you to dictate that? and who exactly is going to be using faggot in a non insulting way? literally no one

&gt; at least that's Kyle's argument

no it isn't. his argument is childish nonsensical trash(although so is yours obviously). he literally pointed to an episode of south park to "prove" his point that faggot isn't a homophobic slur

&gt; but that's insensitive on your part

no it isn't. faggot is to gay men what nigger is to black people, exact same thing, just different slurs for different groups of people

&gt; That was my point!

no it wasn't. you're defending this dumb fuck idea that the main homophobic slur is somehow actually not a homophobic slur, you're saying the opposite of what i'am

&gt; It's pathetic when homophobes cling to their stupid insults as if they had nothing else to live for

so basically you are annoyed at homophobes calling gay men faggots because then other people can't use the word. you want homophobes to let go of the word faggot so that everyone can start saying it

&gt; But it doesn't need to

it is. pretty fucking odd that you are so eager for faggot to be a word that is used generally. 

&gt; The meaning can change again

you really want to be able to call people faggots don't you, what a dickhead

&gt;  like bikers

go fuck yourself

&gt; Like in 'I hate these faggot homophobes. Stop being so homophobic, you faggots!'

so basically you really want to be able to call people faggots is what's happening here. the fact you would want to use homophobic slurs to "defend" the gay community against homophobes is fucking disgusting. have some respect for gay people you dumb cunt. is this dumb trash a joke? or are you actually a stupid dickhead who wants faggot to be used in this way?

&gt; It looked like as if the word was on the way out

it absolutely fucking didn't. you obviously don't know a thing about homophobia or the experiences of gay people if you think that

&gt; And calling a homophobe a 'faggot' for being as weak as a small stick doesn't mean you are a homophobe yourself

calling anyone a faggot is homophobic. doesn't matter what dumb shit you come up with to "justify" it. calling anti gay bigots homohpobic slurs is moronic as fuck, you're literally just further perpetuating homophobia by doing that. here's an idea you repulsive cretin, how about responding to homophobic bigotry by not using bigoted homophobic slurs

&gt;  not homosexuals.

when you use homophobic slurs you are insulting gay people. it's even more insulting than any other use of the word faggot to "defend" gay people from homophobes by using homophobic slurs. it's a vile thing to do

&gt;  that's what the point of Kyle seems to be

nope

&gt; They call a faggot a 'faggot'. They wouldn't call a gay person a 'faggot', except when that person is a faggot

do not use the slur again, stop fucking doing that you digusting piece of shit. 

&gt; There are people that truly don't see that insult as a term to call someone gay

no there isn't. every single person in the world calling someone a faggot knows it's an anti gay slur

&gt; They call a faggot a 'faggot'.

and what the fuck is a faggot? there is no such thing as a human being who is a faggot you vile cunt

&gt; But there might actually be a chance that the meaning of this word has changed to some people already

it hasn't, all the people saying this dumb garbage that you're spewing right now use faggot in exactly the same way it has alwyas been used, and they are all very aware of the homophobia

&gt;  And not everyone using the term 'moron' hates mentally challenged people

moron is an archaic term and the vast majority of people saying don't know it used to be a medical term. whereas literally everyone in the world who says faggot is aware it's a slur used against gay men, a slur gay men almost always hear when they experience homophobic violence

&gt;  Wouldn't that be good?

obviously that wouldn't be good you fucking moron

&gt; Wouldn't it be great if that word in its homophobic hatred would vanish because people stopped using it in a homophobic way?

no it obviously wouldn't be good if straight scumfucks who really want to call people faggots got their way and made it so faggot was just a word used generally. that you think this would be good shows massive disrespect for all the gay men and boys who have experiences of bullying, harrassment and violence connected to that word. you are fucking disgusitng, go fuck yourself you piece of garbage

&gt; giving it another meaning (again), could...

you're clearly absolutely chocking to be able to call people faggots and have people not call you outthis comment is absolute trash. and you are a fucking moron and a dickhead&gt; trying to explain his view

who the fuck asked you to do that? no one gives a fuck. i was asking people what they thought of what he said not for them to come up with moronic justifications for it

&gt; there might be kids out there calling each other 'faggot' in the understanding that it means a weak Trump-like personality

there isn't&gt; Wouldn't that be good? 

before you were saying this &gt; But we have to give it a chance to lose its insulting nature 

i thought you wanted it to lose its insulting nature but here you are saying wouldn't it be good if if was being used as an insult, care to explain that&gt;  but come to the conclusion that I have to be in a war against homosexuals

no i didn't. the fuck are you talking 

&gt; I can have a valuable opinion, even when I'm not gay

obviously. but on this issue your opinion is worthless trash

&gt; It's not the gay community against everyone else

i didn't say it is

&gt;  it's mathematically impossible that you have done more for the gay community than I have.

hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaah

so are you going to acknowledge that all your comments on this thread are dumb garbage? everything you have said is completely ridicolous and you didn't acknowledge a single fucking thing i've said. faggot is homophobic, get that through your thick skull you stupid asshole, and have some fucking respect for gay people. what kind of moron thinks calling homophobes faggots is a valid way to  "defend"(perpetuating homophobic language isn't defending gays) the gay community? seriously answer that question

&gt; But what if the term was used by some as an insult to needy, desperate, weak, self-victimizing assholes like Trumpists?

you clearly want to call trump supporters faggots. yeah that would still  be homophobic, calling people faggots is homophobic, get that through your fucking skull

&gt; Or bikers, in the case of South Park

you do realize that south park episode was completely moronic? and you also realize that a cartoon written by two straight guys doesn't dictate what is and is not a homophobic slur?

&gt; Wouldn't that be a different context?

nope, faggot doesn't magically become not a homophobic slur becasue you want to call trump trolls faggots or because 2 straight guys wrote a cartoon episdoe where they encourage people to use homophobic slurs and then pretend it isn't homophobic

&gt; , it's not carved in stone that the word 'faggot' has to refer to homosexuals

it does refer to homosexuals, becasue it's a homophobic slur. using it against people you personally dislike doesn't make it not homophobic. the word faggot is a slur against gay men and everyone who is saying it is aware of that, you can't just declare that you mean something else. btw do you defend people using racist slurs or is it only homophobic slurs you like?

&gt;  the connection between 'faggot' and 'homosexual' might fade over the years

faggot is literally THE MAIN HOMOPHOBIC slur, why would it magically become not homophobic? why would gay being used as an insult less make the connection between THE MAIN HOMOPHOBIC SLUR and homosexual fade? that makes no fucking sense. faggot is the gay equivelent of nigger, why would people using gay as an insult less make the main homophobic slur magically become non homophobic?

&gt; And the South Park guys and Kyle seem to see it that way.

no they don't. they literally just decided and declared that the main homophobic slur isn't homophobic, as in they are saying RIGHT NOW in 2017 it isn't homophobic even though it obviously is and bigots call gay men faggots all the fucking time. they aren't saying it will become not homophobic in time, they are just declaring it isn't becasue they decided it isn't, becasue they obviously(especially in the south park guys case) just want to be able to say it without being called out

&gt; Maybe they're wrong

no not "mabye". they are wrong and the opinions laid out here by you are absolute embarrassing moronic trash
&gt; Some words just aren't meant to insult the specific group they once were. One could put 'faggot' in that category

how the fuck is a comment saying faggot isn't meant to insult gay people got so many upvotes on this sub?&gt; I'm just here to explain their point

why again? no one asked for someone to explain why morons pretend THE MAIN HOMOPHOBIC slur isn't homophobic. you clearly want faggot to be something that is acceptable to say and are not just explainning their pointOn the contrary to all the opinions stated below from libcucks, I would very much like to engage. Low birth rates means that the white population is not getting naturally replaced, also mass immigration means that the proportion of Caucasians decreases. Now tell me, which people in their right mind would celebrate the reduction of their population?

Only guilty white libtards will. What is the white guilt about you ask? Well its about the legacy of colonialism, slavery, land stealing etc. Look every historical civilization has an ugly past; thats how people lived ok. So why are white people the only ones being forced to apologize? Do we do this to the Turks, Mongols etc?

I suggest you listen to this man Douglas Murray here.

Also his book "The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity &amp; Islam" is a great read. Check out his interview with Rubin here discussing the book. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAgLxI5izQUI am sure that every human life is valuable and I do also appreciate diversity but in order to maintain this diversity, we must create separation. White people live in white countries, Asians live in Asia, Blacks in Africa etc. Why are white countries the only ones expected to take in large number of immigrants?

Our people have improved the quality of life through industrialization, modernity, science etc. Most of the contribution to world development have come from European brains. I dont want to share this with other non-white scum. I appreciate other cultures, just wish that they would stay in their countries and use their own resources for development instead of being leeches &amp; parasites in our countries. 

Yes, family is family. We take care of our immediate family; parents, siblings, partners, kids etc. What is race? Race is simply an extended family. Therefore, being white myself, my loyalty lies with the white race and the betterment of my own kind. 

Every other race acts this way. Blacks hate whites in general, stick with their own, have their own identity groups, ditto for Asians, Latinos and extremist Muslim savages. Only delusional &amp; race traitor fools like you care about everyone else first. You are a cuck lolz! And you should read these books and watch this videos.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9fOqz_lY6IJudging by the framing of the post, it seems the OP thinks that this is a Trump victory and not a DPRK victory. What do you think the point of all the threats and posturing are anyway? They want to end their isolation, on their terms.My theory is consistent. Diversity thrives in separation. Do you not understand this simple concept? True diversity arises when races are kept separate, developing their own individual, unique characteristics. When you get interbreeding, all you get are mixed mongrels. 

This is a problem for us, as we have recessive genes and so if we mate with blacks, 9 times out of 10, the kid comes out black with kinky hair, fat lips, ugly facial features etc. This is why we whites need to separate. Now, you are an idiot who does not value white beauty, but that does not mean that others dont. I simply feel comfortable and prefer to live amongst my own kind. What is so unreasonable about my demands to keep America, Canada, Australia and Europe majority white?

The non-whites can have Asia, Africa, Middle East. I say good luck to them. Dont come over here and mooch on our resources. Wow what happened to free speech? You may disagree with me but how dare you report me for stating my opinion honestly? THis is the problem with you snowflakes; you cannot handle different opinions and this is why I am glad that Trump won. Diversity thrives in separation. Do you not understand this simple concept? True diversity arises when races are kept separate, developing their own individual, unique characteristics. When you get interbreeding, all you get are mixed mongrels.

The fact is that you disgust me. You have bought the multicultural bs hook, line &amp; sinker.You keep avoiding my main question. Why must white countries be the only ones letting in immigrants? Why don’t you the demand the same of Ghana, Nigeria, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia etc? 

Asia for Asians, Africa for Blacks, Middle East for Arabs. White countries for everyone??? Why????Then what are you? Progressive? That’s even worse or a neocon idiot like David Frum? The only mainstream conservatives worth listening to are Ann Coulter &amp; Stephen Bannon.I'm really not sure where to start with this comment. Let me see if I can go for the knees, rather than get caught up in the tangle presented by the questions you're asking and the way your'e asking them.

It is art. Just a new medium. There are more productive things that could have been done with paint and building materials than making statues and paintings. The use of those materials to create art didn't preclude those practical uses, and paint, stone, and marble were used to those ends as well as artistic endeavors. There were more productive things to do with video technology than to record Chaplin clowning around and creating a narrative out of it. Those productive things were done as well, and weren't harmed by the use of the technology to create cinema. 

Similarly, computers are used by society for all manner of practical uses that aren't disturbed by there also being an entertainment industry that utilizes the technology. The idea of something "better to do" just isn't really applicable. I can use a bicycle to get to work or to do tricks. One won't stop the other. It's not like someone is doing tricks and not thinking that they might also use this device to go to the supermarket. 

Think of it as any hobby. Hiking, knitting, reading, watching movies, hanging out at the local bar, chasing storms... whatever anyone does for pleasure/stimulation. Video games are that. There is no real reason to view it through any other lens.This is a hilarious and racist comment by the orange ape in charge haha! Does he realise that Nigerian immigrants outperform every other group in USA? Does he know that Indian doctors &amp; software engineers make up a pretty significant portion of those industries? What about Mexicans, Central Americans that work for half the pay and are keeping the fruit picking, construction industries alive down south? Only an ignorant, bigoted asshole would make such a statement.

Btw I actually support merit based immigration as then people with good education &amp; qualifications can come &amp; contribute to USA regardless of where they come from?&gt; My point is that gaming seems to exclusively glorify violence as opposed to art in general. How many romantic or comedic games are there?

A great deal, and growing every day. There are all sorts of bizarre genres you wouldn't likely expect to exist, let alone thrive. Not only that, but you'd be surprised at how many games that do contain violence are also some of the games that are the richest in content (as movies can sometimes be), or are made by developers that are cognizant of the fact that they are creating interactive narratives that put the user in the position of engaging in violence and take it into account when creating games, or have historical themes/settings that are explored in more than superficial ways. Really though, I think you'd be surprised by how many don't include violence.

I'm not sure the medium even requires that sort of diversity to be validated though. Even if it was a bunch of shooting simulators, if the function of the product is to entertain, provoke emotion or thought, or anything along those lines, it should get its artistic credit. Every medium begins somewhere. 

&gt; I take exception to the first responder's reply to my comment attempting to justify gaming's questionable value as being 'just art', when its a very specific genre of what I view as low brow art.

So it's art you don't appreciate. It's also art that you seem to have incredibly limited exposure too, but that's beside the point. My point is that it doesn't need to be appreciated by everyone or by you to be considered art. Whatever exception you're taking, it's not really contradicting what I'm explaining to you about this phenomenon that you're expression confusion about. It's an artistic cultural contribution, and a valuable one, just like all seemingly worthless art beyond the appreciation of observers can have impacts beyond moving someone on some level. Science fiction inspires science, for example. Cinema and music can contain political messaging that can persuade people ideologically or promote awareness. Video games function much like cinema on a lot of levels (and even like sports on others), and have been, right under your nose, inspiring people for decades.It’s not our responsibility or fault that these people have bad corrupt governments and cannot take care of themselves. Honestly, this excessive caring, altruism and empathy are the weaknesses of Caucasians. Take care of your own tribe first. That’s what all other races do apart from us. It doesn’t make any sense to me. I’m willing to pay non-white people to leave white countries! 

If you want to experience diversity so much why don’t you move to a third world shithole &amp; get the whole cultural experience man? Why subject other white people to this when a lot of us don’t want it? Ever wonder why white flight happens? Because the majority of us self-segregate &amp; feelsafer in less ‘diverse’ neighbourhoods.

Have you read the strange death of Europe by Douglas Murray or this French book called ‘Submission’? Get out of the feel good leftist bubble. Have some pride &amp; less guilt!Really? There is no such thing as a white country? R u kidding me now? What about Europe where our recent ancestors originated from and where white people have lived for Millenia. Omg, it’s people like you that are destroying our race. I'm not offended by the word "shithole" either. But I do have a problem with the underlying implications.
You are right that this view on immigration is common in Western civilization, but our immigration policy until now was one of the things that was supposed to separate us from other countries.
That might be a sappy way of look at it, but generally speaking, but no one who is already happy where they are (example: most Norwegians) is going to immigrate to America.
Also, statistically speaking, significantly more people from those third world countries actually have advanced degrees than Americans and arguably more skills. So his comment doesn't even fit his desired merit-based policy.That is not what I meant in the least. This was not an argument about his personal enrichment, nor did I allude to that. This was more drawing a parallel between how companies recruit employees looking for the best of the best and Trump's ideal immigration policy.I couldn't agree more. He doesn't understand the basic fundamentals of American citizenship. I'm terrified of what will be left of our democracy when he does leave office.Ok yes I concede that USA was never an exclusively white nation. But my ancestors are European &amp; I care greatly about the wellbeing &amp; survival of those people. I have Scottish/English ancestry and already these countries are becoming shitholes due to mass migration. There are still countries in Europe (particularly Eastern Europe) that are still exclusively white. Iceland, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Hungary &amp; Slovakia; I hope they don’t go the way of Western Europe. And yes there are small Roma minorities in Bulgaria, Romania who went there in the 1200s from India but they are criminal invading scum &amp; should be sterilised. Oh yeah. I regularly tell my girlfriend that Pakman is an attractive dude and she agrees.It is good that she is free and generally I like her, but there are good substantive reasons to point out one problem with her: that when she attempts to look extra-nice, she looks like a weird mix of man and woman, and as a result looks the opposite of nice(*). All facts need to be out, regardless of how sad they might be. For Chelsea, it would be wisest to not make any attempt to look extra-nice in a feminine way. Why attempt, when it fails so hard? Signifying identity is not good enough reason. 

(*) subjective i.e. to some percentage of people, including me. Unfortunately, these words describe the perception experience: repulsive, disgusting, extremely ugly. Finding a scientific explanation for this unfortunate fact about perception, like "it is a phobia / fobia ", does not affect the fact and does not make it go away.New York is already swinging left.I wouldn't admit defeat yet. Trump likes to inflate his "accomplishments" and make them appear better than they are. Recall his doctor's note during the campaign. The doctor in that case was a proctologist with a Healthgrades.com rating of less than 2 stars, and the note was very Trumpian while not using medical terminology (i.e. "testing positive" is medically not a good thing).
Dr. Jackson is not one to share this kind of info publically. His name was also misspelled on the WH statement.
People in "excellent health" don't eat fast food and junk the way he does. Reports say his cholesterol is very high and he needs to lose weight.
Finally, the cognitive test he insisted on taking was not comprehensive. Reagan had Alzheimer's and passed his with flying colors as well.It likely will. I don't think any similar bills have ever become law. It just bugs me how many people are actually in favor of it.That appears to be the aim, actually. What I fear, though, is that the listed stipulations are on paper only, and the actual courses will become Bible study, given WV's past problems with the issue of bible in schools.
Those Christian parents will likely just pull their kids out of school if the content doesn't reinforce their religious/evangelical views.Hillary would have been a better POTUS, but the democrats learned a lesson that they need to run progressives, not center right establishment shills.

So might be short term pain for long term gain.  If they do learn their lesson, Trump's election might inadvertently set the stage for the needed leftward shift. While Hillary might have cemented center-right as the main stream go-to.  Trump winning may be exactly what the US both deserved and needed. Trolls, imposters... or people who disagree. I've run out of patience with this childish practice of calling everyone who disagrees with you a troll. Grow the fuck up.Furthermore, I'm also sick of this fucking narrative of Trump's election being everyone's fault. The people who voted but not for Clinton. The people who didn't vote. The people who voted, but didn't get the vote out enough. No. THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. We can talk about all of the factors involved in the last election, and yes, small differences had major impact. As far as voters though, the people who voted Trump in voted Trump in. Full stop, and fuck any intellectually lazy cocksucker who wants to say otherwise and spend their time hassling people who actually had the temerity to vote for the candidate that they wanted to see win. Kiss my fucking ass.&gt; The flipside to this, though, is that now they have to own president Trump by admitting 'Hey, I'm to blame - I didn't vote for her!'... 

No they don't, you just choose to project that onto them. I commented on this elsewhere in the thread, but the only people you should blame for voting Trump in are the people voting Trump in. THEY own Trump, and I'm sick of all of these bullshit accusations that people want to level at everyone but them when we talk about Trump making it into office. It's not outrageous for people to actually vote for candidates they like rather than voting for candidates they hate less than the most hated. If the country voted fro Trump, that's that. While you sit here and praise Pakman's video and extrapolate your way to a point about voters, you may want to bear in mind that Pakman himself, if I recall correctly, did a video pointing out how these Stein spoiler narratives are, in terms of the numbers involved in the vote, complete bullshit. Even if they were not (which, again, they are), I find the idea of blaming people who voted for the candidate they preferred for not voting for one that they hated to be repugnant and boneheaded. 

&gt; Not doing something is by definition not progressive.

Neither is championing the continuation of non-progressive candidates who would like to sail under the banner of progressivism. Again though, maybe you should be figuring out how to hammer some sense into Trump voters rather than try to explain to everyone how it is so progressive to perpetuate the lesser of two evils framework that establishment democrats have held over our heads for decades to box our votes in and alleviate any pressure to actually run progressive candidates or campaigns, or to fight for any actual progressive causes. 

This nonsense idea that you're pushing could have been used if Cruz won the primary. Or if Christie won or if Jeb won. All of the fucking Republicans suck. That's not good enough anymore. When do we actually put our foot down within our own party and stop letting them tell us what it's going to be like unless we want to elect a Republican? After EIGHT MORE FUCKING YEARS of corporate Democratic shadow puppetry? And of course there won't be another shitty Republican candidate in eight years to enable the Democratic party to sing the same song at us, right? At this rate we'll be leaving time capsules for future generations telling them to elect actual progressives... but only when the timing is perfect. Otherwise, talk progressive with the left side of your body while you use the right side of your body to pull levers for corporate-funded Democrats who do not share our political vision. 

&gt; Voting for "the lesser of two evils" is actually creating fewer evil! 

Duhuh duhuh! Actually no, it's not. It's ensuring that your choice will always be between two evils. It's spineless, unproductive horseshit that gets nothing at all done. You can say that it may be called for in the more extreme cases, and that 2016 was that case. Guess what though: They mostly did vote for Clinton. Stein captured an irrelevant portion of the general election vote. Once again, your energy is misdirected. 

&gt; The strategy of doing nothing has failed the US too many times now...

Then YOU stop voting for the lesser of two evils, as maintaining that status quo is the closest thing to doing nothing imaginable. The party will always be Republican light if you continue to enable that bullshit. You're not just enabling it now though, you're champining it! Get a fuckin grip.

&gt; God, how I'm annoyed by whiny little bitches that don't do anything but complain.

Right, you are not a whiny complaining bitch who does nothing when you go on your diatribe about how we should continue the lesser of two evils strategy that has made the political spectrum of our elected officials range from center to right. It's only the other people who are whiny bitches. Be sure to have some shades on if you ever pull your head our of your ass, I wouldn't want you to become blinded when see the sun for the first time.That's what makes it a lesson, not a suggestion. I don't like it either, and it's not how I would have chosen to make the point, but I didn't, and neither did any dems. Republicans were about to get their vote out better this time, and had a candidate that appealed to their base rather than dictate to and scold it. I agree, the damage being caused right now is most alarming. I'm not sure why it's the fault of anyone except those who chose to fight tooth &amp; nail to ensure that his opposition in the election was an antithesis to the ideals that drive the democratic base, and one who spent a good deal of her time condescending directly towards that base. And how would Hillary's victory of mattered? It would have cemented their mentality that center-right positions win elections.

Centrist democrat front runners like Kamala Harris have shifted to the left on a variety of issues since the 2016 defeat.

Trumps victory has had a measurable leftward effect on the democratic party.If they don't lose elections they don't shift.  They were steadfast and dismissive of Bernie and his supporters right up until Trump won.

The shift happened because of the loss.  Not because Bernie ran.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As4qycanteE

It took me quite a while to find. I was actually beginning to think I might be mistaken. When I went back to the search window to close it, I just scrolled down a little bit more and there it was. 

It's one argument. You can disagree with it. 

&gt; I'm sure you can at least come up with a conceptual scenario where voting for your favorite candidate isn't necessarily the 'right' decision to make.

Yeah, I've been doing it since 2000. I'm not sure you're even making the right argument here, or at least not one that is speaking to what I'm saying in the sentence you quoted. You can disagree with their vote. You can choose not do do what they do, and use your vote strategically to try to avert some disaster that you perceive (what I have been doing since 2000). You don't blame that person for the candidate you like not winning though. They don't like your candidate. They also didn't vote for the candidate that beat the one you liked. If there is a voter to take issue with here, it's the one who checked the box next to Trump's name. Both parties are participating in the democratic process as intended. One of them voted for the disaster you were trying to avert. 

Aren't you troubled by the fact that this mentality perpetuates the two-party system, inhibiting our choice of candidates in a small field of paid stooges and ensuring that the biggest progressive victory we can hope to achieve is keeping the next lunatic Republican out of office?&gt; I would also have to say it was partially the fault of anyone that didn't vote for Hillary, especially in the rust belt states.

So it's their fault that they didn't rush out and vote for a candidate they didn't like? What is even the point of campaigning if we're expected to just vote one way all the time? What incentive AT ALL would the DNC have to push any candidate that actually has progressive goals? As long as Republicans keep on being a destructive party that pushes destructive narratives, the Democratic party has your vote on lock is what it sounds like. Do you anticipate the Republican party running out of scary candidates any time soon? At what point when a candidate sucks is it ok, in your eyes, for someone not to vote for them? 

At some point you have to hold a campaign responsible. Of the two major candidates, Trump's campaign got more votes out where it mattered. It's known that Clinton neglected the rust belt. I'm not sure why you would be more interested in blaming the voters for her doing that. It's like voters are supposed to know what to do, and the candidates have no agency at all. By the way, you also might want to consider the fact that most of the country that didn't vote for Trump and likely many who did didn't think Trump could win. No doubt due in no small part to the fact that media heads in papers and on television/internet were constantly telling them so, including Clinton's surrogates - those same surrogates who assisted her in berating and alienating the democratic base that you're now blaming for Donald Trump being in office. How's winning them over coming along btw?&gt; You seem to have missed the word "partially".

I didn't miss any words. What about my comment makes you say that? While we're throwing semantic nonsense into the mix, I should also point out that "it was partially the fault of anyone that didn't vote for Hillary, especially in the rust belt states" is even going to far, in particular your use of the word "especially," which suggests that blue state voters who voted for Stein had any impact whatsoever, just not as much as the rust belt voters. Even by your weird logic of "everyone who didn't enable Clinton to win despite the fact that they did not like her," the idea that you should be waving with your pitchfork in the direction of a New York voter who cast a ballot for Stein is absurd. Now that that tangential nonsense is out of the way.

&gt; Yes, I can be counted on to vote for the better candidate offered by the two relevant parties in any election where my vote might make a difference.

Then thank you for ensuring our perpetual political stasis. The democratic party will never have to run an actual progressive thanks to you and people like you. All they have to do is remain one smidge less repugnant than the batshit insane post-Tea Party Republican candidates, and you will ensure that their careers and their disingenuous agendas will always prevail, as long as you have something to do with it. It's funny how the word progressive can come to represent no progress whatsoever when the Democratic party has your balls in a sling and you prefer to do nothing about it. 

&gt; Now that I've raised your blood-pressure another couple of points...

Get a life. It's not my first day on the internet, and even if I were susceptible to you posturing as the calm and in-control party speaking to an hysterical one, my post to you was completely tame and civilized. Go fuck yourself. There, now you can try to set yourself up to act smug in lieu of persuasive arguments.

&gt; I absolutely do blame both the DNC and the media. They get the bulk of the blame, I just don't let the voters off the hook completely.

You shouldn't. Only the ones that didn't vote for Donald Trump when you're having a conversation about why Trump won. This is a process where people step forward, not where everyone else steps back. Campaigns need to bring out votes. The same way that it's not the viewer's "fault" when a show gets cancelled, or diners' "fault" when a restaurant closes, I'm not going to blame voters for not jumping on-board with a shitty campaign that made massive mistakes. A politician needs to earn a vote, and like Clinton in 2016, you seem to think that an acceptable means of doing so is to not be the craziest person in the room, fuck all else. Sorry but a lot of people are done with that. Never mind the ones who don't typically vote, and were given no incentive by the Clinton campaign to come out and do so for the first time to make her President. You don't get to disenfranchise voters and then sit around blaming them when they don't rally behind you. 

&gt; If we don't like the candidates, then we have the option of turning out in the primary, so I also blame the voters who stay home for those. Bernie was either competitive in or won all the rust belt states, but even there turn-out was terrible. Voters need to realize that primaries are where all their power lies in this country. 

Yeah, participation in primaries is not only alarmingly low and we would almost certainly see more favorable outcomes in elections if that were not the case. It's still not idle voters' fault that Trump won the election. Voters' disenchantment with the political system and resignation to the idea that their votes don't matter or count isn't one that manifested out of thin air. They've been given very good reason to become underwhelmed by the process. By the way, that includes primary voters in 2016 who broke their ass trying to get out the vote for Sanders, only to find out that the Democratic party and Clinton were in cahoots to defeat him. The same people who you're blaming (excuse me, only partially) for not turning out to vote for her.... No, fuck that. I DO NOT blame those people.Good riddance! With friends like Rubin, who needs enemies. I say that Pakman is much better off not associating with that POS. If only Sam Harris had the backbone to stop his Patreon funding as well. The fact that you can dig up information on almost anyone with as little as their name relates to poor practices by either the people themselves or, more seriously, institutions that should know better. Just to give a very simple example, my university published a list of enrolled students. This is out there forever, and allows anyone who knows my name to find out where I went to university. This is a serious issue when we're talking about institutions which are part of the infrastructure of modern life. Avoiding them isn't a realistic option any more than completely cutting yourself off from society is. There is very little that an individual can do about this, and if this is ever addressed I believe it will be by legislation.

Concerns around the NSA usually relate to mass surveillance. Obviously NSA is especially apt at this, but there is plenty of other organizations that try the same (with different degrees of success). There are plenty of things an individual can do about these. For example, don't use (or minimize usage) of services which have been built for the purpose of collecting information that can be traced back to you personally (google, facebook), or learn how to use them while covering your tracks when possible (google) and drop them altogether otherwise (facebook). As always, be conscious of weighting pros and cons when sharing your data.

You're right, but I'd put these two phenomena in separate categories. I suppose there's also people who would say these are really the same phenomena and they should all be addressed by legislation.I'd say that if Karen is sharing her plates of food, she won't be complaining about privacy. That is not the kind of people that he was referring to when he gave the coupons example.&gt; But Karen is the majority of people

But she's not complaining about privacy, so she's not the people that our ex-FB friend was talking about with his example.

&gt; But my Mother-in-law will wreck computers with malware and give away any information at virtually any prompting. That's who the guy is referring to.

No, there's two parts to his claims. The first is people in general, he claims they don't care about privacy. The second is people who claims they care about privacy, and for those he offers an example as proof that they don't.

And by the way, the fact that your mother-in-law wrecks computers with malware doesn't imply she doesn't care about privacy. It might just be that she doesn't know any better. Right? You have to admit that's an alternative explanation to just "she doesn't care about privacy".Context? Why does this person matter?Dude, you're hanging out with strange people then. The people I know who have this behaviour of posting everything they eat to instagram, don't complain about privacy.

&gt; However, she doesn't think twice about snapping up those coupons and shops based on ads she sees. 

And here you're making the same mistake as our idiotic friend. It is consistent that you're privacy-weary, and still get coupons. This is a calculation that each person does individually, and different people will come to different conclusions.

Anyway, I think I've made my point, I have other stuff to do now :-PI noticed something about you. When you desperately try to get under my skin, you usually repeat something verbatim that I already said nearby in the thread. As much as I get your Superman undies in a bunch, it's pretty clear that you admire something about the way I speak. Oh wait though, let me head off a likely response: No, you are not doing it to refer to my text. You just aren't very articulate or creative, and repeat the last good-sounding thing you heard. 

Anyway, I hope my nuts are a faster ride than public trans for you, or the highway if you're a driver.&gt; The conclusion of Pakman's argument in that video is that Clinton/DNC are partially responsible for the election loss.

You sound like you do not understand what you just listened to. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even seen like you read the title, which very clearly places the bulk of the blame clearly on the DNC and Clinton. The overall thrust of the video speaks to several narratives that try to place blame on various other parties as well, including, in no small part, narratives about third-party spoilers, which is exactly what I referenced, despite the fact that right now you're trying to tell me that we shouldn't believe our lying ears. I'm not sure if you're trying to be slick or if you really aren't especially adept when it comes to analyzing bodies of text and identifying what its components indicate. The result is the same: you're wrong.

&gt; Russia, Comey: all of these things also contributed to Clinton's loss in the sense that had they not occurred, Clinton would have won despite the support that Trump got.

Yeah, and that weather on voting day too.

Sure, there were numerous factors, and it's not unreasonable to speculate that any one or two of them being absent could have yielded a different result. THAT IS NOT a rational basis on which to start raging against the weather. When we're talking about the catastrophe that was the last election, one campaign brought out a lot of votes, and in important places, while the other belly-flopped in spectacular fashion, including neglect of the very battleground states that cost her in the election. In light of those two major factors, I'm not interested in this massive waste of time of trying to find everyone possible to place some blame on. It's not our job to compensate for shitty campaigns. 

&gt; This issue can be fixed by voting in better candidates during the primary season.

But that didn't happen. Why? Well, we can't say how things would have turned out otherwise, but it's reasonable to conclude that the party throwing all their support behind Clinton while using every sleazy trick in the media book to smear Sanders had some impact.

So the people that you're scolding voters for not getting behind are the same people that are trying to impede the solution that you suggested. The same solution that millions of voters mobilized to reach. It turns out the problem is more complex than that, and that the perpetrators in the situation are the same people that you're blaming people for not voting in. If you don't see how that's a massive problem, and how that's not the fault of people who voted for Jill Stein, I'm not sure what's left for me to do to enlighten you on this dynamic I'm criticizing. lol lawl I totally believe you rofl lolI'm not at all worried about convincing devout Republicans. I grew up in the town where some kid tried to rush the stage at a Trump rally in 2016, and Trump spent the next week falsely claiming that the kid was with ISIS. I know Trump Country, trust me.
I'm worried about independent voters who may lean right, but are otherwise disgusted by the GOP. I have one friend who considers herself "libertarian" - she's really not, she thinks it's the same as not being either Republican or Democrat - who voted for Bernie. She's on the train the Schumer/Dems are the only hypocrites in this. I'm worried about those kind of voters who are otherwise for Democratic policies.I think that this is reading too much into what Tammy was trying to say. If Trump had dodged the draft because he was against the war based on principle, then you would have a point. We had those kind of draft-dodgers in my family. But Trump LOVES war. He has literally said so. She was attacking him as a rich spoiled brat who never had to serve when others did, however corrupt the cause. We can distinguish between the war itself and the soldiers drafted to fight it.
To be fair to your point, she could have just said  "someone who has never served," but that doesn't have the same bite.Interesting, but I don't think it will work. It's too early to know the consequences of new tax law, but right now it is very popular. Better messaging will be highlighting the impacts on popular programs like Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, impending rise in healthcare costs, companies laying off workers, etc.
If we wanna go the scare-tactic direction  (not recommended), we can bring up economic analyses predicting the next financial crash as a result of the tax law.
Bottom line: focus on impact.I never said we were close. 😉
She thinks of me as a niece because I danced with her daughter for a while, but I haven't seen or spoken to her since I quit dancing when I was 15, now 11 years agoNo restrictions.

I'm friends with several die-hard Hillary supporters. They blame his campaign for her loss because they think it's his voters' fault for not turning out for her. For some it's because he's not a woman, for others it's his idealism, for some of my Jewish friends it's that he "won't admit he's Jewish."

The Bernie Bros didn't help either.

Yes, I agree that it's on Hillary if she didn't get the votes. At times, even I was reluctant.Fair enough. Gah! I'm an actual engineer. I should know these things!I gotcha. I 100% agree.She volunteered. She's in a perfectly fine position to criticize the president. He never served even when he was called to multiple times. She volunteered and lost her legs as a result. He will never know that kind of sacrifice.

And for that matter, if you think women don't get to criticize draft-dodgers because they can't be drafted, then men don't ever get to talk about women's issues.

See what you do when you draw lines like that? Also, read my ENTIRE comment, not just one fucking word. He wasn't against the war. He just preferred to sleep around New York avoiding STIs.It does if it will impact 2018 Democratic candidates.

Also, I apparently just like to watch the world burn.Jimmy Dore is a cancer of the left! Just ignore this idiot, there are many more liberals &amp; progressives out there that are worth listening to.Then he got an idea how to make his sack of money even bigger: 

Next he was showing a smaller sack of money to other person and saying: "you get this if you go around saying that liberals are bad, abortion is baby murder, taxation is stealing by gunpoint and wishing for conditions that would lead to less inequality is class warfare"

Then the other person said "ok".

How I made that picture: With Blender software on Linux operating system. ( Blender has a whole subreddit, which is rare for a single software. Of course Linux has several subreddits. )

I release that picture to public domain.Thanks for the suggestion mate! I will def check Rational National out. I’m a regular listener of the David Pakman show &amp; he’s brilliant. Dore is slowly becoming the Alex Jones of the left; he’s not worth engaging.I had to rewatch that segment of Bill's show, because I don't remember "We should adopt Canada's more right-wing policy," being the thesis of what he was trying to say. Then again, I'm a big fan, so it might just be a dose of cognitive dissonance.
Bill didn't follow up with any suggested actions on the facts he read, which were basically the bullet points of the criteria Canada looks at. Then Larry Wilmore started talking and they never got back to it. Mind, there is limited time to get very deep into nuances on the show, especially in the season premier when there's a lot of news to catch up on.
This response video also didn't do anything to refute those facts. It was more about immigration in Canada vs. US by the numbers, looking at the numbers of immigrants coming to both countries as percentages of the existing population. 
Both videos, I think, are good things to talk about in the immigration debate. We don't need to copy everything Canada does, but let's not put words in people's mouths.I agree to some extent, but it also depends on how you frame the Russia issue. If it's about Trump-Russia, I'd say yes. We are too focused on it in the media. I'm not sure what we can do about that, though, because right now it involves watching GOP representatives politicize the intel community and try to discredit them, and THAT is an issue we should care about more than we do.
If it's about Russian meddling, because they still are with #releasethememo and other memes, then it should be covered more. I only recently recall interacting with him, though based on those couple of interactions, it's possible that he's the same intellectual adolescent whose deaf ears I've presented arguments to in the past. More like tragedy than comedy if you ask me.Fuck that guy.This is why I don't believe he will give them a path to citizenship. We have him floating that idea yesterday to the gaggle of reporters on tape. I haven't seen any yet today, but nativist commentators on conservative media and hardliners in the WH will pull him back. That's literally what happened 2 weeks ago with his bipartisan meeting followed by the "shithole countries" meeting.
His idea of what to do with the Dreamers and the wall seems to be changing daily. You can't make a deal with someone who can't make up their mind.

That said, if he did (hypothetically), I think the hardliners would be angry at first, but then forget about it before too long. I just don't see any signs of that happening.One bit of polling missing in this debate is public opinion on "the wall." Most recent polls show that 6/10 Americans don't want it, but I didn't see a party breakdown.
As long as Trump and the GOP continues to insist on the wall in a DACA deal, we need to know public opinion about both pieces of the debate.I see we have no shortages of crazy right-wing conspiracy theories this week.Many involved in pro-Palestine activist groups actually are anti-Semitic, but not all. When you clicked on the video link, did you happen to read the comments? They are trashed with Holocaust denial and hatred. Just because you don't hate Jews doesn't mean that every BDS activist shares your opinion.

There are definitely fair criticisms to make about the Israeli government, especially these days, but this reality needs to be acknowledged.Okay. Here's the thing, though. It doesn't take much to read up on the origins of BDS, which are, at their roots, anti-Semitic. It is also helpful to look at opinion polls from Pew. BDS did not start on American college campuses, and the movement is financially connected to Islamist groups, obviously Hamas, but also the Muslim Brotherhood and Salafi. The ultimate goal of BDS is to end Israel, not an agreement on a 2-state solution. There have been several opportunities for that.
Demonization based on the opinions of a segment of a group goes both ways. I've read comments by Israel die-hard supporters calling all Palestinians terrorists and calling on them to be wiped out. However, those involved in BDS also use those Zionists who favor further Israeli expansion to paint all Zionists as racist scumbags. Neither generalizations are remotely accurate, including Israelis. Where's the nuance? That's what I hate about this debate. It is one of the issues most prone to confirmation bias when there is news about the conflict, and there is no unbiased news source.Now now, no need to be hostile with me. Here are some polls and sources if you need them.

Here are some videos from David's show that feature the problems with BDS and anti-Israel views that are missing facts, such as the use of human shields by Hamas.

I was mistaken in thinking there was a poll on explicitly anti-Semitic views. But, if you think about it, we have been saying about racism that no one likes to be called a "racist," and the same goes for "anti-Semite." I do not believe that being against Israel automatically makes you an anti-Semite, nor did I ever say that. However, the BDS movement is attracts a lot of anti-Semites and its ultimate goal, as you have acknowledged, is the end of the Jewish State. You even agree that their demand for the right to return is a bad idea.

"The poisoning of the debate in the west by conflating all criticism with antisemitism is designed to destroy nuance."

Again, it's the same problem with leftists shutting down debate with a Zionist by automatically calling them racist for their support of Israel. Reducing the entire debate to either side acting entirely out of bigotry is getting us nowhere, and THAT is what I am sick of.

"Most public defenders of Israel are racist scumbags who are apologists for the occupation."

Aside from Alan Dershowitz, who I think is a big old POS and my other more liberal Jewish friends agree, where is your evidence for this? Do you lump all people who identify as Zionist with the "public defenders of Israel"? Because there is a major difference between a Zionist - someone who believes in a homeland for the Jewish people - and someone who defends everything Israel does, including it's destructive expansionist policies. I did present to you a poll that shows that being Zionist does not mean that I defend the Israeli government, and I generally don't. Many Jews in America are like me that way. 

"The fact is the state of Israel has existed for 70 years and its right to exist is not in question, the debate is whether or not Israel can conduct a land grab and slowly dispose of inhabitants."

This is categorically incorrect. You already conceded that the ultimate goal of BDS is the end of the Jewish state, so on that basis alone, Israel's right to exist is at the heart of BDS. BDS does attract people who have the view you described, but that is not the purpose of BDS, and you know it. Here is another clip from David's show explaining that. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po3RpaOUMTw

"It worked on apartheid in South Africa and it can work on apartheid in Israel."

Except that there is no apartheid in Israel. Arab Israelis have equal rights in Israel with Jewish Israelis and have representation in the government. The Palestinian territories are self-governed by the PA and Hamas. That is not an apartheid. The Israeli government does continue to build settlements, which I vehemently oppose, and the checkpoints are, admittedly, oppressive. But this is categorically not the same thing as an apartheid, so treating it that way will not do anything to solve the problem.

"It's got you hemming and hawing at what should be uncontroversial statements in any civilized society that really believes in human rights and international law."

This is pure ad hominem. I'm not saying that Israel doesn't have human rights problems that need to be dealt with. However - and this is not a what-aboutism - have you ever considered human rights violations within the Palestinian territories? Israel is not the sole guilty party in this conflict. I was in Israel for a month in the summer of 2008. While I was there, there was an exchange: the two IDF soldiers kidnapped and killed by Hezbollah in 2006 for 100 living Hezbollah prisoners. That was a pretty emotionally heavy day. I have been told scary stories by Israeli friends from their time in the IDF and the friends they lost in battle Hamas and Hezbollah. An elderly family member of a close friend was stabbed by a Palestinian militant on a sidewalk in Jerusalem last year.
I'm not trying to pull a Trumpian "violence on many sides" thing here. But it is intellectually dishonest to only look at violations by Israel and excuse attacks and murders by Palestinians against Israeli civilians.5 Things:
1. I'm well aware that Rebel Media is a far-right website. This is not news to me. And contrary to your belief, I do know the difference between far-right and alt-right.
2. Clearly, they don't promote these kind of hateful comments. What part of my statement made you think that I don't know that?
3. I don't generally look at the comments under their videos. That said, I was not surprised to find anti-Semitism, nor did I insinuate that I was.
4. I was mistaken in thinking which side the anti-Semitism was coming from. It was an honest mistake. I reacted too quickly. I have come across other comments on social media where the anti-Semitism does come from the far left, which is why I wrongly came to that conclusion.
5. Was the "autism" ad hominem really necessary? You don't know me, you're not a doctor, and you read literally two paragraphs from me and attacked. I made a mistake. It doesn't make me an idiot. You could have just pointed it out and moved on. I don't have to go away because my mistake offended you.

Do you bully people like this often? If so, find a other hobby.I certainly acknowledge that I may just have an anti-Trump bias to bring it up today, but I've actually felt this way for last 5 or so years. It just seems that we are always fighting over what the actual state of our union is, and we watch like vultures for the opposition response and fact-checking. We see it everyday in the news anyway. Hell, it's even in the title of Jake Tapper's Sunday show (btw, my favorite news anchor). I just feel like it's become a waste, especially now that the debate has consumed our everyday news and conversations.I also must admit that after all of the news yesterday with McCabe forced out of the FBI, the Nunes memo, and Trump's refusal to implement the sanctions, I am pretty distraught at what this country is turning into.

The SOTU in my opinion is that we have basically become Russia's wind-up toy.Thank you for your perspective. That all makes a lot of sense. I was just curious if anyone was feeling the same way I do about certain traditions like this because of how times have changed. But you bring up a lot of really good points that I guess I hadn't considered.I don't think that's what soucy is trying to say. I'm still not going to watch, more because the sound of this president's voice makes my skin crawl. However I think the point was that rather than just read/watch secondhand commentary on soundbites afterward, because we're all gonna do it either via the news media or late night comedy, it's best to get the full speech first hand so that full context is there and you can have a more well-informed conversation. At the very least, I will read the full transcript tomorrow.

I think your response was kind of rude. I agree that this country is disunited, but there must be Trump supporters in your life, either at work/school or among family and friends. We need to be able to constructively engage with them. Not "mind meld," just to be able to talk from the same raw source. There is no need for you to go after someone who is on the same side as you are politically because they see the value in watching the speech and you don't.

For the record because I'm curious, too, is there are reason behind your screen name? Is that your college major/career path? Or is it just something you thought would be goofy? I have a college friend whose self-imposed nickname was Downsy because she started out as a Special Ed major.Exactly what are your credentials as an "Intellectual Trump Fan"?I actually didn't realize that was the guy from Home Improvement until I read the comments below, and thought it was actually Carl Benjamin up to that point.I'm not sure that it's entirely on the media, but I do think that they really botched their coverage of the 2016 election. Yes, they were covering the real news of the BS email investigation on Capitol Hill, but they overdid it.

MSM is at least partially to blame, I agree. Maybe we can get the money out of the news business? Take away the ratings incentive, maybe they will actually cover news again instead of nonstop political commentator debates. And truth be told, even with their ratings, CNN and MSNBC don't make a substantial profit for Time Warner and Comcast, respectively, and they are usually premium cable channels. It should just be a free service like local news.Okay. You're not going to like my assessment. I've perused your posts, and based on my observations, respectfully, here are the reasons why I would not classify you as "intellectual":

1. It appears that you are using your own observations of your own comments to make that claim. You cannot possibly be an objective judge of your own statements. In political discussion forums like this, most people post and make comments that they think are interesting and thought provoking. That's not always how they look to others. I'll admit that I have fairly been called out on dumb comments I thought at the time were intellectual. From what I've seen, you don't seem to have that kind of humility in your activity on this forum. Now, I don't know you, so I could be wrong. But I have to go off of only the information I can see.

2. In most of your posts, your rebuttals are unsourced, meaning that you don't directly cite hardly anything. Example: in a comment on your very first post: "AGW is not a scientific fact. I have looked at the data. Have you? Let's debate these." You didn't cite a single source for the data you have looked supposedly looked. Then the person you were debating cited their source. To have a real intellectual debate on a scientific topic like this, you need to be using data from the same credible source(s), which in this case would peer-reviewed papers and experiments. Your approach comes off as "This is fact because I say so." This example is not an outlier. You did source the DNI report on Russian interference as evidence of no collusion, but you didn't check the date it was published (Jan 6 of last year, btw). You sourced it only a few days ago. Don't you think that there's a chance that assessment may have changed in the last 390 days? We know that there were contacts between Russian operatives and Trump campaign officials during the campaign. At this point, it's just a question of whether or not those contacts amount to collusion or even conspiracy. Your sourcing of that report this far into the open investigation reads to me as confirmation bias. I don't have time to go through everything, but those two things stick out to me.

3. Related to the above reason, you write off anyone who disagrees with you make assuming they haven't read the same things your have. Often, I have found in your replies to your critics who give you an article to support what they're saying, you fire back with "READ THE ARTICLE." You also once said "I read articles" immediately after a pretty incoherent sentence, which I'll write off as faulty autocorrect or typos. Good for you that you read, but I already covered that you rarely cite your sources. Here's another example. Clearly, you are a big Ayn Rand fan. I'll admit that I have never read her work, although it is on my list. I have enough self-awareness to know that I wouldn't last in a debate over her at this time. However, I read a debate you were having over her philosophy. I wouldn't know whether or not the person you were debating really knew their shit, or you, for that matter, but is it not possible for someone to read the same books you do and come out with a different conclusion or opinion from yours? That goes for pretty much reading anything, including news articles. Even David has recommended reading Rand's work, if for nothing else, to at least understand her philosophy first hand. Making blanket-assumptions that liberals don't read looks to me like an effort by you to shut down debate. Same goes for assuming that liberals only act on emotion without any regard for data.

4. Most of your posts come with direct statements that you are actively trying to debunk/discredit David Pakman and the entire liberal movement, or in your shorthand, "libs." But in one, you didn't even get into the details of what you are debunking. Example: "Intellectual Trump Fan debunks What's the Long Term Impact of the Trump Admin's Lies." "Wish there was something to debunk. He aint saying nothing. what's being normalized is baseless assertions and group think. The Intellectual Trump Fan has spoken. I can refute everything that liberals say." What is the point of posting that you are debunking such-n-such a video if you don't even put in the effort to clearly proove your point? You can try to refute everything liberals say, but that doesn't mean you are always successful, and I haven't seen a single thread by you in which you were effective. Your comments come off to me as arrogance, not nuance. In another "debunk" post, your initial "debunking" analysis was clearly incomplete because it is cut off in the middle of a sentence.

5. Another observation I have is that a lot of your posts and comments have random capitalization in an attempt to over-emphasize, much like Trump's tweets. It's fine and all to like your guy, but mimicking his online behavior isn't going to help you convince Trump critics. That may or may not be your goal. You might just be a troll who gets a hard on by pissing off liberals. But don't expect to be taken seriously if that's your angle.

6. I have seen a few comments from you that, while I still don't like them, are not as bad and more clearly communicate your views. It usually doesn't last long because it's typically followed by the behaviors listed above. One of those cases was a debate you had over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. You did accurately point out Gaza's use of human shields as well as the disarray of Hamas. You didn't provide a source, but it was accurate. I must give you a correction, though. Arab-Israelis (Israeli non-Jews) are not Palestinians (non-Jews in the West Bank and Gaza). The former have full rights in Israel along with representation in the Knesset and the latter do not, although many are still employed in Israel. I'm giving you a little on this point.

Overall, these observations of your posting and commenting practices don't about to taking an intellectual approach. I'm not saying you can't be a Trump fan and still effectively partake in an intellectual political discussion with Trump critics. Most of my co-workers are Trump supporters, including my boss. I enjoy their company, and political discussion with them never gets hostile. But you can't just rattle off in an online forum, crown yourself "Intellectual Trump Fan," and call it a day. You need to have an open mind that yours is not the only possible interpretation of a piece of information, you need to not make baseless assumptions about people who disagree with you, and if you must refute someone's thoughts, you can and should respectfully. Otherwise, you're just furthering discourse. In the end, you may just have to agree to disagree and move on.

I imagine right now you're formulating you're rebuttle about how I'm "just another illiterate liberal who doesn't read" (I think I demonstrated that I do) and attempting to refute my every point. I'm just objectively explaining my observations. You do what you will.

You have a nice day ;)

Edit: I had to correct the numbering.I looked at samuelbucketface's other Reddit activity. I don't think their assessment is based on ideological predispositions. Taking the SOTU in a vacuum, I would be inclined to agree that it was okay. But since I can't ignore everything else outside of the event, I'd give Trump a 3. Just like last year, the next few days his popularity will swell a little bit for the next few days because he behaved like an actual adult for a day, and the surge will end with another unhinged 3AM Saturday poop tweet. It's his M.O. at this point, but we all knew that.No problem. I don't share your opinions on the impact of his policies. But you seem to just have an open mind about the administration, and there's nothing wrong with that ;)I can attest to that. At 14 years old, I was 4'10" and 115lbs. Because I was having body image issues, because that was technically overweight, mom took me a kinesiologist to measure my body fat percentage. It was 17%, which for a 14yo girl is considered athletic.

This information is nothing new, though. As a measure of overall health in this day and age, BMI is almost irrelevant taken on its own.Unless they are professional athletes or live at the cross-fit gym, you'd be right, although that doesn't necessarily mean they're obese. But body fat composition would still be a better index to use. It's harder to measure, but it's a more realistic index of overall health. Some people are just naturally more muscular, too.

Keeping some levity (irony not intended), I prefer Gabriel Iglesias' levels of "fatness": big, healthy, husky, fluffy, and DAMN!Is your question serious or rhetorical? Hard to tell in text. It's a pretty loaded question.

It's not antisemitic, at least on its face, and a large majority of BDS advocates are not in the least. However, the number of left-wing anti-Semites involved with BDS (yes, that's a real thing) is not insignificant.
David has several clips from his show discussing this issue and his viewpoint on it, and he supports it with video and information that avid BDS advocates often spin, ignore, or are just unaware of. When you have the time, if you haven't already seen them, I would browse them and make your own conclusions. I could go into it because I share his views, but that'd take time I don't have.Lmao this is comedy gold and the perfect parody of brain dead far-right shill Dave Rubin! Love it 😊 Yeah agree. See I hate Rubin with a passion lol so any parody is good for me. But yes being agreeable is the lesser of his faults. What gets my blood boiling about Rubin is his vacuous personality, his pandering to the far-right &amp; alt-lite and him being a Koch brothers funded right wing shill.The preemptive commentary surrounding the memo seems to completely ignore the information released in the transcript from Glenn Simpson's Senate testimony.

At this point, the release of this memo is inevitable as early as today. At best, people will read it through their ideological filters and it won't really change anything. At worst, Director Wray may resign, Rosenstein might be in jeopardy, and ultimately Trump will try every possible avenue to get rid of Mueller. Realistically, the consequences will likely lean more toward the former, but there will be stronger rhetoric from the Trump Admin demanding or suggesting the latter.Other factors BMI doesn't account for are weight fluctuation due to state of hydration, time since the most recent meal before measurement and how large that meal was, stages in a woman's menstrual cycle, treatment for congenital health conditions, use of antidepressants or mood stabilizers, etc. I regularly fluctuate +/- 5 lbs, and my body looks the same on either extreme in that 10 lb range. But one pound or one inch of height is all it takes to go from one BMI classification to the next. If we have the technology to better frame a person's overall health assessment, we should just use that and get rid of BMI.Rhetorical it is! Got it.

First of all, I did not generalize that the entire BDS movement is anti-Semitic. Far from it, actually. I said a small, but not insignificant, percentage of people who follow it are. And the origin in 2001 and early proliferation of the movement have anti-Semitic undertones at best.

Second of all, David Pakman, and I as well, ARE against mistreatment of Palestinians as well as the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capitol by the Trump administration. This is also the view held by Bernie Sanders, who actually worked on a kibbutz for 4 months in his 20s. We are big-time critics of the current Israeli government. Supporting Israel's right to exist advocating for the human rights of Palestinians are not mutually exclusive. If you don't think that holding those two thoughts is possible, then you're reducing the situation to either/or and straw man fallacies. We just believe that BDS is not the right vehicle to bring about the end of the mistreatment, and not just because of the involvement of anti-Semites. It hurts the Palestinians more than it helps because it affects their employment prospects. Recall how BDS against Soda Stream went down. Avid participants also falsely compare or even equate it with the apartheid in South Africa. Arab Israelis have equal rights. Palestians have their own governing bodies. I'm not saying that there's no oppression by the Israeli government to protest (there certainly is), but it is, by definition, not an apartheid, and therefore the same tactics would not work to bring about the right kind of change.

Third of all, serious question: Do you classify the mere existence of Israel as the "mistreatment of Palestine" you are referring to? And why does coming down on Israel's side of the issue instantly make us biased? Would it be fair for me to say that you're just biased against Israel? Calling the information used to come to that conclusion mere propaganda is disingenuous and avoids the argument.

I agree with you that Israel has too much influence over the US government, and while I personally don't support BDS, as a free speech and expression issue I am against banning the existence of the movement. I recently broke a date with a guy because he was so gleeful over Indiana University's BDS ban. Don't you dare believe that because I support Israel's right to exist I don't support free speech against it. But to be fair, the US has also given foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority for many years. https://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000592

"You're worse than the people that label BDS as a hate group based on the actions of a small percentage if it's supporters." Seriously? How so? This a hyperbolic false moral equivalence. But since you bring up BLM, I must point out that in the last year, BDS has turned itself into a progressive purity test on issues spanning from LGBTQ rights (turning away Jewish women who showed up to the Chicago Dyke March for not unequivocally rejecting the legitimacy Israel), to women's rights (Linda Sarsour's declaration that Zionists can't be feminists), to BLM itself (inserting anti-Israel language into their their charter). Why can't one support all of these movements separately? Why does progressivism need to be all or nothing? It is an ad populum fallacy to lump Israel with all other progressive movements. Also, BLM falsely claimed that US law enforcement get training in Israel to learn methods of brutality and oppression. Police brutality is a problem, but that claim is beyond ridiculous and another set of logical fallacies: begging the claim and another ad populum. That story was also blatant propaganda.

I tried to be polite in my response. I know Israel is an emotional issue, but we can have a decent dialogue about the merits of the issue without making blind assumptions about each other.

May I suggest watching the movie "The Borrowed Identity"? It may still be available on Netflix, but I haven't watched it in a while. It's a true story from the perspective of a Palestinian boy growing up in the late 80s/early 90s. It's pretty enlightening for anyone who cares about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict regardless of which side they are on.No, it's valid to debate the legality. But MSM was debating the content and the impact on the public before it came out, although given GOP rhetoric it would be fair to take a guess. That's what I was referring to, not the legal repercussions.Fair enough. I'll admit that I didn't actually read the link and assumed this was just a general thread about the memo. Pretty big mistake on my part, and I'm sorry to have caused the confusion.The end of Overtime last night was so on point, too 😂How is it that The Simpsons predicted so much of what is happening in politics the last few years so long ago??? They literally predicted Trump's election!I disagree with the headline. Trump would not have the same response to statement resignations like Director Wray's would be. He will just shrug it off, smear Wray on Twitter, and look for someone more loyal to replace him. It's a tough situation, but I think it would be dangerous for Wray to resign in protest.It won't affect him with his 35% base, and they may actually like it, and since the House Republicans directly caused this mess, it's clear they don't want to be a check on Trump. It would have minimal meaningful impact. All it would do is reinforce everyone's opinion on the Trump-Russia/obstruction of justice controversy regardless of what that opinion is. If would be the same if Trump dismissed Wray.Would I be correct to guess that your dad is a Trump fan?

First, let me say that if the last 2 and a half years have shown that no amount of facts will convince a committed Trumpist on a matter like this. But here are a few ideas:

Bring up the transcript of the Glenn Simpson Senate testimony released by Senator Feinstein a few weeks ago. It outlines the reason Steele brought wrote the dossier and tipped the FBI in the first place. It also revealed that the FBI had already received corroborating Australian intel telling the same story, meaning that the dossier was not the ultimate trigger for the investigation. Additionally, it shows that Steele was concerned that Trump was a victim of Russian blackmail rather than a co-conspirator in the matter.

On Peter Stzrok, I would bring up that this week's reporting revealed that he was one of the FBI agents who triggered the reopening of the Clinton email investigation 10 days before the election, which IMO was a pretty big factor that ultimately threw the election to Trump in the first place. https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/31/politics/strzok-fbi-comey-clinton-letter/index.html

On the memo itself, remind him that Nunes is not a reliable arbiter of truth in the matter and point to his involvement on the transition team and the White House visits in March of last year in which he had supposedly gone to the WH to bring Trump info on the investigation but it turned out that the info came FROM the WH. (I think the late night comedians the best job of explaining that one because it was pretty comically ridiculous: https://youtu.be/L6tVjqfIXFY https://youtu.be/xdjrK0h1sZw). Also, point to other news this week that he admits to not having read the FISA applications before writing/releasing the memo. http://thehill.com/homenews/house/372119-nunes-admits-he-did-not-view-the-surveillance-warrant-applications-that-form

Finally, though this may already be covered, mention that Carter Page had been in the FBI's crosshairs over concerning Russian connections since 2013. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/02/02/how-important-is-carter-page-to-the-russia-investigation/?utm_term=.dc805fd28166

If your dad is committed to his beliefs, then it may just be a waste of time. But if you want more facts to prove your points, try using these. Hopefully these were helpful :)No problem 😉I forgot one point. Bring up Fusion GPS's history of conducting opposition research in US political campaigns, including for Republicans Ted Cruz and Bob Corker (https://washingtonpost.com/investigations/journalism-for-rent-inside-the-secretive-firm-behind-the-trump-dossier/2017/12/11/8d5428d4-bd89-11e7-af84-d3e2ee4b2af1_story.html) and that the funding of the opposition research on Trump for the presidential election by FGPS was initiated by the Free Beacon, a conservative website that had endorsed Marco Rubio, in 2015 (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-dossier-paul-singer.html).Good catch on the correct extra details.Fair enough, but it's the ones they happen to get right are kind of freaky.My cousin is so disappointed that the tweet was deleted, he's sarcastically calling for a new constitutional amendment. Says "This isn’t about the tax cut. It’s about being deprived of my 28th amendment rights to being entertained on Twitter."That's a pretty entertaining suggestion 😅How about "Yo memo so influenced its release gave Putin an orgasm"?They definitely stole the show for a few moments there.Who decided that there is a game or who noticed that there is a game and decided that it is worth playing?I haven't seen any bad tyt reporting.  They start with facts and offer opinions and I can't recall any wildly bad opinions.  Can you point me to a link of  a bad story they covered?The issue isn't criticizing crazy/stupid people on the left.  The issue is when you go full retard and spend 100% of your time focused on what is essentially a few hundred morons, instead of focusing on real issues, like how unregulated untaxed capitalism is destroying the USA and ruining the lives of 100s of millions of people.Just some standard russian propaganda. Stop listening to russian propaganda media.

It is not actually unfair to place little bit of troops in Baltic states, not even with the twisted notion of fairness that Putin spreads.

Fairness is meaningful only if there are 2 or more teams and a game. Before we can talk fairness properly, we need to know why there are teams and a game.
It is us vs them though.  Why is Us vs them bad? They have diametrically opposed whims in terms of policy wishes. How can it be any other way? Looked to me like TYT has the best handle on the refugee crisis.more: 

With trade, it is easy to understand why there are "teams" and a "game", but not with armies of Europe. 

Also it is strange that some ways Saudi-Arabia is considered closer to USA than Russia. 2 words: skirts and atheism

they cause less trouble when they are in front lines instead of streets

they are not going to kill jews with anti-tank missilesThe difference is that right wing economic policies are destroying the lives of millions of people.

The number of people affected by parents trying to get their baby gender reassignment surgery can be counted on about 1 hand.

The number of anti free speech lunatics, left and right, number in the low thousands at most.

My point isn't to be "partisan".  I simply think the amount of time and effort should be relative to the size of the problem.

Economics affects hundreds of millions of people in the US alone.  Gender pronouns and trans bathroom policies affect 0.001% of the population.

Seems to me that the right wing ideologues are making mountains out of mole hills because they know they're on the losing side of the real arguments that matter.My example of economics is real right now.  An asteroid is hypothetical and may never happen.

My point has been pretty clear.  Get the wax out of your eyes and read what I said.  Ideologues like Ben Shitpiro use a nonexistent issue of an "Anti free speech SJW" threat as smoke screen to distract from real issues.  Ben just a couple days ago literally said on his show "The economy is doing GREAT!" Then quickly shifted to a rant on how free speech is under attack. Ya, 50% of the US lives at or near the poverty line and wages have been essentially flatlined for 40 year, but don't look over there at that inconvienient truth, look over at that 1 crazy lady with blue hair who wants to fine you for not using gender pronouns!  That's "THE LEFT" and that's the "real problem".

It's typical charlatan dishonesty at it's worst.

You claim the number of anti-free speech types are growing, yet poll after poll shows that it's actually a fringe minority that doesn't even register a blip on the radar. This is why even some left content creators like TJ Kirk started focusing on SJWs and anti-free speech.  Because it's easy money.

Every single person on the planet, left, right and center are pro-free speech.  The handful of loonies that don't are fun to pick on, and they're picked on by everyone regardless of political leanings.

It gets more clicks, likes and shares by everyone.  It's simply a business decision in his case.

But right wing ideologues like Ben Shitpiro, Stephen Crowder, Sean Hannity, and their ilk are clearly using it as cover to paint "The Left" as enemies of freedom and smoke screen for bad right wing policies. &gt; Asteroids whiz past the Earth literally every day.  

The chance of an asteroid hitting the earth and doing major damage is infinitely low (Once every few billion years?) and I never said you can't or shouldn't talk about it.  But it's not a core issue and shouldn't be the primary topic of discussion, non-stop, for years.  Everyone agrees Asteroids heading to earth should be dealt with.  Everyone agrees free speech is good. Why do you idiots feel the need to spam discussions on shit that's already settled and agreed upon by 99.9999999% of the fucking population?


&gt; I like how you added "shit" to Shapiro's name.

A fitting name for a shitty person.

&gt; I love how you guys always emphasize "it's just a fine". Yeah, what happens if you don't pay that fine? At a certain point, the government will have to be willing to kill you...for not using the right pronouns.

The point, which flew over your head again, is that it's a non-issue.  How many people are claiming non-binary status? And how many of them would actually want legal action for someone not using the right pronoun? Like, 20? Cool story.  Again, we all agree. Mentally unstable SJWs with ridiculous pronoun requests who want legal action against ass holes who don't address them as they want to be addressed are fringe idiots we all, left right and center, agree shouldn't be taken seriously. Move on now.


&gt; That is not even remotely true and you know it. Go draw an offensive image of Mohammad and post it on Twitter with your name, face and address if you're so confident.

I love how you have to reach out to the "Go see what the middle east thinks of X Y Z topic".  I don't care about the middle east religious justice warrior stances are.  We're talking in the west right now. Ya, great, Afghanistan is a backwater shithole and their population holds insane RJW beliefs.  So what?  What does that have to do with American politics? Ben Shitpiro and his ilk aren't getting in front of a camera and discussing free speech in Afghanistan.  They're talking about the USA.  They're pretending like our country is under siege against "The left" (the fake straw man left) that wants to destroy free speech and civilation as we know it.

But as I said, when you look at the west, everyone is in agreement. Free speech good.  We settled the issue about 242 years ago. Move on.

&gt; It's another story when it comes to defending the right of people to express so-called "hate speech". And it doesn't matter if it's a "handful of loonies", because it always seems these loonies get into positions of power and nobody - least of all people on the left - calls them out about it.

You need to leave your bubble. Literally every single popular left commentator criticizes anti-free speech loons.  We just don't focus on non-issues for years on end like you edge lords do.

&gt; Once again, no, they're not. Charlie Hebdo gets shot up, and left-wing publications stop short of saying they deserved it because they published "racist cartoons". The left has a serious problem of not actually defending free speech when it counts.

Once again, you're stuck in your little bubble.  People's point was that the incendiary cartoons were responsible for why they were targeted.  No one excused the killings as justified and everyone defended their free speech.  Pointing out the undeniable fact that provoking violent extremists is poor risk management is a reasonable thing to point out.  Going to a GOP rally with anti-Trump sign is a quick way to get punched or shot by an angry white guy.  Do I think the person should be able to protest a Trump rally? Ya absolutely.  Do I think the person is clearly taking a risk of getting hurt by doing so?  Ya, I do.  The right hates free speech and secular values.  It's not anti-free speech to suggest it's probably a bad idea to go stand in a crowd of 1000 Trump supports with anti-right wing picket signs.


&gt; You're so astonishingly wrong.

No, I'm actually 100% right.

&gt; I think all those guys are scum, but they're not wrong. You're just being too tribalistic. You don't even want to admit that the left has problems worth addressing. 

As I said, the left does address it.  The left is far more in favor of free speech than the fucking right.  You may not be old enough to remember, but I grew up with right wing religious justice warriors constantly trying to destroy free speech.  If the millions of them, backed by billions of dollars and thousands of high end platforms were unable to get rid of free speech, 20 or 30 pink haired triggly-puffs on a college campus isn't even note-worthy.

&gt; Jesus Christ. This is why I said I wasn't going to get into political arguments anymore. 

I agree you're not very good at this and you're clearly too drunk on the kool-aid to have a reasonable and thoughtful discussion on this topic, or basically any political topic for that matter.  I'd love to continue this conversation, but you don't really seem to have anything to add that the right wing shills haven't said for years on end and you've said nothing that the left doesn't agree with nor do they, the left, have a problem addressing the few SJW or RJW crazies.  You might be a victim of facebook algorithms or something.  Maybe try changing your google and youtube search patterns up a bit so you're not so reinforced into this nonsensical mindset.
So in short, you didn't like something that this guy said at some point in the past, and so you're sitting here commenting on this situation that you didn't look into at all and passing judgment. 

One person here is in desperation mode. Get a grip.That was the saddest attempt at a comeback I've seen in a while. The cherry on top being the tired, sad move to try to paint the person you're arguing with as being feeling-hurt as if it would prove anything even if it is true. What is true though, is that you came in here with buckets of asshurt and spilled them all over the place, revealing in the process that you have nothing to say about the actual topic, but just saw the name of a guy whose words mad you really made once and decided to chime in. 

For the record I don't listen to either of these people. Just to bring your entire fantasy full circle. Now find your own closing line for your next flaccid rebuttal please. Thanks for the link. The guy is a despicable asshole. It worries me that the era of Trump is making public discussion about anything extremely toxic. Trump is having a cancerous effect on liberal democracies &amp; you have assholes like Peterson &amp; Dave Rubin taking every advantage of this &amp; riding on this white rage / grievance train. Its thoroughly disgusting!Wow I don’t know what people are so upset about. She’s just a classical liberal!! 😝I don’t care about Rogan mate! I think Rogan is a dumb douchebag, a laid back stoner frat boy but can’t deny that he’s got a massive platform &amp; that having Pakman on would show the progressive community in a great light!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyP8JG9iJdc&amp;list=UUvixJtaXuNdMPUGdOPcY8AgAgain, the point being that it's a fringe, microscopic minority that's anti-free speech.  Yes you can look at ass backwards countries in the middle east that are horrible in many ways, including free speech, but when it comes to what concerns us in our western society, the US, England, Germany, Canada, France, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, etc, we're all on board. Free speech is good. 99.9999% of everyone agrees.

The focus on a handful of SJWs and anti-free speech lunatics by the right and alt right are an attempt to deflect from debating real issues they know they can't win on and content creators who focus on this non-issue are doing it because it's easy money, specifically because it has wide universal agreement from all sides of the political spectrum.You're becoming quite unhinged here.  Hate speech laws aren't in conflict with free speech. And as I said from the start, when a problem does arise, it's from a tiny fringe minority, or a single one-off case here or there.

It's not like there's hundreds of thousands of people being thrown in jail or fined for "using the wrong pronoun". You're focusing on a non-issue because it's easy.I'll also say for the Scotland man who's on trial, you're exactly right, on trial.  On trial doesn't mean he committed a crime.  He's on trial to see if he did. If it was just an honest joke and his intention wasn't bad, he'll be let go.  If he's an actual Nazi and the dog video just exposed who he really is, then he'll go to jail.

You seem to think hate speech laws prevent free speech.  That's far from the truth.Enjoy your crusade against the non-issue, kid. I'm just glad that with every post you make, you get more down votes.Got to disagree.


As a foreigner I and many others see it like this: Trump lost the popular vote of all the people that voted and Trump won the US' electoral college therefore he is president. Nobody believes that third party voters were okay with Trump otherwise they would have voted for him and the same goes with the ~45ish percent of people who didn't vote.Quite unfortunate that no one here has decided to give substantial feedback on your post, so here goes..

First and foremost, I can understand temptation to determine your political allegiances solely based on the impact on your bank account, the government is in part tasked with precisely that (namely the distribution of wealth or resources) - However, I strongly recommend that you reconsider such an egocentric, and perhaps more importantly, self defeating approach to electoral politics. The world does not revolve around you. 

Consider for a moment that there are millions of lives being impacted by every single piece of legislation, every word or action that flow from the executive, legislative and judicial branch. To ignore that is craven, cruel and uncompassionate. 

Though let us for a moment make examine the claim you posit; I will charge you with being arbitrary. 

No doubt, the Trump tax cuts have been designed to achieve exactly what you describe - carrot politics is a strategy meant to create some seemingly visible effect on peoples lives (and here for Republicans, specifically financial). Now I believe you'll freely admit that though the increase in your financial status would be significant, it is however fairly minor. 

Now how can you say for certain that the impact from a improving economy, strides made under Obama have not created the conditions whereby you now are able to have that raise? What is it about your particular company that they now see it fit to reward you at this present moment? What other factors could you imagine could be responsible for your "accelerated improvement" in your well being?

From my perspective, these things might very well be the result of arbitrary circumstances. 

Therefore, it would be enormously unwise for you to change your politics (that again, impacts so many lives) when in reality you cannot account for the reason why this is happening in any more scientific or accurate way than soothsayers would predict better crops and find correlation in the passing of a meteor on the sky. That is simply not how we determine right from wrong or constructive and unconstructive as far as politics is concerned. 

Is the Trump hate cosmetic? No, of course that is not the case. Look at the tax cuts that you celebrate. These are conceived to ensure more concentration of wealth and power in the hands of private corporations and peoples, including Donald Trump himself. How can you be so uncritical of that? If you believe that these instruments of oppression are benign, I have to break it to you friend - you are not a member of the Left. 

I suggest you immerse yourself more in historical scholarship. Pick up any textbook that says something about economic and political history. You could read a more mainstream book like *"Out of Many: A History of the American People"* or *"A People's History of the United States"* by Howard Zinn. The latter is more rooted in Leftist tradition, and I assure you you'll get a greater sense of what these political developments could mean, not only for yourself, the people you care about and your children, but for the overwhelming state of your country and people. 

Reductions in taxes like the ones Trump and the Republicans are pushing through now will have a price down the road. The government will starve as deficits increase, Democrats will be forced to pay the bill as they usually do throughout the last decades (thereby opening them on to attack for being tax fanatics, this is a silly dance). Not to mention that the country will likely see increased political corruption as private power amasses further, while calls for entitlement cuts are imminent to balance the budget (they will affect you my friend) as it was always the plan and meanwhile, improvements in the economy are overshadowed by ineffectual government and superficial improvements in the economy that historically seem to only increase the risk of crisis (in all manner of ways).Let’s get corporations now.Let me be as clear and honest as I possibly can, you **Americans are fucked in the head**. The fact that you find ways of convincing yourself that arming TEACHERS is a good idea, is beyond fucked up - I swear it sounds like you are living in a post-apocalyptic world. 

"*Hehehe, today my math teacher turned around to write something on the chalkboard and I got a glimpse of his Glock 22 Gen4.*" Meanwhile the lunch lady is polishing her AR-15 in the break room.

You guys need help. This is as good a sign as anything that you've officially gone over the cliff. The years of decadence, successive mass delusion, paranoia and an epidemic of ignorance, culminating in the election of Trump, have certainly brought a swift decay. May your ultimate demise be benign to those around you. You had a good run.

Could there be worst attempt at argument. If that dismissing is based on honest actual opinion, it is normal part of conversation.

It is ok to dismiss or agree with opinion groups like christians.

Also, people, in her case especially men, should be cognizant that her beauty could be distracting them in a way that clouds their judgment.What authoritarian-left movements? 

I would also like to know how a "large portion of administration in academia" have caught the virus? What is your backing behind that claim, and how would you describe this virus you are referencing? 

Please do not reply; gender studies.Harris = The most punchable face in recorded history.Better than an ideologue? First, this is not about complicity. 

&gt; Are you under the impression that something as artificial as a party affiliation totally changes who you are as a person?

Party affiliation. No, and yes. People are people. Trump is malleable. There are a lot of cognitive biases you can attribute to Trump, but he is certainly vulnerable to bandwagoning. He has few principle positions and no rooting in ideology. You saw this most recently with the bipartisan gun legislation discussion, where he suggested that we should ignore due process to confiscate guns from people deemed dangerous to public safety. This is radical, even for Democrats. 

This might be one instance among many, where we are invited to revise our assessment about Donald Trump. He is too stupid to know where the parties stand and therefore susceptible to common sense, or more importantly; populism. I'm not sure how warranted it is to dismiss everything he says as purely a rhetorical tool used by strategists within his campaign or administration to seem progressive on some issues. 

More importantly, the consequence of this line of argument is something we've known for a long time now. Namely that the President is typically empowered with the ability to make stylistic changes in the realm of policy. Going back to Ronald Reagan, we saw the emergence of figureheads who were heavily controlled by people around him. The same is true for Trump I suspect - though Trump being so bombastic a personality regularly goes off the reservation. 

I believe we would do well to keep in mind that for all the havoc that Trump is causing publicly, this might inevitably be in the best interest of the Republicans. Trump can act as a distraction, and the sole target of public outcry - while at least some of them come away unscathed. Trump is quite racist, but he is not the source of the systematic racism we see in the policies coming from the White House now, nor the legislative branch. Again I think Trump could just has well have been swayed toward benevolence had he been surrounded (and controlled) by members of the opposite party. 

In consequence, Trump himself could have made a poor administration compared to someone like Obama, but not necessarily the worst president in terms of signing on to legislation that is controversial or has a high popularity among the people. Democrat Trump could very well have been more likely to push through Universal Healthcare compared to Hillary Clinton because of that ideological grounding.

I live close to Russia, and I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of both of Russia and NATO. I'll be happy to provide you with some counterpoints if you're interested."Bernie folks?" Do me a favor, go fuck yourself with a cactus. Here you are sitting here and making fun of peoples being conspiratorial and jumping to conclusion on flimsy bases, and in the same breath you're casting that thread of nutjobs as Bernie supporters. Based on comments such as ones that lament that Uranium 1 wasn't investigated enough, or who *fucking tell you that they voted for Trump*, they come off as Sanders supporters to you? 

Man, the bots really came across a fuckin ball of clay when you wandered by.Have another comment:

:Why? Simple. Because they can't stand the fact that both the AND right voted for Trump.

Once she stole the primary we worked our asses off to take the same enthusiastic that won Sanders the primary (minusing the illegal stolen votes) to work hard for Trump.:

Does that sound like a Sanders supporter to you? His name is lockherup2020. Does that not sound like a hardcore Trump supporter with verbal diarrhea, posing as someone who sort of gave a shit about Sanders?

"kool-aid vendors were either totally silent or pooh-pooh-ing Uranium One. U1 could turn out to be all above board but it sure as heck looks wayyyyy messier than anything Team Trump did in bed with Putin."

Yeah, Clinton is so much more corrupt than Trump. This guy sounds like an earnest Sanders supporter.

Don't assume. Part of the entire discussion we've been having about internet discourse as it relates to politics involves dishonest actors disseminating information (which I probably should have put in quotes) to give false impressions of political sentiment and sway the beliefs of the low-information reader who does not read critically. 

Is there a Sanders supporter out there this stupid? Sure, of course there are some. By and large though, this isn't just not representative of almost anyone who would call themselves a Sanders supporter, but is contrary to the way most of the staunch progressives who strongly supported him operate and think. To print this with a suggesting that "duhuh the Bernie Bros. are at it again" is playing into all kinds of hands, and isn't helpful at all.He doesn't really have the proper format for callers. Whenever people call in he usually seems hostile, and leaves little room for conversation or discussion even when the caller seems supportive.Trump only won by 70,000 votes.  Facebook, twitter and other social media reached hundreds of millions of users.  It's hard to deny that the Russia social media effort didn't push him over the line in the election.I'd say the majority have their minds made up.  But when you're talking 129 Million* votes, and the win was 70,000. That's only about .0005 of total votes cast.

Russia 100% won it for Trump. Shillary was a bad candidate and the DNC really messed themselves up, but without Russia helping, he would have lost, 100%.Looks like you're not good at math.If not more, obviously.What dogma? The dogma of basic facts and math?Literally zero intelligence officials agree with you. GGKim jong-un and any US president should not meet anywhere, not in China, not in Russia, not in Border between Koreas.

But they should communicate, except Trump, who should just delegate communication to others. Sometimes passivity is best.
The entire world has figured this out.  Why can't you?The fact that you think at least 0.0054% of voters weren''t swayed by targeted and repeated propaganda makes me think you're retarded.You're alone broski.  Nothing I said was wrong.https://i.redditmedia.com/Z7B8R3Eq4VV2-0poUaaV5pZqEtPdgHonX0eocJiicyk.png?w=498&amp;s=510455fe02ad0321a12eb6bbbb518dc7This sub is literally called TDPS, yet you'll see all manner of posts on it, don't you? Facts are facts bud.  I'm not sure why they upset you so much.

Propaganda surely doesn't affect 100% of everyone exposed to it but here are the facts.

-Russia performed a massive pro-Trump / anti-Shillary propaganda campaign.

-Propaganda does have a measurable effect on people's voting choices.

-The margin of Trump's win was razor thin, about 70,000 votes split between a few states.

Given the 100's of millions of people exposed to the propaganda, that we know propaganda campaigns do work and the razor thin margin of victory, there is only one conclusion that can be made from these facts.

Russia was the wild card that pushed Trump over the finish line.

Could Shillary still have won, given she actually pushed a better more progressive message and the DNC hadn't been caught shilling for her? Sure.

If Trump was a better candidate, could he have won by a larger margin, and therefor the Russian propaganda would have just been the difference between a win and a slightly larger win? Sure.

But all things considered, Trump wouldn't have won, given all other factors the same, without Russia's interference. The margin of victory was way too small.

If you disagree with anything said here, you're basically an idiot. And frankly, I'm not sure why any of this is surprising or offensive to you. These facts couldn't be any more mundane and indisputable.

Companies all around the world deploy commercials, on a faction of the budget, to a fraction of the audience, to obtain measurable gains in sales far larger than the margin Trump won by.  We have this shit down to a science.  Advertising for commercial products aren't a $500 billion dollar industry because it doesn't work. lol.Snoring mouthpieces are basically the only effective anti-snoring devices.  If your snoring is severe, you don't achieve REM sleep.  Without REM sleep, you're sorta sleeping, but you're not rejuvenating your mind and body when you sleep.  So you wake up tired, groggy, fatigued, etc.

The jogging scene probably just illustrating a good night sleep leading to a productive, energetic day.

Do these products work? From what I understand, aside from a CPAP machine or similar device, sleep mouth guards like this one, Zyppah, etc, all have high rate of effectiveness.

If you ask your dentist, they also make them custom to your mouth, but they all do the same thing.  They move your jaw forward to un-obstruct your airway and prevent sleep apnea and snoring noises.

Getting a sleep mouthguard was best thing I ever did.  You can immediately tell the difference when you wake up. I used to feel tired all the time.  I'd "sleep" for 8 - 10 hours, and wake up with a headache, and was always sleepy during the day.

With a sleeping mouthguard, I wake up after 6 - 7 hours feeling amazing.  It was a complete 180 for me.Disagreeing with basic facts makes you an idiot.  It's ok to have opinions on subjective things.  But nothing I said is an opinion.  You're disagreeing with reality because it upsets you for some reason.  That makes you an idiot.I'd be happier if you weren't being stupid.Why can't you just swallow your pathetic pride and admit you're wrong?  Would that kill you? A little humility and introspection goes a long way, kid. &gt;I felt bullied into silence, and still do, because I'm Jewish and identify as a Zionist, even though I am extremely vocal about my criticisms of Israel.

Why did you feel that way?

&gt;But as far as Weiss is concerned, I'm more inclined to believe an actual witness and contemporanious reporting of the events that took place over Glenn Greenwald.

What about witnesses whose account support Greenwald's claims? Do you not believe them? If so, why not?&gt;So virile anit-semitism spewed by professors is the same as college campuses shutting out conservative opinion?

Are you aware that an investigation was conducted and those professors were cleared of antisemitism? I'm afraid you seem to be doing what many who seek to silence critics of Israel's foreign policu vis a vis Gaza and The West Bank do: conflate Israel with Jews so that any criticism of Israel becomes criticism of Jews. 

It's a very regressive leftist tactic, if I may say so.4th_DocTB, you might want to take a look at mattrbchi's profile. He/she is a Zionist. That a post in a sub does not indicate that the person who typed it is completely aligned with the sub's intended audience... Anyone can go anywhere and post. 

Russian bots posted on Facebook. By the logic you employed here, you could have similarly said about the paid trolls: "That guy's not a paid Russian troll, his names is Calvin Jones. Look at it, it's right there!"Let me just say, before I respond, that I only read the TL;DR part. Therefore, I can and will only respond to its contents. 

I don't know what "pretzel-logic" is, but I fail to see how you or anyone could claim that Weiss "was fighting for her right to call out what she saw as hate-speech as well as to defend herself against accusations of racism as it has been tied to her Zionism". There is a record of Weiss’s opposition to tenure for Nadia Abu el-Haj and Joseph Massad, based on their views. She also protested Norman Finkelstein’s appearance at Columbia. Moreover, it has been suggested that Weiss helped to bring about the resignation of Dr. Lisa Anderson, the former dean of Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), from her job in 2008. Weiss accused Anderson of fostering anti-Semitism, kicking off a witch hunt, demanding an inquest into whether CU faculty were insufficiently pro-Israel and then criticizing the committee formed to investigate the matter as being insufficiently pro-Israel. When Anderson invited former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak at Columbia in September 2007, Weiss wrote in the Columbia Spectator at the time, urging students to hold Lisa Anderson “accountable” for the Ahmadinejad invitation:

&gt;**Shame on her, and shame on an administration that would have him speak were it not for “security reasons.” Columbians-students, faculty, administration, and staff-if you are serious about standing up against hate, you will hold Dean Anderson accountable for offering Ahmadinejad a podium.**

You say "She never tried to get anyone fired...". If this is true, how do you explain her call for Anderson to be "**held accountable**"?  

And how can you claim that Weiss was fighting for *her* right, when in fact she was the party on the offence in all these cases. She was the one attacking others. I have seen no evidence of her being on the defence vis-a-vis the CU controversy. An entire investigation was conducted into several individuals on account of charges made by her and others like her. It seems then - to me at least - that she was attacking the rights of others to hold a view on Israel that was different to hers. And I haven't seen any evidence of her being, as you claim, accused of racism by dint of her Zionism. If you can adduce such evidence, I would be grateful. 

&gt;You are more than welcome to disagree with me on this, but I empathize with Weiss because I feel that I have been fighting the same battle, albeit on a much smaller scale.

I do disagree with you on this. &gt;More like an Israeli fascist.

I don't agree with that assertion. "Multi-ethnic democracy"? And here I was thinking they were trying to create another ethnostate in the Middle East. Not everyone. Just fools like you who refuse to accept basic facts of reality.  You so far from what could be considered normal it's not even funny.&gt;What is wrong with being a Zionist? 

The same thing that is wrong with being any other type of nationalist, for that is what Zionism is. It's Jewish nationalism. Black nationalist. White nationalist. Kurdish nationalist. Arab nationalist. They're all posionous. And we will do better as a species without any of them.&gt;To compare Zionism with white nationalism only shows ingnorance.

No, it doesn't.&gt;Ok, i guess you beat me. I was overpowered by the supreme mind and logic of John Rawls.

Glad to be of service.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitic_canard#Accusations_of_controlling_the_media

Would you like to select another antisemitic trope? I'm sure it'll make the BDS supporters look better (Speaking as someone who remains supportive of BDS). Otherwise, *fuck off and have a nice day!* Who compiled this table? What was the methodology? And more importantly, what exactly is it supposed to prove? Also, why are you talking to me about BDS? I don't care about BDS? I don't support them - because I know next to nothing about them. &gt;Most Israeli's are non-Ashkenazi.(ancestors were not living in europe). There are no race laws in Israel and Judaism has no racial hierarchy. The richest Jew in Israel is non-white.

I don't see how this is relevant to the original claim that Zionism is Jewish nationalism. It just is. It is Jewish nationalism. And like all nationalism, it is poison. 

&gt;Let's get this straight, Arabs pioneered the African slave trade and still practice slavery with asian indentured servitude but you think non-white Jews are the problem.

Whoa! What gave you that idea - that I think non-White Jews are the problem? 

You know this doesn't work, by the way? This tried-and-tested tactic of accusing critics of Israel of anti-Semitism. It doesn't work - at least not on the internet. You can shout "anti-Semite" at every critic of Israel until you're blue in the face. It will neither change minds nor silence critics, in the same way shouting "racist" at critics of Islam no longer does the same. You're better of trying to have constructive dialogue than you are trying to smear your opponents as anti-Semites. 

Why is reality so hard for you to comprehend?  Tell me this, out of the hundreds of millions of people exposed to Russian propaganda on social media, how many people do you think were affected?  What percentage of voters?  Cite studies of the effectiveness of advertising / propaganda to support your numbers.

KK Thanks.Advertising does work.  That's why it's a multibillion dollar business.  You think you weren't swayed by the advertising to buy the apple, but you forgot about all the advertising you were exposed to suggesting you buy oranges.

We know 100's of millions of people were exposed to pro-trump, anti-shillary propaganda.

We know there are people who are die hard R or D or I voters. We do know that there are a large percentage of swing voters.  We know advertising / propaganda does work.

You can't say exactly how many were swayed. But we know some were.  How many? Can't say.  But all the was needed was 0.0054% to be swayed.

Can we safely assume that many, or more were swayed?  Absolutely we can.  Far less extensive, far less expensive advertising campaigns with far less reach are far more effective than that on the low end.

It's such an infinitesimally small number, we can say for certain that the Russian propaganda absolutely in the end made the difference of the win / loss.

As I stated before, if Shillary or Trump had been stronger candidates, we could conclude that the Russian meddling wouldn't have really changed the outcome.

But due to the razor edge win, it's 100% certain that it did.

I mean, for fuck's sake, CNN focus group Q and A's about the 2016 election had people on national TV regurgitating Russian linked, social media spam lies as the cited reason for their anti-Shillary vote. It had far more of an impact that you think it did.  Clearly.Okay, guys, here me out. Is it possible that Putin was being facetious? You know, trying to play to the idea that the idea of Russian interference in the 2016 Election is just a conspiracy theory akin to the Jews being behind everything. For example, "Oh, so you think the Russian rigged the elections? What else do you believe, chem trails? A one-world government? Jews control everything?" Something like that.

It's just, Putin is too intelligent to expose himself as an anti-semite, if indeed, he is one. Given all other factors were the same, no Russian propaganda social media campaign and we would have Hillary for a president instead of Trump.

If Trump had won by, 500,000 votes, it might have been debatable.  1 million or more? Probably wouldn't have mattered either way.

But 70,000? Give me a break.  There's no way it didn't swing the election.You miss the point entirely.  Try again.Who cares?In my opinion Africans should expropriate white property and expel them wholesale from the entire Continent under under pain of death. 

TIA motherfucker!Splendid! We'll have an armed rebellion, and God will decide who is worthy to own the land.You dumb motherfucker.Current Affairs does great work. I would encourage you all to take out a subscription. A digital annual subscription is only $40. David, you should invite Nathan J. Robinson on to the show. In thick French Canadian accent, "You are all moral-fags!"It's *Look who's Back*. And I watched it today. It has some really dark moments. Some really dark moments that are easily missed. It satirises how easy it is for demagogues to build a following. We like to think it is impossible for someone like Hitler to rise to power today. I think the movie challenges that notion in the best way possible.  David, you should interview Zizek!Zizek smashes him pretty well from the left. I agree with you mostly except for not subscribing to intersectionality. Peterson and his hipster followers totally misrepresent intersectionality in the same way the regressive left does: they think that it means identity-based biases are additive. That is, Black woman is doubly oppressed because she is black and a woman. 

That’s not what intersectionality was developed as by sociologists. It merely means that a black woman must deal with certain biases because she is black and because she is a woman, and these have interactive effects. This is tabloid garbage! We shouldn't care about this! This is apolitical! And yet it has 33 and counting up-votes! Do you know the kind of people who care about shit like this, Fox News and their viewers. We should be above this. Per the article:

&gt;The Philippines government has responded to the International Criminal Court’s probe into its state-sanctioned killings in the country’s ‘war on drugs’ by announcing its withdrawal from the court. It is the latest country to test the court’s authority with a threatened pullout. In 2016 Russia withdrew after a file was opened on its annexation of Crimea, and later the same year the court’s apparent focus on African indictees prompted three to announce their intention to withdraw. 

I didn't even know Russia had withdrawn from the Hague. It wasn’t a hack job. Lazy, perhaps, but it was solid in its logic and analysis, imo. I’d love to hear why it was a hack job.&gt; International courts are the dumbest things ever.

That's one view. 

&gt;but there are lots of countries that treat druggies even worse

Such as?

&gt;Maybe the focus should be on them first rather than just deciding we don't like the style of a particular world leader.

Is there  reason why we can't do both - i.e. talk about countries that treat "druggies" worse than the Duterte regime and talk about the Duterte regime and its treatment of "druggies"? Let's use you as an example. I presume you're not just focused on a single issue at this moment in time. I only need to look at your reddit history to see that you talk about different issues. 

Also, I love how you trivialise the objection to Duterte by assuming we simply don't like Duterte's "style". It's not as if the objection to him is based his abuse of human rights or anything. It's that we don't like his style. If only he would wear a suit and tie and be a bit more soft-spoken.Ah, I guess I forgot. It was more of a takedown of the lib left, which I am with him 100%. I think that that quote you use it spot on. Peterson is fairly clear in his interviews that he sees the more unhinged LGBT and feminist identitarians as a (cultural)Marxist conspiracy. 

It’s hilarious because wtf does cultural Marxist even mean? Marxism never saw race or sex as class, and Marx himself discusses some of this in Capital Vol 1.&gt;Hahahahahahahahaha, what? Are you fucking serious?

Yeah, I'm going to have to agree with the sentiment expressed above. /u/granitehope2, are you serious? Do you know what a sophist is?&gt;Most Asian nations, including Singapore and Vietnam **which will sentence druggies to death**, and that' snot just vigilante justice, **that's their actual justice system**, which includes North Korea, which by the way needs a lot more attention than the Philippines of all of its human rights violations.

So, in these Asian nations, including Singapore and Vietnam, *there's at least a trial*. Unlike in The Philippines, where extra-judicial killings are meted out to drug users and dealers. Don't you get it? The fact that vigilante justice is state sanctioned in the Philippines is the problem! None of the human rights abuses of the countries you have mentioned excuse the human rights violations currently going on in the Philippines. 

&gt;North Korea, which by the way needs a lot more attention than the Philippines of all of its human rights violations.

Have you been living under a rock for the past thirty years? North Korea's human rights abuses gets a lot of media coverage. But I can understand why you think it doesn't. For you these things are mutually exclusive. We either cover North Korea's abuses or we cover The Philippines'. For some reason, we can't do both. 

&gt;I think if your focus is on human rights, you'd be a lot more focused on those committing human rights violations.

But...Duterte *is* committing human rights violations and he just recently withdrew the Philippines from the Hague. *That's* why my focus is currently on *him*. 

&gt;For example: There is a starvation genocide going on in Myanmar right now, which is killing far more people.

I just checked your reddit history. You haven't created a thread about the Myanmar crisis. Why haven't you posted a thread about the plight of the Rohingya seeing as you're currently so concerned about it? You could post a thread here on this sub-reddit. You could post about all those other countries violating human rights, Vietnam, Singapore etc. 

&gt;You guys think maybe focus on that some? You did say you can do both things at once. I'm interested in seeing that happen for a change.

Here's a thread posted on this subreddit about the Rohingya crisis: https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/6yejy3/aung_san_suu_kyi/

Here's a thread on this reddit about the crisis in Yemen: https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/81toyk/sanders_introduces_bill_to_end_catastrophic_us/

Here's a thread on this reddit about possible human right violations in South Africa: https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/82x68o/is_david_pakman_going_to_speak_up_about_the/

Perhaps, you should do a little digging and a little less presuming. I suspect, by the way, that your presumption is tinged with bad faith. I suspect you don't really care about the human rights abuses in all of the countries you have listed - Vietnam, Singapore, North Korea. I suspect your goal here is to simply muddy the waters and stop us raising any concerns of human rights abuses. You see, the corollary of your line of reasoning (a line of reasoning known as "whataboutism") is that if we can't talk about *every single instance* of human rights abuses out there all at once, we shouldn't talk about *any* of them. But like I said above, none of the human rights abuses in other countries, including the ones you mentioned, excuse the human rights violations currently going on in the Philippines. 


Here is a list of suggested videos produced by The David Pakman Show. These are more long form pieces, and therefore the result of more extensive research.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVrg5xLmCvhEW39MIHcEaQTe7HRlKmgxa

I recommend you watch most of them, though I would like to mention in case you are unaware, that most arguments or line of arguments do not require this strenuous standard of evidence that you suggest with peer reviewed evidence. Neither is that level of evidence always readily available or necessarily more convincing than one argument based on historical evidence say. 

I'll also caution you that an excessive use of or portrayal of scientificism might well be an indication that the person using that approach is either attempting to cover up deficiencies in other areas of his argumentation, or that it is employed as a rhetorical device to lure gullible people like you in. In this context, I believe you'll find the same technique with figures like Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson. Though remember that the "peer reviewed literature" could easily be cherrypicked, misrepresented or ultimately irrelevant. 

This much I grant you, I'm not necessarily fond of any political pundit on YouTube either, but to claim that someone like David Pakman, Kyle Kulinski or the Young Turks is equivalent to Steven Crowder is laughable. 

Lastly, I invite you to check out Democracy Now and The Majority Report with Sam Seder and Michael Brooks.The growth in the nation's wealth is due to technology, capital, and property. The various direct/indirect owners and managers, of this, the owning class, are naturally going to  benefit the most.

The solution is not trade protectionism and would be counterproductive.  The solution is raising taxes on the wealthy, the owning class, and unearned income and redistributing back to the middle and lower classes in social services and public works like healthcare, education, and  infrastructure spending.

I think the lower class(and I am technically one of them) does have it better now then before thanks in part to expanded Medicare/Obamace, plunging unemployment, and lower crime and births rates among the poor .  I think the middle class has it a little better now as well but is hampered due to the relatively rapid rise in costs for middle class healthcare, college education, and luxury spending.  People treat yesterdays luxuries as tomorrow's necessities.

I think it could certainly be better and I look to the social democratic Scandinavian nations as practical real world redistribution ideals.

That's my two cents.&gt;Oh right! There's a trial! Imagine using that in any other context.

&gt;"We burn people alive inside of a brazen bull, burn them at the stake and we lob their heads off if they commit a jaywalking offense. Oh, but we have a trial before we do any of that! never mind our gross human rights violations. We try them first!"

Ah, but you see, your criticism in the example above is not of the existence of a trial. It's of the punishment imposed on the defendant if he or she is found guilty - i.e. your is with what happens *after* the trial - not the trial itself. You even admit as much, without realising:

&gt;Oh, but we have a trial before we do any of that!

Now, we can scrutinise the judicial process. We can question the independence of the judiciary; the jury selection process; the quality of the defence attorney; the burden of proof; and the standard of evidence. But you haven't done any of that. Your quote does none of that.

Also, you say "We burn people alive inside of a brazen bull, burn them at the stake and we lob their heads off if they commit a jaywalking offense. Oh, but we have a trial before we do any of that! never mind our gross human rights violations. We try them first!" Would you prefer a situation in which a trial was skipped entirely? A situation like this:

&gt;"We burn people alive inside of a brazen bull, burn them at the stake and we lob their heads off if they commit a jaywalking offense, and we don't even have a trial before we do any of that! We don't even try them first!"

That's the current situation in the Philippines vis-a-vis drug offenders. 

&gt;I'm glad that you bring up stuff from 30 years ago, shows us how much better off we were under that kind of thinking. Today? They praise North Korea because Kim Jung Fat's sister went to the Winter Olympics.

"30 years ago"? Is [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/30/the-incredible-story-of-the-north-korean-escapee-at-the-state-of-the-union/?utm_term=.7e6628b84fc7) thirty years go? Is [this](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/02/16/life-in-north-korea-horror-why-are-so-hesitant-to-tell-massive-olympic-audience-about-this-reality.html)? Is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrS0uNBuG9c]? What about [this](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/13/asia/north-korea-un-human-rights-council/index.html)? Or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ0t7VNhMPQ)?

"Thirty years ago"? At least put some effort into your attempts to be dishonest.

&gt;Today? They praise North Korea because Kim Jung Fat's sister went to the Winter Olympics.

Who's "they" and when did "they" praise North Korea because of Kim Jong Un's sister? 

&gt;I'd like to see where the MSM has been covering it recently, as in since the RNC nomination of Donald Trump.

Refer to my links above.

&gt;I just did post about it lol, so I don't know why you're showing fake outrage over something I've already done. In my comments, I constantly talk about the Rohingya.

Where and when did you post about it? Can you provide me a link? I just looked through your reddit commenting history and the word "Rohingya" only appears twice throughout your entire reddit history, and one of them is where you are quoting me. The word "Myanmar" only appears once. Both words did not feature in your reddit history until today!

Did you just lie?

&gt;My goal is this: We have a few thousand people dead in The Philippines over a dumb policy. For a dictator, that is puny. Even moderate genocidal maniacs like Fidel Castro would laugh at that small number of deaths. We have a lot worse to worry about in the world than a few thousand dead, most of which aren't even due to the government's direct efforts.

Yeah, this is called "whataboutism". The fact that Duterte's human rights violations have only resulted in the deaths of a few thousand or that a fewer have died as a result compared to the human rights violations of others is not actually a reason not to talk about them, especially when they are brought to your attention. &gt;I have checked out MR and have even called into their show. 

When did you call into the show? You’re Global Warming Skeptic! *The* Global Warming Skeptic. It all suddenly makes sense. I wish I has known sooner. I wouldn't have wasted the time I already have on you. You have a reputation for dishonesty.  

Now that I know who you are, I feel no obligation to respond to you. Good bye.Seriously, guys. $40 - a year's digital subscription to Current Affairs. Help them keep doing what they're doing. &gt;Stupid person's idea of a smart person.

I think Nathan J Robinson put it better:

&gt;Desperate person's idea of a smart person.&gt;Can you tell me a little more about what kind of mag it is? Besides takedowns of Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson, what kind of content could I expect from it? What sort of political/ideological slant would you say it has?

It's a left wing magazine. It's very progressive. It's pro socialism - as a principle, not as an economic model. 

If you subscribe to it, you can expect economic critiques, critiques of mainstream journalists, politicians, intellectuals. This same writer, Nathan J Robinson wrote a fantastic critique of Steven Pinker's new book. [Here's](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/02/why-equality-is-indispensable) a link to it. 

They don't just limit their analysis or criticisms to the right or centre of the spectrum, but also the left. 

It's also very humourous.

I will warn you, the articles tend to be long. But, if you're willing to take my word for it, I'd say they are worth it. 

No problem. By all means, don't commit to anything. Keep an eye on their website. They don't hide their articles behind a paywall. Their content is available to the public. But, if you like their stuff and you'd like to support them, please consider taking out a subscription. :)&gt; There is a fundamental difference between being critical and critically thinking, and I think that is the fundamental difference between Nathan J Robinson (critic) and Jordan B Peterson (critical thinker).

This isn't really an argument. It's just an opinion, isn't it? It is my opinion that Nathan J Robinson is the critical thinker and Peterson a pseudo-intellectual. 

&gt;Being critical is akin to ranting, complaining, or simply undermining the works of someone else. Being critical for the criticisms sake is typically fuelled by emotion, often anger onset by jealousy.

Robinson is not being critical for the criticism's sake. He says as much in the article. 

&gt;By contrast, critically thinking means that one is capable of obectively analyzing a topic in a fair and reasonable manner. The purpose of critical thinking is to identify the underlying truths, observe the non-truths by means of fair evaluation, and then offer constructive criticisms to the individual in question.

Robinson did all that.

&gt;N.J.Robinson seems to employ the prior: being critical for criticisms sake. His criticisms aim to undermine the works of Dr. Peterson, without offering much of anything in the way of constructive criticism.

Could you give us an example of Robinson being critical, as *you* define it? And could give us an example of what constructive criticism of Peterson's work should look like?You mention the auto industry.  Trump is try to put tariffs on steel to protect steel creating jobs.   But it will raise the price of steel and hurt workers in industries who buy and use steal like the auto industry.  Consumers of all steal products will also be hurt.

The vacuum is not sucking everyone dry.  Free trade moves money/income from the specific moderately skilled middle class workers to the poor/working poor in America and abroad.  There are certainly winners and losers but the wins out weight the losses.  It also moves more money to the owning class and the wealthy which is why higher taxes on the wealthy and on unearned income is necessary.

It's not going to protect old jobs. I don't generally believe in protectionism.  Protectionism protect very specific American workers but broadly hurts other American workers, consumers, and investors.  Protectionism can also lead to trade wars possibly real wars and isolationism.  International trade also brings millions of people out of life threatening poverty every year and gives more geniuses at birth a chance to survive childhood and contribute to humanity.

Other countries buy and invest in American stuff, hardware, software, assets, property, intellectual property, etc.  As they get more productive they buy more stuff.  We save money buying things from them that they make more cheaply and then we can spend this saved money on more stuff both domestic and foreign.  The lower class, followed by the middle class, spend the highest percentage of their resources and the rich save long-term the most.  The rich also are more likely to spend and move money outside of America.  Spending is good for both the domestic and world economy while saving long-term is not as economically useful.

Other nations will continue free trade for the same reasons we and continue free trade.  It good for the overall economy.

There are more jobs and better jobs in American then ever before and the unemployed rate is near record lows.  Average wages are keeping up with or beating inflation.  Minimum wage laws do need raising. People spend more of their income on luxuries then previously and have a higher standard of living.   Unless one has been hit with a healthcare disaster or another kind of disaster there is really no excuse for a healthy person to slide from middle class to total impoverishment in America.

Government should provide training and education for displaced workers and they should get new jobs.  Anti-poverty and other social programs make participation in prostitution and crime unnecessary to survive.   If people choose prostitution to pay for luxuries then I have no problem with that as that is their choice.
Getting a job is easier then it has ever been.  People's feeling and opinions are not necessarily truth.  The middle class feels poorer because they spend more money on luxuries, are more financially irresponsible, more unhealthy then previous generations, and are more spoiled then the rest of the world/previous American generations. We are also more exposed to the lifestyles of the rich are envious and more tempted to be irresponsible.  Poor/middle class  American immigrants have a more optimistic outlook then regular Americans because they are not spoiled.That makes it okay then.You could consider a armed or peaceful revolution?Not as well-read as he thinks he is.Alright, you've got me! I'll settle for some Fukuyama beats!Could you refer to him by his full name please? "Andy Race Warski"!I agree American income inequality on the whole is up.  But that is because income for the rich/owning class(mostly unearned income) is accelerating faster then the poor/middle/working classes.  It is not because the poor/middle/working class have less resources available to them.

The difference in American income between minorities and whites are down as well as between the sexes.  The difference between incomes in the US/the first world and the developing world is down.  Life threatening poverty and abject poverty rates world wide is way way down.

Real GDP looks up to me!  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1

"The goal is to have a system that works for everybody"
Assuming you mean equally of opportunity and not equality of outcomes then I agree.  Again I think that redistribution and social programs is the best and maybe only way to do this.

"But it's not benefiting poor and middle class Americans. That is a statistical fact. It is not benefiting America as a whole."
It(free trade un-beneficial to the whole of America) is not a fact. I, the other commenter here, and most economists disagree with you.

"Trade should be for the benefit of THIS country. We trade to benefit ourselves, just as every other nation trades to benefit themselves."
You do realize I and free traders are arguing that protectionism is counterproductive for this country.

"they're essentially working for next to nothing"
No.  Their standard of living is going up and their poverty rates are going down so obviously they are relatively well paid compared to their income otherwise.  Their incomes are rising.

"That's not what I call an improvement over how things were prior to the 1970s. We were blowing out inflation in terms of wage increases. Poverty was decreasing. People were getting a piece of the pie because we were producers as well as consumers."
The post WWII economic boom is what you are talking about and it was is not sustainable for the most industrialized and advanced nation.  The rest of the world, particularly the developing world, is catching up now.    And those jobs sucked. Working in low skilled low tech factories, farming and mining, physical labor, all that sucks.   Most first world millennial's and post millennials don't want to do that.  they rather work at Walmart or if they have any skills a better job.

For poverty rates OPM is flawed and an anchored SPM is more accurate.  American Poverty is going down.  This may be the biggest reason for our disagreement and possibly something you did not see before???  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27352076

"Try living in a large major city with welfare alone. Welfare, food stamps, and the other programs just barely are enough to make it in a run-down crime ridden neighborhood project"
I and my friends and associates grew up and still live and work in a very major metropolitan densely populated area of a city with mixed level of income throughout the city and burbs.  I had close friends who were food stamp poor.   Detroit is about the only city that I would say has gone the wrong direction but even that turned around after the recession. I had many friends with no fathers and terrible mothers.  My income has been very low for about a decade now and I get Obamacare.  Minority unemployment is way down.  It is much easier to get basic work and better work now especially for women and crime is way down.  Parenting is better but people still make poor spending decisions.The truely middle-middle class is shrinking primarily because the upper classes are rising.  This is another major reason for our disagreement I think.  The upper classes are rising twice as fast as the lower classes.  The rate of upper class growth is awesome.  This is really a great sign of things to come.  The lower classes also have it better, because of redistribution and technology, and have more luxuries then before.
http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/09/the-american-middle-class-is-losing-ground/


Getting an old fashion middle class jobs is probably harder especially in places like Detroit. But getting jobs in the new economy and upper class and lower class jobs is easier.  

You never heard the argument that millennial's are spoiled??? 

Look at the the luxuries that middle class pre-70's families had...  One car.  One relatively little family tv.  One family phone. Kids shared bedrooms and fought over bathrooms.  They ate at restaurant once a week.

Now middle class families eat out much more often.  Multiple cars, multiple TVs, multiple computer, smart phones for everyone, cable tv, and internet.  Kids have their own rooms and often don't have to fight over a bathroom much.  The square footage of middle class living space is up.   More clothes. More and nicer stuff.  Middle class kids don't get jobs as early or work as much as they used to.

Americans are all more unhealthy due to obesity and an aging population and that is causing more healthcare/insurance spending.  Upper class people can usually easily absorb these costs and the lower classes have social services to help.  The middle class is has the hardest time with this.  Ideally America would have complete socialized healthcare like the rest of the 1st world and this would largely solve this particular spending issue for the middle class.

I am not going to get data for some of these things because I think it is self evident.  If you have data or an argument to refute those claims then I would love to see that and I could change my mind.
What choice did they have? From what I know about Russian history, the people don't like democracy. They like strong men - The Tsars, Lenin, Stalin, Putin. Some peoples are just like that. You can't impose liberalism and democracy on a people. I won’t be surprised if he runs for president in 2022 Gary’s stupid but at least he’s said something sane and ideological I wouldn’t mind kamala, she’s a progressive democrat who used to be a New Democrat, I just think she’s gonna become another Obama, underdeliver, shift to the right by the end of her presidency. She has a lack of experience in Washington so she’ll have to be reliant on her VP  a lot. Sanders and warren is just a pipe dream Nice to see supporters of aristocracy out and about.I’m sure it was sarcasm anyway.. and plus anyway US citizens can run for president as long as they are at least 35 years old and have been resident in the us for 14 years Any up to date evidence and not historical I.e in this century preferable and maybe the 1990’s. Both can be used interchangeably excluded the presence of formal noble titles. Those with extreme wealth who now largely dominate society through their financial and political influence might as well be characterized as the modern aristocracy in my view, at least from a historical perspective the comparison makes sense.

Obviously my comment was tongue in cheek, and I'm not attacking your arguments necessarily. But I really do believe it is instructive to historicize these arguments we hear that are supportive of wealth or political stratification. What separates the wealthy modern elite and aristocrats from the 17th century France?

People used to subscribe to the similar concepts of entitlement or privilege vis-à-vis in aristocratic times also; that these wealthy nobleman had divine right, or somehow singularly qualified to rule. This line of thinking is essentially sadomasochistic. How different are these arguments from those that would claim that CEO's or the Bill Gates of the world somehow earned/deserved every single penny through the work that they've done and employment they provide? I for one do not subscribe to this idolized view of "job creators", if anything I think it underscores a creative deficiency that we need these individuals to make sure people have access to basic necessities or work. It's absurd and backward.Yeah we like 2.5 or even 1 percent average real GDP growth for fully developed nations if it is consistent which it is.  It is better then the rest of the fully developed world. Economists agree It is not possible for fully developed nations to average much better. Any positive real GDP is real growth.  

The industrialized and unionized rust belt had it the best so they got it the worst from automation and moving jobs to the south and to other countries.  Politicians across the board failed these communities but these communities were also stubborn and refused to change or move somewhere with better work like previous generations.  The rest of the country did better.

Those old people that had those jobs are biased and stubborn about their jobs and their lifestyles.  It is generational.  They are not the future the millennial's are and they don't want those jobs.  Besides automation replaced much more of those jobs then outsourcing/free trade.  Automation will replace tens of millions of transportation jobs soon as well.  Everyone who does that stuff has to find new jobs.  Those jobs are not coming back and any politicians who say's so is lying Trump style.  The idea that coal mining is coming back is retarded.

"The rate of upper class growth is neither a positive nor a negative. It is an indicator of an economy that works for them. I'm fine for an economy that works for them, so long as it works in some sense for everyone else."
It is a positive because there are more of them. An increasingly higher share of the population is upperclass.  The percentage of upper class compared to lower class is going up.  The percentage of upper class to middle class is going up.   In no way will a free capitalist economy ever work for people who are stubborn and refuse to get new jobs or to move or to learn new skills.

"It has nothing to do with anything in this country. It has to do with what we're giving to the outside"
No. Automation has removed more of those old world jobs then outsourcing/free trade.  What do suggest be done when automation removes most of the transportation jobs soon?

Healthcare...
"Wouldn't solve the spending issue, it'd just all go on taxes like it does in most European nations that do it."
Government run Medicare and Medicaid is more cost efficient than private American insurance.  Americans spend more for healthcare/insurance and are a lot less happy than any of our all of our counterparts.   

You want the government to pass laws specifically to protect old world low skilled good paying jobs for people with no college education and that is socialist.  The market is not going to pay low skilled non-college educated good money anymore.  Those jobs are never coming back primarily because automation is taking them.  People should learn new skills and get new jobs and move to new places for jobs like previous generations.  People should get educated and save and become members of the owning class if they want a lifetime of luxuries.


This has a little more specific numbers from that Pew measurement over time of the shrinking middle class that I think is key.  from 2011 to 2015 the lower class actually went down while the upper class continues to go up at an impressive rate.  It looks like both the middle and lower class will continue to go down while the upper class continue to grow.  The economy has been better 2015-current then it was 2011-2015 so this new post recession trend is likely accelerating

Here details the change in number of jobs for the classes  https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/Good-Jobs_Full_Final.pdf

I am most curious what you think should be done when automation removes tens of millions of transportation job soon.Not just stats I want any evidence that can be used to suggest that’ the republicans are racist or at least racially biased. Like for example national GOP scandals but evidence of racism or racial bias within the  Republican Party party platforms or nationalised campaigns which be the best concrete evidence in my opinion I was just giving my opinion that sanders and warren is a pipe dream. Nothing directed at you no need to get triggered lol.

Sanders and warren would be my wet dream but they’re both so old especially sanders, sanders probably won’t even run There is some sound evidence there, but how is voter id laws in anyway racist or racially biased. Sure it might be pointless as voter fraud is low.  This claim that racial minorities are disproportionately poor and don’t have ID is stupid. It’s not that hard to get ID . Even some states that ask for ID when turning out to vote even offer free ID.   Well I think you’ll find more racially ignorant conservatives  It’s just a pipe dream but every liberal or progressive would have a wet dream over it, sanders is too old to run, warren is a likely president or vp.  Did anyone expect Trump to not congratulate and suck up to his boss?Ya, Bernie is so OLD! We need to pass a law that no one over 70 is allowed to hold public office and remove anyone currently serving over 70.  Could we get that written up and passed asap? Thanks."He had his opportunity" is not a point.
*edit*
Nor is it completely true unless you count a stifled, sabotaged effort that his own party was against as a valid opportunity.What's with the caps. Are you supposed to be hurting me or something?

Back to my two points though:

* Yes, he failed the rigged chance he had. I'd hardly call that an opportunity.

* "He had his opportunity" is not a point. There is nothing static about this. Losing one election doesn't mean you cannot win the next.

Do you have a point then, or just shitty little attempts to get under my skin for having the temerity to point out that you have not made any kind of point?Why? To your last question. It seems that the main thing that could theoretically prevent him from having even more support than last time is this mentality you espoused, and that I have seen before and never understand.

What is even the underlying approach here? Is it strategic or something? If you were supportive of his agenda and his agenda hadn't changed or been matched by anyone else yet, why not continue to vote for the candidate with the goals that you most align with?I think trying to predict and strategize around what the electorate might do for the purposes of getting a D into an office is part of why the primary charade was allowed to play out the way it did. The single biggest bat in the arsenal of Clinton and her surrogates was this idea that it was strategically unsound to vote for him. Perhaps we should just focus on rallying behind candidates who cater to our goals rather than entangling ourselves in abstract bullshit that creates for more problems for us than it solves.

Mind you, this has nothing to do with humility. Show me a candidate who checks off all the same boxes that Sanders does. I'm not attached to the guy. He's got most of what I see as worthwhile goals in-mind and as part of his platform.Like Joe Biden?

Let a better candidate manifest before we write off the best one for being old."communist". Can you please show me what country during what time had workers in control of the means of production? Or are you confusing authoritarian dictatorships with socialism? You know, authoritarian, like capitalists.The only way Biden is a Bernie light is if you're judging them by their physical age and speaking volume. 

And sure, old is real. Someone Sanders's age is in the White House right now covered in McNugget sauce. Sanders has looked ancient for decades. Maybe the situation will be different in 2020, but right now I don't have reason to believe that he's at death's door or that his mind isn't sharp. As such, I'm going to treat the candidates on bases of their platforms, and not treat this like a college football draft.[relevant pakman interview classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8sMTmYNaKw)This post conclusively portrays your ignorance. I'll give you some advice, use what you have written here to learn more about history and political philosophy. Save and reread when you know more. I guarantee you'll be amazed how wrong and sanctimonious you are. That said, here is a small hint to get you started; You are conflating "the Left" with liberal Democrats. That's a good place to begin. Read something by New Left historians, or the international Left from Tariq Ali to Jeremy Scahill, Gore Vidal or Arundhati Roy.Clinton is more hawkish than Obama. There was cause for grave concern with regard to her approach toward Russia. I'm not a Trump supporter but I can understand the desire for detente after years of escalation in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere. Whether we agree or not, the corrupt motives of Exxon Tillerson was a surprisingly attractive prospect to some compared to increased sanctions and possible US intervention in Russian affairs. 

That said, the increasing presence of Dominionists, Neocons and people like Erik Prince is extremely dangerous. We are now at the mercy of the state infrastructure to keep these people in check. However, I'm not sold that foreign policy under Trump has thus far been any less or more aggressive than under Obama or a possible Clinton presidency. Perhaps.

Then again, Russia seemed very concerned about Hillary Clinton and her State Department attempting to remove Ukraine from their sphere of influence in the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. Eventually threatening to incorporate Ukraine into both NATO and the EU, while funneling in billions and billions to the newly formed government in Kiev. 

There is a reason why Russia was so engaged in the 2016/17 US Presidential election. Under no circumstance did Russia want someone so openly confrontational with Russia in the White House. Unless you believe someone like Jack Matlock; former US ambassador to the USSR, Lawrence Wilkerson; Dept. Chief of Staff under Colin Powell, or Stephen F. Cohen are somehow corrupted by Russian propaganda, I would seek out their analysis of the crisis in the previous years between the United States and Russia. 

Hillary Clinton has been at the center of escalation with the Putin regime. Looking at the dire consequences of the proxy war in Ukraine, in Iran and Syria, that could have well have become the next American foreign intervention under Obama. You have to recognize that there was a real threat of war between the US and Russia. In this regard, advocating for detente is quite reasonable, and in my opinion the default position for the Left.

Now again I'm speaking toward the credence of a specific perspective. I'm not passing any judgement on it right or wrong. These are hypotheticals after all since we never were able to see a Clinton presidency. Trump supporters have reason to hope that Trump would change the hardline approach to Russia.Yes. The era of the pajama boy is over. Communism or Socialism is now the cleanest, coolest kid on the block. 

Now for a more substantive reply; Conservatives have attempted for 5-6 years now to convert millennial men to either Libertarianism or Conservatism using reaction or outrage culture online as an example to generate more adherence. Anyone can get behind calling someone out for being irrational, though how that has somehow been reinvented as a natural gateway to Conservatism is certainly a stroke of genius as far as political strategy is concerned. 

Furthermore, you posit that regulating "free speech and morality" is all that the "Left" (by that I assume Liberals) does. I'll do you a favor and assume you are being hyperbolic, thereby not addressing what the concerns of the Left are generally speaking as it pertains to policy. However, when it comes to free speech - what are we actually dealing with here as Leftists? You are talking about people like Ann Coulter, Milo and so on, whose occupation is to spew lies, be offensive and push the boundaries of meaningful debate. Incidentally in such a way to establish a new center of discourse where blatantly bigoted framing, language or thought becomes somehow respectable opinion. This is not the case, and will never be the case as long as the Left is vibrant enough to call them out on it. 

The primary pushback as far as Leftists are concerned is toward the denigration of public discourse. That we have as a society regressed to such a point where we spend massive amounts of energy entertaining people that are simply ignorant and in the case of many, rather unintelligent. Personally I would prefer that we dispose of these people as hastily as possible with tools far more discriminate than simply protesting them, but that's just me - looking at the major debates that we are having now, I'm really struggling to understand how the Left or Liberals can be characterized as authoritarian because we find it vexing to have to literally concede ground on the most basic understandings we have of our surroundings, determined through consensus like climate change for example. 

Allow me to make an analogy of the situation we find ourselves in. There's a crowd of people, in the middle someone is on the ground having a heart attack, meanwhile some random stranger is attempting to administer CPR - though you quickly realize he has no idea what he's doing. You happen to be a doctor, so what do you do? The responsible thing. You push the stranger aside and take control of the situation to ensure that the person with the heart attack has a fighting chance. That's where we are heading right now. 

There is a responsible crowd of people, still moderately sane and committed to justice, peace and progress. I won't need to characterize the other side, but if this continues, at some point we won't be having any more "discussions" or conflicts in the realm of "free speech". We have been very respectful humoring them for this long, especially on more dire issues.

Political correctness, free speech and censorship - these are all tools that Conservatives use to gain ground for ideas that are backward, archaic and reactionary. There you are!I'm going to ask OP to articulate a point. I can guess a few points that are supposed to be suggested by the title of the thread paired with the article, but I'm going to need you chuckleheads to start speaking like human beings before I show you that same respect, as I've played this game once or twice before. When people let vague nonsense like this drop out from the side of their underwear and you confront what seem to be the most obvious suggestions with any kind of competence, they tend to tell you that you didn't understand what they *really* meant. 

So what is the suggestion? That "Bernie or busters" did not think that Trump was dangerous in regards to foreign policy? That they were wrong that Clinton's stance towards Russia (back when the public generally didn't have the vaguest idea of their active mechanisms that were aiming to disrupt our political system) was troubling? Is this about pundits or is this about anyone who refused to support Clinton after she put her entire surrogate force out in the world to stomp Sanders supporters into submission? Give me something concrete to work with here.Plenty, thanks.

""Bernie or busters" did not think that Trump was dangerous in regards to foreign policy?"

So this is your assertion, based on the common line of Clinton having a hawkish foreign policy.

The two are not mutually exclusive, and so the conclusion you reached is exactly without premise. If you have some examples of people expressing that they didn't think Trump was a foreign policy threat in that regard, I'm more than happy to examine them. My guess is that if you have any at all, they're incredibly few and far between, and hardly identifiable as a concept belonging exclusively to people who refused to vote in the general on the basis of the candidate they supported (Sanders) being perceived as having been cheated by his own party. 

What I did see Sanders supporters espousing in droves, whether they decided to vote for Clinton in the general or abstain in protest/pick a third-party candidate, was alarm about Donald Trump in every regard imaginable. There were some cynics I noted, mainly in the punditry world (a couple of the boneheads of which you've named), who felt that Trump would not be able to achieve anything that he expressed he would like to accomplish, which again, is hardly representative of anyone who found Clinton's rhetoric around the Syrian conflict in regards to Russia troubling.

"That they were wrong that Clinton's stance towards Russia (back when the public generally didn't have the vaguest idea of their active mechanisms that were aiming to disrupt our political system) was troubling?"

We'll just have to agree to disagree. Her freewheeling tough talk in regards to Russia's involvement in a conflict that most Americans have little interest in did, to me, suggest that  we could expect increased conflict in that region under Clinton. Trump being subjectively or objectively worse in that or any regard does not effect that assessment. Her shitty answers were still shitty answers, even if shittier ones appeared subsequently from other people. 

Just to be clear about where I'm coming from, I'm not suggesting that Sanders had all or even any of the right answers in this regard. I'm not suggesting that I know what the right answer is. The statement that you/I quoted, and that you verified as representative of your assessment is not one that changes in light of someone else's actions, as it's not a comparative analysis that you're challenging. 

"Why can't it be both?"

It's your assertion, it can be whatever you say it is. I was trying to establish some clarity, rather than start speaking to what I suspected you might mean only to be told "well I was talking about *these* people" afterward.

"Offering concessions to Sanders' supporters, such as moving on the minimum wage was stomping them into submission, was it?"

No, but characterizing them as basement-dwelling ignoramuses who knew little about politics and policy represented that. So did casting them as sexists, accusing them of hurting democratic goals by having the temerity to actually have a primary in an election, as being naive about the world for championing goals that have already been achieved elsewhere in the world. So was putting her surrogates out in every media outlet possible to declare superdelegate support for her before the primary even got into motion. There was plenty that her campaign actively engaged in that alienated any democratic voter that didn't support her in the primary. 

That was an adorable try though, to use that one concession (that she should have been in support of anyway) to characterize her disposition towards her base. Aside from the fact that it represented less of a compromise than it did a necessity in order for her to try to claim any kind of progressive credentials as belonging to her platform at all. It was calculated. It was just too little and too late for many people who she spent months insulting and dismissing up to that point.&gt; What is the conclusion that I have reached?

I said it directly before what you quoted... I'll print it again.

""Bernie or busters" did not think that Trump was dangerous in regards to foreign policy?"

Thinking Clinton is a danger doesn't preclude one from thinking Trump is a danger, is the point I made. 

&gt; In what regard?

To hawkish foreign policy... Is this supposed to be you flipping the script and acting, in return, as if I'm not giving you enough information to respond? It doesn't work as well when the information you're making a show of asking about is 1-2 sentences prior to the ones you're quoting. Just have the discussion, you're not cute.

&gt; In every regard? I guess it's my turn to ask for some examples of Sanders supporters espousing in droves alarm about Donald Trump in every regard imaginable.

This isn't a point. 

&gt; When did Hillary characterise Sanders supporters as "basement-dwelling ignoramuses who knew little about politics and policy represented that"?

&gt; Was she lying when she did that? And was that against rules?

Did I say she was lying or that it was against the rules? Or was that a bullet point in a number of items describing how Clinton alienated a healthy portion of the Democratic electorate? 

To speak to what you said anyway though, even if it was a deliberate misplacement of my argument: Is buying politicians against the rules? Since it's not, is it something you're ok with, and defend by saying "was that against the rules?" Somehow I'm thinking that you only become that obtuse when it's convenient for an argument you're posing.

&gt; Would you like more examples of concessions she made during the campaign?

Sure. Maybe there is a whole lot of news that I somehow missed. It would have to be an awful lot to get around the following:

&gt; Gasp! Really? It's almost as if she was doing politics!

No, it's exactly like she was doing pandering, and couldn't even muster more than the most halfhearted attempt that didn't convince anyone that she was trying to do the bare minimum to pick up the votes of those basement-dwellers that she spent nine months taking a giant, rhetorical crap on. Much like her charisma, it was hollow and rehearsed nonsense that didn't persuade almost anybody. Not even you, I'm sure, as you posit the idea that she became some sort of progressive lioness, and that just still wasn't good enough for the evil "Bernie Bros" *shudder*.

By the way: Google. Did you really not know any of that stuff I was referring to? Use the same basic tools I did instead of making a big show of acting like you have no idea what I'm talking about. I expect you to take as much time and effort to provide evidence for your assertions now.Oh brother, someone got their copy of Trolling for Dummies in the mail. Move on then, you have more failing at defending your shitty thread to do. For the record: I blame Hillary for you losing too.&gt; I'm sorry my refusal to read your screed upset you so much.

What about my reply made you think it upset me at all? 

&gt; Look, if you can shorten it - considerably - I promise I'll read it. 

Is there money in it for me if you read it or something? I'm not sure why you think it matters. Don't read it. I can understand why you wouldn't want to acknowledge having read something that demonstrates that you don't know what you're talking about. As far as I'm concerned, it's a settled matter. Anyone looking at the exchange can assess the strength of your assertions.

&gt; It's why you're so mad.

But I'm not. I understand that you've tried to troll me twice in this thread, and that you were hoping to get under my skin somehow by doing so. Acting like you succeeded when there isn't any indications of it contained in my comments though, is best summed up by the sentence following the one I just quoted.

&gt; The Lady doth protest too muchlol I love that I found this thread immediately after replying to you in the last one. I'm just going to leave this right here:

&gt; I don't think anyone was going to read that. It was too long. Kudos for the effort though. Look, if you can shorten it - considerably - I promise I'll read it.

Mine was largely spaces and links, by the way. But you already know because you already checked it out and would rather not engage it.&gt; I don't even know why we discussing this here.

Because I noticed you on the front page putting your foot in your mouth, initially. After that because you decided to open your fat mouth.

But don't let me derail, I can see this is buzzing with activity. &gt; Boy howdy! I really did touch a nerve, didn't I? You see someone about all that anger.

&gt; I don't know what narrative you are referring to

It's really starting to look desperate, too. I could say good morning to you. "WOAH, looks like someone got a nerve touched!!" I'd say you might be convincing yourself but that's not true. Keep it up though, I guess! Better than admitting that you're a simple dude with simple tactics.https://www.kosbe.org/uploads/images/201506301138336935.jpgdamn, i was really hoping for some inept drama to happen with this dude. oh well. good call on trump's legal team's partSure you did.can someone give me the cliffnotes version of what it was all about?True, but homie is talking hologram humans control by human brain or AI type brain.I know loony toons stuff.Haha the prick Rubin has finally admitted what we all suspected for a long time! Only a deeply partisan, brain dead moron will call Gavin Newsom a progressive. Sure, I do like Gavin &amp; his policies for the most part; he's a nice centre left liberal who is also pretty non-corporate. But to call him a crazy progressive is a massive joke hahah! I'm curious ... How is The Young Turks part of the "Far Left"?People are stupid.amazing how many political figures speak their mind *after* they retire and can no longer do anything tangible about it besides bitch, though of course i get that (in this case) a supreme court justice's job is to interpret the law, not bend the law to promote an agenda.&gt; The Supreme Court does not have the power to amend the constitution. And if you knew Stevens, which I suspect you do not, you would know that he is one of the liberal justices and gave the dissenting opinion in District of Columbia v Heller.

i'm aware of that, just musing about the general trend lately.The show has had a Community run discord server for about a year now. I believe we've had close to 10 debates so far, some with over 80-100 people participating. I'm not exactly sure how many attended the last one, but I would wager to guess it was around 40. 

Yes, some of the debates have been very good.I don't know who suggested the Israel question, in addition to voting it forward. The entire question is simply begging or baiting for antisemitism. Kinda pointless unless we were reaching out to communities that actually are antisemitic. 

Again, there were other topics including Universal Basic Income, but for whatever reason it did not receive enough votes compared to some of the other topics. Though.. I seem to remember one group talking about UBI. I'm not sure. 

There have been debates centered on borders (open borders), immigration, free trade and free college before. The problem however is the level of conversation and substance in these debates since it rarely sees any preparation on the part of the participants. Don't get me wrong there are some people that know quite a bit about those topics, but overall we are rather handicapped when it comes to discussing highly technical topics that require sufficient sourcing and so on. 

Therefore, I have suggested before that topics are either formatted along the lines of common sense arguments, where almost anyone can use logic, experience or well known data. I'm not sure if GMO falls under that category since it does require some knowledge of both the science behind it - and possibly the broader societal, industrial or business aspect that factors into production, marketing and how it is being employed. Now I am not saying it is beyond comprehension, but in order to have a real discussion with some productive outcome that can sway people to one or the other side - people will have to read up on it beforehand. I would post a simply syllabus or documentaries etc supplement something like that.

The same is true for free trade, and some of the other topics you listed. Still, decent suggestions that leave room to move in interesting directions. 

Wow! Thanks for the link man, it is sickeningly hypocritical of Rubin! The guy bemoans identity politics yet is himself one of the most tribal &amp; partisan hacks out there! How the hell can Sam Harris fund this guy? I’m actually re-evaluating taking off my funding from Sam based on his inability to call Rubin out.Haha true! Have done now. not to make light of this, but i'm also subbed to a couple gaming subs and at first glance i thought this was about peter molyneux, the guy who created populous.How so? The video linked here is not directly linked to any of his accounts I believe? Furthermore, somehow I find it doubtful that a community of progressives would find him attractive enough to follow him regularly. I wounder if Michael Brooks is going to cover this? Considering he has a crush on Corbyn I'm not holding my breath.It's anti-science, anti-women's rights, anti-free will, anti-LGBT, anti-athiesm tolerance etc.Could you elaborate on your views about Crowder? I have seen a few of his videos and find myself agreeing with a lot of his views well at least particularly when it comes to the anti SJW's etc. I liked the Christina Sommers video though. Did anyone say that?Please stop it. If people had to admit they were wrong about something to be allowed to post again in the future, you wouldn't be around to make this comment, let alone your blatant trolling attempt on here today in the form of a post regarding Sanders and gay marriage. Nor would half the people posting. You made a fine rebuttal to the post, just leave it at that. 

Getting people banned doesn't help in any but the most extreme cases of disruption. We all benefit from a robust community here, even and sometimes especially if it involves shooting down falsehoods that are shared on the internet.

er, no lolThis is what desperation looks like. 

Let me point out two things that you really wish weren't apparent:

1. YOU did not make any distinctions when you created the thread with this title, which makes YOU factually wrong in your assertion. You can try to cherry-pick after the fact about how Pakman was only 90% correct and not 100%, but every time you make it, it's an exercise at screaming at yourself for being 90% WRONG. The semantics you're engaging in aren't helping you, even if your natural reflex is to grab onto something as you're falling.

2. When the person you're defending has a decades-long and ongoing track records of sexual misconduct and abuse, and has a documented paper trail involving his lawyers to that effect, you no longer have a platform to launch a moral attack on someone else for making an off-color remark 20 years ago that they have since rescinded. Again, as with the first point, you'd do your own position well to drop your argument right now, as it's a much more effective weapons against your own position than anyone else's. Was this supposed to be a strategy? I wonder how my response of grinding them into fucking dirt on a personal level until they cry "ad hominem!" and then calling them a bunch of snowflake twats fits into their bulletpoints of achieved goals. &gt; If I didn't make distinctions, it's because he didn't. 

No, you didn't make them because you weren't aware of them yourself. You thought you found the argument stopper, and if you had any awareness of the nuance of what you were linking people too, you'd have headed it off instead of making yourself look like a giant ass with a claim that, by your own assessment, is 90% wrong. I can appreciate that you want to save face, but it should be apparent by this point that I won't me jedi mind tricked into the same.

&gt; It means what he stated was incorrect fullstop.

Then you're wrong fullstop... I'm full of ammunition here, but you can keep handing me more if you can't think of anything else to do.

&gt; I'm not defending Trump in this thread. I am responding to lies told by Pakman.

By telling a bigger lie while defending an even bigger one while using a moral platform to attack an unrelated person whose transgressions amount to the tiniest fraction of far more severe offenses on the part of the party you're defending. As such: see "2" in my original reply. You're the last person Cenk Uygur needs to defend himself against.

Please don't try to frame the world for me. I've got a solid handle on it, thank you. You'd do well to just admit that you're wrong when you're wrong. People on here often respect that. We all have to do it now and then. This sky-is-green nonsense doesn't persuade anyone.&gt; Um...they're right on the US Census Bureau website.

Right, but you didn't refer to that context that you're pointing out is provided by the site. Instead you referred to the existence of the questions at all, clearly unaware that the forms you linked were to questionnaires that the vast and overwhelming majority of the population never saw. That you didn't know that makes your OP that much more of a backfire, as you also go on about how clearly available the information is for everyone in the same breath as you reveal that someone likely just fed you a narrative and some links, and you actually did not legwork whatsoever to reach your false conclusion. 

&gt; This response is basically like "no u" that a 6 year-old would say. That doesn't cut it.

Oh? You should note then that I was borrowing your syntax. I guess firing shots that come back around to hit you is your theme for the day.

&gt; Pakman made a claim. I provided evidence against that claim. Are you claiming that the US Census is telling lies now?

No, I'm saying that you're full of shit. If Pakman's claim was correct for 90% of cases, and not 100%, and claiming that on that basis he's just completely wrong, then you should also be consistent and acknowledge that what you framed as the existing Census paradigm is also 100% wrong. I'm happy to call it only mostly incorrect, as Pakman's statement was only mostly correct. You're the one who wants to apply the strictest possible analysis, with black and white being the only two answers. Pick one. Neither is flattering to you.

&gt; lol, just forget that he got kicked out of Justice Democrats and had to sell his company to investors because it was failing so badly.

I'm happy to have a conversation about that. You just don't have the credibility of an honest actor when you bring it up while defending another party who is guilty of far, far worse transgressions of a similar and more severe nature. Speaking of which:

&gt; I'm not defending any party

There are parties involved in the discussion we're having. You're attacking some parties and defending others. Are you not aware of that use of the word? Did you think I was referring to the Communist Party? Or someone's birthday party? It's a good sign when the person I'm arguing with needs to be this obtuse. I've got the popcorn out here. Let's see how committed you are.Are you named after the redhead kid who plays the drums?&gt; I did it because Pakman referred to the existence of those questions, saying they haven't existed since 1950. Again, I'm responding to his comments.

All right then, you're full of shit and I'm done with your disingenuous ass. Fuck off and have a good one.News is silent on this Majority report and Thom Hartmann Average healthcare costs per family went up 12.0% per year under Bush and it was cut to 5.5% under Obama. So it's not even correlated.If all US aggregate demand goes towards buying U.S. products then GDP growth would go up. Trump is repudiating Reaganomics and neoliberalism on trade.How much do you balance the insights from Jungian or political psychology with contributions from academia in other social sciences, or criticisms of the former? In my (admittedly shallow) view, people like Peterson seem to be using Jungianism very shrewdly as a marketing tool to generate a following among young people with a interest in pseudo-rational ways of categorization of people. To some extent the entire process is perverse, since these categories are likely unfounded while also being enormously restrictive, given what we know about neuroplasticity. But what the fuck do I know!I'm a philosophy undergrad, and I struggle to see how Peterson could provide a better understanding of the nature of good and evil. Like, why not simply read the classics? I don't get it![kulinski responds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VD7_j8KY3w)

after watching the panel, oof. what was thatNo, disingenuous because you're completely full of shit and can't admit that you were obviously and painfully wrong about your suggestions regarding the Census. Anyone looking at your post can see it clear as day. I know you don't want to hear that (I can tell by how stubbornly you're trying to play it off as if you said exactly what you meant), but it's the truth, and it's insulting to others when you expect them to believe the dumb shit coming out of your mouth when they point that out. 

I repeat. Nobody is fooled. You're just making yourself look even more childish and dishonest every time you try to pass it.Sorry but this interview was a complete embarrassment where Kyle is concerned. He thought he was going to waltz in there and steer the discussion where he wanted it to go, completely ignoring the questions being asked to him and just reading off of his cheat sheet. He forgot that he's in someone else's studio, and that on network TV, things move on a schedule and that schedule is brief. He just turned the discussion into a confused clusterfuck, and I'm not sure why the statement being highlighted in this post changes any of that. I couldn't even look at the screen past the first 30 seconds or so. My skin was crawling from watching him crash and burn. I twitched right now just thinking about it.Trump was never in the running though, not even for richest guy in the country. 

It's just the Washington Post if you ask me. I think it's funny that it took this long to occur to him too.

He needs to watch his fuckin step. He is (aside from being one himself) pretty tied into the interests of a great number of tax-dodgers and loophole creators/abusers who DO NOT want their spots blown up. If he keeps fucking with Amazon, he might just get what he wants and then some.&gt; Yes, this is true in reality, but not in Trump's mind.

Fair point.just the city, i believe. another guy who replied in the milwaukee thread said the following, though i cannot attest for its accuracy-

&gt; This actually came about in the mid-20th century when the Democrats and Republicans of Milwaukee joined forces to try to end the successful run of Socialist mayors. They passed a bill in state legislature that took the parties off of the ballots, thus hoping to take votes away from three time Mayor of Milwaukee, the late Frank P. Zeidler, who held office from 1948 to 1960.

it appears to be vaguely backed up from a small blurb in wikipedia on [electoral fusion in milwaukee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fusion#Milwaukee), however.

&gt; In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the heyday of the Sewer Socialists, the Republican and Democratic parties would agree not to run candidates against each other in some districts, concentrating instead on defeating the Socialists. These candidates were usually called "non-partisan", but sometimes were termed "fusion" candidates instead.[8]neat.

damn leftiesThere we are,

https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=90.2&amp;d=81.4&amp;g=73.1&amp;s=78.4my. god. somebody get me that joe mccarthy feller on the horni think it just comes off as negative because "excessive" is defined as "more than is necessary, normal, or desirable; immoderate." so if we take the claim at its strictest definition it comes off as "an unnecessary amount of government is a threat to the economy" which most would agree with, otherwise it wouldn't, by definition, be unnecessary. the thought being "if a certain intervention *is* necessary it is not bad; if it *is not* necessary it is bad; therefore my answer by default is to agree." of course the question isn't "is it bad or not" but whether "it is a threat," but again most people are going to equate "threat" with "bad" and again default to "agree."

even the word "immoderate" comes off as more neutral than "excessive" in this situation.

synonyms such as "extortionate, unreasonable, outrageous, undue, uncalled for, unwarranted" don't make it sound any better.[should we trust him, your neutralness? "all i know is my gut says *maybe*."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-bCIA_vyVc)dammit, you beat me to it.Hell yes howsci.Welcome brother!how i understand it (from the recent police chief press conference) is there were 4 casualties that are likely to survive and then one female who appears to have been killed by a self-inflicted GSW.

so, speculatively speaking, the shooter was a woman, acted alone, and is dead.&gt; Nobody’s been tougher on Russia than I have. And I know you’re nodding yes, because everyone agrees when they think about it, strong energy, the United States. My opponent was into other forms of energy, like windmills. 

wutCongratulation on becoming a Neocon. Regime change in Iraq has been an absolute catastrophe. I would remind you that Saddam may perhaps have been a viscous leader, but he made sure to keep the religious extremists at bay while in power. I'll also remind you that the case for intervention rested heavily on the lie that Saddam was in bed with al-Qaeda. This again is completely false, Osama bin Laden despised Saddam and would have never cooperated with him against the United States. Saddam in turn was bewildered that the United States chose to blame him for the attack, and subsequently invade to have him toppled. 

Saddam, brutal though he was - was our man. The concept of blowback is much understood by those who have observed and even partaken in this exercise that you so calmly speak about, .. namely that nation building, military intervention in parts of the world we know little about can have disastrous consequences. Other people in the comment section have indeed made all the obvious arguments, referencing the scores of innocent people that died in this senseless conflict .. I have made a note that you believe ISIS was birthed from the Ba'athist, you are partly right - the upper echelons of the Iraqi army eventually, after a prolonged occupation, to side with the radicals to reclaim their country. However, to claim that this would have likely happened under Saddam is an enormous stretch. 

But I'll tell you one thing.

There's a simple way to answer this question, and I implore you to consider this in forming opinions like this about foreign intervention. How do the Iraqi people feel? How do the Libyan people feel? Has their situation improved? .. Would they have traded Saddam for the current band of robbers and lunatic murderers? 

Of course they would. By the way, I know Christopher Hitchens makes terribly good arguments in favor of the war. All I can ask is that you examine the case further, include what you know now - that Hitchens, unfortunately was not privy too at the time. Otherwise, I would be happy to debate the question with you on the Discord sometime. Amen Brother. Let's grab some pitchforks and get to work. I'll even make sure to supply steady doses of fresh lasagne so we can maintain pressure on the aristocratic dogs. Long live the second American War for Independece (NSA Please don't flag this I'm only half serious).They don't resolve anything.  That's what makes them conservative.  It's literally right in the name.The "Mental health is the real problem" argument is an obfuscation, a purposeful distraction used to defend what they want: To keep their guns.

They all know that's not the issue.  Every country has mentally ill people. That's not unique to the USA.

Conservatism is based entirely on a sociopathic, individualist, darwinian, winner-take-all ideology.  Owning a firearm is seen as a god given right, but access to healthcare is seen as a service that you pay for.  And like all services you pay for, if you can't afford it, you don't get it.

So they have no issue squaring the two.  Everyone should be able to buy any firearm.  Mental health care is something you pay for if you want it and can afford it.

There is no conflict in their mind.American left-wing ideals such as living wage, same-sex marriage, abortion and universal healthcare would be considered moderate things in Europe because everyone in Europe agrees with it. The problem with American politics is that most things seen as left-wing in America are seen as moderate in Europe because American politics is further to the right than Europe. The only thing I admire about America is their free speechwdym 'sjews'I'm glad that the SJW crowd, as tiny and insignificant as they are, tend to be completely within the centrist neoliberal area of the political spectrum.  I don't want my socialist/communist movement tainted by people who can't handle Obama getting criticized. lolwait are you a communist if not then what are you? plus and I know this is maybe an unpopular view but I'm sure the sjw crowd has gotten bigger and infecting the left ever since Trump came but nonetheless the Democrats won't win anything if they keep going on about Stormy Daniels, Russia, High turnover etc. it's just a distraction from the real criticisms of trump No, when the party moves to the centre it fails like it did with Clinton. I mean it's like you want the democrats to not represent anything at all and be republican lite. I mean what do you want them to stand for? Medicare for all is really popular and Bernie Sanders is the most popular us politician ever. The rust belt was destroyed by the centrist new democrats who supported the trade deals. European social democracy is working, look at the Scandinavian countriesI am up to date on it.  I was just noting I'm happy that my fellow socialist/communist comrades aren't idiotic SJWs.No i'm talking about the mentality of some democrats who use identity politics and don't have any policy substance and go we don't hate gays, blacks, muslims or immigrants vote for us blah blah blah, Clinton spent her ads criticising Trump's character and racism and how she's a nice woman, that was itThe SJW crowd has been infecting the centrists. Not the left.  Just because the GOP has moved to insanity right land doesn't make corporatists and democrats "Left".You must be playing a character. No one is this much a stereotype.You can understand basic realities of racism, sexism, etc without being a lunatic "SJW".I'd love to see David discuss economics with Sargon so that sargon alt right fan kiddies can have a meltdown.&gt; I want Democrats to stand for the poor again. Medicare for All is a handout to the rich who do not need government benefits, but this guarantees it for them. I want Democrats to stand for the working class and be united on trade, rejecting disastrous trade deals like NAFTA and TPP, but Democrats no longer stand for that.
&gt; 
 I used identity politics ffs, pretty much all of her ads were about how Trump was a racist, islamophobe and sexist and she just attacked his character. Identity politics is cancer and is a losing issue that's why in every poll done with Bernie Sanders vs Trump, Bernie is shown to be in front
"Democratic Republic".  Lmfao.  Everyone knows the USA is a Capitalist corporatist Authoritarian Dictatorship held hostage by oligarchs.

More than half the country's votes don't even count and the presidency is basically decided by 4 or 5 states out of 50.  What a damn joke.The entire mainstream media dropped the ball, but some evidence (the 911 call for example) was only recently made public, forcing different outlets to correct the narrative that prevailed in the aftermath of the shooting. That in mind, I'm not sure whether there's any point in criticizing The Young Turks in particular here, when we know there are forces behind these narratives that do this consistently -- Jeremy Scahill at The Intercept did a good break down of this in his most recent podcast episode, I would suggest you check it out.I believe you're wrong, both on the level of diagnosing and prescribing a solution to this issue.

The question we should be asking is: What is trolling? What conditions have lead to this kind of behavior being so "seemingly" prevalent online? and who are the main perpetrators? 

* I. Yes. Trolling has a cultural component, similar to terrorism for example, in that the awareness of this behavior leads others to adopt the same approach either as a counter measure or simply because they find it entertaining.  

* II. However, the cause is rather simple - Where did it come from? I believe the main condition to be the absence of normative sanctioning that you usually see in any social space. Manipulative provocation is likely a common form of socially deviant behavior, but is usually heavily responded to in the form of physical violence, shaming or some other sanction. The anonymity of the internet allows for this kind of deviant behavior to be employed without any consequences. 

* III.  I believe it is common knowledge that these forms of socially deviant behavior originated among male subcultures on the internet, and for whatever reason, remains as a primarily male dominated behavioral trait.


Now that we know what the problem is and how it originated, what can we do to combat it? 

There's no easy answer. Subcultures can become incredibly entrenched and last for decades if not longer. Here is how I would approach it; I would first strike the companies that are responsible for socializing these kids (which they effectively are most of them) and instruct them to begin implementing features on their platforms aimed at countering anti-social and confrontational behavior. I would scale back the anonymity somewhat and make people more directly accountable to others, remove competitive mechanisms that promote hostility and correspondingly incentivize friendly cooperation. Here's a few examples: The Blizzard Entertainment MMO (Massive Multiplayer Online) game World of Warcraft has a drastically less toxic environment compared to Counter-Strike or League of Legends as an example, because in order to progress in the game you have to build up a reputation and become a part of social group. This social group essentially has sanctioning power over you and limit your experience of the game if you do not behave nicely toward others. 

In League of Legends, there is no accountability or punishment effective enough to make sure that people behave - while the game itself (company) eagerly manipulates players to become more addicted, and emotionally connected to the game. Investments into what are ultimately arbitrary concepts like matchmaking ranks, a mechanisms that enforces negative comparisons between players (creates elite culture) and toxic competitiveness. Let us have a return to cooperation and more personal social groups online. Gaming companies are particularly important because like I said, they have realistically taken on one of the biggest roles of the socializing process for young people. I would also instruct companies to begin investing heavily in events that draw people out of their rooms, while at the same time emphasize the return to more traditional games that have LAN (Local Area Network) capability.  

Communities and local municipalities should designate space for net cafe's or spaces where youth can access or house their computers alongside others. 

Here are some other solutions; increase the minimum wage and reduce working hours in order to promote more family time and socializing time. Create more communal ties generally through social events and common ownership, -- reduce both the costs of education and the strict requirements, make Universities more open to the broader public and academia more approachable. The problem here is not necessarily the anonymity of the internet alone, though that is certainly dangerous in the promotion of abhorrent and sadistic behavior - but I think most issues evolve from some underlying cultural, social or economic conditions. Did you play World of Warcraft for Umbrage?But do you take moronic centrists seriously though?that's why they killed him?Very interesting points you made. I don't see humans colonizing space physically but mentally yes. I don't wanna privatise Space Travel but sadly that's the path we're heading to.  It's really half and half. This video with Dr. Kaku might explain some things  https://youtu.be/iwj8deuPjNEJFK was a communist confirmed.Individual liberty is a talking point buzz word phrase to try and distract from the fact that humans are a social species.  While individual freedom sounds good, the collective is important too.I love the idea of robots of helping the people in need instead of killing folks.Depends on how you're using the term.That's one of the things I dislike Obama for. The drone program accurate with its kills and why can't they stunt the enemy instead of killing them.Since when do conservatives care about "facts"?Dave Rubin is the final form of late capitalism.TIL Noam Chomsky is a conservative. Good to know. A card holding GOP member to boot too I'm sure.  Quick, someone get him on stage at the Republican Nation Convention!You come across as an obvious troll mate.You've read Marx?Having fun?She's a professional provocateur, well adapted to modern media strategy and marketing. However .. That does not make all of this acting, her motives might be abhorrent, but she is sincerely disgruntled with the Trump administration. Xenophobia has been her brand for decades now and I suspect she believed this was going to her chance to be "adequately" represented in that regard.

These people are very savvy, and their intentions and beliefs are real.are people in his base *really* that concerned about a wall though in the grand scheme of things? even my fox-news-drinkin-the-koolaid-convert parents are like, "well, it *sounds* like a good idea...." but they're not acting like a wall is a single issue thing like coulter is coming off as in the video.

i assumed people who support him just want to feel like they're "winning" even if there's no actual tangible benefit to them.I really hoping for break dancing robot like claptrap. Sigh I'll just dream about it.That last sentence reminds me of that cheesy commercial of the egg and frying pan.I remembered one report of Pizzagate that got him canned from TV. Before that mass shootings he did report wrong and not once apologies. Middle East stories are always complex to say the least. I know some average  Joe in the Reddit might find this person creditable. I have habit on listening to both sides. Rest is either comedy or interesting fact checking for myself. The majority of the left oppose intervening in Syria as they all ways have, it's just the right (except many trump fans,) and the hawkish centrists who want Trump to intervene Study analytical philosophy.That's what inspired me to make this. Assad has the tools and doesn't give a damn. He won. Pure and simple. 

There is nothing to celebrate here. Nothing..


The generation of Republicans that Paul Ryan belonged to, supplemented by this disgraceful administration, were put into power to fulfilled a reactionary corporate agenda to roll back regulation, taxation, and increase the power of the corporations at the expense of government. Here they have succeeded.. Now we await the consequences, short term and long term.

Paul Ryan quit, yes perhaps because reelection might be more difficult now - but mainly because, he is the embodiment of the revolving door and corporate recruitment to destroy democracy. He is a hitman. Looking back at their electoral strategy, I believe the Republicans know they gambled everything on this move, with the understanding that it might cost them the midterm elections to alienation and disillusionment. 

This is their strategy. No one cares about the Trump administration, since the man was picked  to be the dumdum with the pen. That'll be sacrificed as well when the time comes. 

Now they'll go on the defensive. Lose the house intentionally, and blame Democratic obstructionism that further promises are not being enacted. This could serve to reengage the base against the Democrats moving into the next Presidential election, and the 2022 midterm election - that's where they need to win again. That way they'll be able to set themselves up against the incoming Democratic administration, which is almost guaranteed to be more progressive. Moreover, the Republicans will still have the Supreme Court for some time to beat back bigger policy changes.

.. Here we are, the Left now has a massive structural disadvantage. 

Yeah, this suit is gone, but the mechanisms and forces that send people like Paul Ryan to Congress is still in full operation. The change that might come from this other candidates more adapted to the defensive strategy. I suspect, people that are more aggressively outspoken and even more openly xenophobic, anti-government, anti-Leftist, so on and so forth.

Be prepared.I'll leave this here:

Article Excerpt: 

&gt; *"MOSCOW, April 6. /TASS/. Jabhat al-Nusra (a group outlawed in Russia) and the Free Syrian Army are planning chemical attacks with the use of chlorine in areas under their control, including Daraa’s district of Al-Balad, the chief of Russia’s center for the reconciliation of conflicting parties in Syria, Major-General Yuri Yevtushenko, said on Friday.*

&gt; *Jabhat al-Nusra plans to sabotage UN aid delivery — Russian Defense Ministry
"The ringleaders of Jabhat al-Nusra and the Free Syrian Army, which are acting together, are plotting explosions of makeshift chemical charges containing chlorine in a number of areas under their control, including Al Balad in Daraa," he said.*

&gt; *Tipoffs about preparations being made for provocations in the south of Syria, including the use of chemical warfare agents, Yevtushenko said, had been received from the group Jaish Ahrar Al-Ashair, which has taken the government’s side.*

&gt; *Yevtushenko said "the militants plan to photograph and video the alleged effects of chemical weapons and show the clips to the public at large to blame government troops for civilians casualties, as well as to provide excuses for their own actions to disrupt ceasefire in Daraa."*

&gt; *The equipment for catching phony chemical attacks on camera is already in place and other preparations are on, he said."*

**This article is from the 6th of April.**

In it the Russian military warns in detail of an impending chemical attack perpetrated by elements of the Free Syrian Army.

I'll assume you are correct, that the Assad regime is responsible for the attack (I'm open to being convinced either way). 

Please explain the reasoning behind both the warning, and the chemical attack. In what way would the Assad regime benefit from international condemnation and, quite possibly retaliation that would have Bashar al-Assad removed? This has been shown to happen before. In fact, it almost lead to a full blown invasion under Obama. Keep in mind when building your argument that the Trump administration had just signaled withdrawal from Syria. Why does the Assad regime want the US to remain engaged in the region?  

Feel free to ascend beyond claims that the assumption of rationality is unwarranted, or that the people in charge of Syria currently are simply "evil". Care to respond to the question?  To be fair, I don't think I've ever mentioned the Golf of Tonkin incident where the person I was talking to, of any age, knew what I was talking about. 

Bring up medicare for all, and you can get bombarded with a wave of people who think they're history scholars start rambling about gulags and "The great leap forward", but zero of them can name famines, death or massacres that occurred under capitalist agents.

There are a lot of historical tragedies people don't have a clue about. Most people have a narrow and extremely limited grasp of history, so this doesn't surprise me.The way I see it, both theories have a conspiratorial quality to them. A) Assad conspired with Russia to gas his own people for some elusive reason B) Elements of the Free Syrian Army conspired to gas people for some (less) elusive reason. 

I'm skeptical enough to wait for the UN reports, but even then I would be hesitant to commit to it entirely. There's is simply too much geopolitics involved, in addition to .. rather murky details surrounding the attack. Moreover, I'm not sure I need to stake out a position, other than to reaffirm that bombing Syria back to the stone age to remove Assad is demonstrably unwise regardless of his involvement in the gas attack. Now I suppose that makes me an apologist for "fascists", but hardly anyone is able to remain consistent in that respect so I'll forgo the moral condemnation.

The question I posed is rather basic. Let us say Assad gassed his own people, as I understand you believe (again I'm not saying he did not), one day after the Russian military sent out warnings that an impending gas attack was imminent.. I want to know; **what-was-his-motive?**. 

Is it scare tactics against his own people or the Free Syrian Army? Perhaps a war of attrition play against the US to maintain their presence in the fight at the behest of their sponsor, Russia? Or maybe the entire thing is some elaborate psyops aimed at undermining the US by baiting them to overreact, that again would foment opposition domestically and reduce their willingness to play the proxy war game? Who can tell.

Quite simply, I would like to know why, before I pass judgement. Ya, it was only a lie perpetuated to give an excuse to wage land war in Vietnam against political and economic rivals, resulting in the deaths of about 1.5 million people.

But I mean, hey, obscure little event. No big deal.It's where Donald obtained his bone spur injuries.  He barely made it out alive.I think every school child knows what they Holocaust was in a general sense.  When you start asking specifics, you're going to get a lot of "I dunno" or just wrong answers.

So Auschwitz falls into that category.  A detail many don't recall or know about, but it's a part of a broader thing they do know a little about.

Most school kids and young adults could probably give you a rough idea about the US civil war, why it was fought and by whom.  But start asking about specific places or battles, most will probably draw a blank.

It's probably the same thing.I think every school child knows what they Holocaust was in a general sense. When you start asking specifics, you're going to get a lot of "I dunno" or just wrong answers.

So Auschwitz falls into that category. A detail many don't recall or know about, but it's a part of a broader thing they do know a little about.

Most school kids and young adults could probably give you a rough idea about the US civil war, why it was fought and by whom. But start asking about specific places or battles, most will probably draw a blank.

It's probably the same thing.That's my point.  Most people tend to remember the major all encompassing event, and then the details are lost to a lot of people, even the major details.

Auschwitz is a major detail of the Holocaust, but it's still that, a detail.  I would wager the same, or less people can describe or even know about about Gettysburg. Or Omaha beach. Or the Storming of Bastille, etc etc.

That's all I'm saying.Heh, I guess you'd be surprised by how many events in history aren't even known by a majority of people, much less details of those events, major or otherwise.

I don't think I'm wrong either.You've missed the point completely. 

This isn't about whether they are credible. I'm asking for analysis. The Russians warn that the FSA is planning a chemical attack, and the chemical attack happens. What is the line of thinking behind this from the point of view of Russia and Assad? 

Now I'll simply ask.. Does this defy Occam's Razor? Yes it does. Should we therefore conclude that Assad was not behind the attack? No, we shouldn't. There's reasonable doubt here, so attacking people for questioning the public narrative and not ignoring these contradictions is not only insulting - but deeply dishonest. 

In any case, I'll remark that you have not engaged with the question I posed. Assume I'm ignorant on the topic, and you could serve as my beacon to understanding this conflict and the events of the last few days. Who is carrying out these chemical attacks and why?

Okey, I think we can safely conclude that you are trolling. The post has been reported.It’s all propaganda!! Everything is lies! Post hoc ergo propter hoc. 

I would caution against the use of the term "fact", even in the case of the U.N. report. 

Because the Assad regime was likely responsible for previous chemical attacks, does not mean that they are responsible now. Now would you care to address my question? "This is your fault for being poor.  We wouldn't need taxes if everyone was Jeff Bezos. Taxation is theft. Also, Jeff Bezos earned his money. You don't earn yours. Libtard" -Every Libertarian/Conservative ever.Ya this is a real head scratcher.  I can easily see why she was having a hard time.  On one hand, she really doesn't like black people going to school with white kids.  On the other hand, if the USA institutes the Final Solution, the law would be pointless because there would be no black people. /s

What a joke.

thanks for the video, I was assuming it was a DP video anyway. I'll check it out laterThanks but I’m sure I did provide factual information especially for the Charles Kirk He’s a conservative political commentator and found of Turning Point USA which is a conservative organistion. In my opinion he’s just a mediocre Ben Shapiro because he has less substance and more style than him &gt; By the way, if you'd like, you could do me (and I'm sure some others as well) a huge favour and sort out what exactly is going on with Corbyn and Labour. I sort of lost track on that one; last thing I heard was that Labour in Israel cut ties with him. What's that all about? Palace intrigue?
&gt; 

There's been allegations of anti-Semitism being recurrent within the Labour Party. It's nothing new, the Media tried this 2 years ago and kept saying the same thing about this issue. The criticism the media and many other people have is not that Corbyn is an anti-semite , although he has been to marches with Hamas and Hezbollah who are clearly anti-semitic, it's that he's been soft on the issue. I do believe it has risen in the party not because of Jeremy but because of the more hard left people joining the party since his election who at the least and most times carry unknowingly anti-semitic views and at the worst and most are A grade anti-Semites.

I myself am a mild critic of Corbyn even though I love him because the previous reason metioned and his past links with the IRA. In terms of his military policy, when he's asked how he would react if e.g. Russia launched a missile on the UK would he respond back and he just dodges the question and says how he would wants to live in a world without Nukes. The shady shit in Corbyn's past makes Bernie Sanders look a conservative in comparison which is why I prefer Sanders who I prefer more.

On the Issue of Euan Blair, this is new stuff to me and I just found from you and I'm as clueless as you. According to the papers, it's just rumours but I wouldn't be suprised if Euan actually did set up a new centrist party. Tbh I don't think it would work out at all, everyone in Britain is fed up with his dad Tony Blair for the mess he done in Iraq and plus he's making an even more bad name by returning to the public eye and saying how he believes the public were duped on Brexit and that we should be able to reverse our decision. Euan's surname would cause him a lot of trouble no matter what he does let alone the fact that the Lib dems are basically trying what he's doing and yet the Lib dems are stagnant in the opinion polls at no bigger than 10 points.was popping in to say this also, about how his "are we streaming \*right now\*? oh i \*dearly, truly\* hope we're not broadcasting this rant \*live\*" comments are as transparent and shallow as the man's "views." purely an act, clearly.

the fact that everyone sees how blatantly obvious this is warms my heart a little.Btw, are you in favour of the way Germany, because I realised you're from there, had accepted so many migrants into the country in 2015. I'm in favour of accepting refugees but Germany went a little bit overboard when they accepted nearly a million of them and some are even economic migrants. Do you have evidence like statistics to debunk the right-wing claim that many of the refugees aren't integrating, are more likely to commit rape and violence and are taking welfare Have you heard of Dominionism?Another Besty Devos momentThere is an important monitoring group tracking these lunatics, unfortunately I can't remember their name at the moment. From what I can tell, Erik Prince (and his sister Betsy DeVos) is probably the most dangerous/influential Dominionist at the moment.  No, better to remain ignorant I suppose.Taxation remains one of the most reactionary mechanisms we have in society - and I can't help but think that it has benefited the Conservative upper class far more than it has the Liberal or working class. In my view any forward looking political model should find a way to dismantle the taxation of ordinary citizens entirely.. There's a reason why people here seem incapable of giving you the argument you're looking for. Mainly because, the illusion of ownership (and relative entitlement to reward) is extremely powerful. thanks, i've been looking for this.https://www.politico.eu/article/why-the-arabs-dont-want-us-in-syria-mideast-conflict-oil-intervention/I stopped watching Kyle but I respect the man and his show. I like Bill and some issues I do disagree with him on. Like Islamic and Gaza Strip topics. Kyle issues religion and politics is spot at times. Russian Prob is ongoing thing we don't know much about yet. So Kyle and Bill are right and or wrong on the issue. Lastly, to the people who left David on silly reasons. Bye FeliciaTrue but I wanted to be safe on the topic. that article is written like shit. barely comprehensible at times. fucking awful. wtf salonthanks for the linkIt’s nothing new, I found out about it on his Wikipedia page ages ago but it’s removed now. Not sure if this is not representative of Shapiro now because it said on the wiki page that years later he condemned population transfer as immoral. I don’t understand how an article by him 15 years ago should be held up as what Shapiro believes now as according to your logic therefore Cenk Ugyur who made sexist comments around the same year hasn’t changed his views. 

I think Ben Shapiro is very emotions first and political hack when it comes to the Palestine and Israel conflict and believes that even the PLO who renounced terrorism years ago are terrorists. He also seems to have some prejudices of Palestinians or Arabs at least wether intended or not and tweeted 5 years ago that “Arabs live in open sewage and bomb shit #settlementsrock” fucked up sentiment, but i don't see where he actually calls for "aryanization" or mentions replacing them with blonde\-haired blue\-eyed white people, unless there's more to it further down the thread. shocking how normalized this language has become, wrapped up in semantic niceties.Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to United States Secretary of State Colin Powell under Bush 1. This is perhaps the only intellectually honest Republican that I am aware of, while also being surprisingly empathetic. I suspect he belongs more to the old cadre of Republicans that still believed in progress, but preferred reform or incrementalism to more radical change. 

Otherwise, I would extend a general appreciation for every reactionary Conservative that now occupies a grave. Antonin Scalia for example. Is there anyone who does not realize how much of a trojan horse this man is for Conservatives in America?Jordan Peterson is literally the dumbest e-famous person right now, right behind Dave Rubin and Ben Shitpiro.There goes the right wingers again, shutting down free speech and afraid of hearing different points of view. He can't even handle having a dinner with people who disagree with him.In my view, there very little that either Conservatives or Libertarians can offer the Left outside of affirmation, an understanding of their psychology or behavior and subsequently important lessons in adaptation. Perhaps I'm being uncharitable, but whenever someone on the Right is accurate in their description of reality, they normally copy that from some historical argument made by someone else on the Left - like the anti-war or free speech narrative, which has now been appropriated by members of the Right and made to seem revolutionary. Indeed, so much of the Trump era is about reinventing or taking credit for traditions that Conservatives have for quite some time opposed.

Interesting though, that the Conservative perspective is highlighted while no one seems interested in exploring more Leftist thought, whether it relates to economics or politics generally. I suppose we are sufficiently exposed to it as is? Nevertheless I seriously question the value of paying such close attention to what the Right is saying at the cost of developing our own ideas and potentially putting it into effect. Counter strategizing is important, but there's still a lot that is missing from the Liberal Democrat modus operandi. 

I would also suggest that so much of academia is missing as well. There are so many dedicated communities of researchers and scholars out there beyond the fast-food punditry that everyone could benefit greatly from, and make us far stronger at combating reaction and appeasement.  This I'm sure is a clear sign of decline. 

When fools and sophists become the torch bearers. 
I don’t live the US, I’m from London. I was just wondering how widespread it is for left leaning people to find it hard to live in red states because conservatives always whine about they find it hard to live in states like California  "As secretary of state, rex tillerson refused to accept eighty million dollars"

oh?

"...in congressional funding earmarked for state to counter russian propaganda"

oh.I firmly believe that in order to restore the sanity of our society, this man must eventually be properly disgraced, his inadequacies and personal faults laid bare, most importantly by those who have enabled him. In my country this.. could never transpire. I'm not certain whether Trump is the result celebrity worship or extreme individualism, but it is clear that society no longer has an effective behavioral correcting effect that extends to where it arguably matters most, high office. He can lie indiscriminately.

Indeed. To reclaim sanity, this man and all that he represents needs to be destroyed. Simple replacing him through an election will not suffice since normalization has already played it's part. I would like to see some serious brainstorming on how to overcome the collective trauma inflicted by this megalomaniacal naracisist.+1 for Communist party please. You add the far right extremist "Libertarian party" but going to the left you stop just slightly after center-left with the Democratic Socialists, who are basically just capitalists in favor of strong social welfare programs.  The spectrum goes farther left than that.The Democrats are Center-Right on economics and foreign policy. They're center-left on social issues.They don't care about the fetus.  It's a Big-Daddy authoritarianism ideology they have.  They don't like people having sex and want people to suffer financially for sexual activity they deem sinful.

It's not about the fetus, or children.  It's always been about punishing people with different lifestyles then theirs.What is it you are hoping to achieve with these posts? I mean honestly, what the fuck are you talking about? 

Just take a college course or read a book about foreign policy already. If you dealt with religious lunatics repeating the same failed arguments for over 2 decades you'd be pretty short with people too.She endangered nothing. Grow the fuck up you CHUD.Like I said socialism comes in many forms, your basically doing a no Scotsman fallacy The simplest explanation is, a combination of this: 

* *1. People are overworked.*
* *2. People prefer entertainment over civic engagement. See point 4.*
* *3. Politics is complicated, and intentionally made difficult to be engaged with.*
* *4. Manufactured consent is powerful, the mainstream and Conservative media is fierce in its propaganda efforts.*
* *5. Personal or social concerns trump civic engagement, people have enough to deal with.*
* *6. Tribalism, nativism, racism, nationalism and jingoism can maintain support for candidates regardless. These are all widespread in America.*
* *7. 14 percent of adult Americans demonstrated a "below basic" literacy level in 2003, and 29 percent exhibited a "basic" reading level.*
* *8. People hate neoliberalism,so Trump becomes the necessary evil to defeat that.*

There's a whole bunch of other things, but these are some of the most significant in my view.Keep playing centrist and licking capitalist boots.  It's working out so well for ya. lol. RIPAre you high? They did prevent people from voting.  They explicitly did closed primary to dismiss indy voters. They also conspired against Bernie to make it harder for him to win.  Lets not even get into "Super Delegates" which made it look like Bernie had no chance of catching up, right from the start (which obviously swayed voter opinion).

You have to be a complete idiot to think that the election wasn't rigged. 1. Independent voters.
2. Super Delegates are a thing and have been for some time, and they're used to push establishment candidates who are corporate drones.
3. I love how you claim it's an issue with Bernie supporters, denying the fact that Clinton voters are the ones typically clueless on the political process and policy positions.

&gt;"Rigging" implies an active effort to sabotage a candidate.

By your own definition, the DNC rigged the primaries.

But hey, keep blaming the actual left with your centrist neoliberal boot licking. Nobody wants to vote for republican-lite. Aside from the fact that the corporate democratics are objectively shitty on policy in terms of actual results, it's not going to energize any voters.
&gt;There's nothing wrong with a private political party holding closed primaries.

The fact that Trump won says otherwise.

&gt; I presume your claim is that the superdelegates discouraged Bernie supporters from voting for their candidate.

That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying in general it fooled a lot of voters into thinking Shillary was the "obvious winner".  Which she wasn't, objectively. It fooled Shillary voters into sticking with her instead of going with the better choice.

&gt;My original claim was that the conspiracy theories surrounding the 'rigging' are often vastly overstated.

It's not overstated.  It's just stated, because it's a fact.

&gt;It depends on which policies you're talking about.

All of them.  The Dems are capitalist drones and almost all of them are beholden to their corporate masters. They stand in the way of everything the country needs and play fence sitter or propose half-measures only after extreme pressure from a grand majority of the country, because they want to be Republican-lite.&gt;In what way does it say otherwise? If the primaries were open and the DNC, backed by corporate media, didn't rig everything in Shillary's favor, Bernie would have been the winner and he would have won.

&gt;I don't see how this is functionally different 

Bernie voters voted for Bernie. The fault falls on the Clinton drones that were conned into thinking she was the best choice, when every indication was that she was wildly flawed and inferior to Bernie. 

&gt;how do you know that Clinton being the 'obvious winner' didn't discourage voters from voting for Clinton

Because group-think always makes people jump on the "winning ship".  Being proclaimed the winner helped her, not hurt her. &gt;I disagree.

I didn't say anything that was up for debate.

&gt;Most of their policies are fine and are supported by the academic consensuses.

What a fucking joke. Please stop. I can't handle laughing this hard.

&gt;Democrats now support single-payer.

Cool story, too bad when Dems had the white house and congressional veto-proof majority they gave us the Heritage foundation plan instead. Oh boy oh boy.  Such great policy.&gt;This is irrelevant to whether or not it conceptually makes sense for primaries to be closed or open.

It wasn't just the closed primaries that worked against Bernie.  The rigging went much deeper than that.  And even with everything stacked against him, he still came damn close. There is no scenario that without the rigging that Bernie wouldn't have won.

&gt;I disagree. The motivation to vote for a candidate becomes less when that candidate is guaranteed a victory.

That's not how it works. Especially in a primary.&gt;Here's a good article from 538 which examines what might've happened had the primaries been open.

*If every state held a closed primary, Clinton would beat Sanders by 19 percentage points and have a 654 elected delegate advantage, we estimate. If, however, each state held an open caucus, Sanders would beat Clinton by 22 percentage points nationwide and have a 496 elected delegate lead. Of course, neither of those scenarios would happen.*

The article you linked backed up what I said. In fact, it went well above what I stated.  This scenario suggests that if ALL the state primaries were open, Bernie would have kicked her ass.

It doesn't even take into consideration all the other shit working against him.

Now it says "This would never happen".  I never said it would happen. I said that if it was opened, he would have won.

Good game.&gt;The closed primaries didn't work against Bernie.

The article you linked says otherwise. It states that if all states held open primaries, Bernie would have won by a huge amount.

You're delusional in this conversation.  I'm not sure what you're smoking.Ya, when they're in power, they bow to their corporate overlords and pander to capitalist interests.  When they're out of power, they try and act like little saints and "push" for things the working class want, fully knowing that it's not going to happen.

It's a game and people like you are getting played.It's funny watching you flail and try to defend their horse shit.  Don't worry though, the Dems crowned Shillary, AKA Mrs. "Bernie just wants to give everyone free ponies" to be their leader.

That's where that party is at.  They're backwards corporate shills and most of them are owned by corporate money that finances them. They will never pass anything that the working class wants. Never. Get it through your head.  You've been played.

Keep trying to act like they're what you want, instead of what they are. It's hilarious.Cry me a river, snowflake.  Maybe it was the right number for them.  All the neoliberals and neocons got triggered by some harsh Truth, so they needed the help from the suicide hotline.No individual. Empire.I'm assuming if you're calling for a person to get fired for speaking their mind that you're old enough to get called an idiot.The "It's slavery to have public healthcare" is completely moronic.  I don't see how anyone with an IQ above single digits could make such a dumb argument.It’s laughable to to argue that Clinton is better with foreign policy. Even Alex Jones would do a better job with foreign policy. She voted for the Iraq war and led and supported the intervention in Libya. She also shills to Israel and Saudi Arabia and also praises Trump for his air strikes on assad a few weeks. I’m from the UK and I’d love it if we had the right to bear arms providing that we have effective and rigorous gun control like universal background checks and bans on assault weapons Your right and I totally agree. lately however I've been devoting more time on the subject of Pence himself and his political history and of course the more I dug in the more pissed off I got because of what he's said and done throughout his career but even with all of that he is to me, the one guy who I could live with as President for a little less than 2 years or to the next election. I seriously never thought that I would ever show some support for Pence but as of right now anyone, and it doesn't matter who, would be better than Trump. There is no benefit or any logical reason or suggestion at all by keeping Trump in the drivers seat. He's done absolutely nothing at all for his own party and democrats and I say that because he obviously needs to lead our entire nation that means everyone no matter the color of anyone's skin or their religious beliefs being President of the United States carries the burden of running our military and to even think that Trump is capable of that is just insane. Pence on the other hand isn't dumbed down like the Donald and he actually is a well educated individual who lives in our reality. I donno, I could go on for hours and days lol but Trumps bullsh#t is getting old and im just sick of hearing him talk the way he does repeating himself and using the same words 10 times in one sentence and calling everything fake and bragging non stop and the worst part about everything is congress doing nothing about it. Paul Ryan deserves to be smacked in the face with a carp fish every time you see him standing behind Trump with the biggest smile on his face.....Trump supporting Republicans  are just as guilty and complicit for taken no action.....what ever happened to the Republican Party of Nixons day, you know the ones who actually care about our constitution??  Trump supporters will all surely vote for him again no doubt. However I am really confident that the majority of Americans won't make the same mistake again like last time by not voting. Every news channel in the mainstream media were  saying Trump only had a 1% chance of winning and so that's one reason why a lot of us didn't care to vote and I'm sure there are many other factors at play but what can you do. Midterms are around the cornerjackass, actually. haha.The sheer hypocrisy when they complain about the so called ‘liberal’ and biased corporate media channels like CNN, ABC and MSNBC and yet don’t bat an eyelid on how much of a partisan hack Fox News is Thank god I live in the UK and I have single-payer healthcare  The most notable difference in the relationship between North Korea and South Korea, has been the evolving leadership in both countries. There's now a Center-Left leader in SK, that seems far more interested in reducing tension and broadening cooperation. Trump has no role there other than to serve as an increased threat to the security of both nations. I'll remind you in case you forgot, that the last Nobel Peace Price winner was an organization fighting for denuclerization. Now you want to turn around and reward someone for breaking international law by implicitly threatening nuclear holocaust in a belligerent and lunatic fashion? If that is the case, wouldn't it be more reasonable to reward the Obama administration for their strategic patience, using computer viruses and other means of sabotage to derail the North Korean nuclear program? I wouldn't agree to that knowing the case with Iran all too well.. but it makes far more sense in my view.

Think about the presedence this sets for international diplomacy. Insanity and aggressiveness is not only cheered on by good ratings, .. but international recognition from a panel dedicated to peace. I'm not sure we need to normalize Trumps monstrosity further, and legitimise behavior/policy that is at this moment likely far more vile than we know. You do know he just brought on Mike Pompeo as Sec. Of State, and John Bolton? These people are lunatic fanatics.. Meanwhile, somehow.. there is cause to celebrate this diplomatic disaster of a presidency? Personally I'll await results, I will also be examining the outcome of his next year's in office, that do promise escalation considering these appointments. Historically you'll find a better case in Stalin. But no one is suggesting that knowing the totality of his brutal reign. 

Please understand, that affirmation of the madman thesis is dangerous in this day and age, not simply because we have come so close to nuclear war before, but because we are looking toward a future with immense instability, conflict and resource scarcity - combined with smaller tactical nuclear weapons. 

What we need is actual diplomacy, actual cooperation. Trump is the antithesis to this. Again... In truth, the POSSIBLE thawing of relations we are seeing is actually IN SPITE OF TRUMPS ACTIONS. Man are we lucky the North Koreans are more sane than some Americans.ah, gotcha.

"Greg Gutfeld should host next year!" \- Trump

loooooooooooli find the whole "god must exist or else everyone would be immoral" argument to be by far one of the weakest. lol at this clown&gt;that reality is a creation of consciousness.

that's actually a fun thought experiment though.Hello Trevor,

Now I've read your thread, here is what I want you to do, in order to reaffirm the validity of your commitment. Please make your way to the projects, or some predominantly black community. Once there I want strike up a conversation about this very topic with an African American, make sure to convey the scientific data that supports differences in IQ as best as you can and allow the that person(s) adequate time to best determine how to respond. 

The outcome I hope, would be that you realize how delusional, meaningless and offensive this exercise truly is. I'll suggest to you that for someone who is most certainly white, young and male, with no connection to academia or some research institution like you mentioned, the commitment to this topic should be minimal if you want to be not only considered intellectually honest and but a decent human being as well.

I'll be very blunt though, there has to be something wrong with you for if you are unable to recognize the problematic history of these ideas, where it originates, how it has developed, how the discussion is framed and by whom - and remain dedicated when you know how divisive and potentially harmful it can be, ... How does that not register for you? There is an outcome to all of this, and it is not pretty. 

We are living in a world that is growing ever more attached, connected and multicultural/multi-ethnic through necessity - with mass migration from (surprise) so many places in the Middle East, Asia or Africa projected to increase significantly. You see racism, isolationism and white supremacy on the rise in all countries affected throughout Europe and America. Furthermore, there's widespread fear, anger and frustration in minority populations in those very countries already for so many reasons. 

Meanwhile, this is the context where you want to spend your time discussing questions of race and IQ - and not only that, but you want to convince us that this is a worthwhile and important intellectual pursuit compared to ... economic equality? See this is the thing that people like Sam Seder, or anyone else on the Left take issue with. The discussion is biased, harmful and ultimately **pointless**. 

Honestly I think it's obscene, and condescending. I'll ask you to take my advice, stop talking about this with your white tribe online - take the conversation instead to the people you denigrate.

I'm sure it will serve you well in life. I'll second that.So JLP's best argument is Divine Command Theory? Y'know, that hypothesis that is thoroughly and completely routed in any introductory philosophy of ethics course?

I thought this guy was supposed to be a serious academic.I'll agree with thatgreat read.Relax freind, somethime we all need a helping hend. He strikes me as someone who is considered thoughtful within his own sphere, but generally does little thinking in reference to others or is somehow not exposed to serious challenges. He builds on his own concepts and ideas endlessly in a supportive function only because it is a part of his brand or lecture series, .. In truth, I doubt he is even a good academic. I say that because a decent academic would be aware of his limits, and naturally accommodates for perspectives outside his expertise, .. I've seen so many outlandish statements/claims by Peterson on historical matters as an example, that make it very clear he has no connection to that branch of academia whatsoever. He is building his belief structure on personal commitments and ideas within his field. 

Therefore, whenever we see him venture outside his bubble, like on Bill Maher for example, he puts forward these really cheap "profound" thoughts and proceeds to just leave them hanging. Hey, CommonMisspellingBot. Thanks buddy! 
By the way, just a quick heads-up: You don't even have a head. 
Too bad motherfucker. Have a nice day!Why is everything considered anti-Semitic? 

Edit: someone from the Israeli lobby must have downvoted me.Thanks for your reply David. I have seen your video commentary / deep dive on the race-IQ thing; it was very informative &amp; well done. So kudos for that mate!

But my question to you was more about how you think the two parties I.E. Sam &amp; Ezra behaved? I’m a Sam Harris fan but I’ve gotten very disillusioned by his behaviour recently. He is becoming more and more a vehement anti-SJW caricature, as in a more intellectual version of right wing hacks like Dave Rubin, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson etc. 

Btw have you considered bringing on Sam or Ezra as guests on your show? Would be a huge interview if it happens mate.Who does that?Harris and Pakman and Steven Pinker are my favorites.   Sedar's format and presentation bother me but like the Young Turks or Joe Rogan I like to get their take on things.  Peterson is wrong about most things but interesting and the illiberal idea of deplatforming him or strawmanning of Peterson's arguments causes me to defend him too often.  Pakman makes a better case for everything then Sedar and friends.  Unfortunately Sedar, like a bunch of our fellow progressives, often takes social justice warriorism too far and that is counterproductive to the righteous cause of social justice &gt; Easy solution to her problem: become something other than a highly corrupted, pro-big-business capitalist.

I'm going to write a reply to this comment, I'll post is a standalone thread here on the subreddit.I'm gonna call you out. 

What do you mean by supporting Communism? 

There is a wide variety of regimes, movements and ideologies that proclaim to be Communist or Socialist. You wouldn't necessary want to just brush over all of those with one come. That doesn't make much sense. There's a big difference between supporting Communists in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, or in Greece where they fought the authoritarian monarchy and supporting the brutal Stalinist regime in the height of the purges! 

The thing that is quite common to Marxist, Socialist or Communist movements is that they are concerned with anti-imperialism or colonialism, ending oppression, alienation and exploitation. How is this juvenile? Furthermore, what does it mean exactly to claim that these movements have always failed? To me, it sounds fairly disrespectful with regard to how many people died fighting for autonomy and a compassionate society. 

Now when we are talking about some of these main principles, like the abolishment of class, worker control over the means of production, abolishment of money and so on. Would you be able to point out a society that has managed to achieve this? Regardless of whether you believe this is objectively desirable, one would have trouble finding a society or regime that necessarily complies with the principles of Communism. That is not to say that the road toward good intentions is not paved with a large amount of cold bodies, the struggle to overcome disgruntled and entrenched factions in society is never easy, and there's a very valid criticism in the objection to radical change. 

I'll also remind you that Communism has been the "face" of indigenous, dispossessed and exploited people everywhere. It has also been a strong idea current throughout worker communities in countries everywhere, in "liberal arts academia" or the humanities generally. Nice to see that McCarthyism and anti-intellectualism is alive and well here on the Pakman reddit as well. 

Again I will also echo what you wrote here - doesn't it seem weird given what I just wrote to claim, that Communism will ALWAYS lose? What does it mean for it to lose, other than if you view it in this strange competitive way vis-a-vis capitalism? You don't have to be that reductionist in order to be happy that the USSR came to an end. 

"*How do you even invision implementation of a communist system without violence?*"

You can't (though never say never), and why would you have to? I'm not universally opposed to violence. That's impossible.Would you characterize the founding fathers, or any who fought in the American Revolutionary War, including George Washington extremist? 

There are countless revolutions to pick and chose from. You seem to be under the illusion that we can overcome all our differences by negotiation or conversation, that is simply .. delusional - and so blatantly false considering the wealth of historical knowledge we have of brutal ruling classes and authoritarianism. 

Most people do not live in the fantasy world we call the middle class suburbia. The world is big, messy and filled to the brim with suffering people. For some the road to this "mixed economy" equilibrium is not all that easy, as I'm sure you understand - especially when these "mixed economies" operate off of the exploitation of countries less advantaged by natural resources, technological capacity and weakened worker's rights. Now I'll be happy to agree with you, that I think we can have a decent world running the Scandinavian model - I live in Norway myself. There is however quite a long list of criticism of that mode of government, economy and so on that remain - and need to be addressed in one form or another. 

I'm a Communist though, because I favor the elimination of some very basic features, like money. I think debt, taxes and all the rest are unnecessary - or will be soon anyway. In between the time where we might see an opening toward Communism again, with the advancements in automation etc. I'll be happily standing next to you advocating for social democracy. How is that? Meanwhile, I'll ask you not to belittle my aspirations knowing, again the full context of this "ideology". God damn itThe fact that people still think Communism is viable after millions of deaths is baffling. Are you aware about what happened @ Evergreen? 
The full video is in the description if you're interested on the others (btw there was a case of friendly fire of people attacking these speakers in the past)

&gt;What is "the left"? And what does "eating itself" mean?

Did you actually watch the video? Because he goes over that, or are you just reading titles and typing w/e comes to mind. Like literally and explicitly answers those questions.

&gt;Are leftist not allowed to have heated disagreements with other leftists?

You most definitely did not watch the video because this is not what anyone is arguing for here. 

 What do you mean is it meant to sound profound? 

The Authoritarian left is constantly attacking people who hold nuanced views on anything that does not fit the oppressor vs oppressed narrative. (ANTIFA) 
I think it is important for those who consider themselves Left in the classical sense, or I guess libertarian left to be aware of what is going on. 

I recommend you watch this video: https://www.reddit.com/r/wakinguppodcast/comments/8gcnbe/bret_weinstein_how_the_magic_trick_is_done/

Edit: Just realized how absurd it is for me to link a video that is an hour long when you don't even watch 9 min video. Oh well, this might help someone who is actually interested. Oh wow. Incredibly stupid comment aside, You exist. I really thought you were parodies people create make fun of the SJW's. It is kind of weird though right? The Nazi's were bad and then you read what the communists did in Russia and china and you're like oh shit. They went above and beyond!

How about that. People who think Communism works still exist.  

Btw, You got to send me that message thanks to Capitalism. So you know, stop using the internet you're part of the problem ! lol  What a bizarre conclusion. Seems so out of touch with reality. 

You look at [ This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERd-2HvCOHI) where they are literally saying "the food water and chairs are for the black people, white people need to stand in the back"  and you don't think there's people trying to turn the tables of oppression? Turns out black bigotry exists, I know its kind of crazy right? Does not fit the narrative. Turns out humans can be shitty regardless of their skin tones. 

Btw Brett was an open Sanders supporter \(as was I\), so I guess you have to be full blown communist to be considered leftists according to you? 

You're one of the players in this game. Probably the 2nd according to this idea in game theory: [How the Magic Trick is done](https://www.reddit.com/r/wakinguppodcast/comments/8gcnbe/bret_weinstein_how_the_magic_trick_is_done/)

Yikes you've been living under a rock man. It is time to acknowledge that there is a problem with the authoritarian left and stop giving the far right more ammunition. Is it safe to assume you're ok with all forms of mass genocide? Are you pro Nazi's?
 Or are you just exclusively supportive to the Stalin brand of mass genocide? What about Castro's brand? Mao?

Assuming you're not okay with mass genocide, It may be a good idea you learn a little history. Communism was a god damn catastrophe and led to an almost unimaginable amount of death and suffering. 

To have the arrogance to think that Your brand of communism will work when others failed, is just the very definition of arrogance. I think it is time to mature a bit. 
Incredible! you watched over 1 hour of video in less than 20 minutes. You're definitely engaging in intellectually honest conversation.

Let me ask you this while I hold your short attention span. Are people in this subreddit all chapo crazies?

Pakman struck me as somewhat reasonable but is this place suffering from the same fate befallen @ the samharris sub?? Just taken over by far left ideologues?

Edit:

Wait Really?

&gt; I **never said**, nor can you pull from my initial response the majority of these implications. 

Do you suffer from short term memory loss?

&gt;*There's another population that does not wish equality of opportunity, what it wishes to do is to turn the tables of oppression*  
&gt;  
&gt;What on earth is this man talking about?

I did not say you implied that. That was a comment I made.

&gt; To me, this video should be titled *are centrists finally realizing they have been incorrectly thinking themselves as leftists* 

I guess I have to spell it out. A Bernie supporter, is incorrect to consider himself on the left? 

&gt; This response if full of nonsense.  

The only way your response makes any sense is if you change your period to a colon, you know like you're announcing "I'm about to spew some nonsense now:"Read my edit. You're kind of a hopeless case aren't you. You can't even see that you contradict yourself and blatantly lie about what you said and didn't say, which makes no sense because its like right there. 

Quoted and everything for you. I'm gonna end the conversation, I have no idea what to make of what happened here, short term memory loss? Schizophrenia? Emulating Trump? Something real weird took place. Good luck I guess. There are more than a few I suspect. Not that it matters. I refuse to engage with people who resort to name calling. 

If you apologize and engage in non ad-hominem arguments. We can talk. Otherwise good day sir!the gist of the article\- 

&gt; So just keep asking yourself, and asking others: Have you ever heard of a  multibillionaire who couldn’t pay a $130,000 bill and needed a 120\-day  or longer loan from his lawyer to cover the bill? 

in the end, it's speculative, but what i find interesting is part of giulliani's little spiel in the past couple days was that "$130,000 wasn't much money" and something like, "if it were a lot of money, there'd be merit to the campaign finance violations" but clearly if he was broke then 130K is a kick in the nuts.&gt; Says the idiot

We're done.Capitalism, boooooo!The United States has been a commercial empire from the time of its founding. There is empire written in the foundation of the United States, it can be readily found in the constitution, developed under the expansion against the native population from the 17th century. Its main concerns has always been securing economic growth through access to new lands, resources and markets - in this respect, we can view America as a synthesis of every empire that existed contemporaneously to its founding. 

Here I would read about the US involvement in the Opium Wars for example, but more importantly the long history it has as a regional hegemon in Latin America and North America. This is where the pillars of foreign policy was developed and put into place. Look up the Monroe Doctrine and the Open Door policy specifically. Here it took on the feature that everything that happens around the world, can in one way or another be interpreted as being relevant to US national interests. 

In the process the US becomes incredibly expansionist. However, understanding the context of which these historically colonial empires evolve, the Dutch, French, British, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Russian, some leaders learning from the instability enslavement and direct control causes, adapted a more sophisticated method to maintaining economic control - using some minor involvement, kinetic operations, sponsoring regional forces and leaders, rigging elections for example. 

Here I would have to disagree with you, and I believe a body of historical scholars do as well, that empire was not thrust upon the United States when considered this more lengthy history. You could say that it was the fashion of the age to become an empire, but the size and demographic makeup of the United States, being massive and overall settled by Europeans, made conquest and empire natural. The same remains the case today with countries like Russia who know they should have a more central role in the world.

When it comes to more modern time, and the question whether the US would have become imperial without these large involvements in European and Pacific wars - I've already answered the question somewhat, which is that I believe it would have happened regardless. However, I suspect you are right to some extent, in that the decline of the British empire did leave a power vacuum all around the world that the United States was directly urged to fill by Winston Churchill while Truman and Eisenhower were in office. But the expansion and preparation for the move into the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Africa was already started under FDR. 

There is so much that contributed to the US becoming a global hegemon though, from nuclear weapons to more diplomatic events, but the impetus to go further and secure connections, resources and markets was already there to begin with - I believe if you studied the circumstances and history more closely, you would find that this idea that the US unintentionally took or hesitantly took on the mantle of US leadership or becoming an empire is ... complicated and dangerous. Mainly because it dispels the effect that some historical currents have, the intention to become empire that was clearly there - some leaders actively sought US imperial expansion not out of moral duty, but because it generated more wealth and power. You can't claim benevolence when the end result is subjugation and exploitation.

To briefly reply to the last comment on Russia; are they truly attacking American Democracy? I'm not so sure.Viva la revolución. my 50\-year\-old morbidly obese brother\-in\-law regaled us all at easter about how he epically trolled the libs on his facebook page by posting a meme showing hitler with facts about him being a vegetarian and anti\-guns etc etc.

just pointing out the striking similarities between the 14\-year\-old literal neckbeard at the beginning of the vid and my retired\-teacher 50ish\-year\-old BiL, both using the ol' argumentum ad hitlerum.Search it up Not necessary to view this article. I do not have a subscription either. Perhaps it is because I have Ublock? Probably offended and will talk about how this girl wants to make money off her anti SJW stance. The usual. I'm a historian, with a focus on US foreign policy. Just so you know. There is no need for combativeness, insults or these nonsense rhetorical questions. 

There is a reason I mentioned the Open Door Policy specifically, because in many ways it does make up the central component in the foreign policy approach used to this day. You might find that to be horsecrap, arguably that would land you in the "factually dismissive" camp and disqualify you from this discussion, I will however attempt to ignore that for the time being.

&gt; "If America didn't assert itself as a global superpower, your country would either be under Nazi or Soviet rule today - and China and Australia would now be part of the Japanese Empire."

This claim postulates alternative histories, and there are many variables that make this difficult to determine. Had Nazi Germany emerged victories we could certainly have remained under their control to this day in Europe, that is quite possible. Though as we all know Germany did not win the war - the Soviet Union did, through a collective sacrifice unparalleled in military history. There are some important contributions that deserve recognition no doubt, like the British efforts across the channel to dismantle the German Air Force, the occasional funding and supplies from the United States, and the civilian vessels that managed to keep these supply lines open. That said, even Winston Churchill admitted that the Soviets tore the guts out of the German war machine. There would be no path to victory had the Soviets buckled. Therefore, I believe we can lay the Nazi scenario aside and focus on the Soviet.

Now what suggests to you that Stalin would have continued to occupy the rest of Europe at the time? From what I can tell, the Soviets were quite conciliatory from the beginning. Roosevelt had fostered a good relationship with the Stalin and attempted whenever possible to reduce tension between Churchill and Stalin - who by the way, also managed to come to some arrangement whereby he relinquished support for the Greek uprising. The postwar consensus was determined by a few important concessions, this much is true, - The Soviet interest was mainly to make sure that they would never experience an invasion from Germany ever again, therefore, closing the Polish corridor was of paramount importance - and they continued to seek recognition. This is all understandable. But something significant changed with the election of Harry Truman and the development of the Atomic Bomb. The United States used that instrument to threaten, and ultimately poison the relationship with the Soviet Union, turning them more aggressive, assertive and adventurous. I'll remind you that you do not have to reject these failures in diplomacy in order to remain patriotic. 

To combat your argument, the entire point is a strawman fallacy. There is a difference between the United States being a large player on the international arena contributing moral leadership and being a belligerent, destabilizing, colonial and imperial power. Is it even necessary to mention Iran? How the US sent Kermit Roosevelt in to foment a coup against a Democratically elected Prime Minister. Neither if I can say am I supportive of a excessive use of violence, like the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the firebombing in both Europe and Japan - which had no effect compared to the threat of invasion from the Russian front. This is well established in the historical community by the way. The United States did sacrifice and ensure that the Pacific theater was won, I have my criticisms of how that war was won, like I mentioned above, same with the Soviet rape and looting of Germany and Poland at the end of the war. But I'm able to recognize the contribution regardless for both countries. That does not however justify crimes, atrocities and mismanagement in the future. Like I said, the whole point was a strawman - overall I support the US war effort during World War 2, I can't see how that makes me an imperialist however but okay. The Allies needed to win the war. 

As for your second comment here, I believe you misunderstood what I was getting at here. Russia is not necessarily attacking US Democracy today, to be honest I do not think the United States is all that democratic - so what I was questioning is the category. I think it is more accurate to claim that Russia is attacking or attempting to weaken a particular power structure that would impede the global reach that they currently exert - specifically, they are attempting to undermine the establishment administrators of the empire, like Hillary Clinton. From a Russian perspective of course Donald Trump would be more desirable. He is incompetent and will only contribute to further decline in US power. There's an important context to what Russia is doing at the moment, but I believe it is too controversial for you to wrap your brain around so I'll leave that out - only to say that I believe I know Russia and their propaganda system well, so you can retract that comment altogether. 

Getting back on track, again in the next paragraphs you make similar claims or expand on the arguments you have already given. You are massively incorrect. The US could not have subjugated every country on the planet in the military sense, but it did subjugate the world as far as was possible and in accordance with what policymakers understood about the adverse effects of direct colonialism. The United States managed to occupy most of the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and to some extent Asia. Despite recently closing hundreds of bases in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States still maintains nearly 800 military bases in more than 70 countries and territories abroad—from giant “Little Americas” to small radar facilities. Britain, France and Russia, by contrast, have about 30 foreign bases combined. 

In Europe, the United States constructed large scale institutions that would further their strategic dominance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the United Nations. These are and have been overwhelmingly in support of the United States, with some important exceptions in the UN where dissidence has arisen to US crimes since it is a forum for so many nations. George F. Kennan, developed the Containment Policy, used both against China and Russia to this very day. In the postwar period the Soviet Union was completely isolated, and NATO has only increased its territory further East after the USSR disintegrated. 

Meanwhile, in the Mediterranean and Middle East the US casually supported the imperialism of Britain in the beginning, crushing the rebellion in Greece against the Monarchy, helped to overthrow the Democratic leader in Iran, sponsored regime change elsewhere, built a network of client states from Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt and Iraq. There's no need to go on, but I would suggest reading Andrew Bacevich, one of the finest military and diplomatic historians of our time. The US effectively owns these countries by sponsoring their military, grooming their leaders, using threats and bribes when needed to make sure they stay in line. 

Ultimately I think the case is devastating for the US. Alongside the French and British, they have effectively destroyed secular Arab nationalism - mainly because it threatened their economic and military control. Even during the war in Afghanistan, the opium fields were left alone because the alternative would be mass cotton production - which the United States itself relies on.  

&gt; I'm not saying the US is the greatest country in the world. Hell, I've got my complaints, that's for sure. But if you look at the alternative timelines we could have had in the world, I feel like we got pretty god damn lucky for that "American Empire",

Look at alternative timelines? That is almost irrelevant to criticism of ACTUAL HISTORY. This attitude is so redundant and anti-intellectual. "Things could be worse - so why complain?". Yes, I'm glad about some leadership from the United States compared to North Korea ruling the world, I can still be a critique to imperialism, which has brought the US and people elsewhere immense suffering. How many American veterans commit suicide every day? How many children did the US sanctions against Iraq kill? How much damage to Nicaragua did the US sponsored terror campaign do? What the fuck was the point of the war in Vietnam? Why did the US have to arm, train and facilitate the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan and elsewhere to bait the USSR into their own Vietnam leading to extremists taking over the region? Then the US turns around and destroys the Saddam regime that were keeping the terrorists at bay, (I don't support Saddam). 

Has the attack on 9/11 not taught you anything? People fucking hate the United States for their imperialism. 

Nah, I'll stop being critical of empire and target the Republican Party instead. (I do that all the time.) 
Here's something that will satisfy your tribalistic mindset: Harry Truman refused to kill Mossadegh in Iran. The British had to wait for a Republican, Eisenhower the anglophile, to come into office and decide to pull the trigger. Overall I would agree that Republicans have been more responsible for aggressive imperialism compared to Democratic presidents. *"It may not be a saint but it has been a savior."*

Hilarious. Did you get that from a movie?What happened?Prejudice doesn’t just mean hatred it can mean treating or viewing someone else different because of who they are. The rule applies to blacks, Muslims and others. Does he mention things like a ‘gay agenda’ Wrong read above That one was classic You mean Sarah Hackabee Slander and Kellyanne Conartistway? If identity politics is used as a distraction like Clinton did in order to distract voters from her lack of policy substance then its bad. If it’s used to divide people and that the more oppressed you are the more virtuous you are. then it’s also still bad I wrote my bachelor thesis on the Contra war. Selling weapons to Iran while under an arms embargo is the least horrible part of the story, .. He also facilitated the massive funneling of narcotics into California mainly, to the detriment of communities and people. This man was willing to kill his own people to continue a state sponsored terror campaign using death squads, to kill innocent Nicaraguens who wanted an end to dictatorship and exploitation. Oliver North is a human rights abuser and a traitor.Thank you for the link. I will check it out.

In thinking about the future of AI and AGI it is inevitably true that something resembling the Scandanavian countries has to be at least attempted!

Correct me if I am wrong but I believe the largest job in the US is Drivers. With Australia having had a successful run of a Driverless Truck Crossing continent and back, it is only a matter of time before drivers become "obsolete."

It begs the question, what are these people going to do? It is not just blue collar jobs either, A.I has been shown to outperform lawyers, Doctors, Financial Advisors, even complex games such as Go.  The value of a human being is going to have to shift a bit. What can be done that accounts for this and does not lead to Venezuela. Nothing seems obvious. 

Reading articles like the one I posted gives you pause that is for sure. 

Politics is not my cup of tea as I agree with this Yudkowski: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer 

I tried to force myself to learn a little about them in small doses but it is always so ideologically charged that it is almost impossible to understand objectively. An example being another person who posted who did not bother to engage with the article at all but just posted a snarky different title and called it a day. 

Anyway, Thank you for the video link again. What makes you think Yudkowski is Right-Wing biased?&gt;ask yourself in advance what you would say if that point were decisively refuted. Would you relinquish your previous conclusion? Would you actually change your mind? If not, maybe that point isn’t really the key issue.

Interesting Read. The quote above makes sense to me. I am not entirely sure why he states that it would lead him to vote republican, I am not aware of the background behind this article so I am probably missing something.


Was there something in that argument you linked that you think is wrong? If so Why? &gt;I don't know why you would connect his libertarianism with voting Republican

Oh because it literally says in the article that would vote republican. So I was just stating that I don't get the statement he made there. 

&gt; I only linked it to show he is right-wing.

Apologies, I thought you posted the article in disagreement. I see you were posting it to illustrate that he leans Right.


Would you be willing to elaborate more on what is wrong with the article I posted then? 

It seems to me that West Germany did better than East. As Did south Korea vs North Korea. Chile doing better than Venezuela.  

I think it is safe to assume that you disagree with the arguments presented in the article, but I am blind to them, Where am I going wrong here? 

Edit: Arguments not TopicsGood luck rehabilitating Bill Clinton.After David recommended Steemit, I started getting an ungodly amount of spam. Damn you, David!You provide ample evidence that the United States deserves to be taken over by Jihadis. Nationalize Google now. ASAP!I’ve got it on secular talk vids as well I'm being somewhat reactionary. This is not something I have any strong opinion on. However, ideally we would want to start rolling back the power that these tech companies have, nationalizing and operating it as a public utility. I am particularly sceptical about the development of artificial intelligence within these undemocratic institutions, knowing how easily it can be used against people for the pursuit of profit, social engineering or other potentially disastrous ends. People like Mark Zuckerberg should never have been allowed to wield such power, the same is also true of Google, regardless of the technological achievements made on the back of exploiting and manipulating their users. 

The problem is... Government is broken and corrupted. 

There are few responsible agents or entities present to take on the challenge of controlling this development - making sure AI is not used at the whims of the market or by the bottom line. Therefore, we are in quite the bind.. No one should be allowed to exploit AI. Knowing how things stand now, it will surely be exploited.no because i use ublock originI always find it curious how none of them has realized we could just as well turn around and say: "Yeah, we actually like Mexicans, Italians, Egyptians, Iranians, Kenyans and Indonesian. What we do not appreciate is young white males preaching division based on race theory and other pseudoscience. We'll go ahead and a spell you from our society."

The argument is so reflexive. You're not wrong. I did Strawman. Still I am not gonna respond to name calling, not of any high around or w/e you're talking about, I just see it as pointless. Just not my thing. 

It certainly did not change my view on Communism having led to disaster every time.

Some of the more reasonable people here led me to take a second look at Socialism.

 But you're not wrong. Democratic Socialists of America.https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/the-intellectual-dark-web-and-having-civil-debate-1228134979570?playlist=associated

MSNBC Morning Joe has her on to talk about it.  There good are counterpoints to it online from the left and the right like Vox, Slate, and National review.

I find this new and vague genre/movement extremely interesting.  I am a big fan of Sam Harris and Steven Pinker. The others not so much but I think they all be good indicators of how the winds are blowing especially Joe Rogan.

Pakman is my favorite political progressive and poli-sci guy.Whoa the man himself! Thanks David and keep up the good work.  Again I am a big fan

The responses to this article by Bari are very interesting too.  I like the Slate and National Review ones best...

Jordon Peterson and Sam Harris(and Douglas Murray) will have a public discussion in two months.  Tension has been building between Sam and Jordan for a while now and I expect sparks to fly come July.  Jordon keep slowly sliding to the unreasonable right and I expect Harris to hit him hard on that as Harris has hinted at that.
https://www.axs.com/events/352430/sam-harris-jordan-peterson-douglas-murray-ticketsHarris and Rubin recently? When and where? ThanksPinker often is categorized in this way for whatever reasons.  He has been on Rogan's podcast a few times and Rubin's once.  Rogan and Rubin's shows are often the nexus for the "IDW"

I am also a fan of the Weinsteins and Nawaz.  

Yeah like most comedians Rogan is a likable guy.

I have listen to all of Rogan's podcasts except the new MMA specific ones.  He is a podcasting pioneer.  Rogan is smart enough to know politics and political science if he studied it as he has studied other things but he won't and that bothers me sometimes.  He represents to me the quintessential thoughtful man who is too busy to prioritize politics and poli-sci.  I think he is a great indicator of which way the winds are blowing.

Russell Brand has a podcast as well. I guess he is the furthest left/progressive intellectual that I dig a lot.  His podcast with Harris, and then the podcast a week later with Jordan Peterson are epic in my opinion.  I would pay to see Brand and Ben Shapiro discuss!People like Peterson, Harris, Rubin and Molyneux should either be  gulagd, sent to reeducation camps preferably exiled to a remote island in the Atlantic ocean. Molyneux seems to be universally disdained by liberals but I haven't seen anything that clearly shows he deserves it. But I haven't looked to hard either.  If you or anyone else has an example or even better links to things he has said that are clearly disdainful then could you please give them to me here? Thanks

These people and their fans often link themselves together.  I would say it is a vague but growing movement.

Pakman on Rogan's show is an excellent idea.  Pakman would drop some mad knowledge and structure on Rogan.  Both Kyle Kulinski and Jimmy Dore(who I often disagree with and is my least favorite lefty) was on the JRE not too long ago.  I would disagree but I probably have a lower bar for intellectual. Would you also not consider Dave Rubin an intellectual(I might agree there).  Ben Shapiro?  Is "thought leader" a better word?"and the trews as good"???  Would you say they are engaging in intellectual discourse?  Who is your example of a modern right wing American intellectual then? In the duel podcast with Sam Harris and Russel Brand...

Brand was to the left of Harris who is a solid liberal/progressive.  It seems to me that Brand was even post-modernist(and as so was maybe the only person to present post-modernist arguments that I thought were reasonable) and argued more along social justice lines.  Brand seems particularly concerned with "power" and who is wielding it unjustly and how to break it up.  But I as a black man would prefer knowing that the person has openly served me irrespective of my race and not serving me or other just because the government has a gun to his/her head. Instead of the government wasting time and bringing lawsuits and fines on the scumbag boycotts hits the person were it hurts most. The Montgomery bus boycott is an example of a successful boycott. How do we feel about this comrades?Discrimination will always happen and one can stop someone’s who wants to discriminate  only by putting a gun on their head Stop posting cancerous clips of that right-wing shill who can’t stop criticising the left and caricaturing them and barely criticising the right because their opposition to gay marriage, abortion and pot which are things he claims to support. He’s not for the market place of ideas as he only invites people who are either moderate or right-wing nutjobs. would you say that 99% of people recognize what Rubin and Shapiro do as intellectual discourse?  Does it not fit the textbook definition of intellectual discource?  Are there any well known liberal intellectuals  or are they also like conservative and never well known?He was Red pilled by post-9/11 Christopher Hitchens.Technology of this kind should never be allowed to come into contact with the free market. That's a principle position for me. Developing these robocalls to deceive people, which is exactly what they are doing, is a good clear example. None of this technology should be allowed to rest in the hands of private individuals, with almost no democratic oversight or control in place. I'll remind you of the extensive history of psychological manipulation in the marketing industry. This is being continuously innovated because the market forces behind rapid consumerism is so powerful. Once Artificial Intelligence really comes into play, I mean .. God only knows what problems we'll have. The recent scandal with Cambridge Analytics has illustrated that point open sufficiently. Places like Facebook, Twitter, and so on have now become unregulated public spaces where big companies and foreign governments can manipulate on an industrial level. Totalitarianism is within reach.

Don't get me wrong though, AI is enormously important - but I doubt we need a unrestrained Google to have that technology come to fruition. Like I said earlier, some of this conversation is mute since we have no real option in opposing certain aspects of  the development, when our own government is so corrupted by the same forces that inevitably seek to wield the power of AI.this is the first one that i've been able to make it through for similar reasons; the message itself is on point.Hah, leftists propaganda you use to try to disscredit ideas that are good and Nobel. That David Parkman loser hes no idea about the truth of right wing hknsety. I suspect that if went to match wits with Ben Shapiro he would get yanked. Loser Parman!I should be more impressed with your raving obsession with boats! Boats all over your house and shit.just seems like an incredibly convoluted, horrifically inhumane method for the jewish people to be "brought again unto their land" when as god he could just, you know, let them have it. without the genocide.&gt;Kim got all he wanted

elaborate? this is not a troll questionscary stories to tell in the dark, every fourth grader's introduction into horror literatureI think this whole thing is intellectually dishonest. I am sad to see David get involved. What’s actually happening is a rejection of a framework work debate. Both sides do this, think hatriots, it’s a giant subtle ad hominem. I think a good example of this is Mr. Shapiro. Personally I find his framework wrong, destructive,and generally formed from false information. That doesn’t make him not a intellectual it makes his intellectualism dangerous and when the left dismisses him out of hand it doesn’t help our side. We often have good arguments we just for what ever reason don’t use them. Also the original article lumped Rubin ( who isn’t and intellectual) and Sam Harris who is. You may disagree with their framework conclusions but that doesn’t make them wrong.just like disagreeing with Kant on morality doesn’t make Kant not and intellectualSure, except insulting someone is probably considered responding. this the dude that mentioned haidt in the youtube comments?

bro you gotta work on your punctuation. i oftentimes skim through the cesspool that is the youtube comment section and had to literally stop at your post and parse out what you were trying to say. it left such an impression on me \(as in, "oof, this is a mess to read"\) that i immediately recognized who this was within the first few words of your first sentence of this post \(even if you hadn't mentioned haidt again\).

apologies if i came off like an ass. then again, hey, some authors take years to hone a recognizable voice, and here i am recognizing your writing within a few words.

oh shit is this the guy who called in the other day and hung up after you got a quick suggestion from david? whatup dudeYou are making a moral judgement call. His data backs up his framework argument. You are actually being anti-intellectual in this post. You are creating a normative framework and excluding all arguments outside of it. Do I agree with Harris, no but not because his data isn’t valid. It because he’s making the fallacy of correlation versus causation. You know and actual argument. What’s sad is the right has a point on this aspect of life. The left often denies and invalidates people on the right entirely because their frameworks collide with theirs. You may think his race theory is bad. That doesn’t make him and anti-intellectual. That’s and ad hominem that reinforces your framework and denies his meaning you don’t have to actually consider or argue against his point. Want to see this in action got watch the hundreds of SJW gets owned videos. You want to know why they get “owned” it’s because Shapiro and others like him are just a little more clever then their opponents. This is because many on the left are told this is the framework the world operates under anyone who doesn’t agree is wrong and is some form of -ist(place your preferred one here) regardless of data, logic, or arguments. That is anti-intellectual. What’s sad is the left has the arguments. I weep when people talk to Shapiro about racism and he asks them to prove it. You watch people talk to Shapiro and his ilk and watch them fish gulp as he responds. It because they haven’t been taught that what they are talking about isn’t reality. It’s a framework it’s perception. It’s as old as Plato’s allegory of the cave. We are all interpreting shadows on the wall and to say someone else’s shadows aren’t valid because they contradict yours doesn’t make you right. Turning around and seeing reality does and the only way to do that is to actually debate them and accept when they are valid no matter how much it hurts. You are never as good and your enemy is never as evil as you are lead to believe.Shapiro is easy to beat. Every thing he states is either a bag of logical fallacies or his data is bad and biased. The only thing he has going for him is that he’s just that much more clever then the people he debates. I have guys I work with who listen him and bring up his points. 7 our of 10 times I can ruin his comments. I’ll give you a example. He has a famous video we’re he “debates” a lady from BLM. He asked her to give one example of systemic racism. She of course falls for his bait, he is clever I give him that. She talks about cops killing black men. He rips with BJS stats his supporters cheer. The correct response is sentencing for crimes. That super racist. Honestly watch a video we’re Shapiro gets schooled. He folds like a house of cards. If you got him locked in a real forensic league style debate any novice LD or CX debater would own him.I would like a definition of intellectual first. That’s my problem with this debate. Disagreeing with a framework or data interpretation doesn’t make you a faux intellectual. I would think placing a normative narrative and saying anything that falls outside of it is wrong, regardless of validity is pretty anti-intellectual. It’s also just not the right. The left has this issue as well. On issues like the wage gap, domestic violence, and sexual assault on campuses. When you actually dig into them the studies that support them have some fairly shady/weak methodology sections. When someone calls that out they aren’t anti-intellectual. They are attacking the framework which is using that data to validate it. Just because it doesn’t fit your world view doesn’t mean their wrong. If you just dismiss it because you don’t like it in the end all you do is reinforce those who do. Both sides have this outrage echo chamber and we are starting to see them boil over. Long story short because some of their claims are valid but all of their claims are dismissed for stupid reasons and that sprinkle of truth reinforces the lies.This was a joke comment. Thanks thoughThe best body builder ever, Ronnie Coleman, was a Texas state Trooper. Roids are rampant in the police and military Harris does include himself in the self-sarcastically titled grouping.  The DWI is a vague grouping.  Joe Rogan is tossed in there and like Rubin he isn't that intellectual but he provides an intellectual space for this type of stuff.  There are some others who are much more similar to Harris like Steven Pinker, Gad Saad, and the Weinstein brothers(and one wife).  These people have all had podcasts with one another so that is what makes them the core.  I would also like to see Russell Brand in there and he is pretty close as well.  Pakman could easily get in on the action and raise the level of discourse as I would ke to see that well! Pakman and Brand would round out the left side of this thing rather nicely.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn2tNXIvXtgPeterson also tends to come off bad whenever he does Fox News stuff.  His argument for Vice News was lousy too.  I like him and find his movement interesting as hell but his political and cultural stances are lousy.  He is great at motivational speaking, psychology, and free speech advocacy.Peterson is a cultural actor.  He is doing other things like motivational speaking/writing but he is trying to frame the cultural and politics is downstream from culture.I does if you get Obamacare or the Medicaid expansion the Dems are responsible for.  Or if you care about the people who do.  The Dems are clearly better then the Republicans.  The Dems are clearly more progressive now then they were a few years ago tooThat's a great point!I listen too him often as well.  He is the best the pro-Trump hard core conservative out there. He is also likely the conservatives future talk head leader.  If anything is breaking through on the hard right then he will reflect that,  I agree with you.  Yeah Ben is often a massive prick.  His stances on the Israeli Palestinian conflict seems deeply clouded by emotion and his bias is most prominently displayed with that.&gt;She thinks it was great that he changed the capital of Israel.

nuance is lost on these people. US embassy opened there = he changed the capital of israel. wutThat’s fine as long as your self effacing. But your views are exactly that your views. We all are a little authoritarian (more like a lot) it’s why I subscribe to realpolitik and at best am a moral relativist, if not a nihilist. Power is the only truth in my world. Everything else is just a means to it. Democracy only works because we all fear someone else will take all the power so we cling to the fraction we have. Absolute power doesn’t corrupt it just lets us express the corruption already their. Trust me my views are much more inline with yours. I may give them a chance to look behind the and stop starring at shadows but if they refuse because they like the pictures on the wall....fuck um. This is, ironically, and intellectual exercise for me to deconstruct my framework and find its flaws. I think Peterson, Shapiro and especially that sponge Rubin are ass hats who need a good intellectual beating and if they don’t listen after that maybe a physical one. I know the beast of my nature. It’s why I’d never run for President.🙃I suggest you go grab a book on the history of the Iran Iraq war. Read it then come back to me and say why you think this is a good idea. Honestly the only dumber decision Trump could make is to invade North Korea. 
A. Iran has a large and robust military. This military is also fairly fanatic. They have just around half a million people under arms a navy capable of making operations in the Persian gulf difficult. An intact air defense network with the ability to detect current gen stealth. Also a fairly modern tank core with around 2000 units.
B. Geographically it would be hard. With their influence in Iraq a land base staging ground would be hard. They have mountains and the Caspian to the north and east. The gulf to the south. The only invasion route is from Iraq or amphibious. It would be insanely hard to invade.
C. It would piss of at least two nuclear powers. Russia through Syria is close to Iran and have a strategic alliance. You also have Pakistan who would not like being surrounded.
D. It would fracture the Middle East. Iran would call on foreign fighters who could/would conduct terror operations across the region destabilizing multiple governments.
E.we would have few allies. Europe would not join us. We would have few real allies out side of Israel and Saudi Arabia who’s involvement could contribute to the point above.

This is a bad idea most people who want war have no idea what we would face. wait, what does he mean you can get the whole banana that way? have people not been eating the whole banana? i've never peeled a banana, and not gotten the whole banana.

this shit is bananas.Good news is at least we don’t have to worry about Trump committing us to a tremendously awful deal. If they had meet he we have negotiated like a dude in a dive bar at closing anything to get the piece of paper. I only have confidence in one thing for Trump to negotiate, how much it costs to put his name on stuffSo hypothetical situation. You find out the Russian government gave money to Hilary through a shell company and a Super PAC. Are you angry? You know that would be legal and the Super Pac would not legally need to disclose where they got the money.Exactly put the Super PAC doesn’t have to disclose where they get money. So you would never know.


What if a multinational company gave money to a SuperPac, like Exxon who will benefit if a Syrian pipeline is built.The point is we don’t know who is financing elections anymore or why. We need a public fund for elections.He also farted on the subway when he was five. So I loath Rubin. I listened to his show expecting him to challenge his guests to have open conversations. (That his stick right?) No in the least I don’t think I have ever heard him say anything beyond. That’s interesting, I didn’t know that, or I don’t agree but you make a good point. He is a pathetic mouth piece who I don’t think has any idea on the topics he speaks on. Out of all the people called supposed intellectuals he actually fits the bill and David’s debate with him proved itArticle is written by Anthony Fisher of the Daily Beast. It’s brutal &amp; beautiful.&gt;“He  was angry at God because women were rejecting him,” Mr. Peterson says  of the Toronto killer. “The cure for that is enforced monogamy. That’s  actually why monogamy emerges.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr.  Peterson does not pause when he says this. Enforced monogamy is, to him,  simply a rational solution. Otherwise women will all only go for the  most high\-status men, he explains, and that couldn’t make either gender  happy in the end.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Half the men fail,” he says, meaning that they don’t procreate. “And no one cares about the men who fail.”  
&gt;  
&gt;I laugh, because it is absurd.  
&gt;  
&gt;“You’re laughing about them,” he says, giving me a disappointed look. “That’s because you’re female.”

[obviously](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/151/590x/secondary/consciousnes-831849.jpg)&gt;I'm failing to understand this doublethink.

or "we should control women's sexuality so men have equal access, but we shouldn't enforce equality for everything else"

oh, the hypocrisy.ah, like when stefan molyneux "reviews" movies and calls movies anti\-men propaganda and female protagonists unrealistic mary sues. gotcha.Peterson is not a religious ideologue. He is a Christian who doesn't really believe that Christ was/is a real person/entity!   He doesn't believe that the Bible is literally true! He doesn't believe that Christianity is the only way.  To me he is some kind of post-modern Christian.  Maybe a post-modern conservative as well.

Not sure how you define the mainstream left but I would say the mainstream left is not that concerned with Peterson and many don't know who he is(yet?).  I don't think he has ever been on or addresses by any shows on CNN or MSNBC but he has been on Fox News a bunch of times.  He is still largely confined to niche internet audiences.

As long as Peterson has his niche but sizable audience and occasionally says, with clarity and emphasis, laughable and outrageous things the media will highlight him for it. It is amusing!

Peterson complains about post-modernism all the time(and I often agree with him on that) but he also sounds very post-modern much of the time.  His view of "truth" seems completely subjective. 

That a dragon is really real, more real then anything, a solid, important, and necessary representation of something, is a subjective truth. 

"It makes sense that witches live in a swap" is a subjective truth. It doesn't make sense to me that they live in swamps.  I thought they lived in old scary castles! It makes sense that alligators live in swamps.

His lectures on religion and archetypes is post-modern in nature.  In his now famous argument with Sam Harris about truth Peterson is arguing a post-modern approach to truth.

Peterson is sometimes unfairly representative and critiqued but this is probably the most fair and most critical I have read.  His phenomenon and the much more broad "intellectual dark web" movement is certainly interesting and I watch it closely.David, I signed up for Steemit like you had suggested in one of your videos, and was immediately bombarded by an onslaught of spam. To this day, I receive spam every ten minutes all throughout the day. Damn you, David Parkman! 

I too signed up for steemit but I've received no spamWhat makes you think that our societies have less intellectual sense now then they have had before?It is on its way to over a million YouTube views in less then 2 days(I think).  And this is a weekend!  This sounds to me very high and fast for this kind of thing? Does anyone else agree or have an idea about these numbers for this kind of thing?Ha.  He and others on the right of the "IDW" are on the ascension whether we like it or not.Peterson's other stuff has not done nearly this well before.  I think there are substantial anti-Peterson and neutral viewers tuning in as well Michael Eric Dyson and Peterson really go at it!Slightly off topic, obviously Hamas are dangerous and bad actors, but I think maybe it is not right to call every member of Hamas a terrorist.  Some Hamas members commit terrorist acts yes but most do not correct?  They do not rule over their subjects like we imagine terrorits like ISIS do.  Members of Hamas should not be seen and treated automatically as enemy combatants correct?I see where you are coming from but the vast majority of the American people will never support sacrificing thousands of American lives and a trillion or two dollars to help foreigners.  The staggering price tag alone could have paid for all of our healthcare and education. It would be instant political suicide for a politician to support American sacrifice like this for foreigners and that would go for a politician of any other nation as well.I think treating everyone in Hamas as terrorists/enemy combatants is counterproductive.  The Gaza population would likely further rally to support Hamas.  I think an individual can't be treated as an enemy combatant/terrorist until an individual has or is in the process of committing terrorism.  I understand that there are members of Hamas who do nothing or just feed kids.  Does Isreal arrest people who claim to be members of Hamas but have committed no crimes?Whatever it is... it is way too much!Putin blows!What are you a Kurd in Iran or something?  Obviously the UN would not say it is legalAnd it is particularly hard on the right side of the IDW.  I posted on this Pakman sub already and some commenters https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GxYimeaoea0

https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/8kp569/pc_debate_over_350k_viewers_in_less_then_8_hrsi/This looks like it will get a million YouTube views this weekend. Much higher and faster then anything like this before correct? Why?What did you think of the Dyson's use of "mean WHITE man"? I think he went to far but maybe it was a stunt he did on purpose to draw attention.  wait, trump misspelled his own wife's name? how did he spell it? melanya? milania?

lolben shapiro\- "racism isn't a big deal anymore. i'm jewish and i turned out fine"You do sound like you are trolling in this subI don't think factoring in a person race like that is necessarily important.   There are plenty of people of color who have the exact same views which really weakens race as a factor.  You could argue(and I would agree) that a white person or anyone else with some kind of privilege is more likely to hold these views but an individual's race is not the sole factor for why one may hold those views.  Arguing against the idea is more effective then arguing against a motive for the idea because we can agree on the definition of an idea but it is often impossible to agree on motives.  Questions one's motive is always problematic.

I think it was counterproductive to call him "white" as an argument.  I think it was said to draw attention to Dyson, or to Peterson, or Peterson's ideas(or all of it) and maybe in that way it is worth it.

It is damn close to calling him a racist. Most people will hear it as calling him a racist. In fact I would call it a thinly veiled dog whistle for "racist".  That is not going to win over hearts and minds.  I am a very progressive liberal who disagrees with Peterson on almost everything and it makes me want to take his side for a moment. Attacking him as a racist is wrong and will rally people to his side. Someone can be wrong on a racial issue, or prejudiced, or even rascally insensitive and not be a racist.  It is counterproductive to the righteous cause of combating prejudice and racism, of winning the hearts and minds of people on the wrong side of racial and social justice.

Similar unfair attacks have been made against Sam Harris and I don't like that either.  We also can't act like every conservative and everyone on the political or cultural right is a racist.

We all know that there are plenty of non-white people with the same beliefs as Peterson.  When a black man has the same beliefs as Peterson would it be relevant to call him "a mean black man"?

Another bit off topic example....  we know that black police officer are also more likely to misuse force on black suspects.  I have personally known black people who were prejudiced against blacks.  I think we too often attribute a person prejudice or unjust actions/ideas on race to their race when it is the culture, sociology, group psychology that could bare most of the responsibility.

That is to say if Peterson or his fans are prejudiced or even racist that it is not necessarily their race that has primarily inspired their prejudice.

Instead of calling Peterson a "mean white man" I think something like "privileged mean man" would be much much better.  Probably not a good to attack the man ever but instead attack the idea.  When people of color are fans of and agree with Peterson it is likely they would be privileged in another way(like economic, sex, or physical dominance/attractiveness).There may be a language barrier here to.  Is English your primary language?If he said that then he is definitely trolling.  I think their may be a language barrier saw well though.Similiar to Donald Trump, I think Peterson is likely an opportunistist who would be liberal or liberal libertarian if there were no money and fame at stake.  He plays to anti-progressives and men who need self-help because that is where there is money and fame to be made.  To be fair I think there are a lot of people doing anti-progressive entertainment who are just in it for the money and clicks.What was a typo?It is not satirical. It is trolling or some kind of bad actor. Keep up the good work David!like when sargon claims to be a liberal. nobody buys that shit... well, except dude you replied to&gt;JQ conspiracy theories

elaborate? i've never heard of thatuh, i saw a black guy call a white guy a honky once. CHECK AND MATEI enjoyed your piece thanks.

I am generally a fan of ideas of the left of center IDW crew but I might disagree on the degree to which they emphasize an issue.  I usually disagree with much of the right of center IDW crew but I find them interesting.  I regard Joe Rogan as the most representative thoughtful and relatively intelligent layman in America and I think he can be a great indicator of how the winds are blowing.  The IDW movement on a whole is very interesting to me and I think it's impact on the right is larger.

I have some questions about how you feel about certain IDW people and ideas...

What do you think of Bret Weinstein and the Evergreen College situation?  I think Bret Weinstein may be may be the sharpest and fairest arbiter of the and inside the IDW movement. Here he is talking about it recently with Robert Write...The Intellectual Dark Web | Robert Wright &amp; Bret Weinstein [The Wright Show. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LRsPsTrCvpw

Steven Pinker?

Recently Michael Eric Dyson told Jordon Peterson at a debate that he was a "mean white man".  Is calling him "white" like this fair to you?  Do you think it is helpful?

It sounds to me like you(and many other like Vox, and I am generally a big fan of Vox) are questioning the motives of IDW members and saying their motives automatically invalidates their ideas.

I think a lot of their fans, myself included, are hearing accusations that they are racist and/or sexist and that is unfair.  It drives people to resist any critique of IDW members and their ideas.  I would add Russell Brand and anyone from the IDW movement.  I think Bret Weinstein from the IDW and Pakman would agree on almost everything and I think Bret is the best speaker for the IDW from the leftTo clarify I don't think motive automatically invalidates an idea.   I think claiming that motive invalidates ideas is usually counterproductive.

Have you heard Russell Brand's two podcast with Jordon Peterson(one just last week, the other in February)and one with Sam Harris(right before Peterson in February).  Brand is primarily concerned, and voices it specifically, with structures and power structures and he talks about it with these two IDW guests.  I am probably a lot more interested in arguments that have popular reach then you are.

"we can and should distinguish people who actively promote a discriminatory social structure from those that defend those structures"
I agree! I think the left usually fails to do this and often purposely so and it is tremendously unproductive.  

The problem is often amplified because most people listening to leftist critique on race or sex issues do not have the ability to understand the difference between a leftist critique of racism/sexism and a leftist critique of defending a structure.  If someone hears that one or someone else is unfairly called a racist from the left it is offensive(and even activates mental fight or flight mechanisms) and they will go into defense mode.  The IDW members and fans are just this way.  I think specifically Dave Rubin and Jordan Peterson are purposely using this phenomenon to increase their fame and fortunes but they aren't doing much to goad the left into doing it.

"the subset of the centre-right represented by the IDW appears incapable of separating leftist critique of their positions and behaviours from their individual virtue and reputation."
I don't think this is limited to the IDW. I think almost all people(my expertise is American cultures/politics and white American culture/politics) are incapable of separating racial and gender critique of their positions and behaviours from their individual virtue and reputation.  This is especially so in an adversarial discussion.  It is only relatively intellectual and well schooled people who are capable of not doing this.  Because the IDW and many on the right understand this or are sincerely on the same page as laymen these issues that the IDW and the right have such success with it.

I want to ask again to see if we agree.  You agree that calling Peterson or anyone in the IDW a "mean WHITE man" is wrong?  The "WHITE" part being the wrong part? Do you agree that it is so wrong that it is very impactful and counterproductive?

My priority is making progress against unfair structures and I am concerned some elements of the left are being counterproductive in this pursuit.Kyle covers the specific incident here https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4WJ1jY5T4asking someone to acknowledge a socially unacceptable bias that they believe they don't actually have is counterproductive I think.  They have to be convinced that they have or might have this bias first and obviously that is hard.  Actually telling someone that their views stem not from a racist or prejudiced culture but from their own racist or prejudiced self is even worse.     I think most people are often irrationally offended. Emotions are themselves irrational.  I mostly agree with Kyle An absolute must watch video. This is narrated by Douglas Murray who has been a frequent guest on Sam Harris' podcast. It's really a condensed short form video version of his spectacular book "The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity &amp; Islam". Watch the video and share your thoughts below. I also highly recommend reading Murray's book.You don't think Sam Harris addresses issues that matter?Get out of your comfort zone &amp; narrowminded view of the world. This is the problem with progressives.The audience voted before and after and the right convinced more people.  I think Dyson was better at this then the others. Like Kyle I think the topic of the debate heavily favored the right.  The numbers who have seen this debate or some parts of it on YouTube is over 2 million and it was just posted Friday.  Isn't this record breaking numbers in record time for this kind of thing?  I think Peterson and his views will benefit greatly from it and I am not a fan of Peterson but I find his movement fascinating.I agree with you on his over-emphasis on Islam and campus activism.  The topic of climate change is too simple for him to spend a lot of time on.  He should do another show on it sometime though you are right. I think he would agree that it is important.  I think it is important too but it is an issue I don't spend much time on because I feel it is pretty simple.  I can't remember Pakman covering it although I would guess that he has.Well Peterson gets rather easily flustered compared to other speakers, debaters, and intellectuals.  He is famous for crying a few times on camera I think.  He has admitted to having a problem not keeping completely cool in confrontational situations like this.  I think this gives him more personality and shows vulnerability or whatever and by this he stands out and endears him to people.

His and the audience notable response was not in response to Dyson explanation(which I agree with).  It was in response to the specifically calling him a "mean WHITE man".  Peterson did not respond to it like a black man would appropriately respond to being called "n****r" 

But almost anyone would get flustered if called a "mean white man" or a "mean black man".  To most people it will sound like a personal attack being called a racist and character assassination.  I think most people would think his response appropriate even reserved.  He brought it back up and drew direct attention to the "mean white man" accusation because he knew it was to his advantage and the crowd sided with him.  Maybe Peterson was not sincere(maybe he was) but tactically I think he capitalized in the best way possible(minus the Native American stuff).  Dyson gave Peterson the perfect opportunity to play the victim and Peterson hit it out of the park.  

I think Peterson is very used to having his actions, his words, his beliefs placed within a sociological context.  I think he is used to being called a racist and a bigot.  He has never been called a racist like that in a debate by a debater before.

I agree his bringing up whatever background he has with Native Americans was a poor choice and not effective.

I usually agree with Michael Eric Dyson and I think he is great at what he does.  I don't agree at all with Kyle that Dyson reflects standard old Democratic talking points.  I think Dyson should have just left the word "white" out of his direct personal criticism of Peterson.  

I disagree with Peterson on many things and on the things I do agree with him on I don't agree on his emphasis.   I think Peterson is prone to making mistakes when uncomfortable though but I think we have seen that unjust attempts to make him uncomfortable have often increased his visibility and standing while rallying his base.

Like Kyle I agree that in general the left is counterproductive with this type of thing against someone who almost no one will agree is a racist.I am really disturbed by the unwillingness of people to confront their framework. PragerU while biased usually does a decent job of presenting a conservative framework in a rational way. It’s not much different then many of the organizations on the left who do the same thing. Do I agree, no. Do I think that their points may be worth some consideration, yes. Do I think this video is good, no. I think it overestimates the impact of recent immigration and under values the 19th-20th century fracturing of the great European kingdoms. That combined with the Cold War has more to do with the current state of Europe then extremely recent immigration. I do think there should be concerns when accepting large quantities of a group of people who have vastly different morals and culture the normative one in place. With out a plan to integrate and to deal with those issues problems arise. It’s why I argue cultural appropriation is actually a positive force. I do think this author over exaggerates isolated incidents and applies the minor to the major a lot. But I know that because I watched the video considered what he said, came up with reasons from my own framework why he wrong. If you just refuse because you don’t like it then it is disconcerting. Not everything conservatives say is wrong and not everything liberals preach is rightI didn't foresee sadly. I thought this was super solid and landed new blows on some of my favored IDW members left of center. It's a month old thoughi really, really want one of these. especially if the meeting doesn't happen.  


it'd be like having a misprinted MTG card or something.&gt; Out of all the JP debates and interviews I've seen, I think Dr. Dyson attacked and highlighted the core of JP's bullshit the most *aggressively* [emphasis added] so far. Please share if you know of some better examples.

Notice you said Dr. Dyson *aggressively* attacked Peterson so far and not *logically* or *intellectually* or something of that nature. Relisten to the debate. Much of Dyson's attacks, in my view, were ad hominen and not really critiquing Peterson's arguments. In other words, he was just name calling while sounding smart without actually critiquing Peterson's views.

It's a shame because I disagree with a lot of Peterson says, but when you just name call like Dyson did you prove Peterson's point.  Well when liberals like you are unwilling to stand up for your own country &amp; defend borders, this is what happens. We have millions of refugees pouring into Europe, a lot of who don’t share our values of tolerance &amp; womens rights, they actively hate us and want to impose their backwards medieval savage Islamic culture. 

Why do only European countries have the obligation to take them in? Ask them to try Saudi Arabia or Iran and see how they get treated. Instead of taking action, you fools riddled with white guilt are attacking me &amp; people like Douglas Murray for raising these valid concerns. Do you think that once Muslims become the majority in Europe, they will care for you?

They will take over, implement Islamic Law &amp; subjugate you &amp; your women and make you pay the Jizzya just like the medieval times. Get rid of the white guilt &amp; defend your borders from these hordes of barbaric savages. Instead you keep shouting meaningless terms like fascism &amp; let your country be destroyed.Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Let’s do a better job the Hanford. We don’t need another Tricities This is a terrible poll. I’m sorry corruption, corporate money, and the extreme far left are far bigger threats then some hacks on the news or internet I have plenty of issues with Murray on his politics and culture war stuff, but Murray does not admit to being a white supremacist at all!  That is dishonest.  About the only thing I support for him is his right to free speech.

And I am not trying to be a dick here but if one genetic group of people is compared to another genetic group of people then one group is going to have a higher IQ then another.   If one uses the fact that one group has a negligible lower IQ to judge everyone in said group then that would be racist or idiotic.  I don't think Murray is doing that but he is dancing too close to it with his politics and stuff.

I think Sam was wrong to have Murray on without challenging his political and cultural views.  I think Sam is wrong to draw attention like this.  I would probably concede that they are wrong about the science.  Even if they were right about this issue it would not justify racism.  

I think it would be fair to argue that Sam is, in this very specific case, a little UNINTENTIONALLY  friendly to a very specific racist idea.  But obviously in so many other way he is very much sufficiently hostile to racist ideas(in line with liberals/progressives).

At worst he is wrong on this one specific race issue.  He is correct on pretty much all other race issues and he often explains the correct side of these issues better then anyone else in my opinion.

And just because a person may be wrong on a race issue does not automatically mean they are wrong because of their race! One can be wrong on a race issue without being racist or even prejudiced.

I am particularly worried that the righteous call for social justice will fall onto more deaf ears.  Ears turned deaf from hearing too many charges of racism that they do not believe is racist.

Peterson's ideas on the whole are closer to actual sexist ideas.  Peterson would not define "chaos" as a negative the way most people do.   I think it is fair to argue that Peterson's ideas are a little sexist overall.I think Dyson could have answered that better.  But I think Peterson does acknowledge privilege in other ways.  Peterson's belief in myths are in their importance as metaphors or whateverTactically, anyone who can successfully play a card should play it.  Calling out one for playing a card is often a tactically reasonable counter.  The sincerity and motives of these actions is a different topic.Sounds like this is one for the courts to settle. Might be good for the Dems to bring attention to this issueIf Democrats embrace the term "socialist" it would be 
disastrous It is highly unlikely that the Trump will be impeached AND convicted.Trump being impeached by the House is reasonably possible. Convicted by 2/3rds of the Senate is not.Its too early. But Democrats will do better if they are affraid of loseing. Trump benefited from the fact that most Americans though he would loseNo specific House seat is important. No specific House seat determines Speaker.The numbers of Latinos registered and turning out to vote in Texas is a glaring concern.  I am sure the there are pockets of Latinos in other places too. The new Puerto Ricans, especially in large numbers in Florida, who have migrated here because of the hurricane destruction should be targeted. I think of all things to spend money on this is the best use of fundsThey didn't move to the right.  The Dems obviously did not move to the right on social issues.  They, like the Republicans and the entire country, moved to the left. The Dems have moved to the left on economic issues in the last 20 years.So the first video by three arrows is a good explanation but even he concedes the impacts that are happening as a result of the loss of control. One could argue that Merkeals decision to not close the train station was concedeing control. This is my point. There is validity to some of the pragerU videos premises. It’s conclusion is not sound and I think is wrong. Right or wrong a decision was made there are consequences. Does the prayer video over exaggerate, of course. Can the problem be fixed through reasonable mean, yes. Only if we acknowledge that the conservatives have a few good points and incorporate that into our solutions. 
The second video is a great red herring and has not a damn thing to do with the discussion. I actually am against austerity and Brexit was the 3rd dumbest decision in the last 5 years. 

I and other posters on this sub think Kyleruth is trolling hereLook at his posting history here. He is trollingwow I would say to check your framework but I doubt it will help. Are their issues with Muslim immigrants currently. Yes of course. Is it as dire as you portray? Hell no. The issue isn’t Islam its a lack of attempt to integrate them into western culture. Your bias is the issue. Treat people like the enemy and you will get exactly that. Rather let’s build a robust checks system. Deal with the extremists. The rest provide a western framework to bring them more in line with European cultural norms. Boom a large force for modernization in the Muslim world. It is part of the format to tell about oneself sometimes. DP is not supposed to be like a newsreader with disembodied voice.I know Cathy Mcmorris Rodgers is a target. Lisa Brown has a good chance. She also has decent down ballot candidates. They are organizing a lot of the campaigning to be each other’s surrogates. From the outside it appears to be working.https://youtu.be/k15g9iYsFRIThey have occasional good videos. The Ayaan video was good, Sommers and Peterson had good messages.

Unfortunately, those are rare, most videos posted there are really absurd, the climate change one was particularly bad and dangerous. It is unfortunate that Douglas went in here, I've listened to him in other podcasts and he makes decent points. Unfortunately, white supremacists like u/Warheit29 coopt it for their own retarded reasons.

I think it is important to hear what people who disagree with you have to say but I find there are better sources for this than PragerU. Although, I will admit that I am biased against Prager, as I find him to be extremely off putting and a religious nut.

I personally listen to Ben Shapiro to get out of my own bubble, although I disagree often with his conclusions I find he arrives to them honestly. 

Some people have said that Douglas Murray is promoting fascism, so I was hesitant at first. Then I realized people have called Brett Weinstein a fascist and Christina Sommers and Sam Harris. The term fascist has kind of been watered down to "anyone I don't agree with" and that is a shame really. He has been a guest in Sam Harris and Joe Rogan podcast so you can make that decision yourself but I honestly do not think there is any validity to the accusations.A very unpopular opinion probably: A podcast I use to pop my own bubble is The Ben Shapiro Show.

Edit: I want to add a podcast that I recently discovered that although not always policy based, does bring up some really important points. 80,000 Hours Podcast.  As an intro I would recommend Episode # 6. There is no other way of putting it. Dyson's behavior was terrible. He made racist and homophobic remarks. If you're looking to change minds, this is not the way to go about it. The results showed it to be the case too. 

I loved how Fry phrased it,  "Huckstering, snake oil, pulpit preacher." 

  
Overall the only person it seemed to me that actually talked about Political Correctness was Stephen Fry. I'd say he won the debate.I don't know who these people are: 

* Sargon Akaad
* Tucker Carlson \(I've seen a couple of interviews he doesn't strike me as alt\-right but don't know enough\)
* Sean Hannity
* Tommy Lahren

But these people are definitely **not** alt\-right, whatever your opinions of them there's no need to distort the truth:

* Jordan Peterson
* Dave Rubin
* Ben Shapiro

So I guess I have only 1 choice in this poll, Alex Jones.I don't like the n\-word It's a racially charged word with an ugly history and black people have every right to be upset by it but If you put the word in your song and ask a white person to sing your song you can't be upset when they sing your fucking song.

I honestly don't think black people should use the term either but you know, freedom. But like... come on bro, its your fucking song, you think this girl is some racist, she's just there to have fun. smh. I like Knife Media in that regard. It is hard enough to stay objective without people slanting the news on you. I only wish I got to see more than 5 articles per month for free. It does a pretty good job at rating the objectivity as each news outlet per article.

Something I've started doing lately is to try to pop my own bubble when it comes to politics so I've been listening to the Ben Shapiro Show. It is kind of crazy how different things look when you're not in an echo chamber. I've also enjoyed Quillete.

I am always open to suggestions for a Progressive leaning show that is not bat shit crazy like chapotraphouse or heavily biased like The Young Turks. I was honestly hoping that was the direction that Dave Rubin was going to go after his Interview of Sam Harris, interviewing reasonable people like him, but he  took it another direction. Although I really enjoyed the Weinstein Brothers Interview and Steven Pinker. But yeah that went very much the other direction for the most part.

For now I am listening to The Daily, and taking a peek at The Knife Media when I can.  If  you got something good for me do tell!Indeed. Although I would not phrase it as Progressives vs Non\-Progressives. I find Stephen Fry to be a progressive. And Dyson showed some very non\-progressive behavior \(taxing white people, last time an ethnic group was taxed in the West on that basis alone was Nazi Germany.\) 

The reason I say this is because I consider myself a progressive and I am against political correctness along the lines that Stephen Fry mentioned on this debate, primarily it just does not work. 

The whole project of defending political correctness was probably difficult from the get go, so I can't fault them from not finding someone better than a black bigot. 

The main issue I have with Dyson is that his tactics besides being abhorrent severely undermines some of the points he made that had validity. As a minority some of what he was saying had a kernel of truth but he decided to decorate it with racism and homophobia, this is the opposite of smart tactics. Thank You.

I can't recall at the moment but I remember seeing an episode of the Majority Report that was reporting on something in an incredibly dishonest manner, I don't remember what it was, been a long time. I'll give them a second shot maybe I confused them with something else.

I'll check out Neil Lazarus and Norman Finklstein as well. Thank you.

Edit: 

Yikes, That's a big no on me for Sam Seder. His views on Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson are a string of lies and straw\-man arguments.  I remember a couple of years ago now watching a video and going holy shit is anything he says true?  It is possible that he has other valid points but once you've shown yourself to be that intellectually dishonest it is hard to not cast doubt in everything else. Eliezer says it best,

&gt; Some good rules of thumb \(for humans\): Be suspicious of genetic accusations against beliefs that you dislike, especially if the proponent claims justifications beyond the simple authority of a speaker. “Flight is a religious idea, so the Wright Brothers must be liars” is one of the classically given examples. By the same token, don’t think you can get good information about a technical issue just by sagely psychoanalyzing the personalities involved and their flawed motives. *If technical arguments exist, they get priority*. When new suspicion is cast on one of your fundamental sources, you really should doubt all the branches and leaves that grew from that root. You are not licensed to reject them outright as conclusions, because reversed stupidity is not intelligence, but . . . Be extremely suspicious if you find that you still believe the early suggestions of a source you later rejected What is a good argument against having well educated Presidents? It is rather strange that we'd never be okay with a poorly qualified pilot or brain surgeon. But somehow we're okay with a total buffoon running perhaps eh most important office in the planet? 

I legitimately want to know what is a good argument against having some sort of minimum knowledge required test to run for president?oh. Why do you feel this way? Doesn't strike me that way at all. What am I missing? 

Also thank you for the suggestions, I'll check them out. Do you have any progressive suggestions that are not blatantly wrong as you said like Shapiro?i want one of those sooooo bad now especially that it's cancelled.

welp, i'm gonna be the first to say it. TRUMP4NOBEL2018

and besides the momentary schadenfreude of seeing trumpists jump the gun and look like morons, i must admit it's distressing that we couldn't make it work.I agree I tried Shapiro. He falls into that magical right wing fiat camp. If everyone just agreed with his framework the structural issues of society would evaporate and the world would be great. Not a rynian hell scape of serfdom. He is a clown. He made his career debating dumb liberals who have the same bias he but on the left side. He is just slightly better at arguing his framework and knows how the opponents data has been twisted. Put him against a novice policy debater and they would eat him alive. I’ve actually sat down with my more conservative friends and have had them queue up a compilation video we’re he “owns” the left and I tear his arguments apart to the point they are impressed. 70% of what he says is garbage. He is good at one thing and it’s opponent research. He knows what they will say. He then comes up with a passable counter and since he and his opponents have policy knowledge measured in millimeters he looks really smart. He rubs his game well and you have to respect that. He’s smarter the Peterson in that way. The right hates losers.I will have to check these out. I like a good energy policy debateI think I’ve seen this one. I’ll try it but from the outside it looks more Washington gossip then true policyI see. Well I certainly would not want to be listening to bad reasoning more than is necessary, do you have any evidence for the arguments you posted? 

It is not that I do not believe you but there is a lot of bad information floating around about People like him, or Sam Harris or Jordan Peterson. I often find to be factually incorrect, as they can be polarizing figures and many people just parrot bad information about them. I am not accusing you of doing the same I am just hesitant to just take people's word for it. 

Totally cool if you don't want to take the time to do that though. yeah, i just saw that and checked the white house gift shop site- which took like 5 minutes to load- and then wouldn't move when i tried to add it to cart.

that and there's no preview image for it, and in the description it claimed it wasn't the same design as the white house communications agency coin. i dunno. it went from 24.95 to 19.95 today though, sooooo... I tried to listen to this video with an open mind as I have largely changed my mind about Peterson for the positive. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation about him floating around. I certainly disagree with a fair amount of what he has to say but a lot of hit pieces have largely distorted the truth and I am not quite sure why exactly.

* Yes at the beginning of the video Peterson is yelling. It has been shown already that people were not letting him speak in class so they went outside, there was a protest going on and people were attempting to deplatforming him. I am very much against deplatforms and this sort of behavior. So yeah, he's going to be yelling that's just to be expected. Another reason to be against deplatforming is because it simply does not work, as we saw, this largely made the protesters look bad and it increased traffic towards Peterson's YouTube.
* Turns out he was actually correct about c\-16 though.  So the video gets it wrong already. It is actually not legal to misgender people in Canada.
* Peterson has said that he would, and he has, used gender pronouns if people personally ask him to. He will only use He or She though, so that's the caveat. I personally am not sure how I feel about the other made up pronouns, I suppose if someone wants me to call them Xer I don't particularly see why not.
* To say that it is a childish view to reject Post\-Modernism, I honestly don't know what to tell you. I believe in reason and the pursuit of truth, which flies in the face of post\-modernism. I think most reasonable people find post\-modernism to miss the target entirely. If you're interested in learning about Postmodernism you can go here. [Explaining Postmodernism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQcNjHNXnEE) \- 6 hours. 
* These guys do not have an actual understanding of the Jungian archetypes. It is a case of arguing against two different things. There is a great book on this subject by Erich Neunmann called "The Great Mother." This is not sexist at all, you're interpreting things from two completely different frameworks. Which I totally understand because it happens way more often than you would think. People argue from two sets of frameworks and end up talking past each other.
* Noooooo. They are confusing symbols and metaphors with Biology and intrinsic properties. Nobody is making the argument that women are agents of chaos because of their biology, that is absurd!

I think I'll leave it at that. These guys were not interested in presenting an accurate view of Jordan Peterson. They are quoting that NYT hit\-piece that has been refuted several times.  There are much better critical sources of JBP than that piece.

I am not trying to start a fight, I know JBP is not popular around here. I think there are genuine critiques you can have towards Peterson, particularly the ones brought up by Sam Harris. Who was also a person who was also misinterpreted frequently. If you want to read an interesting review of his 12 rules for life from an objective Psychiatrist: [12 Books for Life Review](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/03/26/book-review-twelve-rules-for-life/)Heh. life is strange, going from beating Destiny on Sc2 ladder, what 8 years ago? and watching him complain about racial imbalance. To listening him talk about Ben Shapiro. Destiny never struck me as very intelligent only based on his sc2 play, hehe im totally biased against him. I'll give it a listen though, thank you for links Miravus.

Edit:

Thank you for the suggestions, there is confusion from both of these guys. So I suppose this is a good case against listening to Shapiro and Destiny.  Why would you ever listen to Destiny though. :P

In this case both Destiny and Shapiro are mistaken about Gender Dysphoria. This is what the DSM\-V says about gender Dysphoria: 

[https://www.psychiatry.org/patients\-families/gender\-dysphoria/what\-is\-gender\-dysphoria](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria)Indeed. Plus it takes effort. It is so much easier to be Tribal, but to actually take the time to make up your own mind takes effort. 

As an Atheist my initial reaction to his views on Religion was a knee jerk response of "this is total bullshit."Especially after watching the Matt Dillahunty debate.  It was not until I understood that he was framing it from Pragmatism which I had no real knowledge about as Philosophy is not my thing. I did an overview analysis, can't say I fully understand what he is saying, I still disagree but I have a much better understanding of his point of view. 

I can understand why people are going to be unwilling to take the time to do that, in a sense I got lucky because I was exploring some of these ideas before I was aware of Peterson.  [This Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZJVedQbl3k&amp;t=1s) makes probably the strongest case in framing Peterson's view, I disagree, it is really interesting nonetheless. This takes time, and its much harder than just labeling him "pseudointellectual" and moving on.  

Why do I bother? because:

To argue against an idea honestly, you should argue against the best arguments of the strongest advocates. Arguing against weaker advocates proves nothing, because even the strongest idea will attract weak advocates. Ism laughing because that is one of the points I made. Shapiro needs to check his DSM-VAbsolutely, what better source than the bill itself and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. First here is the link to [C\-16](https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-16/third-reading). Make up your own mind, these people are lying to you.

 In Canada, a complaint of such discrimination would go to the [Canadian Human rights tribunal](http://www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca/index-en.html)

A landlord for example, refusing to use words other than he or she in referring to a tenant, can be interpreted as unwanted verbal behavior that offends, persists over time, and is discriminatory according to Canadian human rights commission \(CHRT\). 

Definition of Harassment under the [CHRT:](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/healthy-workplace/prevention-resolution-harassment/harassment-tool-employees.html#c2)

&gt;improper conduct by an individual, that is directed at and offensive to another individual in the workplace, including at any event or any location related to work, and that the individual knew or ought reasonably to have known would cause offence or harm. It comprises objectionable act\(s\), comment\(s\) or display\(s\) that demean, belittle, or cause personal humiliation or embarrassment, and any act of intimidation or threat. *It also includes harassment within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act \(i.e. based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and pardoned conviction\).*

[A good article on the issue.](https://litigationguy.wordpress.com/2016/12/24/bill-c-16-whats-the-big-deal/)

[Human Rights Comissioner Weighs in on C\-16](http://torontosun.com/2016/11/13/human-rights-commissioner-weighs-in-on-ze-and-hir/wcm/0254ab55-ade7-40f4-b1f3-553b75b10842)

[Senate Bill C\-16 Hearing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnIAAkSNtqo&amp;feature=youtu.be)

The OHRC \(legal body responsible for defining how the law is enforced\) have said on their website:

&gt;Refusing to refer to a trans person by their chosen name and a personal pronoun that matches their gender identity, or purposely misgendering, will likely be discrimination when it takes place in a social area covered by the Code, including employment, housing and services like education.Indeed. And I'd hate to be dismissing people's experiences for no reason. It is also really silly, I've met some wonderful interesting people who also happen to be transgender I'd hate to think I would not have befriended them out of prejudice. 

 However, would you consider a refusal to call someone zher a humiliation? I doubt you do, and neither do I but it can be interpreted that way by someone who identifies as a Zher. It seems to me you'd have to call someone by their preferred pronoun. I am not convinced there is even a need for these pronouns, the transgender people I've met at my local LBGT\+ center I have volunteered at seem to prefer "He" or "She." Some but not all have the opinion that some of the gender fluid people are just experimenting.  I have no idea what to make of any of this. Though that is not what I was arguing about and I totally digressed.

I certainly hope you're right though and I am wrong. The best evidence against my interpretation is what you posted because ultimately those are the people who will interpret the bill, and if they have interpreted as so, I hope it stays that way. Absolutely, I am always up for honest conversations and I am willing to change(have) my mind on various issues. 
I don't always keep my cool but I am trying to get better at that. I was wrong about some things and some people were patient enough to show me why, so I am just trying to pay it forward.  &gt;It's really hard to look objectively at the two positions held by Destiny and Shapiro and come away thinking they're both wrong on this...

Sure I can try to clarify.

They are both wrong because you're confusing  gender nonconformity with transgender. You can keep reading to see the difference.  I do not think that Destiny's understanding is a minor terminological misstep at all.

Honestly, Destiny is not someone I'd trust on Psychology at all. He has no formal education in the matter, his job was a blue collar job when he was playing sc2 \(nothing wrong with that, but I'd hardly call him an expert in anything non gaming related...ill throw this caveat that Idk what he does nowdays\). It is good to be suspicious of genetic accusations against beliefs that you dislike, especially if the proponent claims justifications beyond the simple authority of a speaker. By the same token, don’t think you can get good information about a technical issue just by sagely psychoanalyzing the personalities involved and their flawed motives. If technical arguments exist, they get priority. When new suspicion is cast on one of your fundamental sources, you really should doubt all the branches and leaves that grew from that root. You are not licensed to reject them outright as conclusions, because reversed stupidity is not intelligence, but . . . Be extremely suspicious if you find that you still believe the early suggestions of a source you later rejected, I am not a Destiny hater or anything, but I very much doubt him as a source of anything to be honest.  There are much better sources to consult than what this largely inexperienced and uneducated man has to say.I find David French to be a reasonable conservative and his writing is growing on me. I believe that this is as bad an infringement on free speech as the college campus mobs.What page in what edition does he say that? I would agree that lower IQ individuals should be disincentivized.  I am open to the idea that Murray is a kind of racist.  But it is Harris who i think is being unfairly framed as racist here I thinkI mostly agree with you thereI don't think that little bit was homophobic. He made the one clear mistake with calling him "white". Besides that I think is more likeable then the others. You should be able to win a debate arguing pro-political correctness anyway.  The was a proxy debate for other things.  I doubt Dyson and the woman would have done this debate without Peterson to go after.Yeah I have a lot of issues with what he says.  A lot of that is standard conservative and right libertarian stuff and not racist but though.  His bias against non-white immigrants  seems more apparent to me.  I think it is fair to call him a racist but it isn't going to be real clear too most people I think.

It also seems ridiculous that he seems to ignore that it is natural for lower income, lower educated, and/or lower IQ individuals to have more children.  Some cultures have more children as well.

I am more convinced Sam made a huge mistake with having him on and not discussing with him this stuff.  Sam wanted to have him on on free speech grounds and then to focus on just the IQ and genetics stuff and avoid social policy and he was naïve to think that he could get away with just that.

ThanksI use InstaPaper to calculate estimated reading time and I believe it only counts the post itself and not the comment section. I took me 16 mins to read it at 420 WPM\(if memory serves me right\) , so I'm assuming 25 mins for average reading speed is probably accurate. I could be wrong.We are both a democracy and a republic. A democratic republic we are. We are also a liberal democracy.  The founders obviously talked plenty about democracy.  What he is complaining about is a pure democracy and not a liberal democracy with individual rights Venezuela and other socialist movements like it have gone to shit mostly because of authoritarianism.  Socialism didn't help.  I am not a fan of true socialism so arguing for true socialism is not something I would do. Arguing for authoritarian socialism or socialism brought about by the use of force is a disasterous thing to do.  European countries that we admire And want to reflect in some ways are not socialist nations. They are capitalist nations.  They are progressive capitalist social democracies. Social programs are not socialism. Social security and socialized healthcare are not socialism they are merely social programsHe is wrong about a lot of thingsYou could accuse him of being against democracy and let him try to defend that.I don't have a strong disagreement with what you said here to continue to lead us down this road. All I can add is I hope you approach Destiny with as much, if not more, skepticism as you do to Shapiro.

Let me try something different, this video by Alex O'Connor, in my opinion, is a much better way to disagree with one of Shapiro's statements:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwGcOxngTUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwGcOxngTUI)

Would love to hear what you think.Oh no. Don't just blindly agree with him. There is a lot that can be dispensed with, there is a lot that should not be. If anything it allows you to see a different point of view you might have considered, remember that you can entertain an idea without adopting it. Best case you learn something new that you had not thought of, worst case you can build a stronger argument for what you believe. Cheers!I am sorry that Politics is invading your mind this way. If I may recommend a few things I have not seen others say yet.

Consider that this might be a feeling of lack of control in your life which can have very detrimental effects in your well being. The good news is that there are some ways to combat this.

* See how you can affect your immediate surroundings. There is much to be done in local politics and you'll find that not many people participate in your immediate community. See if you can get involved. Don't underestimate the reach that this will have, and you'll regain some of that feeling of control.
* Look to your local communities that are doing things you find important and take some time to volunteer. Take yourself out of you comfort zone, I am not trying to make myself a role model here or anything but I volunteered at my local LBGT\+ community for a few months because it is an unknown world view to me, and I was glad I did. Doesn't have to be anything life changing, maybe a few hours every week.
* Look to your health. Make sure you're doing the best to take care of yourself. Even one night of poor sleep has huge detrimental effects to your well being, including an increase in anxiety, and feelings of lack of control. The opposite of what you want right now. Start small, pick a time to wake up every morning and limit your exposure to electronics at least an hour before bedtime. See if you can make some small adjustments to your diet. Try to limit the processed sugars, replace some of the saturated fats with healthy fats. 
* Meditation. If you ignore all of the above, this is the one you should not! Mediation will allow you to make room for those invading thoughts without letting yourself become fused with them. There are some great apps out there to help you with this if you're new to this. 10&amp;#37; Happier and Headspace are my favorite. I could list the benefits of meditation based on empirical data from now till midnight but the key one is you will gain the ability to not let your mind get hijacked. It will take time, it is like learning an instrument. 

Cheers!Yes indeed. 10% is kind of marketed for "fidgety skeptic" 
The instructions are pretty clear.

Headspace is also very helpful for the beginner.The first thing that Trump and I have in common. We are both terrible writers. At least he gets to say "I never read anything."  I don't have that excuse at my disposal. From the article:

&gt; Understanding the justifications for liberalism is integral to grasping broader debates in today’s society. Today, a caricature of liberalism is often attacked by the Left. Not to be left out, a caricature of liberalism is often defended by those on the Right. It is not clear to me which is worse. Indeed, as implied [my most recent *Quillette* article](http://quillette.com/2018/05/17/emergence-rise-postmodern-conservatism/) on postmodern conservatism, I am deeply concerned that these pressures from both Left and Right will eventually make it impossible to have a sustained and rational debate about the clear virtues and defects of liberalism I'd like to believe that this is people that have already seen the segment and are just going "right on dude" with their upvote, probably not though.Appreciate your point of view but that was completely irrelevant to the article in question.Trump failed at everything he ever did until he trademarked his own name. I have never seen or will ever see a episode of the  apprentice. I still wish my dad had more money than god though.https://www.google.com/search?q=donald+and+ivanka+inappropriate+pics&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;prmd=inv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3-p-S2KXbAhUBslMKHVQRCb4Q_AUIESgB&amp;biw=375&amp;bih=630What if Obama was using two unsecured iPhones?Low key I'm not shocked. 
That may be the case but this is not the point of the article. Look at the article itself even in support of Elon Musk there is low credibility. 

I understand it is a long read and the desire to express cached wisdom is strong though.Somethings just make my blood boil, dangerous fake science is very much at the top.  Fuck Wakefield, seriously...ofc Trump supports him. I'm gonna stop before I go on an incoherent rant.We wrap our patriotism in both the national anthem and flagThis is not legally a free speech issue as it is a private business.  If something is disrespectful then it is reasonable that many will get offended.  But this is respectful. It is not reasonable for conservatives to get offended. They are faking offense and not being honest.  Liberals and POC could start having random national anthem ceremonies with everyone kneeling and it would be a respectful act of patriotism that Trump and conservatives would attack.  They would attack liberals and POC for being very respectfully patriotic.  It would turn the moderates and centrists and intelligent conservatives against them and towards the liberals.This isn't about the politics and culture of flag desecration which is very very different. This is about the politics and culture of respectful but alternative shows of patriotism.Sorry you are feeling this way. I sometimes feel similarly.  If our goal is to rasist the right and to make progress then we can't do that if we get burnt out or let them drive us crazy.  Our sadness and anger will cloud our judgement and we will make mistakes.  "When one battles a monster one must be cautious not to become a monster"l. I would recommend absorbing some great fiction in either written or tv series form. Comedy tv series.  Maybe some video games.You would lose in court. It is a violation of the culture norms we expect from a president certainly.  This issue is going to explode I think.We often confuse aspects of "free speech"...

1)The legal right to free speech enshrined in our 1st Amendment which I agree is as strong in the USA as ever.  


2)The cultural ideals of free speech.  This is part of the culture war.  

For instance it is perfectly legal for private colleges to have ZERO free speech. Now we don't want that but where do we draw the lines? Are the lines being moved or not? Should we move the lines? What is the  appropriate responses from people in response to these supposed changes or supposed attempts to change.

And where are the lines drawn/should they be drawn in all other aspects of culture and society outside of government?

I would agree with you that free speech is often used as a political football(pun unintended). But that is often the nature of politics.


Other nations don't have quit the free speech protection that Americans do.  I am not a nationalist or "proud American" or anything like that but I do think Americans have a uniquely strong right to free speech. It is about the only thing that I think is a uniquely strong liberal principle the USA has.Because Trump and conservatives have made this into a free speech/free enterprise and conformity of patriotism issue.  Politicized for partisan gainMany Americans would disagree. "America right or wrong". "America love it or leave it".    It does matter if it is disrespectful or not if one cares about the truth.  Obviously it is not politically nationally advantageous for one to critique their nation for everything it does wrong.  That's the best way to lose culture wars.  Whoever this issue is to the advantage of is decided by who/how many feel disrespected and to what extent. Either side can politically overreact and overplay their hand and blow it.You are talking about principles and I might agree there. But this is about politics and culture.  As the world's most powerful nation I think the USA is potentially the biggest threat to peace among nations but certainly the USA is the biggest creator and protector of the existing peace among nations.People do not have protests rights on private property inside private organizations and private gatherings.  This all hinges on respect or the perception of it.  The right has successfully got it in all of our minds that respectfully kneeling is disrespectful.  I think Americans can be clearly shown that it is respectable and patriotic.  The tables can be turned on Trump and the conservatives.  They want us liberals to argue that disrespecting the flag/anthem is great because they will give up principles to win cultural argument(and win elections)No. From lead in the plumbing and gasoline, to eugenics, to climate change... Fake Science is responsible for atrocity after atrocity. 

I can't think of anything worse, perhaps religion. The TPP trade deal happened. Just not with the USA. We should have been in it to influence trans-pacific trade and now we are not.  This just strengthens China economically and weakens us.  I thought Pakman supported TPP???Trump lies about anything.More evidence of police brutality!It is a sad state of affairs when my comment is not obvious to be sarcastic :\(Yup. And it makes me sad and angry. It really shouldn't. There's nothing I can do about it, if 99% of scientists agree on something but you find the one idiot scientist who disagrees based on nothing but bad assumptions,  ie pragueru, and you choose that guy...Haha here I go again,  I'm ranting.  Just about everything trump does is smoke and mirrors meant to distract you from the real issues. He could care less about kneeling athletes.Would like to see him debate Noam Chomsky
I find most of the interviews boring due to bad audio.Thanks you make great points.  The anthem is not a quite a pledge of allegiance though.

I agree that kneeling is anti-establishment and conservatives get upset about anything that bucks tradition and established orthodoxies. Kneeling is disrespectful to the establishment but respectful to America.  The right wants to confuse the establishment with America for political benefit.  Kneeling is an alternative show of pro-American patriotism.

Case in point.  If liberals and POC had anthem ceremonies, say in urban centers, where everyone kneeled it could not be honestly seen by anyone as un-American or un-patriotic.  Conservatives and the right would be split arguing over whether liberals going out of their way exercising respectful and alternative shows of patriotism is wrong or not.  Liberal Christian or universal religious ceremonies often split the right as well.I would also like to see him talk with any of the left of center IDW members.  I think Pakman is about the best current politically progressive discussion participant out there. I would like to see him in staged debates as well. pardon my ignorance, but are there more pronouns besides the obvious "him" and "her" that people want everyone to use? by that i mean, i thought trans people just wanted people to address them by what they identify as appearance-wise- as in, if you're a trans woman and look like a woman, to the average stranger you would prefer "her" and vice-versa.i'm a filthy liberal but even i'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this. like, i get the reason why, it just feels unnecessary.

for example, nonbinary/pansexual/bisexual people still look like a male or a female, right? so to the average stranger, they couldn't, or shouldn't, possibly be offended when they are addressed by the sex that they choose to appear as. how would the stranger know that they're nonbinary? and in the rare, "it's pat!"-like situations (the SNL skits, not the dps producer) where you can't tell, you would just avoid the pronouns entirely, i would think. or just ask, if it's that big of a deal.

but what about people who know them personally? well, if they accept that they're not going to be called by anything other than what they present as physically by strangers, is it not slightly unreasonable for them to expect people who know their sexual orientation to do so when they don't expect the general populace to also?

i just don't see how they expect people to use correct gender pronouns if the people don't know their sexual proclivities. you have to call someone him or her if they look like a male or female, otherwise you're left with calling them it, and that's just dehumanizing.

an all encompassing term would be much easier for everyone. "they" would be okay if it weren't grammatically incorrect.

for example- i'm korean. i get slightly irked when someone asks me if i'm chinese. if you don't know, don't guess, just say "asian." nothing offensive about that. however, my friends know i'm korean. but i'm not going to force them to specifically acknowledge that i'm korean if it came up in a conversation. "asian" is fine. why would i expect friends to do so if i don't expect the average person to? and even when people get it wrong, it's not like i'm jumping down their throat or something. i tend to just let it go and not mention it.

the only argument i can think of is "we should hold our friends to a higher standard than the average stranger" but i dunno. i just like not hassling people on (in the grand scheme of things) trivial matters.Well no shit. What kind of pointless argument is that. You can say the exact same thing about everything.I don't see why you feel the need to make this point. I guess thanks for that valuable insight. What an incredibly stupid comment.

I guess you're ignorant of people who are immune compromised they can't get vaccinated. Some babies are too young to get vaccinated...some people are going to be vulnerable to this. Herd immunity was what was keeping them safe. When people stop vaccinating their children we lose the herd immunity. Also, beliefs have consequences insofar as they will paint future actions, if enough people start behaving this way we're going to have a big problem in our hands. So many diseases that were once thought as extinct, have been rising since the anti\-vaxx movement took off. Polio, measles come to mind.

Frankly your argument is derived entirely out of ignorance.You sir are an imbecile. Explained on a different comment.I don't see how that is helpful for anyone, and not a complete waste of time for Pakman. is pansexual and bisexual (according to OP's reply, "Nope, bis are now apparently.. 'ze'?") not a sexual orientation? gender identity is irrelevant to pansexuality. is OP's reply incorrect, is it a misconception that people want different gendered pronouns for sexual orientation?

re: everything else you said, of course, i agree.gotcha. that clears things up. pronouns by sexual orientation (what OP was implying) is unreasonable and was tripping me up; pronouns by gender identity is sensible.Look into the Weimar Republic and the polish-soviet war, the Italian-Absyinian war as well. The collapse of Europe post WWI is fascinating from a historical perspective Yup fastest way to a communist revolution is through a neoliberal economic system. I really wish people would actually read Marx and stop setting him up as a straw manInteresting pod cast. Don’t agree with everything. Personally Germany could have beat Russia if they hadn’t had to worry about the west. They got super close. A few more men and a few more supplies could have changed the war. If Germany had been able to take Moscow, secure the Caucuses and the oil Japan would have broken the Russo-Japan pact and invaded. Honestly up until 1941/42 WWII was a toss up. Russia was really fragile and if Stalin had fallen it would have shattered. The Germans made a lot of mistakes but honestly Russia was a mess in 1940. He is right though the US/UK could not have taken Germany without Russia. Kursk, Stalingrad, Leningrad, El Alamein are the most important battles of the war. None involved the US directly Wait for the Trump backlash. It could come back Yup it will be liberal Hollywood persecution. Not she went off the rails.Only took 22 minutes I don’t have a problem with justice. I think it’s nebulous and hard to achieve. Nor do I have issues with people who fight for it. I do take issue with those who have a faulty framework and who push this framework and it’s normative values to the exclusion of all else. I call the social inquisitors. They have a world view and disagreeing with it is tantamount to treason. Often words like racist, Nazi, libtard and facist are used. This is a problem on both sides. The lefts issues have recently been exposed but the right has the too (war on Christmas, white genocide, kneeling football players for example). What they are actually doing is being thought police. It’s why I hate identity politics. You saw it on the right starting with the tea party and the left has picked it up and ran with it. Often it’s less about solving issues and making people feel better. It’s destructive long run.Then that makes you a dick. Nothing about your post would even indicate sarcasm or that it’s a joke. Your not clever or smart for it nor are you funny so I would argue the only joke is you...as a personSo this a great video but he’s wrong. Stick to the flow cross apply the dropped arguments and run that K and CP for the win. Literally how you win at NFL policy debate. The issue isn’t that the left can’t win it’s that they concede the ground. Honestly his point about bait is on point. If you hold your ground and push your arguments you can win.She needs to grow up because lost their job thanks to her.Starring Roseanne, 24/7.so weird. she blamed ambien, then pointed fingers, then said "fans, stop defending me, i was wrong, period" and now she's retweeting others in a vain attempt at whataboutism? ["and you are hanging blacks,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes) right?

speaking of whataboutism, [this don lemon panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwhQPW0SPBQ) is an entertaining watch. something i found particularly humorous was that the conservative commentator made a comment about how "liberal hollywood" wasn't allowing conservative viewpoints in their programming. but it's like, okay, here's a situation where they did, and look what happened. it's laughable.

[she's still going, too.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/05/30/roseanne-barr-lashes-out-at-co-stars-blames-wanda-sykes-you-throw-me-under-the-bus/?utm_term=.8230eeb6eb04) now she's lashing out at sarah gilbert, blaming wanda sykes, and claiming the guy who played D.J. threw her under the bus. looks like her right wing fans have encouraged her to backpedal. 

to be fair, for someone who is clearly mentally unstable, this must be mental breakdown-level insanity to her, seeing her coworkers/friends that she's known for years publicly denounce her behavior. she needs to get off the internet for a bit, take a breather.the dislike brigading on pakman's channel, lol. pathetic, people.

i said it in the other post that mentioned she was retweeting fake tweets from the left (which she has since deleted, as she has done over and over again the last couple of days whenever she falls hook, line, and sinker for a photoshopped image troll post), but she needs to take a break from the internet for a while. her right-wing fanbase is getting her all worked up and egging her on and she's self-destructing right now. she's been all over the place. it's the ambien's fault. no, it's my fault, and fans, please stop defending me. no, my so-called friends and co-workers threw me under the bus. i didn't even know she was black. i thought she was white. i thought she was persian. i thought she was jewish. the left does this too, whataboutwhataboutwhatabout. etc etc

it's amusing in a rubberneckin' car crash sort of way, of course."david pakman is jewish?? i'm going to put on my hitler 'stache again and make david pakman cookies!!! GRRRRR"I used to take ambian, it made me tired.. not racist.It would all depend on his messaging.  He has a bad habit of regurgitating lists of problems in a way that sounds very regurgitated, he needs to drop the word 'socialist' from his political identity, and he needs to make clear that although free healthcare and college for all are attainable, he has to contend that they are end-game outcomes that can only occur after scaffolding fixes to other problems (taxes, wages, policies that reward outsourcing, medical price-gauging, and the gamut of flaws in preK-12th grade education).  It's not wrong to have huge goals, but it's also easy to understand people calling them "pie-in-the-sky," considering all the basic stuff already in ruins and being worsened by Trump, by the minute.  Your nice I’d just hand him a copy of Der Antichrist There are certain things that automatically get my water works going, such as seeing a man cry.  Now I guess I have to add 'seeing a robot cry' to my trigger list.  Looks like HuckSand1.0 will need updating as it was not prepared for the idea of its own 3 juvenile biproducts getting shot. I haven't seen them report anything wrongly. They do a fantastic job at holding all outlets accountable for their spin/slant.

I am not aware of any cults, if you have any proof i'd be happy to see it. hilariously, [rush limbaugh literally said the opposite.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBa9HxwQqBg&amp;t=0s)

the reasoning was, "i'm not equating, but the left wants colin drafted for shitting on the flag, yet roseanne can't get a job because she called a black woman a monkey? who would you rather hire??" or something like that. the logic was flawed, as the idea is "people can and will get fired by private organizations for saying or doing controversial things, and said organizations are well within their right to do so," and colin was arguably not drafted for doing something controversial, same as roseanne.

if anything, according to that logic, all is fair and well with "the system" then. not to mention he absolutely was equating, and the comparison isn't anywhere near the same ballpark of fairness.They hold fox news and brei accountable all the time,  you must not have looked very much

Also its not the news job to tell us what's racist,  that's exactly the problem.  They just state the facts,  you make your own conclusions. ah, sorry, i am not well-versed in sports-related jargon.

signed, i meant.I see what you are saying but I would counter with a few points.
Point A. Is they have a point your feeling don’t matter. Just because you feel oppressed doesn’t mean that you are and to make policy based on making certain people feel better is actually terrible because of unintended consequences and it does nothing to solve the real issues. Perception is not reality and if your perception is so warped why does the world have to conform to that distortion? Just because your framework says A doesn’t make A valid if I can prove B and prove it over and over. 
B. Morality is relative. Saying something is immoral is actually a terrible argument and proves you actually don’t know anything about morality. I can literally justify the Holocaust as a morally correct action through utilitarianism. I can also justify telling the Nazis we’re jews are hiding through deontology. There is no true universal morality despite Kent’s attempt. So pointing out that and action is immoral is basically saying I and my framework find that action reprehensible. However if through data I can prove your framework or convince myself that your framework is bullshit then your argument amounts to the same.
C. The left does the exact same thing. Want a clear example look at the wage gap. It’s not 70% for women. The Golden study out of Harvard, Chicago School of economics study in masters graduates, and a great white paper out of Denmark all prove that it’s actually a mom gap. What’s more is the  Denmark study showed that if men take a extended paternity leave their earning drop and they actually take a larger hit then women.
D. This brings me to the larger point and one that has been brought up. This issue isn’t their argument it’s how they get their data. Honestly when someone makes a claim based on a study the best thing to do is go to the methodology section. Find out how they got their data. Find the holes in their logic, the faults in the research, and the factors they left out. Press the Peterson’s, Shapiro’s and their ilk on that point. Beat them in their own framework. Prove their bias, prove their flaws. Rub it in their faces. Then when they refuse to accept it from your mountain of data and good arguments call them a racist. So when they reply you can say it’s the only explanation for why you accept shitty terrible data that I have disproved.

Honestly 9 times out of 10 their data is shit or fabricated. If they can’t produce the study or the data call them s lair. It being “well known” is BS. Hold them to their data and see how quick it crumbles and if it is good and solid admit maybe your wrong.atleast she is saying that her husband is not a criminal and laws not be fixed. As per my understanding, that's kinda what obama admin did. Deport only violent-crime undocumented immigrants[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yyBSO2JoVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yyBSO2JoVs)Oh man. Identity politics are a problem, but if this is how you deal with it, the cure is worse than the disease. 

I get the sentiment though, the left has really pushed it with the political correctness bull shit, people trying to gain power using well intentioned dupes.  I don't think the answer is to run off to other side and play a different equally stupid game. Like Bret Weinstein said, this appears to me like political PTSD. I disagree. man, they just keep coming out of the woodwork in post-trump america.

i was going to quote some choice bits of the article, but the whole thing is literally rife with them. reading that piece was a trip, man. it reads like an onion article, just not funny. and here i thought roy moore and that literal nazi who ran unopposed in a district of chicago was as nuts as it was going to get.

&gt; In 2017 he ran in Virginia’s House of Delegates District 31 and secured less than 2 percent of the vote. 

how did he even get ANY votes??I would counter it’s a culture thing and not a sexist thing because bitch in the US is the female equivalent of dick. Think do you call people a prick? I know on the scale of insults dick&lt;prick. I think you see the same thing with cunt. the comment in the samantha bee post wasn't enough and you just had to make another post, huh.

everyone on the left rightfully dismissed all of the right wing pundits' whattaboutism with roseanne the other day, don't get pulled into the same tu quoque fallacy bullshit.Please see my response in the post about this&gt; **Blake Smith is a historian of European interactions with South Asia and a postdoctoral fellow at the European University Institute. His essays regularly appear on Aeon.co, Scroll.in and other media.** "What about regulation?"

Another one:

ICO guy: "The SEC is not a problem, but can be a problem."

Pakman: "Understood."

Really? You understood that? As someone that made his brand around calling it like he sees it, you might be damaging your brand with this.to be fair, the knowledge panel was working as intended, aggregating the info from multiple sources. can't really fault it for labeling one of its ideologies as nazism when their constituents flirt/associate with or are associated with white supremacist ideology.Jenn annoys me to no end. I get what your saying. I like most of the other hosts but god I can’t stand Jenn. I like the content. I used to listen to Onpoint a lot but after Tom Ashbrook it isn’t the same. It has gone all cable TV panel but on NPRThis is today's news related to the same - https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/4354nb/google-is-labeling-trump-supporting-republican-state-senator-a-bigot. Some smart hackers know the google algorithm for knowledge panel and doing this scandal. All the right wing "snowflakes" are blaming the left-wing "Google" for this (while keeping quiet about anything POTUS says :))Nice explanation. You need to be in Vox/Atlantic :). Unfortunately most people are living in the 140-chracter-tweet world and dont want detailed explanation or understanding. And btw..she has said nasty/racist things about susan rice as well. And she believes lot of conspiracy theories as well. Combination of all these led to her firing (imho)Indeed, the issue with ignoring this problem due to fear of being labelled a racist has allowed for people like Robinson to come in an hijack a very important message. Cowardice brought us this, instead of standing up for the women who were hurt by these band of barbarians... I'll never understand the far left's strange marriage with Islam.I know. The democrats need something to rally around and I think this should be it.Of course willful ignorance is at play to some degree, due in part to the ongoing attack on "academic elitism" the pat on the back for being a "real American" (real as in working too hard to have time for deep investigation of truth, let alone reflection on it), and the rejection of "political correctness."  --That term alone has (I believe) had a weird longterm effect on some people, a subliminal suggestion that correct=incorrect, if even an obvious truth is coming from the 'wrong' side of politics, it must be untrue, or at least treated as such.  
But when you read comments on FOX News comment boards, you get the impression that only SOME commenters are fine with simple ingestion of basically embracing Trump and the far-Right as making America great again.  Some others at least APPEAR interested in being informed, as they cite long rants and lists of "facts" as they see them.  And where do they see them?  FOX News, and other political outlets like conservative radio and internet sites.  This is compounded by the fact that all these outlets are pounding into their minds that CNN, MSNBC etc. deliver nothing but lies, so you have to assume that some portion of the FOX News audience never check out any other source.  After all, they're working too hard, you see.  
By the way, I chose the Roseanne/Samantha vs. tariffs comparison only because they were arguably the most-discussed topics on most media in that 24-hour cycle, and yet FOX News was barely mentioning the tariffs.  I have seen other stories that were unfavorable to Trump that FOX News did not cover AT ALL.   well...fox news (ingraham..atleast) is still trying to float the "spy" boat :)

The sad truth is
what decent/honest republican leaders believe/support - IS OF NO INTEREST to their hardcore base/voters. Props to Joe.What does this have to do with what he is talking about? Are you on drugs?What an absurd statement. Holy Strawman Batman!&gt;Ultimately, we have to call this sort of behavior what it is, and what it would be called when applied to any other group; and that is racism. Dyson’s comment was definitively and unequivocally racist, and indeed a hell of a thing to say in a debate.Probably the first time I up\-vote one of your comments :\)lol "The IDW is wrong" how confused does one have to be to make that statement.I dunno, attractive, black and supports Trump. People on the right play identity politics too, not just the SJW's. This will determine it, where you born in South America? :OI am no scientist, so yes. Then why is he not agreeing with Candance here? I don't get what you're saying here.He really does need to drop the 'socialist' moniker altogether; it only confuses people.  And he needs to admit that while free healthcare and college for all are attainable end games, a lot must be done beforehand, to even begin scaffolding a path to those goals.  Reversing the lopsided tax cut as much as possible and raising the minimum wage would be a damn good start.  Thank you for sharing this.  I didn't know about it (I could take or leave most Maher episodes).  Did yall catch what Bill said at the end, "I'll be with you if you run again."  --Kind of amazing for such a staunch Hilary supporter in the past. eh, it's okay, though i don't like how he throws hypothetical numbers out there regarding cost to other businesses (ie "walmart won't pay us $40,000,000,000") as it just comes off as hyperbole and less-informed people might just blow off his entire argument as scare-mongering.

what he should've done is post actual data plans from other countries without net neutrality while using the female voice examples to hammer home the point that not only they *could* do it, but they *have* done it and are doing it currently.this, for sure. same with trans and supports trump, gay and supports trump, etc.

the logic is, for example, "if a black person says BLM is bullshit, it's okay for us to keep attacking it," or "if a gay person says gays aren't oppressed, it's okay for us to push anti-gay agendas," etc.

typically it quickly devolves into "token black says black people are lazy."WOOOOOOOW aww man. this is a great laugh this morning.

"what's the website?"

"scientific american."

loooooooolshow's over guys, she read a forum post once and then read about climate change one night.it doesn't bother me but i've noticed it myself. he always kind of chuckles and glances knowingly to pat. it'd be slightly insulting if the caller could see his face as the call goes down.

it'd be like rolling your eyes at a caller. to be fair though, callers are so. freaking. bad. with TDPS for some reason. the speakerphone thing is a constant problem. callers being unprepared is a constant problem. he even tells people beforehand, "don't use your speakerphone, and try to have your question written down beforehand" and it's like nobody bothers.

edit- i think i just listened to the clip you were talking about, i had it on in the background, the one about gentrification in DC? if you don't watch the clip it sounds totally neutral, no condescension at all. i think it's just his occasional smirks that irk (some people; also, how bout that sick rhyme).

TDPS = THE DAVID PAKMAN SMIRKBecause most of the callers are not good. I honestly HATE when he takes calls. I am far more condescending in my head.whats funny is the reddit sections and answering emails goes fairly well. Over all David has a condescending attitude. You see it in his segments as a whole. I think it’s part and parcel of his personality.

*Edit*
I do not think this is bad. I just think David just doesnt suffer fools. If his attitude bothered me I wouldn't listen or even be on his reddit page. 
1. I am calm
2. I know and it isnt funny and they also usually use trigger to signal sarcasm
3. Twitter is a pile of hot garbage and I dont have it
4. Being a dick has nothing to do with harm. Its a personality trait.A. No we didnt. Iraq's army had been decimated in the Iran/Iraq war. Most of its top staff had been eliminated by Saddam and they never recovered from the first gulf war. Iran also has the 13th strongest military in the world (https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=iran) Also that data your claiming is from 1991 before Gulf War One. So no they are not weaker then Saddam was. 
B. When we invaded Germany 80% of their force were on the Eastern front. If they hadnt D-Day would have been a massacre. 
C. We have not invaded Pakistan. What are you even talking about. We have "Strategic" Partnership. Which really means we pay bribes and the Pakistani military doesn't shoot our plans down. Trey are STILL passively supporting the Taliban and support their own terror groups in Kashmir. We are in Pakistan because they let us and they could close that door tomorrow. They are also very close to war with India right now. Iran and Pakistan have been close since 1947 and is insanely popular in Pakistan. Also look at a Map its not about politics or war criminal state. Its about being surrounded by "Enemies" on all sides. 
D. Yes but Russia didnt have and alliance with Iraq. Iran does. Also Iran is polled very favorably in Russia. Then once again we are at the geography question. This would give the US a satellite state (or how the Russians would see it) on the Caspian. You think Russia wants that?
E. No they are not, Europe actively wants to do business there. It actively supports continuing the Nuclear Freeze treaty without the US. It may even defy US sanctions to do it. They have a decent relationship with Russia and China. 
To your final point go study the Iran/Iraq war. Iran did the same things in the 80s yet thousands rallied at invasion. There are no secular middle eastern countries with a military worth a piss in a rain storm. The Saudis follow the Wahhabi line and they are the only nation with any military force. It would also devolve into a Shia v Sunni extremely quickly. Iran has supported Hezbollah for decades, you make the point your self. They are actively involved in Yeman as well as other middle east states. Your OWN points contradict your argument on this one. 
Go study the Iran/Iraq war I am not kidding. Iran is far more capable then you think and has been considering this possibility since the 70's. I will also point out you 

I will add role out a map and look at the strait of Hormuz. Ground based mobile Anti Sea missiles, mines and midget subs would cut off the Persian Gulf. 20% of the worlds oil travel through this point. 

Could the US win strait RTS style sure. Could they win in the real world. No, at best we would achieve a Pyrrhic victory like Iraq but only worse. With a ruined economy, a broken spirit and a military so exhausted I cant react to the next crisis. 
She's onto us, climate change shills. Better cash in boys. You seem terribly confused about what the IDW is about. Here I'll just copy paste this here:

&gt;Just to be clear, I think I've said this before. I view this notion of the IDW as a tongue in cheek analogy that should not be taken too seriously. This is a phrase that Eric Weinstein used in one of my podcasts, then I think he used it a second time in the podcast I did with Ben Shapiro. I used the IDW in the title of the podcast, I thought about this for no more than 30 seconds.  
&gt;  
&gt;There was no deep motive there, I just thought it was an amusing phrase, again it is a tongue in cheek . The analogy though was appropriate in that the dark web is this part of the internet that won't show up on your google search and that you need kind of separate browser to access. I've actually never gone on the dark web, I think it's the tor \(?\) browser that gets you there.  
&gt;  
&gt;So there is this domain of internet activity that the mainstream internet user knows virtually nothing about and that analogy seemed apropos at the time. Because, what's happening is that there is a very rich, long form conversation occurring on platforms like this to comparatively large audiences that the mainstream media knows very little about.  
&gt;  
&gt;The mainstream media for the most part is unaware that Joe Rogan for instance, who was also inducted into this IDW, the mainstream media doesn't know that he has a larger audience than most of the most popular shows on television. That would be news, still, too many people in the media. So Joe can have a 3 hour conversation with whoever he wants, rather than a 5 minute interview on CNN, to a much larger audience.  
&gt;  
&gt;That's interesting, and it is changing how ideas spread. That was what Eric was calling out. What most of those people in the article have in common is not their beliefs and opinions in general but it's their orientation with respect to trends on the far\-left that are closing down conversation. The de\-platforming, the political correctness, the judging that certain topics are taboo, all of that is something that everyone in the IDW has spent a fair amount criticizing and pushing back against.  
&gt;  
&gt;But if you're gonna talk about me and Jordan Peterson in the same sentence or me and Ben Shapiro in the same sentence, you have to acknowledge that we disagree about almost everything. So the IDW does not name a unified group, much less a tribe in any normal sense. If we have anything in common is we have a willingness to have a civil conversation about polarizing and important topics. Anyway, the phrase is still something that I view as tongue in cheek, somewhat like the 4 horsemen. That was Hitch, Dawkins, Dennet and I were dubbed the 4 horsemen for the purposes of that video. And that sort of stuck. The "new\-atheist" phrase though we did not apply that to ourselves, but that stuck for quite sometime. As you know I have misgivings about even the term Atheist, so I don't take any of this stuff very seriously. For better or worse. \-Sam HarrisYes unfortunately, I also see this happening on the left too. When I talk about the improvement to healthcare globally or the reduction of absolute poverty I get the exact same response, "the other tribe said it so I reject it." You should be in FBI or investigative reporting. &lt;thumbs-up&gt;&gt; I don't trust anyone pushing the notion that "SJWs" are against "free speech." This is a right wing if not alt-right talking point. 

I'm sorry but I must push back here. Take a look at [this Brookings study](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/09/18/views-among-college-students-regarding-the-first-amendment-results-from-a-new-survey/). (Brookings is one of the most respected think tanks in the country). They asked a variety of questions 
 to college students which provoked alarming answers. For example on the question of
&gt; "A student group opposed to the speaker disrupts the speech by loudly and repeatedly shouting so that the audience cannot hear the speaker. Do you agree or disagree that the student group’s actions are acceptable?"


62 percent of college Democrats said yes. To me, that is quite alarming. Notably, however, there were also concerning answers coming from Republicans as well which also is equally troublesome.I agree. Both parties play identity politics.

But starting with the premise that identity politics are generally a bad thing for nations because they lead to tribalism, I think we as progressives have a moral duty not to play identity politics. We want to be better than the right, not the moral equivalent.She claims "she is a free thinker". Does that mean "I reject left-wing group-think....but i am ok with right-wing group-think"? :) 

IF she is a free thinker...she should just say...i dont have opinion on climate change because i have not learnt/thought about it a lot.Really? You think it's that drastic? I understand what you're saying and somewhat agree but I have to push back slightly. This stereotype has only been around for a few years. Other stereotypes (racial for example) have been around for decades/centuries. I think it might be easier to get rid of this stereotype simply because it is newer.There you go now you get it. It's a joke :\) what are you an autist? Don't take yourself so seriously John. :\)There are right wingers worth listening to Owens is just not one of them.  The whole "that's a different tribe" approach to information gathering is kind of silly. Just because someone disagrees with your worldview it does not automatically make them irrational.

Edit: Actually, I have to temper my comment about Owens not being someone worth listening to. She's clearly not someone worth listening to about anything science, but maybe she has something valuable to say but I have not had the time or desire to hear w/e else she has to say.

Edit2: Ok I tried, I really did. I can't listen to her, the "like I like use like the word like every like other word is like driving me nuts" Communication director? That's her title right? I linked to [this Brookings study/poll](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/09/18/views-among-college-students-regarding-the-first-amendment-results-from-a-new-survey/) in another comment. Like I said, Brookings is one of the most respected think tanks in the country. They surveyed college students.

Here are two concerning poll results:

&gt; A student group opposed to the speaker disrupts the speech by loudly and repeatedly shouting so that the audience cannot hear the speaker. Do you agree or disagree that the student group’s actions are acceptable?

62 percent of Democrats said it was acceptable.

&gt; A student group opposed to the speaker uses violence to prevent the speaker from speaking. Do you agree or disagree that the student group’s actions are acceptable?

20 percent of Democrats agreed.

I don't have any instances of specific calls for arrest, but to me, tolerance for violence is worse. As I also said before, this study showed alarming concerns for Republican free speech attitudes as well. But that is a separate conversation. 


To your first point, they are correlated in the sense that attitudes and opinions form the basis on which all policy is made. All policy has to start from somewhere, and this is where it starts. Hence looking at attitudes towards free speech currently can inform us of potential developing policies.

To your second point. This is actually a pretty complicated question. I encourage you to read [this](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-speech-2/free-speech-on-public-college-campuses-overview/campus-speakers/) from the Newseum's First Amendment Center. From that source, schools can input rules and regulations

&gt; “if they have reason to believe that the speaker will advocate violent rebellion against the government or immediate, destructive, and disruptive action against the host institution.”

Otherwise, 
&gt; “courts have held that when an audience brings someone to campus to speak, the school bears a constitutional responsibility not to interfere." 

This is assuming the school is a public university. Further, I would cite to you the Charles Murray incident at Middleburry as an alarming incident. 

Regardless, the grander point I have is not about the specific policies, but rather about the image of the left and how that impacts the election. At the end of the day, I want to see Democrats get elected to stop Trump and the Republicans as much as possible. The SJW/snowflake stereotype is going to be deeply damaging in November if we don't actively fight and address it.I have my doubts she understand what that word means. You're very sensitive. :)Thank you! These are some of the ideas I was looking for. Point number 3 is absolutely an effective counter because the right has their own SJWs/snowflakes as well. Bill Maher has commented on it Ha, thanks but all I do is nerd out on this stuff instead of getting important things done.  I would think the argument they would make is that since you "own" the property it is your right to do with you need. The government only has a duty and right to protect that ownership and the right for others to have ownership rights as well. It gets into social contract philosophy and you have hit on one of the key flaws in Libertarianism. Were does the government end and why? What rights are part of the social contract and which aren't. They make very Utilitarian claims (Lots of benefits for the most people) for the ones the support and go all deontological (its morally wrong ie people have innate rights) when it is something they disagree with. This is a perfect example. 
we've seen denial, we've seen anger, are we now in the bargaining stage? soon we'll have depression and an emo president, and then acceptance, if the stages are to be believed.&gt; Speaking on a college campus is not some right granted by the Constitution

This was what I was referring to. That Cato Institute study is also interesting. 

I agree with all your points. Perhaps maybe this is a youth issue rather than a left wing issue. 

For whatever reasons, fair or unfair, the left still have that snowflake/SJW image though and I think it's important to counter that. &gt; However, if a student group books a speaker and the auditorium, the university is constitutionally bound to allow the event.

Right but this is what we were talking about though. He/she was talking about controversial speakers who had been invited to speak and I was responding to that. &gt; For example on the question of

&gt;    "A student group opposed to the speaker disrupts the speech by loudly and repeatedly shouting so that the audience cannot hear the speaker. Do you agree or disagree that the student group’s actions are acceptable?"

&gt; 62 percent of college Democrats said yes. To me, that is quite alarming. Notably, however, there were also concerning answers coming from Republicans as well which also is equally troublesome.

it's getting a little late for me and my mind is in non-debating wind-down mode, but i would argue that the example you mentioned is irrelevant in regards to free speech, as protesting is itself a form of free speech, if we're gonna go all free speech absolutist about it. is it okay to stifle one while allowing the other? regardless, "free speech" does not mean "i have a right to a platform and i have the right to be heard without interruption or disagreement," but i'm sure you're aware of that.&gt; I think anyone calling themself a social justice warrior should just drop the modifier, just be a justice warrior. 

eh, the word itself is politically toxic. the right abhors it and the left mocks it. slicing off "social" in front of it isn't going to fix it. that's like changing 'stinky wet fart' to 'wet fart'- it's still a fart, and the stinkiness is implied.

if anything, i'd suggest just not using the label, period.agreed with most of what you said, but just to be a nitpicky bastard...

&gt; raison d'état

i think you meant raison d'etre.Abnormally long, don't you think? Hands like a zeta reticulan....Maybe you're an alien too?Is that a threat? You worried about me finding out about your alien plan to control the world? Guess what? I'm on to you and your compadres like George Soros. yeah but that doesn't make any sense though, because it's not mint-flavored. feh!lol, no, but if we can turn my pedantic musings into a joke i'm all for it. haha.Honestly it has that social engineering operation feel. I just feels someone (FSB) looked at gamer gate and saw that nerd culture was a wedge to use to further divide us and has gone after it whole hog. I don’t know but maybe I’ve gone down the conspiracy rabbit hole. I just left TLJ and people were talking about how great it was. I live in a conservative city. It wasn’t till the next week I literally saw people’s opinions change after watching some jack ass on YouTube. I don’t know the it’s diverse point is too simplistic. I agree Maher is entertainment not discourse. I tune in for the jokesLooks like Trump decided that Guilani can babble useless/controversial stuff and the media/social-media will keep going behind him.

Imho...we should have a record of all the stupid things done by POTUS and Guilani...but dont spend time analyzing/thinking/discussing about it. It seems like a kind of a distraction technique !! SENSIBLE MEDIA SHOULD IGNORE THESE BULLSHIT It's fun/entertainment...so its not really waste of time. But you make a good point about it...that its not in-depth like PBS/DP or Vox/Atlantic reporting. I would just use it as a gateway to learn more stuff So I agree with you but I would also point out that many “SJWs” do not want to have rational conversations. Their feelings or perception trumps all. Often they don’t want a debate they want to dictate. That’s the real issue and why often you have to tell them their feelings don’t matter. You have to break the framework to rebuild it. To be fair the right has the exact same issue. *cough gun control *cough. It’s sad but it’s the truth.Bought by George SorosI don't mind the guy for being a comedian who talks about politics. At the same time giving moronic guest airtime to talk bs can a problem if you don't challenge them. Again, I'm just talking.I'm not purist when it comes to science and or  math equations. However, I do agree with your point. True bad guest equals more viewers = money. Ahhh, I didn't know he was originally for Bernie; it seems like I got the impression somewhere he was a truly centrist Clinton fan.  --Probably heard Dore say that, ha.  That dude is such an enigma to me; I hate him one day, love him the next, then hate him again.  One thing's for sure; he's bad about recognizing nuances like a good pundit.  He either loves or hates everyone and everything, and oversimplifies the argument either way.  Thank you for clarifying that about Maher, for me.  It's a reminder that I shouldn't hold a belief about someone if I can't even remember where I got it from.  I don’t know if I can change your mind. I would say that I think religion is a the perfect epitome of machiavellianism. It is both loved and hated. It’s a system of control that is immensely powerful. It can then be turned to any variety of purposes. I don’t think it inherently evil. Best example is Jesus espoused very left leaning ideas. Power corrupts. Religion is powerful. I don’t think in of itself religion does those things you state. It’s the people in it who use it as a tool to do those things.It’s a bad day when Joe Rogan makes look like and idiot. How dare he defame gorillas like that! If any thing he is some form of baboon like papio stupidus. Joking aside and on a serious note this would be if I as a white man used the word nigger and the to justify it called myself one too. Still racist and is beside the pointI would ignore the right's fight against Bee...because they gave benefit of doubt to the POTUS who used the P.ssy word. 

But
it's the left/sjw that prefers "politically-correct" language so that we dont offend listeners. So...just from decency perspective, it will be better to avoid insults like this. Basically the argument in media has shifted to the "word" rather than the "content" (separating kids from parents).I have similar question as well.

thanks to AI logic of youtube... i ran into this video...and he has a point about supporting GOP (https://youtu.be/UkSpcyu9cV0?list=PL2fm__ojrXphlUhKwhpOKwdvSAAQXcHOq&amp;t=531)what is your source? &gt; In a late Monday filing in Washington, prosecutors accused Manafort and a longtime associate they previously linked to Russian intelligence of repeatedly contacting two members of a public-relations firm since February to secure false testimony about their collective work involving a group of former senior European politicians.

&gt; The group, informally called the “Hapsburg group,” was secretly retained in 2012 by Manafort to take positions favorable to Ukraine, for whom Manafort was working, prosecutors charged.

&gt; In court documents, including an affidavit by FBI agent Brock W. Domin, prosecutors with Special Counsel Robery S. Mueller III allege Manafort and his associate-- referred to only as Person A - tried to contact the two witnesses by phone and through an encrypted messaging program. 

and from [reuters' coverage](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-manafort/manafort-attempted-to-tamper-with-potential-witnesses-u-s-special-counsel-idUSKCN1J1043):

&gt; FBI Special Agent Brock Domin, in a declaration filed with Mueller’s motion, said Manafort had attempted to call, text and send encrypted messages in February to two people from “The Hapsburg Group,” a firm he worked with to promote the interests of Ukraine.

&gt; The FBI has documents and statements from the two people, as well as telephone records and documents recovered through a search of Manafort’s iCloud account showing that Trump’s former campaign manager attempted communication while he was out on bail, according to Domin. 

&gt; The communications were “in an effort to influence their testimony and to otherwise conceal evidence,” Domin wrote. “The investigation into this matter is ongoing.” Trekker....😜. Star Wars has always been on the liberal side too. Just a guess !! I meant to say...she lost black vote compared to obama. it may be because of race, mass incarceration during bill clinton rule.David Parman is basically a leftist libertarian (also a Zeta Reticulan). Ask him. i guess the folks who criticize obama probably needs to read the following (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/14/progress-african-american-community-during-obama-administration). But most likely they are going to ignore it because its from the establishment/party :)well...only if Manafort flips and pleads guilty...right?[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcuWPpsDdQM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcuWPpsDdQM)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcuWPpsDdQM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcuWPpsDdQM)

When she argues about income inequality that's clearly a left\-wing position and people on the right like Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder dismiss that as irrelevant as long as people aren't poor and the wealth wasn't 'stolen'.Ohhh that’s goodwell....i dont know how income-inequality is Koch-Brother issue. atleast I cannot connect the dots.

The right wing dont talk about inequality...but their argument will be "if govt dont make people lazy by helping out the poor/disabled, it will make them work harder and make more money". [ I am not agreeing with this logic...but my guess on right-wing philosophy ]well...they have already spread their wealth and their ideology !! i am sure they will promote someone in their inner circle to safeguard their interest/philosophy&gt; well....i dont know how income-inequality is Koch-Brother issue. atleast I cannot connect the dots.
&gt; 
&gt; 

No i'm not arguing that income inequality is a right-wing talking point which it isnt as i said. Income inequality is something a bernie fan would argue and so I'm arguing that her mask has slipped off because she tries argue income inequality as if it's a right-wing talking point and also mentioned how climate change is a hoax without giving any evidence to validate her arguement. She's a koch hoeah...i guess...i got your point.

"She is wearing right-wing mask just for money/koch-money...but she cares more about progressive issues at heart". Interesting !!He completely understands the media/sjw/haters attitude (i.e. they will most likely nitpick/over-analyze every tweet/geture and find faults) and taunts them.

This news atleast is worth taking a note because it points out the fake-news mentality of POTUS and his fox media. This can be used as a argument when talking to his supporters. (But i dont like when every tweet of him and his lawyer Rudy's non-sense is analyzed to death)The Dead Milkmen should sue Alex Jones whose whole career is a living copyright infringement of their song 'Stuart.'  Find it on Youtube if you haven't heard it, and tell me I'm wrong.  The voice and everything. Isn't the entire reason Owens has any level of notoriety is because she is an African American conservative commentator? I can't think of any reason she'd be popular other than she makes stodgy old conservatives feel better about their worldview by validating their message as "The Truth."

Otherwise, that means she's popular because of her poorly thought out and egregiously articulated ideas, which paints a pretty destitute picture of America.  


Sidenote: I find it fascinating how she brings up Jim Crow Laws and Racial Segregation, but seems to think that the these historical policies have had no long term effects and are undone because everyone is now equal according to law. She is the rankest form of political shill, no wonder PragerU would have her on.Your question about the internet's role is one I struggle with every day, in some manner or other.  I think it DOES both undermine and amplify the 'showbiz' effect.  On the one hand, it offers countless-fold more viewpoints than television (most of which can be accessed at-will, as opposed to when-aired, which increases accessibility exponentially).  On the other hand, it offers countless-fold more distractions from any viewpoint (including other viewpoints).  Furthermore, the ability of the user to become PART of the 'showbiz' (via social media and even comment sections like this) complicate things even further.  How often do we scroll down a Youtube video to read comments before the video is over, or even before we let it play?!  
What really disturbs me is how easily so many people dismiss the Russian interference story --Incidentally I just let the cursor blink at least a full minute before I settled on the word 'story'; that's a good example of the almost crippling effect 'showbiz' has on those of us with hyper-critical thinking.  Because it's a story in the sense that it's a narrative of something that happened, but both 'story' and 'narrative' are used as accusations nowadays.  To Trump-lovers, it's just the Leftist 'narrative' that Russians had anything to do with his win.  Some aren't even aware of the ACTUAL narrative; they think the narrative is that Russians changed the vote counts.  Others know what the real narrative is, but deny that it could have effected their votes.  
And there are even people on the Left rallying against the narrative.  I recently saw a Jimmy Dore segment where he showed silly memes of Hilary behind bars or fighting Jesus as examples of the kind of propaganda the Russians used, because (if you didn't know) Jimmy's assertion is that Russia isn't worth thinking about, that our attention should be on mainstream Democrats because they aren't much better than Republicans.   One gets the sense he is concerend about the showbiz effects on our attention spans, to the point that he has no trust in people walking and chewing gum at the same time, that we can't balance concerns about shitty politicians AND shitty foreign enemies. So he tries to steal the show, using straw man examples of what Russian interference looked like.   But make no mistake, the Russian interference involved far more insidious tactics than Hilary cartoons; they used fake BLM messaging and other social justice causes to rile the Right out of their recliners--things that had no direct link to Trump, Clinton, or the election itself.  And all it took was 70-something thousand votes, in just the right states, and now we have Trump.  Even the savviest conservative voter cannot speak for the stupidest, and there are plenty of stupid people, let's face it.  What's so brilliant about what the Russians did is that it cannot be proven. There is no forensic capable of measuring what caused each person to vote the way they did.   Like murdering a junkie by giving him a bag of extra-strong heroin, all the toxicology report shows is that he died from heroin overdose, no way to know what he knew about the heroin.  
What scares the shit out of me is that this cat is out of the bag, and nobody cares because there's a fucking elephant in the room (Trump)!  Yes, he IS the epitome of that book, if I understand your summation of it.  And yes I should read it.  But do I have time to read a 179-page book anymore?  I don't know, I have so many bookmarked website pages I want to read......y'know what I'm saying?  I see. Again, it's just something I thought I should let you know. 

And please don't misinterpret me; I know the DPS is a full-time job for you, but I always got the impression your main focus was the radio and that your YT channel was more a secondary priority. If that's not the case, then I apologize.You have a strange definition of "facts"&gt; Elon Musk offers a good example of how technocrats don’t always get it right, and why trusting them with the world’s progress is risky. On 23 May, Musk [sent a tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999367582271422464) declaring he will create a new website “where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication.” Sounds great, right? Maybe not so much. He has decided to call it *Pravda*, which means ‘truth’ in Russian. It is also, of course, the name of a Russian newspaper and former propaganda arm of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party. Two days later, Musk [announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1000080833678528512) that, since the domain name was already taken, that Pravduh.com was bought instead. Apparently, he is serious. I am seeing some poor arguments against and for the IDW on both sides, I think there is always room for nuanced thought. 

From the post:

"The first talking point – that the term is silly – is surely true. So is the second point – that it awkwardly combines careful and important thinkers like Eric Weinstein with awful demagogues like Ben Shapiro. So is the third – that people have been complaining about political correctness for decades, so anything that portrays this as a sudden revolt is ahistorical. There are probably more good points buried within the chaff.

But I want to focus on one of the main arguments that’s been emphasized in pretty much every article: can a movement really claim it’s being silenced if it’s actually pretty popular? "Very interesting point.

Similarly...
An extremist Hindu can refuse service to anyone who eats cow beef. (although hindu texts can be quoted for/against eating cow-beef).

For me..it seems like the Justice Department is going down different legal-path to avoid the `religion-vs-civil-rights` issue (i.e. they are saying that colorado folks were biased against religion). 

This court decision has potential to unlock pandora-box of cases !! :(Well...we have to ask Google AI/ML engineer who wrote the logic for the Ads :)

Couple of hypothesis

a) Probably its based on your youtube habits. ie. you may be visiting some right-wing videos

b) Probably dailywire is paying MORE to google to air its ad. So the algorithm is probably matching on top-level topics like `politics` and showing the ad.

And yes, I do get what you're saying; I agree that the internet both amplifies the traditional television program whilst at the same time undermining it. I believe that this undermining is a result of a return to the typographic tradition, whereby people consume a lot more media by reading it and then writing a response, as we are doing here. I also think that the ever decreasing attention spans of the modern age are also highly relevant, and Postman goes into significant detail as to why the typographic mind is much better suited for intellectual rigors than the televised mind. Specifically, when you read text, you are in active engagement with the material, working through the premises and ideas in an involved fashion that lends itself very well to orderly and concise thinking.

Indeed, he dedicates a whole chapter to how the USA was before the invention of the telegraph, a highly literate population relative to other nations of the day that consumed a terrific amount of newspapers, pamphlets, books and the like. In fact, a popular trend throughout the 18th and 19th centuries were "Lecture Circuits," whereby public intellectuals and authors of the day would tour around the country to give talks that could last many hours to public halls packed with people eager to listen. Could you imagine a modern day audience sitting for over 3 hours to listen to one man talk about his ideas on philosophy, history, or the issues of the day? You can hardly get people to sit still for a 1.5hr long comedy special, let alone a public debate, which usually run about an hour at most.

If you get a chance, I would recommend you take a look, I think it would contextualize a lot of the media circus surrounding the Russian Collusion Scandal and why Trump is so hard to nail down in the public sphere on this issue and many others. As I said previously, the "Now... This!" phenomenon is in full swing, whereby we can hardly digest the last horrible thing the White House Administration has done before the next one is thrust upon us.Birds are basically dinosaurs.Excellent point, had not considered that.Your country appears to be gorgeous and it's on my top 5 to visit somedayI eat dinosaur eggs all the time.hehe :) Turns out they are good for you! wait no yes they are good for you.Not necessarily. I can see it being true to a few but definitely not the majority. 

I don't see why not adopt that model. What are the downsides of it? It seems to me that having people with expertise is probably a smarter way to do it. Do you have other sources ?

I am skeptical af of the NYT.

Also it doesn't seem like anybody in The Knife media team is named on that article.

Edit: I got this from another user:

&gt;In response, some twitter users and media publications pointed out that The Knife Media is a cult, or is closely related to one, namely NXIVM. I've been a casual reader of The Knife Media, and found this accusation disturbing. While their methodology for grading articles is unclear, i generally find their analysis logical and accurate. Feeling duped, I ended up reading all the related "Top stories" on google; namely Gizmodo's, Slate's and Fortune's.

&gt;  
&gt;All three publications treat the relationship between The Knife Media and NXIVM as a given. Their source is an article written by Brock Wilbur for Paste Magazine titled "The Knife of Artsitotle Isn's Just a Fake "Fake News" Site \- It's a Cult".  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/the\-knife\-of\-aristotle\-isnt\-just\-a\-fake\-fake\-news.html](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/the-knife-of-aristotle-isnt-just-a-fake-fake-news.html)  
&gt;  
&gt;Slate called the Paste headline "straightforward", Gizmodo called the article "in\-depth", and Fortune called Wilbur an "investigative reporter".  
&gt;  
&gt;On his twitter page Brock Wilbur describes himself as a "Writer/Comedian/Frankenstein American", he mostly seems to write about games, comedy and entertainment. The article is written in a style of gonzo journalism, where Wilbur recounts his strange experience of applying for a job at The Knife Media (at that time called The Knife of Aristotle). The main connection Wilbur makes between The Knife Media and NXIVM is that Nicki Clyne a member of NXIVM, and a former cast member of Battlestar Galactica, worked as an executive producer at The Knife Media. This information is also listed on her Linked In page: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicki\-clyne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicki-clyne).  
&gt;  
&gt;Wilbur doesn't seem to have investigated this connection any further. It's possible that Nicki Clyne worked for The Knife Media, which like NXIVM is located in Albany, to support herself (after all Battlestar Galactica was a long time ago). Wilbur also hypothesizes that a one week training session given by The Knife Media was actually a cult recruitment seminar. To quote Carl Sagan "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.", however the evidence given here is fairly flimsy. Yet Gizmodo, Slate, and Fortune repeated these claims without any caveats.  
&gt;  
&gt;After googling the connection between The Knife Media and NXIVM myself, I found articles on websites frankreport.com and artvoice.com.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://frankreport.com/2017/07/18/the\-knife\-media\-pimps\-jens\-erik\-gould\-for\-secretive\-raniere/](https://frankreport.com/2017/07/18/the-knife-media-pimps-jens-erik-gould-for-secretive-raniere/)

&gt;  
&gt;The articles are poorly written, and their authors have names like Amigo and Artvoice. Both websites are owned by an Albany real\-estate developer Frank Parlato. Parlato is an ex employee of NXIVM and is credited with exposing their cult activities. He is also currently under federal indictment for fraud and money laundering. The Niagara Gazette describes how Parlato used his knowledge of NXIVM to get some federal charges dropped.  
&gt;  
&gt;[http://www.niagara\-gazette.com/news/local\_news/parlato\-facing\-new\-indictment/article\_6b0bdc3a\-3635\-5869\-b26a\-ab845c17c5a7.html](http://www.niagara-gazette.com/news/local_news/parlato-facing-new-indictment/article_6b0bdc3a-3635-5869-b26a-ab845c17c5a7.html)  
&gt;  
&gt;**All of this seems extremely suspicious. While it is plausible that The Knife Media really is a cult, albeit on the surface a very rational one, it's also possible that they're victims of lazy journalism**. It is notable that as of yet, they have not responded to these accusations. If they continue to stay silent, then I will have to stop reading their publication. Which is a shame, since i think they provide an important service.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is even more discouraging is that I had to do hours of research just to get some basic facts about this story. Ironically my experience only seems to confirm what Musk was saying about the media; it really has become a dumpster fire.

Hard to know what to believe anymore. This is the problem with News Outlets playing at activists. They lose credibility and you have to really go out of your way to get plausible facts.What a shame if true... &gt;Name ONE prominent figure on the left

I am not prominent but I am definitely left of center and I do not like political correctness and it has nothing to do with the reasons you gave above. Hi David, let me jump in here because thought I don't think you're defending postmodernists, you've given a lot of criticisms to it's critics. I figured since You're doing a Pseudo\-Science/intellectual segment this week but have yet to slam probably one of the biggest anti\-science movement which is relativism/postmodernist.

A notion of truth, however fuzzy, is needed for everyday life. To have a belief is to be committed to its truth. To assert a sentence in speech is also to be committed to its truth.

To accept an explanation is to think the explanation is true, otherwise it does not explain anything. To give up on a commitment to truth is to abdicate not only the capacity to have beliefs but also personal morality (‘I have not slept with anyone else, honest luv’). Everyday examples also illustrate the intuition that truth is objective.

Relativism is the belief that different theories or beliefs can be equally true relative to different standards. Some degree of relativism is consistent with caring about truth (you may care about legal truths even though they are relative to culture), but the extreme relativism (Postmodernist) shown by some commentators on science is not.

Some of the extreme views are the following:

1. ‘Scientific knowledge is purely the product of social forces, power struggles, and politics. The natural world has no role in the construction of scientific knowledge’. The basis of the claim is the famous under\-determination of theory by data. No matter what the evidence is, there are always a number of possible theories to account for it. Thus, the argument goes, it is the use of rhetoric and power that means one theory is chosen over another. The argument is misguided. First, if evidence underdetermines theory choice, so surely does the social political context. Thus if one does not believe that the natural world influences our theories, why should one believe that the social world does? Second, under\-determination of theory by evidence is a logical claim, but its practical implications are often non\-existent. The theories that the blood circulates, that genes are composed of DNA, that matter is made of atoms and so on are based on evidence that could be accounted for in other ways, but that does not mean there is a single competing theory on or anywhere near the table. Finally, to believe that one’s knowledge is based only on social pressure, not on the facts, is to believe you have no good reasons for your beliefs. There would therefore be no good reason for believing that all knowledge is the product of social forces.
2. ‘There is no absolute truth; true or false is always relative to someone’s perspective, it’s just a preference to believe certain things’. Is the claim that truth is relative to each person true for every person or just for the post\-modernist who believes it? If the former, the claim is absolutely rather than relatively true and the claim contradicts itself; if the latter, then since the claim is not true for me, I rightly will never be convinced by it. Thus such personal relativism is self\-defeating (Lynch, 2005).
3. ‘Physical reality is a social and linguistic construct’. This is a confusion of a representation with the fact it refers to. Sokal and Bricmont (1998, pp. 101–102) present the following passage, sadly from training material for teachers: ‘For many centuries it was considered to be a fact that the Sun revolves around the Earth each day. The appearance of another theory, such as that of the diurnal rotation of the Earth, entailed the replacement of the fact just cited by another: The Earth rotates on its axis each day’. The quote confuses a fact with the representation of the fact. A fact is a situation in the external world that exists whether we know it or not; beliefs represent those facts. If you think your beliefs could be wrong, then you accept a distinction between your belief (the representation) and the fact it targets (the way the world actually is). In the example in the quote, the facts did not change, just their representation. In day\-to\-day life, the distinction between facts and their representations is important to us. If facts are just points of views, why bother with criminal investigations? Do you care whether it is the actual rapist that gets caught? Why not adopt the view one can fly and jump out of an airplane? Blurring the distinction between representations and facts is something few people sincerely wish to do.

Typically people who make such cynical claims about the physical world are naively realist about the social world. However, if there are no objective facts about the physical world, there are no objective facts about the social world. If one is skeptical about the physical world, one should be equally so about the social world. Welcome to the world of solipsists, population: you.

4. ‘The science of one society is no more valid than that of another’. It is true that medical practices in other cultures may have useful components which we should not arrogantly dismiss. Perhaps some herbs in Chinese, African or South American traditions can genuinely cure specific ailments. But there will be a culture\-independent fact as to whether any given herb does have a therapeutic action beyond the placebo effect. The way to find that out is by double\-blind trials. Different cultures may have valuable things to teach each other; but that does not mean that greater evidence for one cultural view (‘that mountain was caused by tectonic pressure’) rather than a competing one (‘that mountain was a giant white lion that fell asleep’) makes no difference. If you had a major heart attack, would you want your friend to call the witch doctor or the medical doctor??

Cheers!Exactly correct. His lunacy might be exposed if he actually *tries* to comply with the court orderI do listen to the Daily. However, the NYT has not been entirely honest with a lot of their articles. As I posted above. So it is hard to say. 

Edit:

I think in this case better safe than sorry, I will delete the post and refrain from using The Knife. Hopefully, it gets sorted out somehow.What happened with that hit piece they did on Jordan Peterson? Whatever your opinions on the man, There was nothing about Nellie Bowles's article that could be construed as remotely honest.


Btw I took down the Knife article because I am leaning on the side of caution. I am worried that situation is even worse now..

The POTUS supporters are going to SUPPORT/ELECT him again even if he does illegal things because he is the only-one who can beat up opponents. (They dont care if he is doing it for national security or not) :(He is referring to academia. In which case the sentence is valid, for example what happened with Bret during the Evergreen fiasco. Many professors were in agreement privately with Bret but refused to do it publicly for fear of losing their jobs.

It seems like  you're missing the point. It is not the prominent figures of the IDW who are themselves silenced (although attempts have been tried), it is people who share some similar opinions in college campuses who are not able to speak up.

Here is a link to some more information about that:

[Intolerance on college campuses.](https://heterodoxacademy.org/the-skeptics-are-wrong-part-3-intolerance-levels-are-high/)

[An Interesting Debate on the Subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsTuMmyHw8s)Here is a great article written by Richard Dawkins on Post\-Modernism called Postmodernist Disrobed:

[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/dawkins.html](http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/dawkins.html)

Also Can't go wrong with Hitchens:

**“The Postmodernists' tyranny wears people down by boredom and semi\-literate prose.” \- Christopher Hitchens**Fair enough.If you said no you must not know a lot of people. Honestly conspiracy Alex Jones types are everywhere. Maybe it’s because I live near North Idaho....I'll just leave this here:

Some postmodernists don't quite understand that there is actually such a thing as a reality that isn't just a cultural artifact and doesn't care what you think of it. This can lead to some embarrassment.

Of particular note was the 1996 Sokal Affair, in which NYU physicist Alan Sokal submitted and had published a paper called "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity"[\[40\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Postmodernism#cite_note-40) in the literary journal *Social Text*. The paper was intended by Sokal to be nonsensical and ridiculous. **For example, he asserted that** [**gravity**](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gravity) **was a social construct.**[**\[41\]**](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Postmodernism#cite_note-41)

As a result of the affair, *Social Text* was awarded the dubious honor of an [Ig Nobel Prize](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize) in literature for "eagerly publishing research that they could not understand, that the author said was meaningless, and which claimed that reality does not exist."[\[42\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Postmodernism#cite_note-42)

**Enabling pseudoscience**

Some figures influenced by postmodernism, such as Phillip Johnson[\[43\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Postmodernism#cite_note-43) and [Steve Fuller](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Steve_Fuller),[\[44\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Postmodernism#cite_note-44) have used its rhetorical tactics to push [intelligent design](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Intelligent_design) [creationism](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Creationism). [Rick Santorum](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rick_Santorum) was also found to be using them to attack his opponents,[\[45\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Postmodernism#cite_note-45) which may prove to be the best excuse to create a real\-life [irony meter](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Irony_meter).

Figures associated with postmodernism sometimes explicitly defended [pseudoscience](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pseudoscience). Unfortunately, their enthusiasm for attacking mainstream notions of accepted thinking has on occasion spilled over into an ignorant blanket acceptance of all sorts of rebellious "science." Feyerabend used his concept of "epistemological anarchism" to give cover to creationism, [astrology](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Astrology), and [alternative medicine](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine).[\[46\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Postmodernism#cite_note-46) Resistance to [biological explanations of behavior](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology) has been labeled "secular creationism."[\[47\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Postmodernism#cite_note-47) While not an indictment of the critical utility of postmodernism, this does illustrate that there is a danger in supporting dissent for dissent's own sake.

In another example, prominent critic Jacques Lacan has been criticized for attempting to resuscitate [Freudian](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) psychoanalysis, much of which is considered pseudoscientific in current [psychology](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Psychology).[\[48\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Postmodernism#cite_note-48)[\[49\]](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Postmodernism#cite_note-49) He was unsuccessful, much to everyone's relief (except in his home country of France, sadly, where his ideas have had a tragic following, and where it's still hard to criticize his kind of intellectual crookery without [being accused of fascism](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_Law)). On the other hand, many postmodernist thinkers reject Freudianism outright. Perhaps most notably, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari co\-authored *Anti\-Oedipus*, a thorough and systematic criticism of Freud and Lacan's influence on the humanities and political culture. Many other thinkers, such as [Slavoj Žižek](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek), employ psychoanalytic ideas in a way that is consciously anything but faithful to their orthodox interpretation.

By and large, postmodernists are also critical of mainstream psychology, which Michel Foucault, Judith Butler and many "[queer](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Queer) theorists" have depicted as productive of cultural biases around [gender](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gender) and [sexuality](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sexuality) in particular. This position has since been reinforced by many non\-postmodern academics, such as Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá, the authors of [*Sex at Dawn*](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sex_at_Dawn). Unfortunately, many young and/or impressionable students misunderstand postmodernism's more legitimate criticisms of the sciences, which often unwittingly lend themselves to dilettantism, [straw man](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man) arguments, and outright fallacious understandings of scientific terminology. Postmodernism's inclination towards elliptical statement and its reluctance to explicitly define its terminology no doubt reinforces this trend, which could otherwise be easily avoided.

[Multiculturalist](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Multiculturalism) trends in postmodernism have enabled various kinds of [woo](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Multiculturalism#Multicultural_woo) associated with indigenous and minority groups. This includes [pseudohistory](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pseudohistory) and [pseudoarchaeology](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pseudoarchaeology) such as [Afrocentrism](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Afrocentrism). [New Age](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/New_Age) guff is sometimes imported into these ideas as in [Native American woo](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Native_American_woo). There is a danger in many postmodernists' willingness to encourage any challenge to mainstream thought — not on the strength of argument or [evidence](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence), but merely out of an over\-enthusiasm for *any* sort of counterculture.Too early to tell. Just because there was no immediate victory does not mean this was a waste of time. My hope is that people see this and find that Chris was not unreasonable. We must remember that there are a significant number of people who are not decided, the answer to them is reasonable conversations, not calling them names.I agree. If we are to win the midterms I don't think we should play the same game we played for the Presidential elections. There are a lot of people who can be persuaded if we focus on the actual indictments. I have to wonder how much of a threat people like Jesse Lee Peterson really are in the long run. 

Sure he's a demagogue, but isn't he just preaching to the choir? Seriously, why would you ever listen to someone like JLP unless you already agree with everything he has to say and just want him to pontificate?

People like Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and the rest of the so-called "intellectual dark web" are way more dangerous in that regard.*

*Even though he's often perceived as being part of that clique, I'm actually inclined to cut Sam Harris some slack. I certainly don't agree with all his views, but at the same time I also don't see him as just another right-wing pseudo-philosopher demagogue, and it would be unfair to lump him in with the likes of Peterson and the rest.Opinions like this worry me for the midterms. Keep treating people who voted Trump as non\-humans that has worked out so well for us. 

I know plenty of people who voted Republican who are decent human beings, I don't think the way to bring them back into the fold is through ridicule. It simply does not work, didn't work will not work. Hehe. u/J0hn_Rawls is a silly silly man. This post further proves it. Never have I been more proud to be called an invader. I hope you get honored too!So this is on area we’re i vehemently disagree with David and this poster. From my perspective IDW is the same as the right using SJW. It’s a “intellectual” short hand to dismiss people they disagree with without having to actually debate their frameworks and claims. I find it often to be a straw man by combining different people into one amalgam and arguing against that. It’s also often a fallacy of arguing to a stone. It’s sad you may not agree, you may find them offensive, and racist. I am going to tell you THAT DOESNT make them wrong. Peterson is continuing a age old debate about morality that has existed in philosophy for centuries. You may not like it and his conclusions but that doesn’t make him an anti-intellectual. You may not like Sam Harris conclusions but not liking them doesn’t make them untrue. It may make you feel better to dismiss them but in the end it makes you no better then Shapiro and Rubin who do the same thing against the “SJWs”. All your doing is “owning” the IDW. David picked this fight and honestly I think he’s on the wrong side of it. It was better when he would refer to his refutation videos. He has taken a lazy short hand and it’s showing in this forum. You want to beat these “IDWs” then stop dismissing them do the research. Present a real argument and stop jerking your self off because you feel morally superior. You want to defeat Peterson go study moral Philosophy. Want to defeate Harris find his research and the holes in it. If at the end of that they refuse then bust out the wahatever-it’s.I m not hurt about it 😛"I also would like to submit this video as merit for me to join [u/j0hn\_rawls](https://www.reddit.com/u/j0hn_rawls) list of dirty invaders."

Haha, no worries SV. You're in that list in my heart and as long as you believe you're in that list in yours, you are in that list  \&lt;3. I applaud the use of Derrida. You about wrote the defense I would. I might have gone more into moral relativism and meta ethics. I would also have added a theoretical physics point of maximum magnification/resolution. Even in science they are not sure if we know. You guys gotta step up your invading skills.

I kind of feel honored to be honest. TIL I am an invader. I am looking through my posts here at /r/thedavidpakmanshow I don't think I've mentioned anything IDW related. I guess you could count my post of Joe Rogan arguing with Candance Owens about climate change. That seemed well received.

It is almost as if people who like the IDW are not some sort of monolith and have differing opinions about different things. Who knew?

Still who am I to argue, Thank you /u/j0hn_rawls for always keeping me in your thoughts.  You honor me sir. You're trying too hard. Just gotta be loosey goosey with it.  I'll divulge my secret invading skills. First never mention IDW stuff on your post, gotta be sneaky about it. Second occasionally give /u/j0hn_rawls the dirty eye but quickly ignore him if he comes sniffing around. Go to other subreddits and discuss things unrelated to David Pakman.  Next thing you know Bam! You've invaded the shit out of this sub, congratulations. One of us, one of us. Do you really think Trump's method is the best way to go about this? I don't but I am open to hear what you have to say.I just don't share your negative view of people in general.

I think yes a lot of people do hold strongly to a lot of irrational beliefs. And don't think for a second  you're immune to this. This does not mean that it is completely hopeless.

I think for the most part if you have a civil conversation with someone two things can happen. You get the chance to hear a different opinion and a different of view you might not have considered before, and if you're case is strong perhaps you can bring up some evidence that might persuade people to your cause.

I've had plenty of success turning people away from religion, climate change denial, ant\-vax ideas. By treating them like human beings, and engaging in conversation.

When is the last time you changed your view because someone called you a special snowflake? How many times have you changed your view when reasonable people presented compelling evidence? I'd wager the latter has worked more times!

Edit:

For example, Trump pitched that he was going to help the "average american" and "drain the swamp" which turned out to be total bull shit. Instead of saying, "see you fucking idiot you were wrong." 

I would try to focus on how his policies will have huge detrimental effects on the average american, for example the way he tariffed our allies will make w/e Tax cuts he claims to benefit us (true or not), a non issue as we will be paying more for literally everything else.  

Not sure what any of this has to do with Jordan Peterson, or Why I am a troll though.&gt;I don't want to see the world dominated economically and perhaps militarily by an authoritarian power like China.

We are in agreement there.

I just think that Trump is doing more harm than good here. Do you have anything specific that might change my mind? International relations and politics is not my strength so I hold my views lightly, as I am likely to be wrong. Ridicule has its place too don’t get me wrong. Also my wager was not that getting ridiculed never changed your mind, but that evidence did it more frequently. 

You brought up some good points though. 

As for the facts not always working, I think that goes without saying. Still my point is to treat people as individuals and not assume because they don’t agree with your worldview that they’re automatically irrational and stupid. I know some people are unreachable, some just haven’t been exposed to good arguments. 

One of the privileges I’ve had by living with different cultures is that it helps me see the human. I don’t think everyone is going to be right, I’m not a postmodernist, but people have different intuitions and can arrive to different conclusions without malice. I don’t always remember and I have a terrible temper, but it’s something to keep in mind.

I was under the impression that Trump has been putting more tariffs on our allies than on China. It’s the DC Delegate RaceThey're painful. But so are all the spam I get from Steemit...I hear you, I have to take frequent breaks ignoring w/e crazy thing trump is up to, I don’t know how u/davidpakman stays sane considering that’s his full time job. I start to lose my shit after a while.I offered a constructive critique of postmodernism. Citing sources not from the IDW, but 2 statisticians and 2 physicists. u/j0hn_rawls lost his shit and here we are.Keep drinking coffee and producing the hell out of the show, my man!daaaaaamn ddude. wtf.Calling something bullshit is not science lolI agree something needs to change. I often skip the Friday show because of it. They are just not that good. The variable reward is so low to make it not worthwhile having a good call once a quarter is not a worth the time investment. I would like it to work, really I would. This is my Onpoint replacement show. They need screening or better editing. Most of the calls are like Thursdays Marx, Stalin, etc voicemail. Lacking a point, understanding or and argument I think the rambling adds charm to it. That’s why I enjoy the segments and TDPS in general. There’s just something about the convos and some of informal flow of the show that I love. As as case it has a huge U-spec or O-spec issue 😆. Sorry policy debate joke this was literally a case run under the resolution in my senior year of debate. 

Being serious I think as and idea it has merit. As to how to implement it and in practice it suffers from the major flaw of the UN. Competitive national agendas. Meaning some nations have no interest in certain peacekeeping missions or in actively preventing them.David, you definitely seem like the guy that never takes responsibility for your actions. Always right and never wrong. Yes the do not vote on the floor. But they do vote in committee.Very informative video !!Yep its was Emerdata which is basically 99.9% Cambridge Analytica only a different name. The company practically has all the same top people from Cambridge Analytica running it and they are also directly tied to a company called Blackwater that has direct ties to Betsy Devos. No its not lol. 

&gt; This thing is bullshit. Earth already has a mechanism of doing this, it's called photosynthesis. No one does it better.    
&gt;  
&gt;All these claims ignore one thing: the energy needs for conversion will be much greater than the energy that was produced by burning the fuels. And that energy has to come from the sun, otherwise... it's bullshit. However... if they are capable of absorbing the sun's energy with such efficiency, we are much better off just using that technology to harvest sun's energy, rather than wasting it on pulling CO2 from the atmosphere. So it is bullshit.  
&gt;  
&gt;My conclusion: it is bullshit.

Where is the Science in this? 

Also just because you think it is bullshit, which is an argument from incredulity thus invalid, does not mean this is not already happening:

Between multiple sources, articles and one uneducated random guy saying "this is bullshit bro. check out my science, see its bullshit"  I think I know who I am going with.Not just your show, all the phone callers are tinny and difficult to hear unlike the people on the shows that are have good mics and are used to talking on the radio. It’s just me most likely but I don’t like any phone calls into any news shows. There is more than enough news to cover without people opinions..K dude. That's quite enough, the guy might legit be on the spectrum. Just put him on block like I did and let him be. I am sure he has his reasons to be the way he is. Stopped being funny a while back. Not New Zealand.

Australia yes but consistent use of the word cunt does not happen in NZ.They all had questions that actually seemed interesting and delivered clearly!These are just slurs not arguments, where did you learn to communicate ideas? Honestly, don't watch. I'm as desensitized as they come, but the guy who shot the old man on Facebook Live was waaaaay too much for me.You are 100% right he’s  not Caligula he’s Commodus. Not that, that’s any better. He just did a podcast with Rogan, although they are pretty buddy buddy with each other Is this before the northern wall?Then we are headed for autocracy.trump in a highchair:

https://goo.gl/images/r457fTThis is a great and well thought out critique of San Harris and is often my issue with him. I phrase it more in faulty methodology and that his conclusions are often based of self effacing fallacies. To be fair no person is perfect Nietzsche is ardently sexist. I think the issue he exemplifies is and issue on both sides. Denying things because you don’t like them or because it proves you wrong is bad. interesting..

pls share details of their agreement...ie. sharing video link (if possible) or in your own words.If you have time listen to both of their podcasts from
yesterday. 

Basically they both agreed on the the things I stated in the post. The tariffs are bad, and that nothing good will come from the North Korean summit. Sounds great. Cept trump is elected and I fear a president trump for the next 70 years if we don’t do something.An article which interviews small ISP provider and clears the myth propagated by Ajit Pai.

in Summary:
 the cost of net neutrality regulation is just 800$ per year. Some how the right-wing nut jobs zoom on this and make it sound like a big regulation f..cking cost :(It is mostly a critique of ideologies, you can take it as a critique of Marxist ideas, or more importantly a critique of people who think they have the perfect solution if only we were to all listen.

I guess a way to rephrase that, compare what works with what doesn't in actuality, not in the dreams of idealists. Social utopians are incredibly dangerous, we saw it from the far right and the far left in the 20th century. For some reason authoritarians seem to be rising again on the West. Good points. But need some clarification/details...

1) I agree
2) what assumptions of western civilization? how is conservative thought different from liberal thought here?
3) I agree. i would assume liberals are not very different here
4) how about comparing with political systems in nordic countries? i see most conservatives not wanting to talk about social democratic systems there.Well I am not claiming that these things that I find admirable from conservatives are only found to be in agreement in conservatives, probably why I find them admirable.

4. I think that's a good example.  However, My political knowledge is very low and I am not confident I understand the issues. For example, healthcare, To me the Scandanavian method seems to be working. 

I don't know the arguments against it being used here (U.S),  at least I haven't read any that particularly seemed compelling.  

It seems to me, that certain things the market is simply not going to work for. To me healthcare is one of those things, and I am only thinking about it logically, If I am perfectly honest about this I am woefully uninformed when it comes to Healthcare. So I could be saying incredibly stupid things right now. 

If I could say 1 positive thing about Trump is that he's made people (like me) all of the sudden start paying attention to these kind of things. 

It's like the joke that John Mulaney makes about the horse in the Hospital. That's how I feel. 

[https://vimeo.com/267873811](https://vimeo.com/267873811)Title could be: "Leader of the free world lectures Mr. Trump".

As for the trumpists spinning this to Trump's favor. It does not matter because people who do that are so rigid in their thinking that almost nothing changes their opinion.  This picture is for people in the middle."They get to point at it and say "look, the whole world is against us, the whole world doesn't want us to succeed" "

They would have to explain why it was not so under Obama or Bush.

Also, getting truth out is far more important than political calculations, even if truth might hurt in the short term ( not saying this picture helps trump, but even if it did help, it is secondary ). May be dishonest arguments, meant to reduce use of that picture. May be rare opinions.

Anyway, answer to that could be:

Trump does not look like a leader. Merkel looks more like leader of the free world than ever. ( I wonder if there is a picture where Obama looked so much like that? )

If Trump is standing firm to anything in that picture ( which is not clear ), he is standing firm to his stupidity and ignorance.Sadly he is not wrong. The evidence at this point is overwhelming. I don't think anyone is against education. Just against indoctrination. The PragerU video has got 700K views. :(

**I think we need a counter\-argument video to separate myth and truth.**

\[edit\] I meant the myth and truth in Jordan's arguments that \`universities are becoming dangerous for kids\`. I did not mean 'truth' from post\-modernism philosophywhat is \`really\` the danger that the kids are being taught (i.e. truth)

and 

what is not really danger but perceived as danger from Peterson (i.e. propaganda or myth)Thanks for sharing details. Will take a look.You’re the worst kind of bigot. The type that pretends to be on my side, cuz poo widdle immigrant, virtue signaling weak men make me want to vomit. I feel that the effect from this will be minimal. However, a psychic said that Republicans will stay in power until 2024 or at least 2028 due the roll purging, gerrymandering, and Russia meddling. I felt that Dems will regain the house but not the Senate with a majority of four to five seats,I think this could lead to more rigging to keep the GOP in power, but there will a silver lining. The ballots will also reflect the ideas of people disliking GOP. There will be a rise in election registration drives by Democrats and progressives.Then Facebook is out.Hi fsirddd
a)
I am not really right-wing troll :). Sad..you perceive me as one :(

b)
I did not grow up or study in USA (but live here)
It's really tough for me to add left-wing critique of Jordan Peterson...without knowing that really happens in those colleges/universities. 

c)
I believe that we should have counter-arguments for myths propagated by right. That's kinda of the reason I post right-wing arguments/talking-points  in reddit so that I can get a feedback from progressive folks and i can respond properly to right-wing arguments. This is the honest reason for my posts.

d)
POTUS has done RACIST things against african-americans.
But he is also supported by some african-americans.

Based on what-i-know-now, on scale of 1to5, i would put him as Racist-Scale-2 ( Educate/convince me with more evidence. I am researching this myself). I think he does NOT condemn racist things if its advantageous to him. I am not sure if that's classified as Racist. Let me know

d) I have watched enough dailyshow-with-jon-stewart to NOT like the POTUS at all. 

e) https://www.reddit.com/user/reditwander/submitted (My posts on Net Neutrality and fact-check on trade-deficit WERE made before I was called a troll. Hope that helps to show that  I am NOT propagating any ring-wing propaganda there. Will be glad if it happens sooner.Not defending conservatism at all.  The question was, what do you find positive/admirable about conservatives.

These are just my opinion about things that I admire about conservatives. It could have created a more just world or sowed the seeds for a 2nd civil war. This is one of the saddest points in American history. Personally i think it would have created a lot of short term issues for long term gains. Africans would have been more economically secure creating a larger power base which would have set the up better in the future. At the same time seizing land from people in power has long term resentment issues. Look at South Africa and the surrounding nations. There is a large and angry Afrikaans population which could explode into violence in the next couple of decades. History is dirty and complicated and there are few if any heroes. There is always those what ifs.The trumps? Crooks? Who would have thunk it?Hi,

I edited the main post with commentary from professor Haidt. He was liberal before and he is more of center-left now.

I dont know if you consider this commentary as valid left-wing critique...but i thought Haidt provides a better explanation of the problem. So I have posted his video and his academy link in the main post.Agree. It seems like PragerU and Jordan Peterson is exaggerating it with click-bait video title !!

Joanathan Haidt - i think is liberal-center. And I dont think he is a propaganda guy. So his research/analysis/views in heterodoxacademy can be trusted. I hope it does not end up in the following scenario

- NK keep his nukes....but allows USA to establish businesses and do real-estate dealing in NK. North koreans are happy as well

- USA get word-of-mouth guarantee that USA wont be attacked by NK. Everyone (esp GOP trumpists) assume that life is peace and keep supporting POTUS even though there is no effective denuclearization (but just rhetoric and plans of denuclearization)

- Russia and China builds up their military near Korean border and get Japan/S.Korea under their control. Maybe, but if we had seized land from plantation holders they would have more heavily funded terror organizations which would have lead to a Northern Ireland like civil war. So far this 2nd civil war is relative bloodless and lack orginized conflict i agree on the BULLSHIT aspect.

POTUS does not care about truth or reality.

He just bullshits whatever he wants to 

\- in twitter : he does that to fireup his crowd

\- in media-conferences : he does that to irritate the press/liberals/democrats OR he does that to deviate the media from talking about relevant-stuff

Basically, he does not give a damn about truth or press or media. he just rolls on :("...would cost far more lives than a non-nuclear second Korean War..."

Yes, that seems likely, but all I m saying that it could be in different order, that there is a possibility of korean war 2 being worse than ww3, that low bound for ww3 is lower than high bound for kw2. If they last same time. These are extremely inaccurate to estimate.

If you are with someone and you feel the need to do this behind their back then either A. They are a shitty person or B. You are a shitty person. This is not ok.Thanks Kyle for doing this...point by point. Very helpful for folks like me ( i requested similar rebuttal for his video in another thread. Glad to see it)11) Equality of opportunity VS equality of outcome 

 At a high level, the right-wing is muddying the waters here. Here is my understanding of the left's view point of equality using an example: Equal opportunity for interviews is good. But if there is **bias** in selecting/hiring candidates and if there is **bias** in giving raises. It will result to **unfair inequality**. Rubin is and always has been a hack. He is the example of most common conservatives as in they have no idea what they are actually talking about. If Joe Rogan, Joe freaking smokes enough pot to kill a horse Rogan, can best you in a political argument you need to go home and evaluate your life. I hate Rubin and I have no respect for himWell...this is "implicit"RUSSIAN COLLUSION 

Here is my wild guess on what might happen

* NK keep his nukes....but allows USA to establish businesses and do real-estate dealing in NK. North koreans are happy and POTUS organization is more wealthy
* USA get word-of-mouth guarantee from NK...that \`USA wont be attacked by NK\`.  Everyone (esp GOP trumpists) assume that life is peace and keep  supporting POTUS even though there is no effective denuclearization (but  just rhetoric and plans of denuclearization)
* Russia and China builds up their military near Korean border and work with Japan/S.Korea to keep them out of USA control. a) On the govt regulation stuff....he got schooled on reality/practicality. Sharp answers from Joe Rogan.

Nice comment from youtuber - Richard Hernandez  
 " Rubin is a naive guy.   He should stick to his specialty, being outraged about the outraged." :))

b) But on Jewish-artist's freedom NOT TO PAINT a NAZI flag/symbol - he does have a point !!Completely agree.

The right-wing media nuts are crying FOUL against persoanl-political bias in FBI (even though they tried to limit their bias at their work)......but they seem to be OK with racial bias shown by border security agents and police agents..even if their bias impact their job-decisions. I've always found it bizarre that people defend Mao, Stalin and now Chavez. 

I don't agree with Peterson in so much but he is so clearly right in this case, I hope that people listen and take action. 

He has enough of a following that perhaps  it will be enough to reverse these incredibly dangerous, historically inaccurate, and just plain stupid ideas.Sorry for straw manning you then. Been seeing a lot of legit communist apologist lately I just made assumptions. 

It is really weird that Stalin and Mao do not get the same level of hatred that Hitler does. Should be at least doubly so in my book.Can you please clarify ur point with an example.  I am little lost. thanksLast week tonight has somewhat critical view of Chavez/Madura.

And a youtuber provided more context on Venezuela

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_fV-C1Ag5sI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fV-C1Ag5sI)

It seems like each side can always look at only-the-bad-things-on-the-other-side. Tribalism !!More context on Venezuelahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_fV-C1Ag5sI

If you read the youtube comments..

It seems like each side can always look at only-the-bad-things-on-the-other-side.  It's not easy to pick one side vs other.

I think Kyle is trying to be fair/neutral in his assessment (like the youtuber)### A VIEW FROM THE ACADEMY: HOW A LACK OF VIEWPOINT DIVERSITY HARMS HIGHER EDUCATION

&gt;***Heather Heying, Lucía Martínez Valdivia, Richard A. Shweder, Nadine Strossen, Scott Jaschik***

**Media accounts of speaker disinvitations, classroom protests, and the proverbial eggshells scattered around campus may seem strange or unbelievable to those who have been away from campus for the last few years. Panelists – all professors – share their personal experiences and professional insights to illustrate some of the challenges academics face in both their teaching and scholarship.**

### BIG QUESTIONS AND HETERODOX ANSWERS

&gt;***Alice Dreger, Shadi Hamid, Angus Johnston, John McWhorter, Jason Stanley, Kmele Foster***

**This panel, comprised of people with a range of viewpoints, identifies key tensions and unanswered questions vis-à-vis viewpoint diversity, open inquiry, and constructive disagreement in the academy and beyond. Is there really a free speech crisis on campus, and, if so, who’s to blame? At what point do additional viewpoints no longer add value to learning and discovery? Who gets to decide? Does the effort to bring more voices to campus undermine another robust value: inclusion? What is the core purpose of higher education today? And how does all of this relate to our increasingly polarized political discourse and affect our country’s future?**

### A CONVERSATION WITH ROBERT ZIMMER

&gt;***Robert J. Zimmer, Bari Weiss***

**In addition to recognizing individuals with HxA Open Mind Awards, Heterodox Academy also sought to recognize the college or university that has done the most to advance or sustain viewpoint diversity either on its own campus or nationally. We are delighted to welcome to the stage Robert Zimmer, President of the University of Chicago, recipient of the inaugural HxA Open Mind Award for Institutional Excellence. As a vocal advocate for open inquiry in the academy, President Zimmer provides an example of the influence of principled leadership. He discusses lessons he has learned and offers advice on how to improve campus culture and lead an institution in a time of rising political polarization.**

### OPPORTUNITIES ON CAMPUS: THE POWER OF LEADERS AND ADMINISTRATORS

&gt;***Michael Poliakoff, Michael Roth, Peter Uvin, Mark G. Yudof, Deb Mashek***

**Administrators play a key role in cultivating campus and classroom culture. In this panel, we highlight the efforts and insights of administrators who have taken a lead in shaping policy and practice in support of greater viewpoint diversity and open inquiry within their local contexts.**

### OPPORTUNITIES IN THE CLASSROOM: WHAT PROFESSORS CAN DO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE

&gt;***Robert P. George, Allison Stanger, Jonathan Zimmerman, Kmele Foster***

**As the locus of academic learning, the classroom is the most critical space in which varied viewpoints must be welcomed and engaged. All students must feel included. Yet with the rise of “call out culture,” students now often report that they are “walking on eggshells” and afraid to contribute their ideas to discussion or even to ask questions. What can individual professors do to help students develop fluency with a range of ideas and be able to synthesize those ideas in service of critical questions and pressing problems? This panel highlights the classroom practices of professors who have found ways to navigate the current climate and foster dynamic classroom discussions.**

### OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND CAMPUS: POLITICS, POLICY, AND PHILANTHROPY

&gt;***Wendy Kaminer, Suzanne Nossel, Robert L. Shibley, Scott Jaschik***

**The academy is a historically admired institution embedded within a broader social, political, cultural, and economic context. This context is changing rapidly as America’s culture wars intensify and various players strive to change, regulate, save, or harm universities. The speakers in this session will consider the pressures coming from legislatures, courts, political activists, journalists, and philanthropists. How might we shape, work with, or resist such forces to reach the day when vibrant universities inspire broad public support and admiration?**

### OPPORTUNITIES IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT: EDUCATING TOMORROW’S COLLEGE STUDENTS

&gt;***George Khalaf, Lenore Skenazy, Peter Gray, Tamara Mann Tweel***

**Tomorrow’s college students are today’s children and adolescents. Their levels of anxiety, depression, self-injury, and suicide are much higher today than they were just eight years ago. What is going on, and how can parents and educators reverse this awful trend? How can universities work with high schools to better prepare students to thrive in college and grow from exposure to diverse viewpoints and ideas? The panelists offer concrete recommendations for parents and teachers, as well as for college administrators who want to understand, help, and teach iGen, the generation after the Millennials.**

### CLOSING DISCUSSION: TOWARDS A MORE HETERODOX ACADEMY

&gt;***Jonathan Haidt, Deb Mashek***

**Heterodox Academy seeks to improve the quality of research and teaching in universities by increasing viewpoint diversity, mutual understanding, and constructive disagreement. This session highlights the organization’s key efforts to date and previews its next steps toward nurturing a more vibrant academy.**Lmao, you’re pathetic, dude. Learn some logic and get a fucking life.  I love David, but he’s falling into the identity trap when speaking about Isreal and seeing anti-semitism at every turn. He also falls into the typical Latin American upper middle and wealthy class that can only see Chavez as a brutal authoritarian without recognizing the context of his rise, his social programs, and the political war that took place between the socialist-military union of the chazistas against the white-Spaniard capitalist compradors who ruled Venezuela since colonization.

These are two biases that are very prevalent among white-upper middle class people of Jewish and LAC descent. We all fall into this trap sometimes, though, so it’s not any harsh indictment. Sams gone off the deep end. I’ve stopped supporting his show; looks like Sam has a real problem dealing with criticism and is overreaching insanely. The problem is his massive ego; (ironic as he criticises Trump for it), everybody critical is dishonest; that’s why he sympathises with the right wing now (center right) as they have not criticised him.Sams gone off the deep end.

Recently he also claimed that the right is much more honest than the left now because basically the right has not criticised him. Latin America and the Caribbean. I lived there and have family connections to the region. There is a stark difference between the general attitudes of those who perceive themselves as white and others. It’s a much more blunt racialism in the region, brought to a crest by the political process of “whitening” in the 20th century, where political leaders actively sought to encourage European immigration and suppress native and African-born culture. The 21st century “Bolivarians” was a reaction against that, like the Cuban revolution 40 years earlier. **a) Why would Roger Stone reveal this info to Washington Post....voluntarily?**

i think they want to build a case for FBI illegally trying to bait their campaign.

b) Why is GreenBerg not saying what "dirt" he had on clinton? (atleast to washington post)

c) FBI is not commenting on the story.

**Something  is fishy. This may potentially discredit FBI investigation...if they  did try to bait Roger Stone...long before wikileaks.**Well at least they aren’t famous for stupid custom majors and copious pot smoking anymore. Not that this is much better marketing wise. It isn’t just Evergreen it’s also WWU (western Washington university). I have friends who adjunct their and they have great stories. The on about students claim faculty facilities for equality is my favorite.Good point !! Sow enough doubts in people minds to win elections...(the only good takeway is some folks are worried up there)I think -this is f..cking gop smartness !!

I dont think there is an **explicit policy to separate children**

Here is how the MADMEN/MADWOMEN are justifying themselves..

\- Previously illegal immigrants were not prosecuted immediately...i think previous admins released them on bail and asked them to attend court later. Now the Sessions Admin is forcing IMMEDIATE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. So adults need to go to jails until the court has a hearing/trial.  Since kids cannot be in jail...they need to be separated.-

It's all implicit. A very cunning way to market-themselves as tough-on-border-security and claiming "child-separation" as unintended consequences. The christian belt are always ok with unintended consequences of the gop :(

POTUS-admin HATES lawyer working as president. But they LOVE lawyers who can bend the law to give them benefit-of-doubt in all their unethical context. ( I hate the so-called CHRISTIANS who support them in all this. Tribalism beats the spirit of religion :()So the 1967 Outter space treaty pretty much prevents this. China and Russia would evict him. Ownership of property in space is internationally regulated I didn't know Josephine was in the Crowd until I saw this video Still. I love her videos.Stay strong brother I did my time at the big brown for seven years.Link to the article https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44527672It’s a great college job. If you make driver not a bad career.I don’t care for these family separating shenanigans, you can quote me on that.

It ain’t right.Not understanding something doesn’t make it meaningless. There’s things that he says that I disagree with strongly, but none of it is meaningless. You don’t get the ratings he got on rate my professor by being meaningless, there’s a lot he says that people find valuable and meaningful. 

I suppose I understand that every good man in history always drew the hate of others but it’s so bizarre to see it nonetheless. 

There’s some legit evil people and nobody cares, the guy telling people to tell the truth and accept their responsibilities gets called a monster. I don’t buy it, it’s just blind tribalism. He said something about your tribe and bam, he’s the enemy. Honestly, I unsubscribed about 3 months ago, though I still support him on Patreon lol.

I agree, he's much more difficult to listen to. I unsubscribed from TYT for a similar reason. These channels will always have a place in my heart for getting me fired up enough to pay attention to the media and their presence is necessary to insure that mass media is kept on their toes. CNN has had to considerably step up their game since TYT and friends have dominated YouTube.

I think he's shortsighted about some issues, though to be fair I have a handful of downvoted videos of DP Show that I disagree with as well. DP doesn't seem to have the same hysterical streak KK has. The constant advertising of Justice Democrats is kind of annoying as well, though I don't hold that against them.

I unsubscribed because I've already heard what they have to say. I support them because what they say is mostly important. I don't feel bad because we're all adults.
Dems are terrible at marketing. To counter your argument. This law is solely a  Trump Administration ruling. Trump personally thinks most of the Immigrants are good actors and or smugglers abusing our Refugee and Asylum status. 

The families coming to America legally and illegally aren't given much of choice. The high gang activities or lack of jobs opportunity are prime factors. However, Trump makes things even harder for people. Rolling back on Obama frameworks that did work. 

Coulter is a god damn sociopath. I don't know who is more idiotic, Sam Seder or Dave Rubin. They both are strong contenders. Nope nope nope. David had a great guest on who addressed this bull shit go listen to his interview. This is not science this is the fallacy of correlation a) I watched the Bill Maher program. For some reason...there are not uploading video of george-will interview in youtube. thats why i have to post salon article discussing this. 

b) most of his gop base are idolizing him anyways. But some intellectual republicans ( who dont idolize him)...are going to believe/present this unconstitutional argument and start supporting POTUS's argument to discredit investigation. So we have to be ready with rebuttal points....to **convince those intellectual folks** who are on fence. He isn’t so random guest it was Dr. Eric Turkheimer who is a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia whose 2003 study is widely cited and has been peer reviewed. You can see it here http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x. 

2nd no the scientific community actually disagrees with your video sentiments. The only article I can find of a scholarly nature is the Jensen 1980 article out of the Harvard Review. Which is then followed by a massive list of articles proving him wrong or questioning his methodology. From socio economics to child rearing multiple articles question if race is the cause. The science matters because Harris is full of shit and Vox called him on it. You whole basis is that Vox didn’t do the research and we’re wrong. Except they weren’t they were totally fair to him because he is wrong! Also the Bell Curve is from 1994 and new research is disproving many of it claims. Furthermore most of it cited works are either outdated from the 60s or have known methodology issues. This is weak hack crap. Put up some sources or piss offThat’s probably where you went wrong, you’re confusing social scientists with real scientists. What about POTUS breaking law and cheating/lying to TRUMP University students..?  He settled the case because he BROKE the law and he has money to settle. The bottom line is "HE BROKE THE LAW".  

Would you and his base call him ILLEGAL PRESIDENT? :)**Even asylum seekers are detained and prosecuted...**

YAY-YAYEEEEEEE!!!!!!!Thanks for the link. They get arrested only if they make fraud claims for asylum..right?and what's so goddamned pathetic aboutt this is that reagan tried pulling some similar shit in the 80s called (i'm not kidding) the star wars program and it got shot the fuck down when they realized it could kickstart a new arms race and.... uh... also, fucking LASERSKinda explains...why they are pushing for legalizing DACA and getting latino votes in 2018 election.

  
As long as they maintain house majority....they will drag their legs for 2 more years in power.  
uh-oh guys! UH-the-fuck-OH!!!

jesus christ i hope trump is having a combination of explosive diarrhea and a mental breakdown on the presidential toilet, all while thinking in the back of his head "but these seats arent' gold :( )a) There is a policy called "Alternatives to Detention". You can keep following that for 2 more weeks and put pressure on congress to come up with a law preventing child-separation. 

b) to prevent slave labor...arrest those who EMPLOY THEM illegally at LOW WAGES.  “This child separation policy is connected to the worst abuse of  humanity in our history,” Schmidt wrote. “It is connected by the same  evil that separated families during slavery and dislocated tribes and  broke up Native American families. It is immoral and must be repudiated.  Our country is in trouble. Our politics are badly broken.” 

http://thehill.com/homenews/news/393170-gop-strategist-denounces-party-will-vote-for-democrats&gt; Anyway. As a fun comment. I am sure if Trump asked all patriotic AR15 owners to register for duty in the Space Corps he would have an instant register of people with assault rifles. 

AH! you mean the "well-regulated miliita" that all the 2nd amendment guys forget about. perfect!

[and it can all use the IW physics!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NJ293dfv00)

(note- i've never actually played IW but i hear the space physics were awful)I think he was pressured into it because it would have hurt the right in the mid termsI’d like and actual debate not a pissing match. A real resolution, rules and a vote. Everything else is just shoutingGreat news for discussion on gender equality in politics.&gt; Ideologically, Ardern describes herself as both a social democrat and a progressive.

Very smart politics and campaigning style. He knows how to divide the people against the EDUCATED/WHITE-COLLARED ELITE and get their votes. 

And the SAD part is his vote-bloc think he represents them/their fears and votes for him. He goes to DC and helps the ELITE ( Rich and Educated/WhiteCollared)

I dont think that crowd hates the RICH elite...they just dont like educated/diplomatic/politically-correct/professional elite (esp if the educatedElite tell them what-to-do)Guess someone is unaware about a little something called statistics, and replication studies. 

\^\_\^a) for sure it's stephen miller.

b) (from pat) ..."oh they like it... and many of those people may not know a hispanic person, they may not know a muslim person..."

personal anecdote- i grew up in ~96% white middle class, midwest america- and this is exactly the point. if you don't know anyone affected, or moreso, if it doesn't affect you personally- why does it matter to you? you don't feel the repercussions, you don't feel the consequences, and so you feel emotionally disconnected from it. my mom told me once that seeing a woman in a burqa in public scares her, and i asked- mom? when have you EVER seen a woman in (hometown) in public, or period??? it's a white utopia in my hometown.

it happens to everyone, even myself, a self-admitted filthy male hetero liberal- re: the baker SCOTUS decision- the most thought i put into it was, "awwww, that's bullshit. that sucks, but at least it sounds like it's just a compromise for later actual first amendment issues forthcoming," but it didn't apply to me directly, (i know very few LGBT people), so i shrugged and moved on with my day. perhaps that just illustrates my own apathy. i think it's a big reason why trump reversed his decision on splitting families up- most people have seen relatives, friends, people split up tragically- and so people decided collectively that this is something worth fighting for. if only we all had the same energy for every other issue (which i again, blame myself for apathy).

c) (re: david "do not stop talking about it on social media")- should we not worry about social justic exhaustion, no matter how progressive they are? like how nobody wants to hear the word "SJW" and automatically gets a combination of sighs and facepalms from everyone, left or right.

Yup, As Jordan Peterson pointed out, Conservatives have higher disgust sensitivity. A lot of Hitler's speech was all about disgust, "cleanse, vermin, etc" 

Pakman is right, we need to vote vote vote. This sort of talk is terrifying. Please take it seriously!I'm a simple man. I see Michael Shermer I upvote.lol. Reads the title, makes a comment. 

You're the best kind of person. Orange is the new power suit?
The collapse of the American Empire?
America’s Commodus?Yeah don’t forget Napoleon followed the committee of public safety. I see him more like a Sulla or brothers Gracchi. Historically once norms are broken they don’t heal themselves. Honestly we almost need to impeach Trump to rebuild and strengthen the political norms that should govern this countryIt’s called click bait. It’s a marketing technique as well a rhetorical device to engage you in watching. Your supposed to be outraged as a conservative. It makes you watch the video generating revenue for David and possibly you learn something too. Your post is the point! Your proving why it is effective. It has nothing to with not caring. It about engagement. Either your and idiot troll or and actual idiot. I can’t decide whichWow this is one of those philosophy debates you have after drinking to many beers or smoking lots of weed. Up there with the can god make a burrito so hot even he can’t eat it and the trolley problem. I am neither drunk nor high at the moment. Mr Rawls I will have to come back to you slavery and ethics debate this evening once I have had a few it’s the only way to engage that debate. My view is that I don’t think it should be illegal nor should it be normalized.There are SOME ELITES who they LOVE....because this helps the libertarian/brainy "elites" and their "supporters" in GOP.

[http://blog.dilbert.com/2018/06/19/episode-110-how-the-king-and-queen-are-sacrificing-the-pawns/](http://blog.dilbert.com/2018/06/19/episode-110-how-the-king-and-queen-are-sacrificing-the-pawns/) ( I did not listen to 45 min video. But he is kinda suggesting that PERSUASION talents of the POTUS went bad. POTUS could have framed as this TRAFFICKING vs ProtectiveShelterInCages. )Jesus fucking Christ... It's like the god damn Vatican.They say she openly wept when Trump was announced the winner of the election and that those who know her say she didn't want to be the First Lady.  She's certainly no better a public figure than her husband given their shared lack of speaking skills and distance from the realities of everyday citizens.  She also reportedly has a conservative stance on some things, though it's hard to gauge her real feelings on anything when she speaks out so little and famously stole lines from Michelle Obama in an instance when she needed to speak for an extended period.  But other than the public hand-holding refusals, it's impossible to know how much Donald controls her, what depths he would sink to.  He tried to use Don Jr. in a bizarre hostage/leverage situation with Ivana, until she said, "Fine, I've got the other two kids," then he showed he didn't really care about Jr. and caved on the threat.   
Chances are, I am way overthinking the jacket; chances are he doesn't have the intelligence to invent a publicity stunt like that.  But the tweet "she" put out while she was M.I.A. certainly sounded like him, and there's no doubt he took the jacket as a chance to use her for a narrative.  It could be a Godiva-after-the-fact thing, not a plan concocted but an opportunity snatched.  All you have to do is go to FOX News Youtube video comments to see how many Trumpsters are eating up his whole "It's about the fake news media" thing.As a Peterson and Pakman fan I don't particularly mind it for the following reasons:

* Pakman gets more views. So that's good
* Everytime someone attacks Peterson, Peterson gets more views, so that's good.
* It strokes the ego of the anti-Peterson crowd so overall happiness increases
* It enrages the rabid Peterson fans which tickles me a little
* The rest of us that aren't offended by jealousy get a little laugh, so that's good.

I don't know if it is a long term good strategy for Pakman, that can be debated I suppose. But bottom line: Man's gotta make ends meet, if it means attacking someone I like, who am I to complain?

 I work for a big corporation, who knows what shitty things I am a part of unwittingly. Still I have a family to take care of, so you know, until something better comes along. 

Live and let live imo. Respond to his first post cross apply all the arguments he drops and then run and abuse shell for bringing up new arguments in the 1AR. 😂 All kidding aside I really dislike Gish gallop being applied here because by its nature Gish gallop requires time being limited. Theoretically time is unlimited so he can’t spread or over extend you, which is the point of Gish gallop. This is more moving the goalpost fallacy we’re the burden of proof just keeps shifting. One list is followed by another and another meaning the burden of proof just keeps growing. It’s still argument in bad faith.Not gonna lie thought that was a photo shopped image of David without hair and your were joking Ok in that case only my 2nd and 3rd 4th point stand, we all win. Not sure what the point of  you messaging me is.

We obviously disagree on whether he is a braindead charlatan. Most people who aren't emotional about this realize that Peterson is absolutely an intelligent and insightful man even if they disagree with him.

I am in the I agree with 80&amp;#37; of what he says camp. So you telling me he is a braindead charlatan is only baiting a fight, which I don't think /u/miravus wants to deal with any more of, as I am well aware this topic brings out the worst trolls on both sides. 

In case you're not a troll bait, There's some interesting stuff about Peterson that everyone could benefit from, his personality and maps of meaning lectures were by far the most popular classes at UoT. They were very popular on YouTube long before he made noises about C-16. Did he bang her though?finally, a tiny piece of good news for the year. sheesh.Ted Cruze is a smart dude, but he's also dishonest and conniving. I dont think I would call GOP congress/senate as stupid at all.

Probably George Bush !!  ( but there is a theory that he just acted buffoonish so that Dick can do whatever he wanted and made fool of the country)I think he writes down the name of the caller so that he can refer to caller by name during the conversation. Not necessarily. Nothing is ever that simple.Two words sentencing disparity. We know, both think, know minoritys on average revive longer prison sentences. That’s a fact if that isn’t structural racism I don’t know what isNo not at all. The right does under estimate the lefts willingness to use violence. Here’s the thing I perceive that violence is always and answer. It’s just often not the best one. Non-violence is the silk glove covering the mailed fist. It’s a choice. The right I think has underestimated the left and it willingness to use violence at its own peril. Their is a large faction on the right who dismiss the left because they have a false belief that the left will not use violence. If you think one side won’t fight back it makes it very tempting to use force to suppress them with force. Why do you think antifa is so feared by the right? Why do you think the black panthers were sought out and destroyed? A armed militia who will take the fight to corrupt police! I know it’s often a joke that if every black man bought a gun we would have gun control overnight. It’s a joke because it’s true. If a group has the ability to use violent  force and bE successful you have to treat them as equals. I am sorry if it wasn’t clear. I am not saying the left is violent I am saying the left makes a CHOICE to not use violence and their is a difference. We should always consider all options, all tactics and be prepared to use those most effective. The caller on Friday was not. David pushed on it and I happen to have thought about this. It is/was and option and the right should remember we choose to be civil and peaceful because we still have some faith in the system. Break that faith and we can and will use violence. To think otherwise is a folly of the right. If you want to feel better I think that’s part of what makes the left better then the right. We don’t conduct armed takeovers of federal buildings. I don’t live that far from we’re the Bundys staged that little stunt. It’s funny to compare how that ended versus Occupy was.I listen to the pod cast it was around the 14min mark.Yup I live in WA they are board AF. Pots legal so smuggling of B.C. bud had all but vanished. The catch hunters crossing the borders like this all the time. Every hunting season so Canuck chases a deer into WA or vica versa for a Murican chasing one into to Canada. They also drop down into the cities and interfere with our law enforcement. Seriously they are ass holes and even the local cops want them to fuck off. They got into it with our Sheriff and local PD a few years ago over jurisdictions. They’d arrest locals our federal DA has to step in. It was a mess. Thier Union was also very anti I-502 (our legalization referendum). We do! Trae Crowder and he does! He has a YouTube channel and podcast. He and some friends call themselves liberal rednecks. &gt; If you spend five minutes looking at neonazi forums, you will find more than one account with an avatar of shirtless Edward Norton with a swastika tattoo, from American History X. An explicitly antifascist movie. That fact doesn't matter to them. They like the iconography. The iconography is powerful by itself, when it is stripped completely from the narrative. The desire to seem powerful by association, by copying, is very human. And it spreads. 

well, i can see why they would gravitate towards american history x- they forget the whole norton enlightenment and insight via experience and boil it down to "the good white kid tries to change and gets killed by that fucking gangbanger anyways. THAT's what happens when we give an inch." etc etc, again, totally missing the point. it kind of reminds me of that richard spencer interview where he straight up admits he doesn't want/believe in free speech, i assume for the sake of "the cause." fucking disgusting.

thanks for the suggestion of that lindsay ellis vid- i already love her stuff but it can't hurt to give it a watch again!My job is to understand it \^\_\^. But keep projecting.

Sorry, Social Sciences are deeply unscientific and there's nothing you can say that will change that.

Have a good one. Amani Al-Khatahtbeh says that Islam founded the principles of gender equality now called feminism in a video called "Can you be a Muslim feminist?" Women in Islam are often thought to be oppressed, but is that true? In answering that, Amani accidentally discredits the Quran, the Hadith, and Islam as a whole. Thanks to Rationality Rules for lending a hand! That would be SUICIDE !!The more you follow politics/news in social-media or reddit - its going to be a lot of discomfort/anger at politics. 

It's OK to take break from news. Just listen to 10min news segment...once in morning and once in evening (something like NPR). 

Just involve locally in some social cause or charity work. your mind will be happy and busy..without too much politics.Looks like the internet supporters are expressing their "free-speech"/"free-market" anger by writing negative reviews (most likely reviewing without actually eating)

https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-red-hen-lexington-3

Looks like YELP is the victim of this battle :(. Tons of toxic photos !! [https://www.yelp.com/biz\_photos/the-red-hen-lexington-3?start=360](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-red-hen-lexington-3?start=360). Yelp is temporarily blocking any more reviews !!yeah, i'm a litle unsure about that comment also- assuming he's talking about the latest one, is he saying white supremacists liked it because... nazi robots? or something? or the KKK taking over america? or is he saying leftists liked it solely because they killed nazis?

the video game media covered the politicization of it a little bit, but overall it was a blip in gaming news. AND the reviews were subpar. OP, elaborate plz?what about the argument that he doesn't push back hard enough on those with clearly ridiculous ideologies?

absolutely not trying to bag on the guy, just curious.True, maybe I'm overthinking things. However, its something we should keep an eye on if anything does happen. Fair argument in NY article. thanks for bringing this up.

Looks like someone read their article in AZ and decided to take a moral standard

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pharmacist-denied-miscarriage-drug\_us\_5b2fa267e4b0040e2743f360Little late for that argument :)) He is not POTUS anymore. I thought even DJT "caved" on his birtherism sales pitch ~~concept~~ and denounced it ~~birtherism sales pitch~~...just to get some more votes in the 2016 section.

Looks like he is still selling birtherism  hats/t-shirts in his post-president rallies...because that snake-oil still makes lot of money !! :))FYI...I did not say...he started it. 

He made it a good sales tool to win primaries and make lot of money selling hats !!  He just has remarkable sales (con-man) skills to sell it :). I see...why my words got misinterpreted. I have corrected it !! I dont know exactly who came up with that concept !! But I do know that he did NOT CREATE birtherism...he just exploited it.Would u need the same proof for DJT as well? or u give him benefit of doubt?

anyways..this topc has been hijacked. So with ur reply..we can pause this tanget thread  on birthersim !! Deal?firstly- i believe i said "push back on clearly ridiculous claims" or something like that. i suppose that's subjective though.

and nowhere did i claim he was alt-right. again, just curious, as i've heard a lot of backlash from the left about him lately.W/e makes you feel better. Go with that.Shit like this makes me wonder if maybe the whole "punch a Nazi" might have some merit after all.

Kidding, kidding, not advocating violence but like this man better be out of a job after that one...sigh but probably not. Knowing Fox, he's likely to get promoted for that one. Piece of shit.ah, gotcha. thanks for clarifying."I think you underestimate the sneaky, sir."Huh?  It would be useful to know WHAT the context is, since you say it's when 'female' is "used almost exclusively in a sexual way."  All we see here is a tweet making a very generalized-looking, NON-CONTEXTUAL statement.  
Female (and YES male) are certainly used in contexts of mixed-ages, and when age is unknown, as in news reports, "Witnesses reported that two caucasian females....." Never occurred to me this was racist. Makes sense, so I honestly feel sorry for the guy.509 area code should be used to crazy conservatives. Matt Shea is all I need to sayI really hope you're joking. &gt;  If he is wrong about something politically it probably means the majority believes the same wrong thing.

ah, i hadn't thought about the usefulness of that. hmm, good point.WTF.  I don't need a youtube link to know that SOME men SOMETIMES use the term that way.  You are the one who said, "in this context, it is used in an almost exclusively sexual way."  So I asked in WHAT context, or what "THIS" you were referring to.  As far as I can tell, THIS was a tweet made by someone named Amanda and she gave exactly zero context!  
Exactly how is it "obvious" she is talking about slang, or that what she means is sexualizing-inappropriateness?  And DO NOT try to call us stupid for not reading between the lines.  You are projecting your own meaning onto what she said.  Just own it.  Uh, like when guys talk about going somewhere for all "the ladies" that will be there, e.g. "ladies night."  Yeah, no sexual urges manifesting there.  It's shit like this making it more and more dicey a proposition to call myself a feminist.  If you think making this post will do more good than harm, you are mistaken. 
I was saying it as a tongue in cheek kind of thing because it seemed to me self evident that going around punching people is a retarded idea. Turns out some people do not think so.Bari is greatI'd have to agree that Social Sciences are not exactly science either. I do research in Psychology and I work in analyzing human behavior and violence. I'd say out of the social sciences Psychology is most like a science as it does adhere to research methodology although of course there are issues as we saw with the reproduction crisis. Since then I think Psychology has moved towards more rigorous research methods though there are still some ongoing issues. Particularly in the Social Psychology end of things. Overall I think things are getting better and more scientific in Psychology. This is not the case for the other social "sciences"

The other social sciences however are definitely not adhering to the scientific method, so yeah it makes sense that you'd not call them real scientists.

A really good Podcast on topics like this is Everything Hertz. Highly recommend.I'm sorry I didn't know I was dealing with a Psychic. It seems everyone who disagrees with you is just making stuff up. 


Please enlighten us on how exactly social sciences perform their research that is accord to the scientific method. Some poor uninformed Right wingers have been trying to push Social Sciences as real Science. The great Richard Feynman explains why it is pseudoscience better than anyone else could.

Arm  yourself! You do realize they are moving production from America to the EU because of tariffs. It’s important that you understand that. This “America First” policy is cost the US jobs not saving the. Farmers are going to be hit hard as welllol. We reveal ourselves through our loudest accusations ;)You'd be surprised.What’s funny is the “law” they refer to was actually passed under Bush Jr. written by a Republican out of TX and is nothing more then a definition of what a unaccompanied minor was. There’s another picture of it and the freaking date is on it and the still claim it was Clinton Peterson's great :).  Good man.Well..here is my guess.

They are ones trying to make  arguments against "left" that appeal to the "intellectual" folks in the "right" Damn! Go Anna, she performed the ultimate RKO on Dave Rubin here. To be honest, Anna just confirmed what I head always suspected. Rubin is a dumb, lazy, greedy, slimy, despicable hack.You are right my friend. Jimmy Dore is an absolute cancer to the left &amp; a dimwit. 

Regarding David Pakman, I think that David is not really a fan of the Justice Dems or their approach; I myself have a few criticisms of Justice Dems. Therefore, David has not covered them. I would tell Franz Papen that Hitler was not his ally or friend. Honestly without the alliance between the conservatives and the the NAZI party Hitler would not have risen to power. Short of straight assassination when he was in prison or at the time of the beer hall putsch. I think breaking his alliance with Papen would be your best option.Man that side eye from Trump is fierce it’s almost like he thinks David is and enemy of the state. It has that “I will crush you” look. So unions who provide a service can’t charge for that service? So if you work at a union shop gain all the benefits the union has gained but refuse to pay for them that’s ok? We usually call that theft.Just heard that her main difference against Joe was about abolishing ICE !!  Looks like new administration is using ICE aggressively to target non-violent criminals and its causing this pushbackSaw a tweet couple of days before...from Vox...talking about Kennedy retiring !! Did not expect it to happen so quickly.

Yes..All those Bernie supporters who voted for POTUS or other-candidates or stayed-at-home - Hope they accept GUILT and do some activism to restore SANITY in the courts.

I can see DJT bowing down to clean McConnel's shoes :))Who honestly still cares what TYT has to say. Or Dave Rubin for that matter, but really TYT is terrible.I thought he was able to successfully implement "New Deal" !! Surprised to hear that he FOUGHT with SCOTUS to refine his programs. Thanks for the info.

Looks like Republican presidents can JUSTIFY every "thing" in name of "National Security"...(ie. tariffs) and SCOTUS will allow it. And Democratic/liberal agendas go thru lot more vetting via courts :( `.. I need proof of your consent, sign here.` 

:)) normal humans would need such consent. 

Meanwhile alpha-male morons will keep grabbing them and getting votes :))a) I don't think he is a muslim hater. He does support muslims who fight against fundamental/radical islam.

b) he does make lot of politically incorrect statements about Islam and bad practices in islam nations. He kinda STEREOTYPES almost all muslim majority nations to broad buckets. Here is where I think he needs to be more nuanced.  He DOES take a hard stance against Islam (hardcore Islam) and Christianity (hardcore variety). So even normal/religious muslims/Christians tend to hate him.  THE WORLD IS TRICKY :))

c) Wish he is more nuanced like "David Pakman" is his criticism of  Islamic viewpoints of Reza. :)If your main aim is MONEY and you don't care much about others/equality......*intellectually* it's not hard to convert from "liberal" to "classic liberal" !! Looks like that's what happened to DR.It's kind of a joke.

But if someone is not sure about verbal/visual consent from other side....then the safest option would be to ask for a written consent....to protect oneself from litigation.I am sorry but I call bull shit. I would like to know who they asked 548 “experts” based of the listed careers is not a convincing survey. This is a great example of really poor social science research. The US has a whole host of issues and I would put it towards the bottom of 1st world western nations for the treatment of women. But out of all 193 UN member nations....no not even close.  `A torrent of sexual harassment allegations dethroned Ailes at the  network before his death and while Shine was not accused of sexual  harassment himself, he was implicated in helping to create a culture of` [`widespread harassment`](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/05/01/fox_news_co_president_bill_shine_who_allegedly_enabled_sexual_harassment.html)  `at the network, including covering for network stars like former host  Bill O’Reilly, as well as Ailes. The accusations ultimately cost Shine  his job in May 2017.`  

Hmm..I dont think they are hiring him to cover up sexual harassment environment in white house. They probably need someone to spread FOXy style news in some avenues. But as usual, they IGNORE the potential risks (ie. bad environment for work) of his hiring. 

If anything bad happens, they know how to escape - "  
It's women's individual responsibility to protect herself. If she would have been more conservative/religious, this would not have happened".  Kinda soft victim-blaming !Thought about that as well :)
Looks like we need to get the sign before 2nd drink :)) 

OR

a new app that will take care of this via video-recording of the partner consenting to it :)
I never used to watch REALITY SHOW because it was staged !! Now...Politics has become like Reality show !! atleast the way POTUS operates it. (and media is not smart enough to skip reality-tv theatre in politics)Global warming - She does not have a reasonable thought. She is just buying into talking points from the right. (because she knows how to survive in that camp :) )

But on Social/Racial matters...we cannot dismiss her. Otherwise..she has the sparks/celebrity-style to motivate young voters. We should be vigilant and call her out on bullshit.  ( nostalgia : i thought people will see the stupidity behind POTUS's celebrity style campaign and not vote for him. it turned out to be a dangerous assumption)a) With so much news floating around, we all need cohesive reporting. 

b)  the way he converses with the callers...is like 2-friends-discussing. very informative.

c) he does in-depth coverage on many relevant topics.  This does need lot of research and critical analysis. i guess/think it's kind of the discussion that started happening in high schools and liberal-arts colleges for quite some-time now and has leaked into young liberal folks in media/workforce as well !!

For example:

\- Permit Patty - IMHO it's a stupid behavior from the lady. But I would not label that action as "White privilege" or "Racist". But look this, that's what young liberals label that lady as. 

\- Vice news - segment taking a dig at the movie-critic-world being mostly "white-males"

\- Gender pay gap - Many folks just take the standard talking point (30&amp;#37; less pay) rather than discuss the nuances (as in David Pakman video)  


In summary: Basically using "Identity Politics" angle to FIGHT against all "inequalities" instead of analyzing other possible factors for inequalities. It's going to upset folks on the "right" and the older-generation "left".

On a related note:

Jordan Peterson is the right-wing darling here...as he does tend to go little controversial when he opposes SJWs. 

Jonathan Haidt is fighting this SJW attitude in the universities in a more sensible way.Funny thing is when Obama wanted to wave "white flag" at Russians from 2008-2011 

\- The "RIGHT" never liked it  

\- "Russia" never liked it probably because Obama/USA was not treating them like a superpower.

And NOW

\- The "RIGHT" is OK with good relationship with Russia 

\- "Russia" loves it because DJT treats Putin as superpower !!Bolton knows that MADKING wont listen to him :))i don't even think it's "edginess" driving it like u/philoscult mentioned. sure, a few teens are going edgelord, as most of us do- ever see that nerdy girl in your high school carry around atlas shrugged? same shit.

what i think it is a combination of many things- firstly, things are changing "too fast" for people, particularly the older generation. we've seen this time and time again, hence the term "conservatism" right? very few people like change, even progressives. sure, i like to mix it up with my orders on occasion and try new things but when i order delivery, my toppings typically end up being pepperoni and sausage. it's human nature. only occasionally do i try something new and go "wow, this is better than what i had before, i'm going to switch to this for the time being" (that clear mountain dew "dew shine" being a real world example and yes, i'm still pissed it's no longer made.) plus the old-school american sensibility of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." compare that, for example, to the ideology of the toyota production system and continuous improvement and note how much toyota is killin' it. basically, it's old thought, and you rarely can change someone's dyed-in-the-wool beliefs.

thirdly, and most obviously, i think it's because white people consider whatever rights everyone else gets as de facto them losing their own, when typically they've misunderstood and in reality it's them being forced on a level playing field.

think about it- if you had it good for so long, and everything was fine and dandy, but now all of a sudden people want you to change your behavior in certain ways, can't make fun of gay people, can't call people retards anymore, can't make blacks go to the back of the bus, etc. etc. if you're selfish, you wouldn't want your advantages to change either. fortunately, not all of us are selfish and understand the nuance of the situation.

and FINALLY finally, i think it's because many don't even understand the advantages they have. i guaranteed if they walked a thousand miles in a black guy in the hood of chicago's shoes, they'd realize, "oh shit, i AM getting treated like shit." it's tough to wrap your head around until you've experienced yourself- sometimes impossible.

it's like, you know how parents will always annoyingly say to single people, "you couldn't POSSIBLY understand what it's like to have a child. ugh, it's soooooooo tough." welp, as annoying as that it is, it's true. your'e right, i couldn't possibly fully understand, because i haven't experienced it myself- i can imagine how it would be, but that's not the same.thanks, sam!&gt;  many people think that discussing serious topics such as education or infrastructure is boring, especially if the issue doesn't have a clear villain. Most people want better roads and cheaper gas - the only question is how exactly it should be done.

very true. if they're gainfully employed, if their city doesn't totally blow ass, if gas is cheap; basically if they're living comfortably and whatever social issue doesn't apply to them, they're happy campers. can't really blame them- i often do the same, admittedly. i definitely think about whatever issue less than the ones i find important, and am less likely to "activate" over something unless it legitimately affects me in some way. call it laziness, i suppose. i think we as humans just like to equilibrium, peace, and chill. or maybe that's just me.

for example- the recent retirement of justice kennedy, and the fear of the overturning roe v wade and who knows HOW much conservativism in our supreme courts- roe v wade being overturned bothers me much less than the decades of conservative decisions potentially poisoning the SCOTUS, because i'm not planning on a) having a kid anytime soon or b) aborting one even if i had one.

call it selfishness, i suppose. i read the headline yesterday and was like, "damn, that's shitty." and watched pakman and seder discuss it, and went about my day. perhaps i'm just lazy.&gt; "white privilege"

the word has become toxic like "SJW" has to the left or "check your privilege." once you drop the "white privilege" bomb, guaranteed anyone you've been discussing with has stopped listening to whatever it is you're saying.Good Israel has been far to influential in our politics for far to long. Keeping them happy has put us into precarious policy positions and hinders our response in the region. I am not saying we should abandon them but Israel’s concerns or interest are often not the US’sAgree..lot of energy wasted. you should become/be a lawyer :)

ah, well said. i've always described it as something akin to "leveling the playing field" but this is a better description that avoids the automatic implication of "privilege" and the disdain that others have for that assumption.Is this the "shouting fire in a crowded theatre" hypothetical come to reality?

I think so.Iran nuclear deal. So I obviously took fiat much more narrowly then others. On a side note of Red Alert showed us anything killing Hitler only leads to a Soviet invasion and the rise of Kane and the brotherhood of Nod.THAT'S IT!!! PATCRACKADDICTCONFIRMEDOh man are you a cross-temporal psychoanalyst? Why are you wasting your precious talents on reddit? You could be making a killing on the history channel!Yeah but they don’t break that down. Provide how or what was asked. You know, know some ass hat will bring this up with Shapiro or some other conservative commentator who will rip it to shreds and use it as a battering ram against the left. Bad social science like this hurts the left more then it helps. You are just giving the right ammunition with BS like this. It will be used to discredit stand up, metoo, BLM, the UN, universities, the news media, and the list goes on and on. Sad thing is not much we can do to defend it because it is garbageHe ran a team in theUSFL called the New Jersey Generals. Link everything to that. Trump hates his failures brought up.You asked for and example of how Israel has influenced US policy. I provided it. Just because we don’t do everything that Isreal wants doesn’t mean they don’t have negative influence. You think that Bibis little stunt proceeded our withdrawal? Don’t get me wrong This doesn’t mean that I support our alliances with our Arab allies either, personally the US creates far more issues then it solves by its interference. The creation of Isreal is a perfect example of the road to hell paved with good intentions.Planet of the rapes: You picked the wrong place to pull a "Just gonna drop this here."  How about you grow a pair and state your case for what is significant about this tragic-but-isolated story, and wtf does the parents' Judaism have to do with anything?   Step up or fuck off. Points well taken.  Except I didn't meant to pose GOP die-off as a strategy, just a fact, and just one of several factors suggesting the extinction of the Party's viability in the near future (other factors could and should include applied strategies like the grassroots ones employed by Alex 0-C).  You mention a 10-year timeframe and I say "sounds good to me."  Unions by law have to represent all workers Unions don’t get the option to opt out. If someone is going to provide you a beneficial service and you can choose not to pay for it wouldn’t you? If Comcast has to give you high speed internet and you could either pay them or not would you? You may but many will not. Negotiations cost money. Appealing terminations cost money. Now unions are not going to collect fees for those services which means they have to do the same work with less money. Funny thing is the free loaders are the first to complain when the union doesn’t bring them the win they expect. It’s like people who don’t vote complaining about government policies Right, but if he gets impeached the base would not be blaming these officials who are screaming at Rod Rosenstein, doing whatever they can to stop the investigation; they would blame Rod Rosenstein, the Democrats, the media, anyone but Republicans.  And then a day or two after Pence being sworn in, they'd start adoring him on command.  I'm just saying, this group of GOP Congressmen must have some reason other than base approval of Trump.  So beautifulThe Russian interference is interesting, but trivial. How sad, the Russians are involved in our elections, boohoo! We're involved in everyone's business, the Chinese are involved in many places. World and regional powers are all trying to gain the upper hand on each other. That's normal, so who cares? 

Do you think the Russians got Trump elected? Were the American people tricked by the big powerful Russians into voting Trump? Or did the Democrats run the worst possible campaign with the world's worst candidate against a fucking orange moron? This one's on the Dems, not Russia. 

Also, why do the American people need to care about the game that foriegn governments play against each other? How does American hegemony help me? As far as I can see, it's got us involved in wars all over the world, killed our troops, and wasted our tax dollars that could have been spent on healthcare and tuition. The goals of the United States government are not my goals and what's good for it, isn't good for the American people or the people of the Earth. 

Last thing, it's better to focus on your own country where you have power, than focusing on another where you don't. I'm not Russian, so I can't affect them, but I'm American so I'll focus on our wrongs because I have more say in that arena. I still maintain convincing Papen to not ally with Hitler is viable. The Nazi party was actually fairly weak. Papen thought he could play Hitler but was wrong. If you went back to the early 1930s and could make it so Papen didn’t need Hitler I think eventually Hitler would have faded. The Nazi party would have gone broke. Right...?is this the hill you want to die on?Let’s start by saying SJW is a bad term that is used so you don’t have to argue their actual points. I don’t like it or IDW. To me that to quickly leads to straw manning. As a Cis White Male I share a lot of people on the rights frustrations. The left does have and issue and some of the critiques from the right do have grounds. I will add the reverse is true as well. It really boils down to three things. The first being is a lot of the lefts social justice movements rely on REALLY terrible social science. There is a great example post on this forum a few days ago about how the US is the 10th worst nation in the world for women. We are FAR from perfect but how that study is conducted and it’s results are pretty much BS. The gender wage gap is another example. Even David on his show has pointed this out. Yet many “feminists” quote the 70% number unendingly. When that’s the main face of your movement that’s not good and makes you look irrational and if your lying about that issue then you are obviously lying about them all, or at least that’s the anti-SJW view. Not saying it’s right just saying it is. The second is we are all having invisible framework arguments and we are all using different definitions. Think the gender debate. If you define gender as A. and I say it is B. and we both have good reasons for those definitions and we engage in and argument and never address those underlying underpinnings but rather just go full on gender debate of course we are going to clash, disagree, and think each other are stupid. We are not having the real conversation we are both just assuming that our definitions are right and the reasons for it are obvious. This gets even worse when you talk about things like white privilege. If you define it A and I B then we both assume that the other is using our definition we end up having really terrible arguments. Third is there is a lot of money and power to be made on both sides. The Star Wars SJW thing is a perfect example. You pick a flex point in culture create a YouTube video on that spurs controversy and tribalism there is a lot of money to be made. From Dave Rubin, Shapiro, Akkad and others on the right to Anita Sarkkesian (sp?), Laci Greene, and others all have a vested interest in create outrage with no solutions. It is their business and I always say follow the money. This creates a great feedback loop. It spreads a lot of misinformation, bad logic and terrible arguments. All boiled down into nice sound bites perfect for Facebook and the comments section. When you get into REAL policy and real debate most of these fakes fold and fold quickly. There is another arrow to this bow which is the people with good intentions who parrot the profiteers because they are generally misinformed or flat out lied to. This is where the previous points come into play. The US has major issues and the left 7/10 time in my perspective has the better solution. We just let all the above bull shit get in the way. We try and die on every hill, even those not worth dying on. It paints us as out of touch, elite and ridiculous. We exhaust our selves fighting meaningless battles. There’s a post about how not sleeping with a trans woman is discrimination. Whether you agree or not is that a battle worth fighting? Is it one you are going to win? Or is it going to piss people off who otherwise would support you? Thus we arrive at the conclusion because often Cis white men are the bad guys. When you are the enemy ALL the time, even the stupid fights, it makes it easier to tune out and fight back.You presumption is that other cultures didn’t do those thing. Shaka Zulu was a terrible man and was the Genghis Khan of Africa.  The caste system in India which existed before colonization. China had a serious slave trade and slave system throughout history. The Qin dynasty was actually exporting slaves across the world. The Caribbean triangle trade was just that. A trade, Africans were trading slaves to gain manufactured goods (gunpowder weapons) to further expand their empire. The Aztecs were pretty brutal and shared a lot culturally with Sparta, which was a slave state. Japan and Korea fought multiple brutal wars at no fault of the west. I actually could go on. History is full of just how shitty humanity is. The west (whites) only real sin was that we succeeded were others didn’t. Honestly looking at history I would have put the Middle East or China to be the dominant culture and powers in the world if I had been a betting man. You would think the 100 years war and the 30 years war would have all but crippled Europe. It somehow didn’t. Whites are just guilty of being successful. Honestly atrocious and terrible behavior is the norm not the exception in human history.These events are good for democracy. It hampers the GOP from becoming full-blown fascist. Trump is more of a Berlusconi that Mussolini. People are empowered especially since Ocasio-Cortez won the primaries and will likely win the seat.This is a relief, for an Iowa-raised woman.  I was born in '73 and here's how deep cobalt blue Iowa was, when I was growing up: In high school when we learned about gerrymandering, our teacher gave us a map with all the counties, and our assignment was a contest to see who could gerrymander most favorably Republican; most of us failed miserably because so much of the state was stubbornly Democrat.  Since then, Tea Party-esque Evangelicalism has turned Iowa purple and even red by some measures, so I am SO HAPPY to see abortion waiting periods blocked.  
I think we'll be seeing the re-blueing of Iowa, a state of highly intelligent "fool me once" people.  I remember my Democrat parents voting for Reagan like so many others Dems across the country, and then regretted it, and didn't vote for him the second time.  Now with tariffs already crushing the pork market since April, and soybeans and corn to follow.......well, those are the three main products in Iowa.  I just saw an article in the Guardian saying Iowa is predicted to be the state hit hardest by the trade war.  Oh and I forgot to say: I don't know about the whole state, but the city of Cedar Rapids where I'm from is about the Harley-Davidsonest place in the universe.  I KNOW C.R. is pissed; I just hope they know to blame Trump, not Harley.  This is borderline racist. link to this plz for the laughsHi lots of interesting things to talk about regarding this talk. Would be nice if people engage in discussion. 

Not interested in these arguments:

\-Dave Rubin is an alt right Nazi or any variation of it

\-JP is an alt right Nazi or any variation of it 

=\]

I am particularly interested in the idea that Eric brought up in regards of Intersexuals and how can people on the left can help clean up the radical left/sjw types. 

How do we fix our side of the Aisle? Don't think this sub ever stops posting about Jordan Peterson.

I will say that most of the time is boring silly things, that have no substance. This particular talk I find is filled with important content. Particularly because Eric wants to take the IDW in an unexpected direction to help fight for intersexual rights, help make places like Vox and Salon clean up their act etc... 

There is so much on this talk. Eric also pushes Peterson in a lot of points. Thank you for sharing, I really enjoyed the Peterson/Weinstein conversation. Absolutely fascinating. I posted it here:

Do post your thoughts on the points brought up :)

Fine, I'll take it, but goes to show that it's all about looks and fitting into what mainstream society expects you to look like. White people are suspect, while minorities are now the only lefties that can be taken seriously. Whatever. I'll take it.

She is beautiful though. My heart skips a beat when I see her, and my mind gets so interested when she starts taking about Democratic socialism. Like Bernie, but beautiful. Peterson does not know much about anything to be honest. He might be a certified psychologist but of course he had to transform himself into this right wing Christian apologist who constantly bashes the left whilst praising the right &amp; Trump and making some decidedly idiotic, dumb statements. He’s a snake oil peddler, a dishonest liar, a real arrogant prick. Peterson disgusts me.Usually when I begin typing a persuasive argument for or against something I imagine the finished product will be a couple of short paragraphs but then it tends to grow into a text wall, as critical thinking kicks in and I feel a need to preempt counterarguments likely to arise in anyone reading.  That text wall then intimidates most people, presumably even avid readers because time is precious and the world is a buffet of text we can't all read.  In this case I begin typing fully aware a text wall result, because I have already weighed arguments and counterarguments my whole life, I will likely think of more while writing now....and I'm not even trying to firmly argue for or against anything.  I'm simply offering considerations on Roe v. Wade and asking for your insights. With sincere apology, I ask that you scale the whole wall before you reply.

As stated, I was a senior in high school (just turned 18) when I had my abortion in Iowa.  No I was not a victim of rape, incest or even naivete under the charms of some guy promising to marry me. My partner was not my first, and I had never had sex using a condum or any other prophylactic measure.  I had received such thorough sex education since 5th grade from the wonderful public schools in my city that I can't even cite ignorance for risky sexual behavior, nor could my partners by the way.  All I can cite are the same things a sympathetic adult might, of the myriad terrible choices teenagers make: an immature prefrontal cortex and a total lack of reference (none of my friends had ever faced unwanted pregnancy or STD, or at least I didn't know of it).   

My boyfriend and I literally looked up 'abortion' in the yellow pages of the phone book.  I didn't know what an 'abortion alternatives' agency was, so I booked an appointment with one, and there a male gynecologist confirmed that I was 9 weeks pregnant, and a woman tried to persuade me not to have an abortion, placing a mouse-sized acrylic model of what my fetus currently looked like in my hands.  Only annoyed, I left and continued to search for what I needed until I learned of the Planned Parenthood 30 miles away, and booked an abortion appointment.  Because I was a teen with few resources, the clinic used donation funds to cover most of my expense; my boyfriend and I had only $300 to pay (in installments after the procedure).  What can I say about the day itself?  There were multiple steps including plenty of pre-screening to make sure I wanted to continue. The 7-minute procedure was the worst physical pain I have ever endured (worse than the labor contractions I had before the epidural was inserted, when I had my daughter two decades later).  But emotionally I felt zero pain, in fact I left that clinic so inspired by the people who worked there, I wondered if I might have what it takes to tackle med school and work in a PP myself someday.   Their sincere care was further confirmed some days afterward, when they called me to inform me that they had also tested me for STDs and found that I had chlamydia, said my boyfriend almost surely did as well, and prescribed us both the antibiotics to potentially save our lives.  The 'abortion alternatives' people must not have given a shit about that.

PP also got me started on birth control pills (for free) and from there I continued to grow into a woman who made much wiser choices.  I took sex much more seriously along with everything else, earning a master's degree, getting married, having a much-wanted baby, but yes I now live deep in Conservative territory, albeit Mobile, a considerably more-liberal city within that territory.  But I still see plenty of poverty and institutionalized ignorance, the two most potent ingredients for unwanted pregnancies and STD's.  I have participated in protests for women's rights and try to stay as informed as I can about the issues surrounding women's reproductive rights, including the many realities of raising children in a country with an increasing wealth gap.

Given all this, you would think I'd see the Supreme Court opening a horrible harbinger of gloom.  At first I did, and mostly still do, but questions are beginning to play around in my consciousness, things that somehow never occurred to me before this urgent time when all possible realities are literally possible.  

Who would be more hurt by the overturn of Roe, people affected by unwanted pregnancies as a whole, or the future of the GOP leadership as a whole? 

Consider that with the ruling behind them, Evangelicals would have only marriage equality to stay rabid against.  Maybe I'm being naive here, but I feel that while some Conservatives will always be disgusted by the idea of two men doing it in the butt, the idea that homosexual preference is a choice has permanently lost its footing.  And once enough Conservatives have seen that married homosexuals pose no actual threats to their lives (may even pose a measurable positive effect on economies), it seems unlikely that overturning marriage equality would be enough to keep Evangelicals voting FOR corporate interests, FOR deregulating companies that poison water and air, and AGAINST family unity, even if those families are brown in color.  

Sure, Hannity, Limbaugh and Jones might keep some segments of Evangelicals convinced that Muslims, gun-snatchers and atheist professors are big enough threats to keep voting for GOP candidates.  But how many Evangelicals care deeply enough about ALL those issues, compared to the number who all care about abortion?  For untold millions, abortion is the #1 issue; everything else they either disagree with, tepidly agree with, or maybe fully agree with, but enough to bring them to the polls, if abortion is already banned in their states?  

Consider also the effect that the added unwanted births will have on poverty in those states.  The women and girls who couldn't travel to legal abortion states would be fired from their jobs when they start missing shifts because of their pregnancies or their babies' needs.  And then you'd have not one but two people needing food and lodgings.  The result would mean either the spectacle of more homeless women and children or the need to raise taxes for public assistance to them.

Next consider the impact post-Roe would have on men.  Sure, rich guys like Trump and his buddies could always fly pregnant mistresses to legal states for abortion, but what about all the other guys?  Keep in mind, in 1973, all a man had to say was "Not my kid."  Now, DNA testing takes away that easy denial of responsibility.

Finally, how fortunate might the overturn be in the long run, for those of us who recognize how horrible it will be in the short-run?  Understand, I don't take lightly the prospect of women and girls I see all around me in Alabama facing unwanted pregnancy.  But I can't help but wonder if we as a people would rise to the occasion better than we did pre-Roe.  I can already see myself volunteering to drive women to Pensacola, if Florida remained legal, or at least legal longer than Alabama.  Maybe whole foundations would spring up, working in partnership with Planned Parenthood to assist the 'banned' states' women and girls.  Maybe progressive women and men will make mass exoduses out of states they can no longer tolerate, and those states' economies will suffer.  And after all that, maybe the whole nation will wake up from their FOX News, Tea Party, "lock her up!" hypnosis, turn overwhelmingly 'blue,' the Supreme Court will die/retire/appoint back to a Leftist majority, and the next ___ vs.____ will reassert women's rights to reproductive autonomy, maybe forever.  Yes I realize I'm talking years if not decades, but might it not be worth the hardship if it plays out like that, and we have the issue completely in our rear view mirrors?Thanks metric robot!  LOL.  I think he/she means the fantasy I described in the last sentences of the last paragraph.
I won't deny that it's a fantasy or mental masturbation, but history is full of accomplishments that started out as such.  C H Martinez, you offer the devastating 2016 election as an example of it backfiring and I'll address that, but consider for a moment all those on the religious Right who entertained the mental masturbation of backing a foul-mouthed candidate who was clearly not a real Christian, holding onto the fantasy that even with the chaos he would clearly bring, he would be in a position to appoint at least one Supreme Court Justice....and that's what happened; their future fantasy came true.

As for Jimmy Dore, what can I say, I can't think of any pundit whose views I have more mixed feelings about.  Before the election and all the way up til about a month ago I hated his guts, hated his followers and largely held him and people like him responsible for the Trump election.  I voted for Clinton, not like it matters one lick because Alabama, but I voted for Sanders in the primary and still hope he runs in 2020.  I mention the about-a-month-ago mark as when I stopped hating Dore so utterly, because it was then that I stumbled on the 4-part (pretty amicable and invigorating) "Bernie or Bust" debate between him and Sam Seder, dated May 11, 2016.  I have also seen the Nov. 10, 2017 segment David Pakman did, answering where he stands regarding that debate.  I agree with him 100% on the reasons he generally sides with Seder, including reasons that weren't yet an issue during that debate, like Dore's obsession with dismissing the Russia investigation as a distraction, as well as Dore's continued laser-focused drive to prove how pitiful the Democratic party is.  I will say that many of the things Seder offered in the debate were spot-on and in some cases eerily clairvoyant, like "What makes you think they won't get rid of the filibuster rules?"  But I was also stunned to hear how many Dore predictions have also come true, namely the amount of awareness that the atrocities of a would-be Trump administration would bring about.  One might even point to Alabama as where that awareness made its' undeniable debut, when GOP primary voters chose Moore over Strange, the guy Trump endorsed, and then we as a blood-red state performed the miracle of tossing the GOP completely aside, and elected a Democrat.  Since then, signs of a 2018 and 2020 blue wave abound everywhere you look.  Trump and the GOP stronghold on the governmet are definitely reeking havoc while they can and some of it is irreversible, but what if Dore was actually right about the irreversible harm this administration would do to the viability of the Republican Party?  Even without these horror stories to reflect on in the future, the electorate is getting browner, poorer and the old are dying and being replaced by the young.  I think the 'thousand cuts' scenario has probably come to everyone's mind because we've already seen states do it, to varying degrees of success (for example that's why some states are down to few or only one abortion clinic).  I know the Iowa Supreme Court just soundly struck down (5-2 ruling decision) the 72-hour waiting period law, which is encouraging.  What I want to know is why aren't news entities having more discussions like this one. --They're posing the issue as if a Conservative Justice appointment simply WILL mean an immediate, all-or-nothing abortion legality case.  But you very well could be right; it could be an incremental thing and there should be legal experts discussing that on TV a lot more.  I say "on TV" not because I'M incapable of finding the information for myself, but because it should be an up-front discussion easily accessed by huge audiences in real time. I'm suddenly seeing all kinds of signs that people don't even agree on what the terms 'liberal' and 'progressive' mean, like whether they're basically the same thing or if they're very different (and how they're different). Thanks for your well-reasoned response and ruling.  If Trump saw this he would surely want to appoint YOU to the seat.  If you don't think political campaign contributions help to sway public policy in the direction of those with the money then you're insane. You've put ideology and strategy on equal footing as legalized bribery. Do you even human?What 'they' are you talking about who 'say' want they want to do?  Politicians?  Like when they 'say' they want to bring back jobs, 'say' the deficit is a priority, 'say' they care about the middle class?  Just because a politician says something doesn't mean they really mean it, especially Republicans.  Just look at all the Conservative leaders claiming family values who had affairs or molested kids.  Do you really think they care deeply about abortion?  Hell, a lot of them have probably paid for abortions.  As for whether they would overturn Roe to appease their constituents, well that's what my post is about and you obviously didn't read it.  Do 'we' really need to discuss this?  --No, people who take political talking points at face value are exempt from the conversation.  You are free to go howsci. I'm not sure I understand your points, like whether they pertain to the same thing.  The first one sounds like you mean they (the GOP) wouldn't lose many people (members) once Roe was overturned--is that what you mean?  If so, I basically agree, and certainly they wouldn't suddenly turn liberal.  But that enthusiasm you mention, that can be the difference between turning up at the polls or not.  To that effect, a Conservative leadership could have just as much support as ever, but not when it counts.  Your second point seems to concur that overturning Roe could hurt the economy with its added burden.  I definitely agree with that, but macroeconomics like that is SO easy to tech-talk voters' attention spans away, if they care to listen in the first place.  And just imagine a Leftist figure saying, "Look how much more everyone has to pay in taxes because we stopped abortions!"  --The easy answer from the Right would be "Thanks for pointing that out--lets stop paying for irresponsible sluts to feed their kids" (like they already say about poor people).And then a bunch of Senators went to Russia and didn't press them on the meddling or Crimea.  Okay, then you acknowledge you are talking about mulitple separate entities.  I'm saying that it may not be in the politicians' interest to give the voters of the party what they want, when it's something as huge as banning abortion.  Because once they have that, they'll be satiated and less of them will turn out to vote.  Give a dog a huge steak and it could't care less if you have a handful of treats left to give.  Soy boy David Parman looking like a real Chicano Jew! Hey David, do you even know about America? A real American would be celibating, not sitting in that soy boy chair!He cleans up nice.I've also seen him referred to as the Donald Trump of Mexico.  WTF. The trick is to let autocorrect work its magic.They were not banned from doing their shows, Auckland city council would not let them use their venues.

In other words, NZ left run council does not provide platform to far right political figures.Agreed, it's the right to free speech not the right to have a platform for said speech. (Especially tax-payer funded) [Bill of Rights has the freedom of expression which is essentially the same though.](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM225513.html)

You are sort of right in the fact we have an uncodified constitution (ours is loosely based off of the Treaty of Waitangi and precedent)Completely fair (our uncodified constitution makes it a bit confusing), a lot of Kiwis are far more ignorant of our laws than you so don't worry hahahaNo I can't 😂

Not from lack of trying trust me.The other makes those far right comics where he over labels everything to the point of ridiculousness.

One other thing, speech against race isn't protected by the NZ bill of rights so they very well could be violating hate speech laws (provided they stick to their material)Sorry I might have misread but that man considers their stuff hate speech but NZ law does not.


The only things unprotected by free speech in NZ are race, sexuality and speech that incites violence. You would only ever be charged with the latter.


I've seen far too many people call NZ an authoritarian regime in the past couple days ...No we aren't denying them entry that's the point. We just aren't providing a tax payer funded platform, fairly certain we don't allow Islamic groups to use them either so your point is mootWhat in the fuck. 

Who cares enough about a fictional character to develop their own political ideology fan fiction ?I feel that within the next 24 months there will be one.The only way this cycle stops is when a progressive president comes in. I feel that the GOP is becoming unstable and the Democrat Party will take its place and a third party comes in to fill in the left void.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh0tIUaguqU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh0tIUaguqU)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOAyp_pMC24



Not only does he not say anything coming close to what you said in that video you linked. It's been long known that Vice edited the video as shown in video linked above. Safe to say you're a dishonest person.


So once again, why are you lying?I don’t know where you live. In DC we had 20% voter turnout. Mofos won’t vote, but they will revolt. GTFOH lolExcept he doesn't. Nobody thinks that wearing make up makes someone a hypocrite if they are sexually assaulted...not once does he say anything that resembles that... lol you're pitiful. Seriously, why is this necessary, to lie about someone you don't know to try to make a point that has nothing to do with the article posted. Everything about you is pathetic and weak. 

Much can be said about what Peterson ACTUALLY says...but lying to make him out to be a monster is just the stupidest way to go about this. 
You literally just lost any credibility. We're done. 
I have been seeing the House will get flipped but not the Senate.Your solutions fit my psychic predictions. A mentor of mine said that there will be an emergence of classical GOP that will take down president Trump and choose a normal president. Trump fading into obscurity will lead to his base to turn violent on liberals.

Meanwhile, people will turn to their communities and the local government for solutions. There will be rising progressives that will take over the government. I say by 2022 we will see the emergence of light. By 2024 we see a progressive female president. By 2028 we see a New New Deal.

From what I saw, I used Pokémon to see the future. In early Nov 2022, Greninja returns. The Pokémon will prefer to act like a bodyguard, speaking telepathically and preferring to be a walking Pokémon. He kills several Team Sword grunts after getting his daisho set. In 2023, I see Greninja defeating a gym leader’s dao sabre-and-ratten shield-wielding Charizard. Greninja shouts his moves before using them. In 2024, Greninja encounters Xeroxic and Lysander, dispatching them in a duel will several of the renmant Team Sword grunts. Also I see the Pokémon slaying several grunts in a hot spring. In July 2025, Ash become the league champion with the help of Greninja, while battling the elite champion in a tie. Serena comes back, as she became Kalos Queen. She gets kidnapped by Team Sword, where Ash and his companions rescue Serena and destroy the syndicate.I find Kavanaugh far-right on many issues. People will turn to local governments and their communities for solutions while progressives rise.We see many fail in earlier special elections.Trump is more of a Berlusconi who is a wannabe authoritarian.I live in NYC, what do you expect.Wow I thought I spent a lot of time on Reddit, but those numbers are unbeatable.CRtv, watch your values!Watched that the other day. It's fantastic (and equally disgusting)Don't bother. You're not gonna convince anyone here, people are stuck on their ways and because it is a political sub everything they see is in terms of "Us vs Them." No matter how much proof you provide that Peterson is not who they think he is, they will never see it. Nuanced thought is not welcome, you're either with us or against us. Since they can't mount a single argument from things he has actually said (not hit piece articles) all they can do is resort to name calling.

There's a lot of JBP fans on the left, myself included, but they mostly stay quiet for obvious reasons. I don't particularly care what some random people online have to say. Look at it this way, would you invite random people on the street to yell out random things at you? Then walk up to them and try to convince them? Nah, u just roll your eyes and move forward.You need to get better at spitting out simple ideas. Most fox viewers will watch that and think you're not answering the questions and trying to play games. I love that David is going on faux news, but he needs to be more direct. 

I am very familiar with fox news' target audience.  I used to be a part of it and most of my family still is. 

David's best line was "there's no evidence for that." It was simple and direct and made the viewer truly call into question the pompous attitude of the host and other guest. Keep doing that!It’s not even debatable that Israel is illegally occupying the West Bank by building settlements there and is controlling the Palestinians water and electricity supplies Surprised they brought him on. Usually it's just political punching bags that make the conservative pundit come out looking better.The callers name.

And sometimes his own name in block letters. He said this on an episode a couple weeks back.I think he's just doing something with his hands. Not 100% sure it's a conscious effort to look busy.I mean, I wouldn't blame you if you were. I subconsciously do it all the time!David on FOX and Cenk on CNN were two of the most exhilarating appearances I've seen in recent history.  In both cases my only disappointment was the shortness of their time, but even that was something both men clearly prepared for, making the most of each precious second.  Calmly showing Conservative and Establishment bullshit for what it is, one short but highly public discussion at a time, this is how Progressivism will progress throughout America.The specifics on the items they showed him, how he reacted (immediately, soon after, and long after), and just the established fact that this happened as opposed to assumptions based on how stuff is supposed to work in the Oval.  --After all, how much of THAT has been normal, in any area of Executive function?  Hell yeah it's news. Sorry, I'm fairly new to using reddit and haven't figured out how it works very well.  There are the two options: submit a new link, and submit a new text post, not sure why you can't submit a new "both."   Well I think he was in on the interference ("colluding" if you will) so I don't believe there's any real chance of him being unable to internalize it.  That is unless we're talking about the kind of dissociation observed in some totally bonkers serial killers or whatever, ha.   I think the part about where they describe him as appearing to begrudgingly accept the evidence just shows he begrudgingly accepted that they had Russia's number.  He's too stupid to grasp how highly skilled intelligence works, just aware enough to be paranoid of poisoned food or being bugged by Obama, LOL!!!  Interestingly, FOX News not only did a segment but got its Youtube video up really fast last night, around the same time as where I saw it (a bootlegged Lawrence O'Donnell).  Of course the FN coverage barely skimmed the surface of the article, and the panel was really dismissive. I got the sense the strategy was: Cover it fast just so you can say you did, but feed the base only enough to scream and fart about the New York Times.  Worth checking out and reading some comments.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg-SvVrTkBcVirtually every plant and animal we farm is genetically modified, has been for centuries if not millennia.  Ancestral cannabis is just the stalky plant farmed for hemp, with very little THC content.  So, the past 24 hours the main stories the MSM has been repeating is the video of Dan Coats learning that Putin is invited to the White House, the Iowa tornadoes and the Branson boat sinking.  This moment there is breaking news of Michael Cohen having secretly taped Trump discussing Playboy model payment.  John King has a whole panel of 4 guest correspondents at the table, breathlessly speed-talking about it.  
Is it as simple as stories with video, audio and/or sex being prioritized?  I mean we don't even get to hear the Cohen tape but just the fact that there is one and it's about a sex scandal, and who knows?--MAYBE MORE TAPES OH MY GOD.  
I feel like a total idiot now.  44 years old and I still expect integrity from the media, what a rube I am.  Well the kind you're talking about is even better.  When you merely control breeding of organisms for desired traits, you have no way of knowing what linked traits will come along with them, including undesirable ones.  But by lab-targeting only the genes of the trait you wish to strengthen, you can achieve the desired modification without side effects. What world am I imagining?  A Trump world.  I'm not being flippant; I'm referring to a freakish administration in which countless appointments have been repeatedly flipped and/or never filled in the first place, an administration where the Executive frequently seems to lack the most basic info common people know, let alone people with access to a team of experts.  And again, even if we could all assume he was being briefed, we didn't know he was told of the interference being direct orders of Putin, and that he was shown hard evidence. By the way, your edit has made you sound even more arrogant than your original comment.  I'm proud to admit possession of some naivete and miraculous lack of all-out cynicism, but I know I'm considerably more aware than the average American. So save your condescension; it just makes you sound like you have social integration delays.  What Clapper report are you talking about? -Not that I fault anyone but myself for being ignorant of facts, but I would be interested to know how much he was told/shown.  This NYT article speaks as if the pre-inaugural briefing was a big deal.  And if it's common knowledge that the President was/is fully briefed on intelligence, why haven't officials in various levels of 'hot seat' ever made public statements about exactly why Trump could not really believe his 'witch hunt' dismissals?  Why haven't they mentioned the briefing described in this article for instance?  This is a witch Hunt. It's silly. Let's focus on the real issues. America is just as bad as Russia.

We are an oligarchy. We overthrow regimes. We are the greatest threat to peace around the world. Fix your own backyard before crying about Russia!Not to say you're overthinking it, but maybe you kinda are.
The cultural characteristics you cite could indeed sit just fine with the typical Conservative viewpoint.  To that I would also add that the Russian approach to LGBT rights is in line with some Conservatives' hatred, and the oppression of journalism in Russia is likely seen as enviable to some, here.  
But to even weigh those characteristics one must first be aware of them, and let's face it, the modern far-Right American Conservative population is not teeming with awareness.  
I think the larger truth is right in our faces but for some reason nobody is saying it, not even in Leftist media (that I've heard anyway).  I think deep down, Conservatives know that Russian interference helped to elect Trump and probably many Republican nominees to their seats, if only as a down-ballot side effect of a base energized to defeat Clinton.  It's doubtful that any individual thinks he/she was even partially duped by Russians to vote for Trump, because that would mean admission of being a dupe.  But everybody knows somebody they think of as stupider, so it's not too hard imagining a lot of Conservatives thinking, "I made the informed choice of voting for Trump because I want to make America great again and I'll be damned if Killary runs my country, but if millions of Bubba-Joes voted Trump because of some kind of Russian interference, well, THANK YOU RUSSIA."  Conversely, just imagine how they'd feel about Russia now, if it had been Clinton that Putin had chosen to help. And (this is pretty fun actually) --imagine how they'll feel about whatever countries are discovered jumping on the American election interference bandwagon, with the goal of electing whoever runs against Trump in 2020.  I'd like to preemptively give thanks to China, Germany, Australia, Montenegro, Canada, all the countries who knew Trump meant them when he said 'shithole,' etc...............Forgive my abysmal ignorance in this, but what do you mean by packing the SC, and how can it be done?Thank you, good to know.  I wonder why they even have a separate prompt for submitting a link.  ???As someone who has actually performed ligation and other genetic procedures in stem cell research, I don't even know how to respond to what you're saying, your "using terms and definitions properly."  I literally can't make out what you're trying to assert.  Well, actually there's at least a little more merit to (SOME) products offered as organic, than non-GMO.  The most common meaning of organic is that no manmade herbicides or pesticides were used.  How much poison can actually penetrate a food and remain there after washing and/or cooking varies a lot depending on the food item.  In many cases you're basically correct, in that traditional (poison-using) agriculture poses no harm to human health, but some people still choose the organic alternative out of concern for the environment.  Me, hell, I'd buy nothing but organic if I were rich, and that's what it would take to afford a whole diet of that crazy-expensive stuff.  Instead I buy and eat whatever's on sale, poison and all.  Okay, I thought you were talking about something along those lines.  But I thought I must be mistaken because what you're describing is impossible (how could the Conservative majority of the SC be overturned by a minority in Congress and a Republican President???)  Thank you SO much.  I really appreciate you taking the time to find those links.  But now I'm even more baffled in a way, because note the date on your first link--Jan. 6, 2017--It's the SAME briefing this NYT article is referring to!  I read it and even followed its link to the declassified report that was issued to the public that very day.  I didn't read it as closely as Rachel Maddow would, but probably closer than Trump would, ha.  Unless I missed it, I don't see it mentioning sources like texts or emails providing the intelligence, or if it mentions them it doesn't show them.  --So do you think that's all the difference there is between that same-day publicly released information, and what came out Wednesday night, just the fact that the 4 dudes showed Trump actual evidence, and what his immediate reaction looked like?  --Not that that's not important, but I do feel kind of silly now, for thinking this NYT article was the first indisputable knowledge we've received, of Trump's knowledge.   Jan.6th is my daughter's birthday by the way, so there's my excuse for not news-hawking that day, ha.  
I think you could very well be right about the NYT waiting for substantial sourcing to publish this article, and maybe the reason the rest of the media didn't freak out sufficiently for me is a combination of factors: maybe waiting for a secondary news outlet corroboration, the story is not 'sexy' like drowning boat passengers or tape talk about Playboy models, and of course, this story is literally not news, or not absolutely new.  Well, I asked to be calmed the fuck down, and for once I actually got what I asked for in a public forum, even if it's a bitter-calm, like when you think you're gonna sneeze but then it just never triggers and burns annoyingly away.  Ha, thanks again. I can't tell if you're just spewing all the 'top hit' cliches on this to be funny or if you really think you're saying something. Well, tell me why it isn't true, jackass? Lieberals
Guess that answers my question.  And you're not entitled to answers to your questions, at least not by me.  Look shit up yourself, lazy m.f.  Btw I'm a jill-ass.  I suspect there's some truth to what you're saying, thank you.  I also suspect one would have to look at it on a case-by-case basis.  No doubt there are lots of farmers who have gone 'organic' just to increase their profits, but others who would curse us out and say we don't know what we're talking about, because their crop is uniquely more-safely farmed without synthetics, maybe because of the particular kind of synthetics that would be required, because of the region where they farm (soil, weather, particular weed/pest threats, etc.), and/or because of local laws or business constraints we know nothing about.  I've actually worked on a couple of small horticulture farms (vegetable, berries and flowers) that didn't use anything, I mean they literally didn't have any kinds of jugs of anything in some shed or whatever, and their products were fantastic with excellent yields, at least when I was there. Wrong answer, bud.Have fun helping. I'm out of this bitch in a year. America, never again. You didn't ask a single question.  You made a bunch of (again, cliche) statements.  Your only clue to my being fed information by MSNBC is that I obviously don't agree with your bunch of statements, which in fact sound identical to the statements made by the likes of Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, etc.  If you don't see the logical fallacy of dismissing Russian election interference because American operatives have committed misdeeds to other nations, guess what, plenty of us DO see that fallacy.  It's an attempt to play on stereotypical liberal guilt, just like accusing Democrats of taking African American voters for granted by promising them public assistance, etc.  It's such a tired and tedious ploy, I didn't feel you deserved to have your challenge met, because I am a real cunt.  But now I think you should know what is so stupid about what you tried to assert.  By that logic, Bin Laden should still be alive (I'm sure Trump wishes he were, since it's the one Obama thing he can't un-do).  Also we should be fine with NK and any other country building as many nukes as they want, because we did.  
Etc. etc. etc.....
I wonder if your sense of duty to American fairness will prevail when countless countries take the GOP's blind eye to election meddling as a green light to do the same, and help a ton of Democrats elected, including a Democrat President.  Ha, China, Canada, Germany, Montenegro, Iran, if you're listening......
Oh of course I didn't forget you Nigeria.  --I'm sure the hacker skills in your "shithole country" have improved vastly since your early days of asking old ladies to help your princes get free from wrongful imprisonment, LOL!!!!  I'm not sure sure what point you've tried to make, but I'm quite confused regarding your comment. What's your point?

I don't watch those guys, not do I watch any other corporate media. I read Chomsky. Prove Noam Chomsky wrong, because you're basically equating him to Sean Hannity.As much as anyone might legitimately assess Rachel Maddow as being a cog in the MSM wheel, you have to give her credit for not falling for deflection bait when she sees it.  The absurd snatching of security clearance from highly-qualified intelligence persons is the kind of thing she WOULD be all over.....if it were a real thing and not just an attempt by Trump to drum up base support and distract from scrutiny on himself....but she clocked that bluff and didn't even mention it.  Any candidate's "pitch" is only as powerful as its reach to voters.  If you think it's not solid enough, it's because it's not reaching you, and I'm not saying that means nothing, I'm asking you to think about why.  Why is the so-called "liberal media" not covering the platforms of Democratic candidates?  Maybe (hopefully) they will as election day approaches, but either way, don't make the absurd accusation of candidates lacking a message.  Go to their websites and you can see their messages spelled out very clearly. Joyyal66 Stop lying, calling yourself a "very progressive Dem."  In fact you sound very much like a certain "very stable genius."  Yeah, you read Chomsky, yet could not understand my point.  Okay I'll spell it out for you: You cited America's past transgressions (that means bad stuff we did), as reason why we should "fix our own backyard before crying about Russia!"  Our own back yard is governed by a President and Congress that Russia has a very keen interest in.  It behooves us (meaning we SHOULD care) about what Russia is doing to control outcomes of elections, let alone control public perceptions.  But according to you, we shouldn't care because we are as bad as them.  I'm saying that is idiotic (that means stupid as fuck).  Just because our government has acted out in violence against other countries does not (for example) mean we shouldn't have taken out Osama Bin Laden when he killed 3000 of our people.  We shouldn't not-care about countries like North Korea building nuclear bombs just because we have them.  If you are STILL failing to see the correlation to your argument, you will never understand.  You're not mentioning any names.  The closest you've come to a specific critique is of "establishment centrist policies" which at least is more focused than your original complaint about "Democrats." And in doing to, you are inherently acknowledging that there are multiple policy approaches for Democrats to take.  --Would you have all Democratic candidates seeking to represent constituents in all regions adopt a lockstep policy, given the complexities of economics?   I'll just go ahead and say I agree with your assertions on centrist Democrats, but you can't say they're struggling if they've already been chosen by their Primary voters.  And that big business you mention is a major reason centrists nominees become centrist candidates.  It's just fucked up; no more eloquent way to put it.  But it IS changing (Alex O-C being a shining example).  North Korea is defending itself against American imperialism. We're not world police, and trying only makes us less safe and proliferates the user of nuclear weapons. 

Imperialist dog!Okay we're done here. You're either a hopeless imbecile or a North Korean, lol.  Buh bye.  I agree with every word you're saying, I'm just not sure what solution you're looking for this late in the game.  Or maybe you're not seeking a solution but just want to make us all feel "doomed," which I especially cannot see the point of.  If you say so. Enjoy your corporate media!But they're mostly uneducated...I didn't even consider his motive (delving into Trumpthink gives me extreme nausea) but you are probably right.  Though given his profound lack of foresight he usually shows on Twitter, I would suspect he was given this idea by Hannity or some other goon.

My brother likes JP and I would love to show him this considering my brother quit smoking without a supernatural experienceI HOPE my brother is better than that. 😂

He is progressive so I'm not exactly sure where the JP stuff fits in, we haven't talked about it extensively.

Thanks though I'll be sure to show him this.Of course Islam deserves criticism as does any religion or ideology, But it’s quite clear Carl wants more than criticism doe which is to ban it No he didn’t but he liked a comment that suggested Islam should be banned Yes but classical liberals believe in freedom of religion and wouldn’t supporting banning any religion Nah, their minds won't even register it as f'd up. I'd take that, but it's doubtful they could even give a shit.  "What's that?  Oh, sorry, we couldn't hear anything; we were swimming in our Olympic sized swimming pool of money."Agree except it's worse than that; it's not just his mental health but his mental capacity seems to be diminishing rapidly too.  A man-baby quickly deteriorating into a baby-man-baby.  I call it 'Narcissheimer's.'  Well hopefully someone will correct me if anything I'm going to say is inaccurate, because I would like to be as informed as possible, but I don't think there is any Constitutional protection at play here.  

I just saw the interview with Cody Wilson in which he compared sharing of the blueprints to checking out a book at the library, so apparently he sees it as a 1st Amendment issue.  It has been compared to the legal case for publishing instructions to build a hydrogen bomb, and some including Wilson see it as similar to the protected status of books with instructions for making all manner of illegal products such as bombs and drugs (e.g. Ye Olde 'The Anarchist's Cookbook').  Wilson's argument is that questions about minors, criminals and mentally ill people making the guns is moot, because homemade/undetectable/untraceable firearms have been illegal since 1988.  Apparently the last-minute ban on publishing the printer codes has something to do with international trade that I still don't understand, but apparently the government sees it as a 2nd Amendment issue?  

Again if I'm mistaken I'd appreciate correction but I see it like this: The blueprints aren't speech; they're an ingredient.  You can't simply read them out of innocent curiosity the way you could a cookbook or anything published in a human language, but they are essential to printing a gun, using a 3D printer and plastic (the other ingredients, which are legal).  This is similar to the procurement or possession of certain ingredients crucial to manufacturing illegal drugs.  What's interesting about that to me is that the law has struggled to keep up with the manufacture of some drugs because people keep figuring out ways to change recipes just enough. There's no way to simply ban everything that could potentially get someone high because that's subjective; you can only ban specific molecules as measurable by lab tests, and in some cases the 'high' of a drug can be created by simply adding, subtracting or moving an atom.  So the best the law can do is ban one or more ingredient essential to the high, regardless of how it could be arranged in a molecule.

I think the banning of printer codes for making guns should be fairly straightforward, since it is an essential ingredient.  And the ban could apply to not only this particular code but all potential codes, because unlike the high from designer drugs, the potential for committing murder is not subjective.  I'm NOT saying the ban would stop people from sharing codes online, but that act should be illegal, same as sharing kiddie porn.  
What do you mean by your 'timeline' question?Okay say like the song, all your exes live in Texas, and you want to murder one of them.  Are there not places in Texas where you could purchase ammunition after getting off your plane?Fully plastic firearms are ILLEGAL. 
[Source ](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00181) I know this will never happen but how glorious would it be if one of these days she does her usual 1984 briefing, turns it over to the Press Corps for questions, and they all just sit there staring at her.  Seriously, wtf do we ever get out of these things besides how despicable this WH is?  Lol really? Sounds like David was making a joke of the whole “cuck” thing that the alt-right idiots love talking about online.Like Kyle Kulinski said on Secular talk, they claim Trump is Putin’s puppet and an authoritarian menace and yet they voted to give him more military power Uh, you might want to check your gauges; I said absolutely nothing indicating my opinion on anything, let alone anything to warrant spasmatic name-calling.  My post is simply a reflection of my field (science, namely biology although sociology was my minor).  It just occurred to me that hardcore Trump supporters are usually cited to be around 33% of Americans, and FNC happens to make up 33.3333% of major cable news channels. 

 I mindfully refrained from stating any of my own opinions because I could foresee them being mistaken for advocating CNN and MSNBC, despite their flaws (although I did allude to that, mentioning how one could cite lack of coverage on a couple example issues).  I thought I made clear that I wanted to talk strictly about Trump favorability coverage.  But I see that not only could I be taken for a Trump "apologist cuck" but that someone would try to force the topic to include other issues such as vaccination.  

OF COURSE every issue can be linked to Trump one way or another, but even if CNN occasionally cites positive things about the economy, it's fairly rare and they certainly don't frame it as a Trump victory, the way Sarah H. S. would apparently prefer.  She is correct that the vast majority of their coverage is of generally negative reporting on Trump.  

I am not saying that is a good or bad thing, just an interesting thing.  I'll take that apology now. 
Here's a perfectly up-to-date example of how I see CNN and MSNBC  falling short of being the Trump-haters the Right accuses them of being, the level of scrutiny they COULD apply (and I think SHOULD apply): As their panels repeatedly chew over why Trump refuses to condemn Russia for the 2016 meddling, one of the pundits always pipes up as the daring seer, using 'duh' hand gestures and all-caps voice mode, "BECAUSE HE STILL DOESN'T BELIEVE RUSSIA DID IT."  And every time I am left shaking my head because there's never a TRULY intrepid pundit willing to go far enough, to say that Trump DOES believe Russia meddled, he knows damn well they did, if only because Intelligence proves it but probably also because he was aware of it before the election, and the reason he won't admit it is either Putin told him never to admit it or he doesn't want his base to ponder for one second whether his super-slim electoral win was legitimate.  Or both.  What's nice about David Packman, TYT and other online media is they WILL go there.  Yeah fuck him but at least he’s being principled on this occasion of his opposition to ‘big government’. The Chinese have a history of successfully migrating and bettering the country they adopt. The downside is that local small businesses will suffer due to superior Chinese business practices. Best bet would be for our future generations to marry into Chinese families and create beautiful babies. Fin.She’s not that progressive and flip flops a lot of the time is only consistent in her opposition to Wall Street. Nonetheless, she’s probs the 2nd most progressive US senator but Bernie is miles ahead of her. I enjoyed Ben Dixon's presentation! Faron Cousins, meh. Jen Briney, I was glad to be exposed to her.you make a good point, thanks for your inputAsian men need more alpha male roles in Hollywood and white women should start giving more chances to the Asian males. I would enjoy Abby Martin or Eleanor Goldfield guest hostingEither way the attack by a Antifa or whoever it was wrong but she’s making a real meal out of her black card when it’s not about that. She’s a hypocrite also for the fact that she said on PragerU that true victims of oppression never complain all day about it. 

Plus you can tell how partisan Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens are because anything the left does they dismiss and are always such sycophants to anything conservatives do or say whether its conservative in origin or not.

The Milo book deal is the perfect scaffold to the concept.  Also, yes, the media entities' decision was based on Jones' violence-inciting rhetoric, not the validity of his claims.  If they did that it WOULD be a slippery slope.  OMG THANK YOU for bringing up the possible (I'd say likely) quid pro quo scenario. 

 I think Donald and Jr. are quite possibly being truthful when they say they didn't get anything at the Tower meeting.  --I think Natalia was like, "I'm sorry your father promised the voters information on the Clintons on Monday, because we're not going to directly give you such information.  It would be better if it's never in your hands, then they don't get dirty.  We will Wikileak the information.  In the meantime, we would like assurances that your father will work with us (regarding sanctions, Russia-favoring foreign policies, etc.)." 

And I think those assurances were given. OOOoooo, DAMN good analogy.  I have not seen it, but I think DP should see it to tell us what it's like and either recommend or discourage seeing it. 

Well that's awful. Using your kids to virtue signal your ideologies... 

This is completely against what we know from psychology and biology. Kids are not a blank slate, there's no need to pretend they are.

This is just terrible in any way you look at it.&gt; Now apparently it means letting children decide for themselves what they want? 

lolI know that this sounds like an Onion Article but it is actually reality and it happened in India. Don’t be alarmed though; India is probably one of the friendliest countries for Jews and is one of the few ones, where anti-semitism has never taken place. Well at least amongst the non-Muslim contingent which is 86% of the population. I think that this was just some sort of cheap &amp; awkward publicity stunt. that 5 s can be filled with graphics and faint music-like soundHaha I know! David should cover this. This is more evidence of how Trumpism and emboldened racialist politics are spreading worldwide. Depends. America has been pretty great compared with most places at the time. Compared to now? Not great, but that is a huge testament on how much progress we have made. That's just untrue. Regardless of your skin color, you're doing much better than you were in 50's. Will sentencing for these 8 charges go forward or will they wait for a retrial of the other 10 charges?

May he rest in peace. I feel that his passing is a sign of Trump's inevitable fall.That's why its a shitpost, nerd!I’m trying to warn the public about the dangers of conservative Islam. As unfortunately a lot of liberals seem to be apologising for this terrible ideology. I as a liberal myself, absolutely detest Trump, Republicans and the right wing in general. It is us liberals who need to wake up and take action.I have defined what action is. In my description above. I’m not spamming Reddit, a lot of people have thanked me for highlighting this issue. I’m not sure what your problem is.It's more interesting than humansI don’t understand your anger here. Are you just going to stick your head in the sand? We have to deal head on with this problem of Islamic extremism. What are some of your solutions to this issue?Yes what you are identifying is just a small part of the problem. I aboslutely agree with you that racism exists and that definitely does foster exclusion, mutual distrust etc. But how the marginalised community chooses to react to this is often dependant on their said religion. You simply dont have discriminated against Asians, South Americans, Hindu Indians etc carrying out terrorist attacks against the native population or hailing suicide bombers as heroes. 

This is a problem exclusively within Islam. As Islam is an inherently problematic ideology. It is Islam that needs to be reformed or destroyed if you are going to see a reduction in violence &amp; terrorism worldwide. And the Belgians need to crack down on this. If Islam was not the main problem here, there are plenty of minorities that get discriminated worldwide but you dont see them reacting by blowing things up. Not recognising this fact makes you an Islam apologist. Oh yes, there are plenty of examples of delusional liberals out there. Linda Sarsour a Sharia apologist is organising women's marches, you have liberal politicians worldwide describing Islam as a "Religion of peace" including Barack Obama &amp; Hillary Clinton, when the religion is anything but peaceful. 

By taking action I mean, talking about the problem honestly. There are certain steps that we can take - look for alternative energy, put sanctions on the Saudis, increase punishments for terrorism, reduce Islamic migration &amp; deport hate preachers. Now you tell me what exactly you disagree with me about?Bernie Sanders = Venezuela 

BLM = KKK

Illegal Iraq War = liberation of Iraq 

Pro-Palestinian = Pro-Hamas 

Same-Sex Marriage = Gay Agenda 

Torture = Enhanced Interrogation

Single-payer healthcare = pie in the sky 

Tax Cuts for the rich = More money in everyone’s PoCkEtsIt’s great being conservative who’s looking after the oppressed 1%OH SNAP! PROFESSOR PAT IS JUMPING IN WITHOUT A TAG! THE REF IS LOSING HIS MIND!Whatever helps. Eh, he may have just been confused. I have a good friend who works at a law firm, and I don’t remember the company’s name. I know when I talked to him but not if I talked to someone from law firm X. Harris is a corporate joke. These types of attacks won’t do anything to stop this scum from entering the court. I get all of that. I just caution people to lionizing the corporate shill Harris. He didn't use to be. I was a Patreon supporter of his for a good while, but he began pandering to idiots.

We can joke about him selling out to big Seltzer, but we all know the kind of dollars the easily manipulated bring in.Very true thanks.Huh that's really interesting and good point. Thanks homie for the advise. Human Service in mental disability. I love working with people that have mental and physical disabilities. It’s a shame these Post-Modernist far-leftist neo-Marxists can’t agree in our philosophy of free speech. And our philosophy of free speech is that you are [free to say things we agree with ](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/09/professor-jordan-peterson-threatens-to-sue-after-critic-calls-him-misogynist.amp.html) Jesus Christ, it shouldn’t be about winning the ‘new cold war’ it’s about trying to ending it. When he says we should win it he means by default that we should escalate the tensions through more sanctions or whatnot so that peace is a more obscure achievement The irony of accusing the democrats for being partisan when yet they are doing just that It is hard to understand what some people mean with their sayings about pandering / being overly friendly with Putin and Kim jong un. Trying to put some possible interpretations in picture form may at least give something that can be refuted.

1 Upper left: pandering is on or off and chance of war drops from 0.9 % to near 0 % when pandering is on.

2 Upper right: the more pandering the less risk of war. So better turn up pandering to 11 ?

Those 1 and 2 seem to be what they could mean.

Then there are other possible opinions about this kind of one dimensional / one adjustment knob choice view:

3 Lower left: after some amount of pandering, more pandering does not reduce risk of war. Benefit of pandering levels of.

4 Lower right: there is an optimum level of pandering after which more pandering increases risk of war.

In reality international relations are more complicated than one adjustment knob.

If a leader calls Putin or Un "good", they are wrong or lying. Can't be a tactic to lie about that.
No it’s that things like slavery is a conservative policy by default and WAS traditionally supported by those who were conservatives. Of course present-day Conservatives don’t now support Slavery.

Plus the guy you’re replying didn’t make the assertion that Candace and most conservatives support slavery, you did. Plus ironically enough Candace in the tweet said liberals were the ones oppressing Blacks like what a loud of bs and oxymoron. 

P.s. If you don’t know what I mean by Dinesh Dsouza virus I’m talking about his whole pseudo history revisionism of the left and Democrats which has no credibility. He’s trying to say the democrats are still the same party that was supportive of Jim Crow. Slavery etc. Now about everyone on the right is kissing and taking his bs. I was in the same boat regarding the long advertisements but then I became a member. No ads at all. 

Been a member for almost a year and haven't questioned my membership once :)So when an accusation is made on anyone, who is to be believed? In civilized society generally the null hypothesis is to be upheld until proof is offered. Do you know anything about the null hypothesis or the presumption of innocence and their logical foundations? You're sounding like a religious person with that sort of nonsense: "You can't PROVE GOD DOESN'T EXIST!" Christ!Capitalism and socialism cannot coexist. You don’t know what either is if you think so. Please. Next time someone accuses you of something without evidence, then I hope you hold fast to your beliefs.What are you talking about? I scrolled through the sub and clicked on a few that I thought were interesting. Idk who you are lolI feel that there will be more dirt revealed on Kavanaugh and on the GOP. Impeachment is unlikely, but more likely Kavanaugh will call quits.True but I meant in the context of all slavery Good argument🤔, bro! When you spend all your career railing against the ills of the postmodern cultural marxists (while not understanding the concept one iota), pose with pepe flags, say you would have voted Trump and end up with massive far-right / alt-right fans, is it any surprise? 

This guy is a pseudo-intellectual fraud and his opinions should be taken with a grain of salt. Kavanaugh's confirmation has energized non-Trump voters, especially women. I feel that the midterms will lead to a balanced congress.I agree with sam 100 on this. I got angry with him for courting racial pseudoscientists, so I haven’t listened in while. You have to look at Murray’s underlying methodology, data, and his personal history to get the full picture. Sam didn’t do his research and when called out on it, merely doubled down. He made a complete ass of himself and seemed totally unable to see why. I don't dwell on individuals, unlike you. I focus on ideas. I take back nothing I said. Dude, you were making an argument for some sort of amorphous, undefinable “don’t believe anyone” position. That’s not correct or defensible. The null hypothesis (the presumption of innocence in law) is to disbelieve any claim that does not have sufficient evidence.

Ford seems credible to me, but there wasn’t a good investigation to tell of what she says has enough evidence to make a certain judgment. I tend to believe that rich, white dudes have no problems sexually assaulting women; Hell, sorority types reward them sexually for it! What is more important is the way kavanaugh responded: he let loose so many petty lies and anger it should have precluded him from the bench. It raises suspicious about what he actually knew of the assault, but it doesn’t rise to the level of cause for positive belief in the claim.

Christ, dude. Lmao, he was a great general. He was also a slave-owning pos. And yet this is what I don’t get. How the fuck is Shapiro any different than Richard Spencer? One is a hyper partisan Zionist Jewish Extremist while the other one is just a white supremacist. In fact I would argue that Richard Spencer (despicable as he is) is a more tolerable person than dishonest, (identity politics for me but not for anyone else) right wing Zionist bastard Shapiro Read this article on Harris by Nathan J Robinson. Might change your mind. It’s well researched, is 20,000 words long and contains endless citations.

This is why I support Pakman. Homie ignores the drama aka pointless debates. Pakman isn't scared to debate folks, but he plays it smart and wants the topic/subject to be the focus. But most people who go for the “anti-trump” approach focus so much on his bigotry, language and how he is a puppet to Russia. Of course you have to run on policies and give voters something to vote for rather than something to vote against but if you campaign on a populist left platform you can also attack trump for being supportive of most left-wing economic and foreign policies as a candidate and backing out of those views. So you can gain support from some trump voters. Sorry, David and Kyle are too establishment-like??Yes totally! Amongst many others of course. But when you have Rubin classified as an "intellectual" that is an instant disqualifier in my book. I mean Rubin is way too dumb to even be a "pseudo-intellectual" like Shapiro or Peterson. 
https://www.youtube.com/user/AntiCitizenX/videos

You would have a completely valid point if it weren't for the fact that Rubin has been dodging David for sooooo loooooong.

This is most certainly a recurring event.Jesse is such a conservative sycophant. This is going to be the worst debate ever as David just laughs at the total madness coming from Jesse’s mouth.Lmao, what a privileged rager. Cenk gottemWell who said you can’t like both at the same time, there’s major crossovers in their policies Well he’s not denying it happened but believes that the US has no right to question Russia for it when they’ve done the same thing. Plus in hindsight, though I condemn the Russian interference in the election, the revelation of DNC emails regardless of who done it was something that we needed to all see It’s not surprising anyway cos Trump colluded with the Saudis. Ik like I said I wouldn’t be surprised if he did and I can’t remember Kyle’s position on it but he is a sceptic on itBut there’s no evidence that ties Trump Sr to it...Guilt by association fallacySo if I’m your friend and we both own a business and i commit tax fraud, does that automatically mean you were involved in it? I never said Trump didn’t know about it, but it’s of course very likely he did. All I’m saying is due process needs to be served 

There’s no concrete direct evidence ghat trump knew of it and went ahead with itThat’s my opinion not Kyle’s. All I’m saying is we can’t jump to certain definitive conclusions but we can make assumptions with what we know It’s not a fallacy because Kyle isn’t using the fact that the US has done the same thing as Russia  to discredit or dismiss Russian interference in US Elections

Plus regardless of the fact it was wrong for Russia to interfere in the election, at least it showed how corrupt and partisan the DNC was. Sad folks use memes as facts or counter-arguments. I like that guyI think he speaks slow. He is anti-black. It's a pthology. No black person I know takes him seriously.Bought and paid for.Can’t be bothered to watch a pseudo intellectual talk about “cultural Marxism” and “postmodernism”, can you tell me what he said that was bigoted? I’m horrified &amp; extremely sad. This election result is disastrous and worries me greatly. I mean Bolsonaro is actually way worse than Trump; he is a literal, authoritarian fascist &amp; racist scumbag. And what worries me greatly is his environmental stance. The man is supported by &amp; supports illegal tree logger goons in the Amazon. Bear in mind that Amazon is responsible for driving rain patterns around a huge area of the the Americas &amp; Africa. And widespread deforestation there will be terrible for climate change worldwide.Haha it’s definitely a possibility. She might just become the new Laura Inghram. Such a pity though. Megyn Kelly is a beautiful woman but she is a terrible person.
