Me personally, this redesign makes the site look a lot like the Gizmodo cluster of sites (Deadspin, Jezebel etc.) Like, A LOT like them.  

I already went thru this with AVClub.com after Gizmodo's parent company acquired AV, but I'm kinda surprised that now Slate has gone this direction too when it's supposedly its own thingI'm on a Mac and have tried loading comments in Chrome, Safari and Firefox. In Chrome I can open the comments section but can only view the "writer &amp; member" comments. In the other browsers I can't open the comments section at all. Has anyone else noticed this? If you are able to open them, what OS and browser are you on? This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/10/11/ninth_circuit_rules_there_s_no_second_amendment_right_to_sell_firearms.html) reduced by 86%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Does the Second Amendment protect an individual right to sell firearms to the public? No, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Tuesday in Teixeira v. County of Alameda, a landmark decision affirming the government&amp;#039;s constitutional authority to strictly regulate gun shops.

&gt; Berzon then turned to the plaintiffs&amp;#039; more substantial argument: whether the Second Amendment confers a right to sell firearms.

&gt; First, the First Amendment is abstract, declaring that the government &amp;quot;Shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.&amp;quot; The Second Amendment, in contrast, specifically protects &amp;quot;The right of the people to keep and bear arms.&amp;quot; A law that restricts the commercial sale of a particular book plainly abridges &amp;quot;The freedom of speech&amp;quot;; a law that limits the number of gun shops in a county does not infringe upon the people&amp;#039;s right to bear arms.

But I'm wondering about the practicality. It reminds me of the story of the [playpump](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/07/01/the-playpump-what-went-wrong/) (an old story, but newer than this one). 

This part is especially concerning:

&gt;Shaanxi Mothers have installed 1,294 digesters in 26 villages. They have won prizes and got funding, though never enough. The money goes to subsidizing a third of the cost of a digester, with **the householder and the government making up the rest.**

What is the cost of the digester minus the subsidies? Is it sustainable in the long term? With the trend of china continuing to lift large numbers of people out of poverty and into the global middle class in mind, is the calculus changed? 

I don't think I have a strong rebuke to the concept (owing mostly to my ignorance about the general field of renewable energies) but the more an idea sounds like a free lunch, the more skeptical i am about it. 

That said, wow 2008 slate. I'm pretty sure at about that time, slate was commissioning essays from college kids by the word count. I think you can see the difference in writing style, content and length from here to their staff writers these days. &gt; That said, wow 2008 slate.

ha! yeah, was definitely a 'blast from the past', to say the least! They've.. improved. Thankfully :)

I do, I think it's disgusting personally... but, it has its merits. There're just too many nutrients there to 'let go down the toilet'.. ..but, not for fertilization of human crops.

&gt; &amp;quot;Even the Washington Post is now, tonight, being forced to admit what we have been telling you for over a year.&amp;quot; That wasn&amp;#039;t quite accurate-the Post article said nothing about the veracity of the Steele dossier, and neither exculpated Trump nor condemned Obama and the Clintons-but Hannity has never let details derail his performative self-regard.

&gt; For Hannity, this just serves to underscore another of his favorite themes: the complete moral bankruptcy of all media members who are not personal friends of Sean Hannity.

&gt; In return, Hannity has pledged the president his unrelenting support and his unyielding enmity toward all who would thwart the Trump agenda.

LMAO, this has got to be the most pearl clutching feminist headline I've ever read!Lets see ... pretty formulaic:

\+ start with the snowflake heart emoting, thought and reason be damned. 

\+ Cite the losing of the popular vote, never mind that's not how you win

\+ Make fun of reality TV star status, never mind the left gets their nightly news from late night comedians, and want to run Oprah

\+ Call out travel ban (on terrorism sponsoring countries), labor unions (that extort people to vote their way), and pregnancy centers ... ok you've got a point ...

\+ Lament the supreme court replacement, never mind the left has circumnavigated the will of the voters through the judiciary consistently

\+ Cite the Comey Loyalty oath, as if Comey's not a slimebag, the left certainly thought he was when he brought up Hillary's email, but now he's hunky dory again

\+ " The capitulation of two branches of (Republican elected) government to a terrifying third (elected branch), elected by a minority (which was the majority necessary to win), is not how our government was envisioned."  ... So electing officials to represent the people through a system established in 1796 was not envisioned?  Or maybe she's referring to being envisioned by Cultural Marxists and 3rd wave feminists?   

\+ " tars asylum applicants (who break into the country) as criminals (because they apparently can't fill out the forms in Mexico)," oh and never mind the Dems tweaked the laws so any couple with domestic abuse issues, verbal or otherwise, can claim refugee status.  Bad couple relationships, why how many asylum seekers would that qualify to hop the wall and fill in DNC voter registrations?

\+ "It isn’t simply that he sees black men as intrinsically guilty, the same as brown refugees ("refugees" who illegally broke into the country)." and she says this despite him never having uttered a single word of prejudice about this African Americans

\+  " It is simply true that the president is corrupt and that his supporters celebrate his corruption." and lets pretend the other ones were all angels.  Remember William Kinda-Rapey Clinton?

\+ "He called (a) sitting member of Congress “crazy” (because Water's is bat sht) and pettily insulted that same restaurant’s cleanliness (after some partisans kicked his spokesperson out for doing her job)."  Seriously, play any video of Waters to a group of people and try to stand on her not being bat sht, over the bursts of laughter

 \+ " upholding Trump’s ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries" and it is a strange coincidence that the greatest sponsors of terrorism are also Muslim countries, go figure. 

\+ " The combined effect has rendered him immune to every standard we, as a country, once shared. "  I once had a choice of health plans where I could go see the doctor for a $300 premium as many times as needed.  Now I have no choices and pay $400 and cannot see a doctor without paying out on a $15k deductible.  Meanwhile, people who economically contribute less to nothing, get a platinum plan.  Redistributing my health?

What she should be writing about is how a two party system is a sham to keep the elite in power by keeping the people divided.##r/counting

Re the Telegraph, its comment is matched by Neil Young in The Hollywood Reporter who described the film as inert. I was worried that a second viewing might reveal flaws, but I enjoyed just as much, if not more so. This is an important historical lesson that I hope younger people are able to learn from. Des séquences vidéo créatives ou rédactionnelles fournies par les meilleurs studios et archives au monde par. Rumours circulated before Cannes that this would be the last Ken Loach fiction feature. However as Jimmy reintegrates into the community and sees the poverty, and growing cultural oppression, the leader and activist within him is stirred. Paul Laverty left and Ken Loach on set for JIMMYS HALL Watching Jimmys Hall was an absolute joy. More reviews of Ken Loach et al to follow. Les fichiers téléchargés directement à partir du site Web sont compressés au format JPEG. I would say that it is a film to inspire audiences with a belief in collective work and community based art and culture. But Norton managed to humanise what could have become a rather stereotyped character. If he cant, I think Jimmys Hall is a good swansong. Les tailles et les dimensions de pixels des fichiers non compressés sont approximatives. Some critics have discussed it as a minor work. After reading some lukewarm reviews I was delighted to find that this is a film full of energy and wit as well as great music and dancing and some serious insights into the repression of collective action in a conservative, rural society. I think he would agree that young people in rural Ireland in particular were stifled by the Church up to at least the 1980s but that since then the international corporations with their movements of capital that first built up and then knocked down the Celtic Tiger economy have taken. In 1921 Jimmy Gralton s sin was to build a dance hall on a rural crossroads in an Ireland on the brink of Civil War. We know Gralton cant win Loach is not a romantic and his films are rooted in historical accuracy though not a history recognised by right wingers. Veuillez contacter le pour les frais de production associés. He makes the decision to reopen the hall in the face of what they may bring. All kinds of metaphors are wrapped up in this stance and the fact that Gralton brings in jazz to play alongside traditional Irish music, including music for dancing. So far I havent managed to find out who the actress is or perhaps she is one of Loachs non actors? A major feature is tiring and stressful but I hope he can make another one. As soon as he is home he begins to hear pleas that he should re open the community hall the Pearse Connolly Hall named after two Republican heroes built by local voluntary labour on the Gralton familys land. The hall re opens and life improves but Gralton has enemies and it is this opposition that has attracted Laverty and Loach to his story. The Cannes Press Conference for Jimmys Hall is interesting in terms of Loachs thoughts on what cinema can achieve. Loach and Laverty have acknowledged that film is certainly linked to The Wind That Shakes the Barley. Vous pouvez demander un fichier TIFF si ce format est disponible ou une taille interpolée supérieure selon le format de sortie souhaité.

As the hall grew in popularity its socialist and free spirited reputation brought it to the attention of the church and politicians who forced Jimmy to flee and the hall to close. The opposition is led by the Catholic Church and the landowners and also by the right wingers from the pro treaty IRA. Youve got it spot on, it was an excellent film.

As for its relationship with Donal OKellys film, I read an interview with OKelly who said that although he put his old friend Laverty onto the Gralton story, his play wasnt the source but his play actually benefited from Lavertys research.

In some ways, Jimmys Hall has a similar address to audiences as the Loach Allen film Land and Freedom 1995. The Pearse Connolly Hall was a place where young people could come to learn, to argue, to t above all to dance and have fun. Jimmys mother is played by a first time actor called Eileen Henry according to The Telegraph, which called the film exasperatingly thin. Jimmy Gralton discovers that the old enemies are still in power.

Now, one of the other losers Eamon de Valera is heading a new government in the Free State and Gralton believes he can return safely.

&gt;Every poll aggregator, from the famous (Sam Wang, the New York Times’ Upshot, Drew Linzer at Daily Kos) to the more obscure stat-hipster types (Mike Cisneros, Pierre-Antoine Kremp) agrees Donald Trump is unlikely to win. But how unlikely? That’s where consensus melts into numerical discord. Wang says it’s basically over. As I write this, he gives Trump less than a 1 percent chance. The Upshot gang is more conservative, saying Trump still has a 16 percent chance of overcoming his deficit in the polls. And Nate Silver? Liberals have to lie down with a cold compress on their foreheads whenever they refresh his page, because he still sees Trump as having about a 1 in 3 shot of winning.

And the article touches on the difficulty of rating probabilistic determinations. I normally like ezra, but i definitely break with him on his mathematical nihilism. While yeah, the entire election predictions are going to be require a lot more samples to determine any single forecaster's accuracy, we have a lot of little samples in the state contests. silver made his name not only predicting the presidential race, but indeed for predicting the 50 states. So it's not like we don't have tools like the brier score at our disposal to determine the accuracy of these forecasts. But we can't do this unless, as the article mentions, the poll aggs release the probability dist for the electoral map. 

anyways, i don't know about you guys, but i actually haven't been following the numbers very closely recently. even silver himself over and over has said that they aren't accurate until late in the race. up to two weeks prior is when they start becoming predictive is what i'm sure i've heard him say. so despite being an upshot and, "the fix," type of a news reader, i've avoided all the horseracy stuff. i actually really miss the frivolous stories like [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/wonkblog/majority-illusion/). I don't hate the horseracey stuff, but it just doesn't rub me the right way.replace "white guys" with "white girls" and "mansplaining" with "bitching"

or replace "white guys" with "black guys/girls" and "mansplaining" with "uppity"

etc


FROM: Daryl Bem Proved ESP Is Real by Daniel Engber


A few students—all of them **white guys,** Wu remembers—would hang around to ask about the research and to probe for flaws in its design. Wu still didn’t believe in ESP, but she found herself defending the experiments to these **mansplaining** guinea pigs.9/23/2016

My purpose: I primarily just wanted to clear the spam when I requested the sub. Now that that's done, i'm simply going to contribute as a member if anyone wants to get any discussions started. That is to say that if you post something, you'll have one captive (and willing) audience member.

This is my way of encouraging members to start discussion on whatever. Topics can be related to the gist (my personal favorite slate offering) or on any articles. Heck, you can even link to other news sites like the times or the post if you want. Really, if we read slate, we just enjoy reading periodicals and so i don't want to limit /r/slate to only just slate.com itself. And also, many slate contributors aren't even necessarily slate employees. So long as it's newsy in some way (e.g. culture, current events, analysis), it'll be appropriate. 

If you want to help grow the community, I welcome that. If you need mod privs to do so, throw me a quick PM. I'm not looking for anything exhaustive. Just, "hi, i'd like to work on the theme/community/spam and i need moderation privileges to facilitate the process because X." 

The only ground rule that i'll lay out right now is that people aren't allowed to be jerks. Sometimes discussions can get testy, i realize, but just remember to act like how you would in real life. You're free to disagree and pushback all you want, but no yelling at people are calling them dumdums. 

Now that that's out of the way, **HELLO and i hope you enjoy your visit**! They run a lot of SNL bits and Jimmy Fallon skits, which are funny, but it's like clockwork. Are those sponsored stories? I like both Slate *and* NBC, it just feels off to me somehow.Can we get rid of this naked administration apologist hitchens already?

This is one of the reasons I don't visit slate any longer. This kind of bs doesn't deserve equal time or equal billing.Mickey kaus. Eh...Note to Slate: Remove this "latest chatter in cuberspace"
First its demeening. Second it's a category that only makes sense to slate. We need something more meaningful on reddit.
The Daou Report is just that. Daou's report on internet writings. Or consider Froomkin's Qapo cuber column, another excellent example of summary simply labeled. And then there's cursor.org which supplies narrative summary.

This Weiss article is much better than the Noah article, but the Noah's has the better title. It would be nice to tie these together. In reddit and in slate. Same important topic. Yet somehow lost in the morass.Except this tool only has current articles.

To get to the back articles you need subject area mavens to crawl through and link the back stuff up, map like in the order of maven perceptions of importance. These maps will then serve as meaningul keys into the articles. 

New events and understandings will make this process continual but it is the subject area mavens who care about the minutia that will ad value, see Cory Doctorow's Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom to gain insight into interest based economies.Fantastic article that clearly and succinctly lays out the situation and how U.S. policies have helped ensure its f'd-up-ed-ness. Go USA.Am I wrong, or does not rudimentary knowledge of chemistry imply that what their *Bomb Expert* said

&gt; "liquid bombs" might involve chemicals like nitroglycerine, nitromethane, hydrazine, ammonium nitrate, gasoline, or—most likely—the ingredients for triacetone triperoxide (also known as TATP). (The terrorists could mix these up onboard to make an ignitable explosive.) 

is not true?

See [this](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/17/flying_toilet_terror_labs/page2.html)Great idea.  

I wonder where the video iPod fits into Apple's vision for the AV market.  A replacement for DVD's, DVR, and CD players?  Sure takes up a lot less space...Note to slate:

The professional hackery of your punditry is on display here. John Dickerson frames the debate, or as most people saw it in PA "the asskicking" in the best possible light for Santorum. That this attempt shows how weak Santorum is as a candidate should not be a surprise since he's the incumbent and he's currently down 10 points in the polls, an inconceivable position. This framing and strained presentation is everything that makes slate the mediocre rag that it is. This is why the blogsphere is eating your lunch guys. You think that because the republican overseeres at PBS gave you a sweetheart partnership with NPR that you have a real media presence? Bullshit!
You guys didn't earn it on your own and the minute the spigot is turned off you guys will be back to your previous levels decrepitutde.

Look in this era you either have the balls to call an ass-kicking an ass-kicking or you get out of the journalism business. Santorum is dangerously out of step with the PA base which has taken an enormous percentage of the casualities of the war, relative to say Utah or Kansas, and they are sick of all the self serving lies that pass for  rhetoric that are the staple of modern Washington DC. 

While Ridge was nice enough to cover W and Cheney's ass with convenient terror warnings in the firs term, while he was HSA head, he like Christy Whitman and other true Republican moderates are tired of being the president's fluffers, and running interference for the lunatic fringe that is the core of the W/Cheney faction in the party.

If you guys at slate asked the hard questions and covered the disaster that is this administration and thier toady Congress as aggressive reporters did in previous eras, there would be no false consensus that their is some kind of even remote public support for what is happening and you wouldn't have the "surprising" angry revolution where now some 40 house seats and 8 Senate seats are now vulnerable.

If you assholes had been doing real press reporting, maybe this shit could have been turned around years ago as the adminsitration was forced to address these problem while in office. A novel concept I know for a sitting republican president, but hey you got a try it at least once. Weakness in leadership is the inability to admit you were wrong and to change policy. Cheney and W have this in spades. And you guys in the media should be shooting fish in the barrel telling us this story in the endless graphic detail provided by these guys day to day actions.

You think its an accident that Frist's kid and the Bush college crowd are completely out of control drunk partiers? It's the family values they learn at home that gets them this way. You guys should be making these guys eat crow for pitching their bogus rhetoric.

How do you all look at yourselves in the mirror in the morning?Wow, never thought that I'd see the phrases "self-help" and "Machiavellian" in the same sentence.  I might have to check this book out.
Two cheers for Dave Lamberti !Do you get the ladies with titles like that?can i comment here?

edit--fuck yeah!Nowadays, we expect that the richness and depth of the print content will be leveraged more and more through online media. Online text readership is expanding phenomenally. Pressmart (www.pressmart.net) gives readers a truly global perspective on the world's events, by delivering the widest selection of full content newspapers to readers anywhere, anytime with the latest technologies like Web, RSS, podcast, social media etc. &amp; above all it allows users to download, store, read and manage all of our newspaper and magazines issues with any operating system.way too much of a title....lol, i'm in the fraternity. these guys got kicked out.I came to this subreddit to see if it was just me. But now the notice seems to be gone? Wtf happened?Still an issue for me.  It is cookie based though so just run incognito and you can reset the 5 articles I've been noticing more and more ads over the years--eventually making it hard to run on my phone. I suspect that they're in financial troubles, but I doubt this'll help.I came here to say the same, I just unsubscribed from all podcasts. They are not behind the paywall, but the links and related notes are, so it's only half the experience now.
Ya, I just read this today. No more Slate for me.That should of course say CORNISH slate.. lol.. couldn't find a way to edit the post! Go back to T_DGod this strip is depressing.  I know that's what the author is going for, but damn...pull yourself together!Do you mean "jerks" to other commenters here, or are you laying out a prohibition against pointed negativity in general?   I don't ask rhetorically--it's your sub.  For instance, I'd love to castigate in detail the pompous, one-note gimmick hire that Slate has put in charge of the comments platform, long impoverished since the demise of The Fray.&gt; Do you mean "jerks" to other commenters here, or are you laying out a prohibition against pointed negativity in general?

yeah no, that's a good thing to clarify. i just don't want people calling each other dumbasses. Think cocktail party rules. Ultimately, we're here to enjoy ourselves. everyone can be disagreeable (heck that's a part of the fun), but not abrasive and continuously so. "i think you're definitely wrong," versus, "get a load of this dumbass."

right now, things are so small that i want to just keep it informal. do test the boundaries. worse i'll probably do is poke you and go, "be nice!"

&gt;I don't ask rhetorically--it's your sub. 

honestly, i'd like for you to think of it as yours as well. i'm under no illusions however and realize that in the end, I hold the reigns. but i'm very much open to what people end up making of it. if a community comes and very much enjoys being abrasive, i might just give away the sub to those who would appreciate the forum as a place to be abrasive towards one another haha.

&gt;For instance, I'd love to castigate in detail the pompous, one-note gimmick hire that Slate has put in charge of the comments platform, long impoverished since the demise of The Fray.

castigate away. while i'm not sure what the fray is, i don't think i've ever seen a comment board on any news site, slate included, that wasn't trash. it's interesting to me that none have adopted a reddit styled board. i dislike disqus a lot... so many terrible design choices..May I ask what drew you to moderate a subreddit on Slate Magazine?

The Fray was Slate Magazine's original and I think (I'm biased) nonpareil comments platform, from Slate's inception in the late 1990s until it was shuttered in 2012 or so in favor of the insipid current model, largely consisting of conformist social media-style slogans and drive-by exchanges.   &gt; May I ask what drew you to moderate a subreddit on Slate Magazine?
&gt; 

it's not so much about the moderation as much as it was about my desire to find somewhere to occasionally post articles that i fancied to an audience of like minded individuals. slate had a clear left of center bias this cycle, and i appreciated that as that is my orientation. 

When I came, unfortunately the place was cluttered with spam. i asked for modship to do janitorial services. 

we obviously don't get a lot of people to begin with, but maybe that'll change if it looks less abandoned haha.

This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/billion_to_one/2013/11/dmitry_itskov_2045_initiative_eternal_living_through_science.html) reduced by 87%. (I'm a bot)

&gt; Even if Itskov doesn&amp;#039;t reach his final goal of radical life extension via avatars, the amount of attention he&amp;#039;s bringing and money he&amp;#039;s investing in neurotech research have many people excited.

&gt; Last month, the publication hosted the Neurotech Leaders Forum, which one attendee described to me as &amp;quot;Like a dating service for researchers and venture capitalists.&amp;quot; This year&amp;#039;s Aspen Brain Forum focused on accelerating translational neurotech: moving research from lab, to prototype, to application, and finally to market.

&gt; As Bonsen recently told MIT News, neurotech analogs to Biogen and Genzyme &amp;quot;Are being born or blossoming now.&amp;quot; Boyden and Bonsen&amp;#039;s MIT course, &amp;quot;Neurotechnology Ventures,&amp;quot; is intended to &amp;quot;Seed the Silicon Valley of neurotech,&amp;quot; as Boyden put it.
