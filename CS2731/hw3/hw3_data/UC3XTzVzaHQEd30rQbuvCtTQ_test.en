So I managed to get onto the waitlist last week for the June 17th show, and I'm only going to be in New York for one Sunday so I made sure to stay up till 4am where I was to get on it. They said that they'd get back to me in 5\-7 working days \(or by June 13th at the latest\), but the anticipation is killing me \(and it's been 6 working days\). Would anyone who's gone happen to know what the chances are? I have two ballots in \(for my friend and I\) Thanks so much for the help! So excited to \(possibly\) see him in real life!!! #Official Clips

Trump could literally commit treason over and over again and over a third of Americans wouldn't know about it, because all they watch are Sinclair owned channels. If we really want to fix this political system, we must start with an Anti Propaganda Law that would forbid Fox News from broadcasting falsehood and present those as facts.Anyone notice that on Sunday's (6/3/18) Episode it was the first time (in my knowledge) John ever commented about what happened on the "Now This" segment with the parliament speaker. Normally he just goes "moving on" and goes into the topic, but this was the first time he's ever said something about it. I'm sure this has no meaning and is just something that happened, but I just noticed it and thought it was interesting. Does NRA acts like a cult? Three months ago I posted a comment in YouTube John's segment of NRA vid "NRA is a cult like Scientology" ... I mean NRA is an  evil cult like the Scientology except Scientology pretend itself a religion while NRA do lobbying and mobilize it's "cult" members to do harm... So that it gave Gun Companies a lot of advantages. 

But i think i got trolled in the reply section, lol....#Official Clips

So The UK will be getting 5 min of GG reading boring Yelp reviews. I don't laugh often but my god, I thought that was hilarious. 

Do we have access to all 5 min? Thank you!Last night we learned that after years of questioning his sexuality, he came to terms with who he is after visiting The Rabbit Hole.

During the Venezuela episode we learned about clubbing days "2.5 Kilos of Meat" shirt.

Then of course there's the events of the book.

Pence's rabbit has led a rather exciting life.Hey, I’m an Australian resident. A long time dan of John Oliver, love his work and his commentary. Sadly being an Australian I can’t actually watch much of any of his stuff on YouTube. To put it in perspective the Mike Pence skit is the most recent one that is actually viewable in the country. I’m tired of getting burned out by fake YouTube videos that have the first five minutes then irrelevant stuff, are there any links or anything to help us in the PAL region? 

Ideally not illegal but to quote John Oliver quoting Taylor Swift:”look what *you* made me do”How do you think John's reacting to this right now given his history with FIFA?Hello! US Citizen staying in New Zealand for two months.  I notice that I'm not allowed on my HBO GO account while I'm here, nor am I able to watch the features on YouTube.

Here’s my experience for anyone hoping to do it in the future.

My friend and I got there at 3pm, and there were already 4 people ahead of us in line. The 1st pair had got here at 1.30, and the 2nd got here at 2pm, so we were pretty happy with our chances. 

By the time someone from the LWT crew came out to take our names (which was about 4.40pm) there were about 15 people in the line. She made clear that even if we got into the building and right up to the studio and even if we actually sat down, none of our seats were guaranteed. She also said that she didn’t like having people from New York and the tri-state area on her list because they have a chance to join the lottery? We were already talking to the couple ahead of us who were New Yorkers and we all agreed it wasn’t very fair because we all spent our time queueing but that was that. 

We all had to write our names on a clipboard - Name, Email, Where we’re from - and we were told to come back at 5.30pm and join another queue. At this time the couple at the front of the queue actually managed to get tickets because of a cancellation so we were 3rd and 4th in line! By the time this was all over it was 5.15pm or so, so we just hung around and joined the new designated queue. 

We were in this queue until 5.50pm after most of the folks with tickets were granted entry, then we were called to enter the lobby and went through security. We waited for another half hour till we were finally allowed through the elevators and up to the studio, which was amazing. Absolutely worth the wait. 

There was a warm up comedian and John came out at about 6.50pm!!! Wanted to ask a question about the bugle during the Q&amp;A before the show but didn’t get called, it’s okay though, just hearing him speak was so cool. He messed up part of today’s piece at one point and said “fuuuuck i’m so sorry” and redid it which was so cool to see! He also does little dances at his desk during the intro theme and other clips with music and is absolutely adorkable.

Today was father’s day so we know that it probably played a big part in us being able to get in for the show, and I think all in all everyone who waited outside with us was able to get in! Amazing experience.Are they really making children swear, like the obscenities used in this week's ending song about China? Is that allowed? It seems questionable morally, is it being dubbed over or somethingDoes anyone have any idea why the soviet flag is on jinpings balls?I'm predicting the ad they will make this weekend. I don't really like how the number is awkwardly long thought.

(Edit: That's not the only thing I don't like, obviously I don't like or approve of any of this mess because I am a fucking human being.)Well, I think Johnny will have a lot of things to say this Sunday night.

It is really bad that this administration decided to leave the Human Rights Council and basically reversing 70 years of U.S. policy as a leading super power to protect human rights...

Now China and Russia can basically lead the world to a darker place....

On the other hand, Trump signed an E.O. to let illegal immigrants unite with their children.... For years I've hoped at some point Oliver would touch on the topic--a main story--about aid-in-dying/assisted suicide (not to be confused with euthanasia). There are a lot of documentaries and a great Frontline episode about this. RIGHT NOW it's not on the front burner, but it is an important issue that people are afraid to talk about. It's one that I've had personal experience and relationships that have succumbed to it, and it's sort of the hill I'm willing to die on.  #Official Clips

     Let me preface this by saying that I'm not some right wing, conservative crazy person. In fact, while I claim to be an independent, I find myself agreeing with the Democrats far more often than I do with the Republicans. 

     I'm a long time fan of the show and when this video popped up in my YouTube suggestions, I watched expecting it to be nonsense and that may be what it is. I'm certainly not an expert on the subject of Venezuela. However, I thought that the video, if it's not starring paid actors with entirely fabricated stories, made a pretty compelling argument that Last Week Tonight was being dishonest with its viewers. Again, I'm not making that claim, the video is claiming that. 

     I was hoping someone more knowledgeable on the subject matter could straighten this out for me because I would truly like to know. This would drastically change my opinion of John Oliver and his show if it's true. The only thing I know for a fact is, either the video I linked is lying, or Last Week Tonight was. Thanks in advance. i used to watch it not so legally , but whoever uploaded the episodes stopped uploading them, how can i watch it legally?I want John Oliver to cover how hard it is for newly graduated people to get a job nowadays. How companies are abusing "entry" level jobs by requiring 2-3 years exp a degree and the wanting to pay you 12-14 an hour. This seems crazy to me how are you ever supposed to pay student loans off with this sort of income.There are several elements to these cases that not only show how No-knock are constitutionally questionable.

" Recreational marijuana use will soon be legal in Canada after the Senate passed a "historic" bill on Tuesday with a vote of 52-29." -CNN  


" Canada's Senate gave final passage Tuesday to the federal government's bill to legalize cannabis, though Canadians will have to wait at least a couple of months to legally buy marijuana as their country becomes the second in the world to make pot legal nationwide." -LA Times  


Well... good job, Canada. You beat the U.S. again.  There's a lot there to delve into. The individuals named in the paradise papers leak are interesting enough: Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth II, Rex Tillerson, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Bono, assorted oligarchs and criminals, various heads of state...What a tragedy. Yet Trump seems not too concern until he post his fucking tweet: " With thoughts and prayers". I guess he is gonna say it every 2 weeks by this rate if he can't adjust the issue.

And i bet those conspiracy rats like Jones is gonna say that is fake, crisis actor.... whatever the hell they would say with their filthy mouth.  

Wonder what John would say this weekend.

Anyway, RIP. That is all i can offer.I've been on a John Oliver YouTube marathon lately and just finished watching the Credit Reports episode. I wanted to see if those sites still worked and they do. Well done.Hi, I was wondering if anyone else in México also have this issue. I saw the Mexican Elections bit on Youtube and I liked it, I thought of sharing it with my wife in order to laugh for tomorrow elections. I went back to Youtube and realize that it doesn’t have any spanish subtitles so I sign in to HBO Go and looked for the episode and I didn’t found it, I thought it was being uploaded to HBO Latam and in a couple of day I would be able to see it. Fast forward to today and it still no time to see the episode Online. I tried on all the devices I have that can run it and I can’t find it. I don’t know if it is my account or a problem in general.

Thanks for taking the time to read this!I recently found out that my sister is homeschooling her son (my nephew). We live in Canada and this is not common here (that I know of). Anyway, she's using curriculum from Project Freedom Academy (the name along made me cringe) and they seem to be getting all their school materials from this place: https://www.apologia.com

and it seems to be teaching creationism as science to me. and I'm literally devastated. I think teaching children this is borderline child abuse and is setting them up for a really bad future when they enter the real world. 

creationism being taught as science should be outlawed.I’ve been obsessively refreshing my email for the past two days hahaIm beginning some research on a paper, and i somewhat remember an episode when i believe it was congress who would mad dash to vote for people who weren't at their desk or were away sick.

I was long enough ago i have forgotten too much about it, does anyone happen to know the episode I'm referring to?I was watching "Coal" segment again and I noticed that his clip of Hannity making lewd jokes is kind of taken out of context, because, apparently, Hannity was imitating Bill Clinton. On the other hand, John cites "Blood on the mountain" as his source, and that movie also took the comments out of context (although, the clip of Hannity is shorter, so I guess they had some additional footage that they gave to John). I always find John to be very credible, so I am hoping that the editing of that video wasn't his fault. What are your thoughts? Can somebody ressure me?[John Oliver Warns Meghan Markle What She's Getting Herself Into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Huab6p5HW0E)

He doesn’t bring it up anymore and I can’t find news on it!Anyone with any idea how long HBO GO users will wait for the premier?Whatever the Smash Mouth equivalent of a Rick Roll would be. He did that at the end of the segmentI loved the end of the show, but John talked over alot of the choir's singing and I would really like to listen to the uniterrupted song by them. I was able to successfully submit the form to the March 18th showing, and only just realized at the bottom it says you must live in NYC or surrounding areas to attend. I listed my Boston zipcode. Does anyone know if I will automatically be rejected because of this? I feel like a complete ass for not noticing. So I applied for 4 tickets for the March 18th show and I was planning to bring 3 of my friends along. But my issue is that a couple of them are 17.

Remember when it felt impossible for Trump to win the elections?
Okay I know this is not really possible, but in an alertnate reality situation. What do you think would happen if he wins?I was planning to see the Season 2 just now, and he spoiled the reason to watch it (how Jack dies). 
Well, I guess I'll not watch This is Us anymore.
Thank you John!I certainly laughed, but immediately felt bad, because after he burned out on acting he got into car racing and ended up with a few concussions that resulted in him [not even remembering being in Malcolm in the Middle.](http://people.com/tv/frankie-muniz-memory-loss-malcolm-in-middle/)

There's a good chance he had a bad AF toothache, and he's not Malcolm anymore in any way. Not a big deal, just a note...Denmark had a independent comedian running for election in 1994. Every television debate, he would troll the whole thing with promises such as:

- Tail wind on all bicycle lanes
- Nutella in the army's field rations
- "8 hours of free time, 8 hours of rest, 8 hours of sleep"
- Prettier christmas presents
- Renaissance furniture in Ikea (no, it's not Danish...)
- Mid-sized disability benefits for anyone without a sense of humor
- Standardization of vacuum cleaner bags
- Mobilizing a famous 19th-century wooden museum warship for battle
- The right to be ugly, stupid and rich.

The voters loved him and he got stuck carrying a decisive vote in parliament for 4 years.

So John, be careful what you volunteer for. **This guy is the reason our army had Nutella in their field rations for 16 years.**

If I were an Italian, I would definitely vote for him.I can’t remember anything but the punchline “Before Times Now” instead of Last Week Tonight.

But, I'll say it seems so.Regarding workplace sexual harassment, I am thrilled to see that it's being brought up and will hopefully change people's views. But something quite backward I noticed is that he makes it seem that only women can be sexually harassed. 

As a man who has been [sexually assaulted](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/8z5m4v/my_sexual_assault_story/?utm_source=reddit-android) this seemed awful. While there is a huge disparity between men and women in terms of sexual harassment. According to [this study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/media-spotlight/201505/when-men-face-sexual-harassment?amp#referrer=https://www.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s), over 1/2 of women and around 1/3 of men have been sexually harassed. Only 1/6 of reported sexual harassment cases are from men which shows that men are more scared to come out about sexual harassment. 

We need to stop acting like men are always the harassers and women are always the harassed. Every single news show seems to act this way, from CNN to Fox. What do you guys think?It’s the one where John is interviewing two people and keeps running between the rooms to speak to themDear John Oliver,

Please do an episode on Bangladesh. What we have here is autocracy in the name of democracy. There are no oppositions, police, armed forces all are in ruling party's hand. The government is unbelievably corrupt. We have no say here. Media is constrained here. All the tv channels are owned by ruling party leader and newspapers and independent writers are hunted down if they publish anything against the government. The ruling party goons - chatro league, jubo league, shromik league etc are mercilessly  putting down any movement with the help of the law enforcement. They slow down internet, close down mobile network whenever any movement occurs. On August 04 the ruling party goons have attacked the high school students protesting for safe traffic regulation. They have mercilessly injured and sexually harassed the minors. There are some allegations some kids have been murdered and raped. We are desperately in need of international attention on violation of human rights here. We are helpless.

1) You can definitely line up well before the 4pm it says on the site. Definitely and you should
2) The literally exact spot to line up is under the small door tented with the “Last Week Tonight” overhang for standby, facing the water. People with tickets should just go right to the CBS entryway for assistance
3) They did ask for locations but in this case did not alter the order or omit, to my knowledge, anyone who had been waiting in line

There are still lots of young, intelligent hard working people here that don't want to give up and simply go searching for jobs in Norway. But the current government - voted in by simple people that have fallen prey to populist propaganda on promises of increases to state pensions and government salaries - is on the precipice of ruining 20 years of hard work.

Can you please investigate the peaceful protest on the 10th Aug, the actions of the riot police; and the political history of Mr Liviu Dragnea in respect to him pushing for a change in penal code simply so he can escape a conviction and stay out of jail. Hopefully some people in the European Council watch your show and help us out.

We love your show and the way you cover topics in depth. Your coverage of Hungary, that is confronting a similar situation, raised awareness and is the first step towards stopping this worrying trend.

 EDIT 4: Coverage by EuroNews: [http://www.euronews.com/2018/08/30/why-is-rudy-giuliani-attacking-the-romanian-president-](http://www.euronews.com/2018/08/30/why-is-rudy-giuliani-attacking-the-romanian-president-)Why else would all three shows be off the air. At the same time. Again.

I swear it happens every time. I almost forgot to check the daily show today figuring it was going to be the case, and it was.

I think these guys all coordinate their vacations so they can join up with John Stewart and work out plans to attempt to save us all from ourselves.

Or at least drink the world away...He’s not on again until September and this whole Manafort/Mueller thing just lit up. It’s like he just knows it’s so huge that he needs a running start 😂I think the one that really made me realise is when he called E-Scooters the “dan cook of transportation” and I just realised that I know a very small amount of the people he’s talking about in his 1 liner references. Lots of people rail against the media for being out of touch with the average American and I feel like John constantly talking about movies, TV’s and actors is just proving them right, in my opinion he needs to tone down the amount of jokes like that because they’re annoying, forced and go over anyone who isn’t a complete movie nerds head. I’ve still very much enjoyed everyone of his episodes since 2015 but these are forced and add little to no value to the content &amp;#x200B;I only remember him having some "Johnny O's fish facts and cancer." Any help?Edit: I've Googled quite a bit for this and the results are overwhelmed with a bit he did about being Johnny Trigger Warning (funny!!), but it wasn't what I am looking for. I remember being informed about the situation/existence of trigger warnings by John Oliver over a year agoHas John ever done anything on Rush Limbaugh? Would love to see a takedown of this nutjob.Hello fellow dingos, after waiting 3 weeks for a flag, we have a fully functioning John Colander ready to take over last week tonight.   He has 30 phrases including the ones you'll hear in the video (some suggested by you glorious people), runs off an arduino that controls the LEDs and an adafruit wave trigger for the sound. The LEDs are a flexible array of WS2812bs and the whole thing runs off 4 AA batteries.  
The next trick will be getting Last Week Tonights attention to see if I can send him to John (twitter, his agent and facebook will all be used). Hope you enjoy, Go get those geckos!

I am subscribed to HBO via Amazon Video, but the episode isn't up.  
  
EDIT: It's out on Amazon Video now, thanks for the suggestions guys!Yes, I said twin. There’s only one of them running back and forth really quickly. Clickbait/Hot take title aside, he is the perfect person with the best platform to do an expose on Scientology and really hold the celebrity Scientologists who turn a blind eye to the tragedies caused by this cult accountable. Leah Remin is doing an amazing job with her Emmy winning show that is receiving great ratings/critical acclaim. Most of you have probably already seen HBO's Going Clear and if any network can take on the litigious avalanche surely to come John's way, it's them. That fat coal mining squirrel fucker's lawsuit is nothing compared to the wrath of David Miscavige. 

But I think the difference between Going Clear and Scientology: The Aftermath is Oliver has a much bigger platform and wider demographic. He also has the younger demo which will take to social media and cause a PR nightmare. Every show he does also gets picked up by voluminous media outlets and they won't be intimidated reporting on it knowing that they will have the numbers over Scientology. Many of LWT main stories have raised awareness and been the cause for social change on a few different issues since the shows debut. 

I know he's a 'nice guy' in Hollywood akin to Steve Carrel and may not want to attack any celebrities like Tom Cruise but put your money where your mouth is John. You always talk about how you aren't afraid to take on the biggest of corporations in the U.S. and abroad (FIFA is the perfect example. His show aired a year before the FBI made their bust. I'm sure he had some influence big or small on their investigation) so lets see you do the same to Scientology. There is so much corruption to cover but his writing staff is amazing at picking out the important bits and breaking them down for the average person. IRS, Shelly Miscavige, Sea Org doing work for free for Tom Cruise (I'll give Cruise the benefit of the doubt on this one), The Hole, Disconnection... need I go on?

Going Clear also killed it in ratings and awards so this episode could secure him not only another another another Emmy but something much bigger than that. And for the cherry on top, this is an apolitical issue that everyone can agree on. Not to mention the lives he could potentially be saving by 'waking up' Scientologists or celebrities involved with them. 

I wish there were a way to reach the producers of the show but I'm hoping one of them reads this sub and will bring this up at the writers meeting for next season.I was in the middle of the NRA video when it clicked to "unavailable". It wont show in their videos list either. Was curious if anyone else noticed this.I was very surprised to see a LWT video on my youtube feed, it was a 12 minute video but halfway through, it said the video was unavailable. 

Any chance they fucked up and this might have been Sunday’s video since they removed it so quickly? (edit: i have now realized it is an old video being reuploaded)

I have no idea about their filming schedule or anything like that so i could definitely be wrong. 

EDIT: seems to have been re-released and I was able to watch the remainder of it. https://www.revealnews.org/article/they-thought-they-were-going-to-rehab-they-ended-up-in-chicken-plants/?utm_source=Reveal&amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;utm_campaign=twitter

TL;DR oklahoma is using unlicensed "rehab" in it's drug courts, and several of these "rehab" locations are actually just using the people that were sent to them as free labor in chicken farms.  Additionally, if one of these "workers" gets injured, the rehab location is filing for workers comp for them and taking the money themselves.#Official Clips

So there has been a post in Trump reddit that "criticizes" the Trump video of John Oliver, I found it hilarious

(link her https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/48fp8q/the_definitive_guide_as_to_why_john_olivers/ )

However I've noticed that it has gathered around 996 upvotes, even though it has been archived now, I thought that it deserves an answer, so I will try to refute their critics as simple as I can 

- That intro was cringy, tbh I know this is not really related but man it is a bit cringy, but let's continue to the so called "Discrediting"

- "Going Over The Qualities That Makes Trump Appealing" this heading literally just about dissing politifact, it just claims that it is a liberal press but no relevant critic about the qualities 

-"Apparently Jokes Are Lies" the same old its just a joke thing, of course people can joke about anything, but however a nominee of a president name attacking on a comedian/journalist is not just a joke 

- "He said / he said" has Trump appeared on any critical shows, more importantly, Colbert and Conan has claimed that despite their critics they would be honored to have the president. So claiming that Oliver lies is just irrelevant and aimed to defame

- "Campaign Financing" suprise suprise, no editing is required to make Trump look bad, even his Twitter is sufficient for that

-"Saying He’s Not Self Financing Is Retarded" , firstly saying that "making money from an election money is badass" is just cringeworthy, secondly the answer to this is kinda simple, it is not  the action, it is that him saying he has spent 25 million, or as Oliver stated it "If you wanna know the difference, try telling your wife you bought her a present and you loaned her a present"

-"Doing A Better Job Than Bernie Without Trying" Oliver clearly not saying that it is false, he suggests that it is taking the attention from the whole funding process, so Trump's statement sounds like Trump doesn't want money but people send him the money, but hey as shown his website literally has funding button

And why does he have the donate button then, of course he can't advertise it because of the "I'm ritch" portrait he draws, but again his whole arguments are about covering the donations

-"Oh You’re A Tough Guy I Know" can't believe this guy just receives sending your hands pictures to a journalist is a good thing, lol

- "Apparently Lawsuits Are Never Necessary"
Just this https://www.google.com.tr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkir22wPfWAhWIPZoKHU3oDNIQFggmMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FStrategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation&amp;usg=AOvVaw1smtyp1IZ8bt8l3AGXSAdQ

Lawsuits "especially by public figures and major companies" are also being used to supress people, just think that crazy coal guy threatened suing John Oliver

- "How Dare He Compliment Himself" 
A presidental nominee should have better qualifications than "Self-praise" . Also it is an indicator of a super-ego

Also, please can someone show me a clip that Trump uses a good vocabulary, I'm a non-US citizen and even I can talk better than the portrait he draws 

-"Muh Debt"

" A small loan of a million dollars" - Donald Trump

And Ivanka's story can be out of time but it is credible and a solid evidence, tbh it's one of the small group of things that you can say solid,credible evidence

Also still doesn't change the fact of multiple bankrupcies

- "Let’s Argue About How Many Billions This Guy Has. That’ll Show He’s Unsuccessful" 

" Trump has claimed to be worth $10 billion, it’s true" it must be soo true, but I don't wanna attack to the source just like the post did

Also ,first thing Trump stating that his feelings are part of his estimate worth is insufficent and ludicrous, because yes his public statements one way or another affects his estimate worth, but if he's not going in to the trouble of explaining this and he shouldn't have said it in the first place

- "Pfft What’s The Trump Brand Anyway?"

Firstly, in Trump's statements there is an image of never failing business man and that's why it is important to show his failures, secondly before the  crisis , creating the mortgage company was jumping off to a bandwagon and not the move of a genius because no crisis or at least an economic crisis happens out of nowhere, it shows signs, now reading those signs are hard but again not hard for a genius, that explains what to gather of a man who establishes a mortgage company

-"Wait I Thought The Brand Wasn’t Worth Much?" 

This is not an insult, the thing is brands and companies does stuff that is inconsistent with their public image, think like this Apple has this cool hipster image however their products made in china (Trump alert lol) which is neither cool nor hipster. 

It is the same case for Trump, his public image is a man who builds things, which can lead to the idea that he builds everything with his name on it, suitable for a company however unsuitable for a presidential candidate

- "These Investors Are Not Babies"

making an implementation that those investor are crying babies is cold, also the claim starts with Trump's name meaning succes and then brings people that shows "No, not always" 

Real estate failing is not Trump's fault, however still calling for investors like it's not gonna fail is.

- " The Housing Market Caused Some Problems Believe It Or Not" 

I don't see any discredit to Oliver in here , it continues to show that Trump name not always means success 

-"Still More Crash Stuff"

"because Trump is an idiot right? "

Well I don't wanna say yes as an author of this article, but personally -at least for the character he portrays- FUCK YEAH

It doesn't mean that he has the blame and that is the point, the  false portrait of a man that will not have a blame on stuff

- "Wait So Is The Brand Good Or Bad?" 

This is clearly stating out the portrait, this part of the post literally criticizes Oliver for being objective 

- (”Flip-flopping” But Not Really)

Yeah Trump doesn't Flip-Flops, and magic exists

Just like him stating that he has no problem with Transgender people than trying to ban them out of the army

- "Muh Racism"

Firstly, that title is so cringy, can someone search that this is not written by Trump himself.

Well when KKK endorses you you are doing some stupid shit, thats the limited case of stupid shit check, and Trump claiming that he doesn't know who is KKK or what is white supremacy is also an another stupid shit check

Also the thing is, at that point , was it that importent that a personal contact has happened

-"More Racism"

Oliver doesn't claim Trump to be a racist for not associating with white supremacy, but calls on the bullshit for doing it much later than he should have (I know another instance of this , happened at Charlotesville)

-"Um Those Views Haven’t Changed John"

There is no claim in here

But hats off, because author has honestly brought up a subject that he doesn't agree with Trump

-"Never Said Kill"

It doesn't matter , usage of the word "kill", same defence has been shown when people were protecting him over the Comey saying that "I hope" is not a comment

Firstly implementations does matter. 

And again, prisoning the families of terrorists -unless they are personally involved- is against to the quintessential point in the modern law which states that "crime is personal"

- "Admission of Defeat"

This so-called admission of defeat is  a thing that should cringe every Trump supporter because it just tells regardless of these uneligible qualities, people still will choose him

- "One Of The Worst Jokes Is What They End On?" 

It is not an argument that they had a difference name, what is in there is a joke, creating another portrait of him, a portrait that is consistent with the entire segment, which states two portrait

Donald Trump : A successful modern businessman 

Donald Drumpf : A businessman with his failures. A person who makes arguable statements and secretly and/or openly supports racist statments. 

"So do me a favor guys, shove this info down their throats when they get here." 

The post has started with a strong cringe and ended with a strong cringe , now that's what I call consistency (My critic started with calling an irrelevant pointing of cringeworthiness, and ended with one LOL)

Result:

Now, first of all I would like to thank to the author of that article for making a research and creates a counterargument to Oliver, despite my criticism I respect him for doing that. Because when we have this kind of media , it's hard to see a counterargument which is worth enough to discuss, I hope that the author will comment on my post so that we can discuss furthermore in a peaceful and humorous environment

It is really possible that I have made some wrong points in my post, but the thing is the entire point of that segment is that a presidential candidate should be like and how Donald Trump is not it

Why I have wrote this post is that, especially now it is also important to see how has Trump started and how has he continuingHello lwt community.  I am trying to find john Oliver's joke about trump's pronunciation of peurto rico.  He compares it to claiming to love italians and says "spaghetti" funny.

I know its a dumb post.  I've rewatched several half episodes and have had no luck.  ThanksI was under the impression that he did a new show every week but it seems to be posted randomly. Like only 2 shows for September? There wasn't a show last night. How do I find out his schedule?#Official Clips

[John Oliver's worst heckler experience](https://pagesix.com/2018/01/12/john-olivers-worst-heckler-experience/)Oliver wanted to discuss the, ["minutiae of prison reform in the Midwest"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euaGS3tPRBw) of the 19th century.

I even checked HBO's schedule till end of February and couldn't find the show. Anyone here know when it'll be premiering?Net Neutrality 3 perhaps?America's Pravda (aka Fox News) is completely out of control. They're making Breitbart and Alex Jones actually sound somewhere around the vicinity of sane. We're always talking about giving unhinged people platforms to spread their nonsense but as of now, the crazy have taken over the asylum and the whole operation is based on propaganda, from the news division to the opinion division.

And even though it's clear as sunlight that the government is heavily capitalizing on it (and maybe even participating) the f*cking stupid media is too afraid to do a deep dive on it; they just hint it here and there while sounding extremely petty. And the worst part is that people are too dumb and they're falling for it.

Help us, John Oliver-Kenobi. You're our only hope. Hello! I've been a long time fan of John Oliver ever since the Death Penalty bit. I just found out I'm going to New York from May 6th-13th so I'm dying to get tickets to see Last Week Tonight filmed.

Just wondering what day of the week is it usually filmed and what time? Hopefully I'll be lucky enough to get tickets while I'm thereIs there somewhere else to watch them commercial free, ya know, considering I sorta-kinda-little-bit pay for them on a monthly basis?I don’t think our Democracy has been on life support this much since probably The Civil War. The “Nunes Memo” is gonna be released before the end of this week and of course there’s already been the shit storm with Trump not enacting the 99% approved sanctions on Russia. I’m sure more heinous dictatorial shit will happen before Oliver gets on the air like Trump [firing Mueller](http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/371352-red-alert-warning-trump-may-fire-mueller-soon) (which should be astounding, but unfortunately is the “new norm”). I hope that that they decide to just go on sooner before there’s too much “information” to cover in 30 minutes. I love John Oliver, and this spring, my friend and I are traveling up to New York City for one of his shows. Has anyone ever been to his tapings? What are they like? (I assume 50x better than the YouTube videos.)Just a reference to John's rants.

You can find it at around 2:50.

https://youtu.be/RrItRBsmH4UI'm trying to find the episode but I'm having trouble, and can only find clips of the joke. He's wearing a purple shirt in it (if that helps), and it's one of those jokes where he says a person's name, then gives them an epithet.#Official Clips

I’m thinking of starting a petition to have John Oliver have a bit part in The Inspectors.

This is either a hilarious idea, a horrible idea, or both.

Think anyone would sign it? Think it’s worth setting up?For the past year, many things has happened and been said about the DNC and I find it odd that John Oliver has been silent. With all this new information and rampant misinformation out there, I would imagine he would've said something about it. I may not agree with what he says but I would like to hear where John Oliver falls on this topic.over the past 6 or so episodes... it feels like the show is getting lazy. Alot more cheap and "dumb" jokes. The show used to be much more smarter and didnt explain basic knowledge to people... like do we really need to explain what catalonia is. Anyone that watches this kind of program you would think keeps up with that kind of news. The show used to have real world impacts which I havent seen happen for a while now. 

Just feels like there pandering to a bigger stupider audience.I was hearing about a compilation of Tucker Carlson in one of the last few episodes, and I want to send a link of it to my (moronic) friend who thinks Tucker is like, the second coming of Christ.#Official Clips

John talks about something, then a half naked guy only wearing trousers appears in the top left corner, while laughing John tells the director hastily to "put it down, put it down". Then, instead of the picture being taken down, the guys pants are moved down. 

Anyone know in which video that was?Most of John Oliver's YouTube clips have things, like food waste, chicken farmers, and useless pennies. He points out things that are wrong in America and I feel upset that there's not much I can do. I am still In high school but would like to help out. I feel like most of his topics are government related and I can't really help out.Fox news?

The NRA TV thing seems counter to anti censorship.  Where is the best place to watch Seasons 1-3? The news section that takes up the first 10 minutes or so I’m not too worried about since it’s not current anymore, but I wanna see the main segments of each.

I know the YouTube channel has a ton, but I’m curious as to whether it’s *all* of them. If it is, I guess I’ll slowly work my way through them but if there’s a more succinct and cleaner method I’d prefer that.

Thanks!Pacific Trade. I'm not sure he's really covered it in the past with TPP etc., but with the annoying orange having another episode, now would be the perfect time. I understand TPP was quite controversial, but I'm sure the average joe has done squat in terms of research on it. John and his team have done better than most in the mediasphere in terms of condensing extremely nuanced topics in an entertaining manner. There were a lot of benefits to TPP in terms of how it would slow China's plan for global economic dominance. A lot of its neighbors would become more reliant on the U.S. over time. 

Now, China is furthering trillion dollar global infrastructure plans to increase their dominance in the Southeast and even west of their borders. Trump's isolationist fuckery isn't just patently stupid economically, its expediting what should be a very big concern for the U.S. economy. Not just in terms of dropping in global status, but the thought of increasing reliance on China's currency should scare the bejeezus out of any economist. Idk if any Last Week Tonight interns scroll this page much, but I hope the team recognizes the opportunity regardless. [This](https://imgur.com/noNR6Ap) is what I'm referring to.

That's it. $79,788 spent on a joke which was totally worth it. This, obviously, doesn't include shipping to New York or Anchorage...So I'm not sure if this totally fits here but I know John Oliver has done some stuff on prison reform.
I was recently thrust into the world of prison phone companies. They charge a huge amount to place phone calls or leave messages and generally this falls to the person receiving the call since the inmates hardly ever have money on a pre established account to make calls. 
It seems like an area of prison reforms that's way over looked. A $10 convenience fee on top of a $1/minute to talk on the phone seems like a little much. If not unnecessary and definitely devastating to low income families.#Official Clips

John says that comment is racist. Since most rapes of white inmates are statistically by black inmates (see Human Rights Watch report, 2001), then how was that joke racist?Hey,

I can't remember (or find) the episode in which John Oliver said something like: "..that might actually be a little offensive to Hitler. He must think: What do I have to do?"
I think it was about a comparison who gets the title of doing the worst stuff, I can't remember who was compared to Hitler here, tho. 
I hope someone can let me know either the date on which the episode aired or some other info. Thanks!Did that piece bug anyone else?  I don’t mean about the scumbag, but the way they portrayed him.

1. He judged the shit out of his challenge coins. Those coins are a long standing military/government tradition. Most members of the cabinet (not just this one) have those coins to give out to subordinates as a sort of “attaboy”. If john just took five seconds to research challenge coins then he’d figure out its NOT an abnormal thing to do. Being that zink has a military background I’m sure he wants to keep up the tradition.

2. John tried to play the stolen valor card by saying he wasn’t in OSB and captain Phillips raid. All zink said was that he was in the unit that did that. I think zink figures not many people would know about seal team 6 (devgru) so he wanted to list devgru’s accomplishments.  Which by the way devgru is extremely hard to get into most seals can’t get into devgru. They’re a tier 1 organization like delta force. If he was in that unit for ANY period of time he did some shit. They’re constantly doing missions in places we’ve never even heard about. 

That’s not to say I want to glorify devgru they have some real issues. https://theintercept.com/2017/01/10/the-crimes-of-seal-team-6/

Not listed in that article was the murder of a green beret over him finding out devgru members were stealing money.  

Honestly John should do a piece on these guys because it’s something most military members think needs to be addressed.

3. Having a geology degree is a qualification. Yes he’s saying dumb shit, but you can’t deny he has a degree in geology. It seems pedantic. That degree qualifies him to say he’s an expert. John should have stuck with the fact that Other more qualified experts disagree with him.

4. Instead of spending 15 minutes talking about how Fink is “weird” why doesn’t he just talk about how zink is ruining national parks. Because he hardly fucking mentioned that part. That’s why I hate zink, the other stuff is just a witch hunt. Talk about how hat land is being taken from us, that’s our land, we share that shit. Talk about how he’s a shill for oil. Not about his fucking challenge coinsSorry if this has been answered - I’m on mobile so can’t use the search function.#Official Clips

Ne never build up Kavanaugh's case. He started with the assumption that Ford's words are too be trusted and Kavanaugh has not a single Argument. He straight out lied, when he "debunked" Kavanaugh's argument "All four of Ford's witnesses do not recall this party". He argued one of the four "Belives in Ford's accusations" as proof against Kavanaugh. That's straight up trickery and dishonest. That doesn't debunk his argument.  


John Oliver should be ashamed to go after Strawmen. I am looking for the part where John Oliver says "Somewhere! It ends somewhere!" in response to the tired old argument "Where does it end?" when people dismiss suggestions.

Must have been one of the more recent shows, but I just can't find it now. #Official Clips

Can anyone help?The media here, including "Folha de São Paulo", "Veja" and "Globo", is desperate because they know they will lose their privileges and free state money (in fact, most of their profit comes from taxpayer money) if Bolsonaro is elected, they've been attacking him with all kinds of fake news such as saying that he beat his ex-wife, which was denied by her, among many other claims and statements taken out of context to make him look racist, homophobic or accusing him of hate speech while all he's doing is saying what the brazilian people wanted to say for years. 

 In fact, we have been suffering for 13 years with the populist socialist government of PT, but of course socialism only works until the taxpayers money run out, and now we are in the greatest recession ever seen on this country, not to mention the absurd amount of politicians from their party as well as allies, that are being caught in OP Carwash. Bolsonaro is simply a family man, ex-military patriot and christian who wants to rescue this country from the dirty hands of communists and globalists, he has no fear to say what needs to be said instead of the old "I will end crime and corruption" populist speech that caught brazilians all these years, and the leftists use this out of context to attack him. They are always trying to make it look like he is against minorities such as the LGBTQ+ community and black people, calling him a ditatorial fascist, nazi or any other bad labels they can think of because this is how the left works here, convincing people with pretty speeches in order to suck some money out of the government and maintain their privileges.  

This is the strategy of socialist leader Lenin, "Accuse them of what you do, label them what you are", the are COUNTLESS videos of leftist candidates such as Haddad and Ciro Gomes being actually racist, homophobic or xenophobic, but those are completely ignored by the mainstream media. Jair Bolsonaro had 8 seconds of air time on tv for this election, the only reason he can be popular is because of the internet, people come here and realize all the crap they see on tv media is actually fake news, because our candidate speaks directly to us on platforms like YouTube and prove the falsehood of such news, as well as other people who dig deep to find information on him, and simply cannot find anything bad.  

Here is a CLEAR example of fake news: around [11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsZ3p9gOkpY&amp;t=685s) in the video the translation says "I wouldn't rape you because you are not worth it", but it's actually "I wouldn't rape you because you don't deserve being raped", you can ask any brazilian for a proper translation, and here is the context: this woman is defending a minor who kidnapped and gang raped a teenager girl with his friends, she is LITERALLY accusing him of being a rapist while he tries to argue in favor of his proposal of chemical castration for rapists, proposal of which the woman is against, obviously she doesn't actually care for women being raped and only wants to put labels in Bolsonaro, always contrary to what he says even if it means supporting a rapist.  

Anyway, I just want to ask you guys from outside to be CAREFUL about the kind of things you're spreading regarding Bolsonaro, it seems all of your knowledge is based on what our mainstream media says to the outside world, and that vision is definitely not the vision majority of us have from him, so please, check before commenting fake news. This country WILL NOT SURVIVE another 4 years of socialist corrupt government.﻿ any insight would be awesome, or just speculation It was a youtube channel that posted all the smaller segments of LWT but I can't find him anymore.

DOES ANYONE HAVE A LINK TO THE SMALLER SEGMENTS FOR THE PAST 3 WEEKS?! =( What episodes are the props from that Oliver put into the box at the end of the Rudy Guiliani episode? I recognized the bud lite lime from when Blatter resigned, the salmon from salmon cannon, and the mug from Net Neutrality II, but what was the book from or the doll he is carrying?

Can anyone ID the music in the Hannity mid-life crisis segment? Can’t find it anywhere!
Thanks!I don't know if the staff reads this sub, but I would love for them to do a take on leaking information from the government. 

Every organization, even the most secretive like the Mossad or CIA, leaks information. Sometimes it is intentional, to sway public opinion or neutralize a pending threat, and other times it is a result of a hodgepodge of reasons from [office politics] (https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Marwat_Farhan), to whistle blowers (like Snowden or Dan Elsberg), and beyond. Despite the outsized impact some leaking has done to the standing of the government, like COINTEL or Iran-Contra, it has been prosecuted in a very limited way. But that started to change after 9/11. 

Starting in the Bush era, the executive branch has taken an exceedingly broad view on state secrets and enforcing disclosure policies. Secrecy became tantamount in the fight on terror and the DOJ was tasked to find any legal end to deny FOIA requests or congressional inquiry. Obama expanded on these measures and increased scrutiny over internal leaks, prosecuting more unauthorized disclosures than any of his precedents. Yet, as noted in David Pozen's "Leaky Leviathan" (Harvard Law Review) 


&gt; "First, and most significantly,
&gt; even though the Espionage Act of 1917 and other statutes
&gt; broadly criminalize the gathering, receipt, and dissemination of
&gt; national defense–related information and even though every modern
&gt; President has decried the practice, an enormous amount of leaking to
&gt; the press appears to go unpunished. The federal government has
&gt; brought roughly a dozen media leak prosecutions in the ninety-six
&gt; years since the Espionage Act was enacted, eight of them under the
&gt; current Administration. Available evidence suggests that civil and
&gt; administrative sanctions are only marginally more common.

Leaks are not all one in the same. There is no question that Snowden's intentions are different than, say, Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear (the DNC hackers). But both have been used to leverage against America, as Snowden stays in Russia. Then there are hazier leaks, like the recent leak to WAPO in which [U.S. officials disclosed their knowledge of an active NK nuclear production site] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-spy-agencies-north-korea-is-working-on-new-missiles/2018/07/30/b3542696-940d-11e8-a679-b09212fb69c2_story.html?utm_term=.5988617421ea). On one end, it could be argued that without the slapdash scrutiny that Trump's administration would be hesitant to act, but the lack of foresight could ruin covert ops used to collect information.

Trumps administration has been no stranger to leaks. Aside from the numerous books written by former employees, the various footage of Trumpian indiscretions, and Stormy Daniels, Trump has on several occasions leaked classified information to hostile powers (anyone remember Sergei Kisliyak?). 

Than finally we get to the Anonymous NYT Op-Ed. Many have called the author a coward for leaking this, while others have them down as a hero. It would not be wrong to say that folks like Glen Greenwald have made a career from leaks and [incentivize insiders to leak] (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/reality-winner-nsa-sentence.html).

Thoughts?

Edits: Words and linksSorry if this is a question with an obvious answer but I'm not American so I'm not familiar with American TV scheduling.

From what I have heard they can be shockingly incompetent.Even verified youtube accounts are jumping in and let off a barrage of insults and fake news accusations in portuguese. The like dislike ratio is now 45 % to 55 %. Am I missing something? Was the episode in any way bad or inaccurate? Or is this just happening because I think it is?I recently became a huge fan after binging LWT's youtube channel. However, I found out that the actual episodes are somewhat longer.

So, are the youtube clips enough or should I stream entire episodes? And how are they different content-wise?I wanted to see if John would be interested in doing a segment on about Mandatory Arbitration and how the Epic Systems Corp v Lewis affected a majority of employees working for companies due to the majority of big companies including arbitration clauses in their contracts virtually 100% of the time, and how Trump signing FOSTA/SESTA into law may have led to companies such as Facebook/Discord cracking down on users (in Discord's case, adding mandatory arbitration to the ToS).

I've seen that most normal Americans haven't noticed these sorts of decisions and I feel like it's important that Americans know why mandatory arbitration stifles the threat of lawsuits (such as sexual assault/harassment eg FOX and Bill O'Reilly, Discord covering itself by updating the ToS with an arbitration clause, etc) and after the Epic Systems Corp v. Lewis case, most people need to know that their legal rights are being choked out of them.

I'm also interested in seeing if anybody else knew about these and what you think; barely anybody I personally know has any knowledge about this.I think he should have the integrity to explain that choice, but I wanna make sure I didn't miss anything.Yep. It happened. We elected someone who openly brags about:

- beating gay people up until they "straighten up";
- defending a military dictatorship;
- paying women less 'cause they're less intelligent and less productive;
- loving Trump;

We are so f*cked up. This entire phenomena of people self-sabotaging their democracy scares me. Mexico, Brazil, the Philippines, Brexit, Trump...

As a 33-yo gay man I feel a little bit scared. But I will not bow down. This is the dawn of the resistance. #Official Clips

The rest of the show talked about how we should distance ourselves from our icons after new information has come to light. If anyone can point me to the episode that would be amazing.My favorite was probably about the Confederacy or North Korea.It's gaining traction with lawmakers, but not enough! 

Fuck this practiceI've watched this show since season 1 (i think my first episode was the third), and feel it's become another Trump-centered late night. I'm not from the US and I really enjoyed how the show focused on interesting and important topics whith some humour. But I no longer feel they try to do a different show than other late nights -the in-depth part of the show takes fewer minutes every week. 
Sometimes when I watch LWTWJO I feel like I'm watching Colbert with british accent.
I know for americans (and in another degree, for the rest of the world too) Trump is a big issue, but come on, it's not the only one!In exchange, as a Brazilian, i will give my opinion on american football.I live in Brazil, so i don't know how things works in USA (well, i don't even know how things works here in Brazil), but is the decision final? We lost the battle for good?I remember it being an episode where John urged people to vote, he showcased 3 elections and 1 of them had been won by a man who only spent a small amount of money on his campaign ($50-60 I think), he didn't even tell his family he was running for some office, and I remember John saying "there's lowkey and there is ...."   
  
He also showcased a woman saying that he won because his name was the first on the ballot and he had a traditional male sounding name. 
That's all I remember. 
I've scrolled through all the videos, tried watching every one of them that had a name that sounded like it might contain that segment, but couldn't find it.I kind of want there to be a LWT web exclusive about the banned word list the Trump administration gave the CDC. John Oliver doesn't even have to say anything. I just want to see someone of note sit in the same horrified stupor I do every time I remember that ACTUALLY happened.

Edit: Some sources report that rather than the Trump administration banning the words, CDC officials elected to not use them in budget documents, for fear their use would damage the chances of funding. Even if this is the case, I am no less horrified. When the show ridicules say CNN by showing what they aired on TV, how do they do it? Like doesn't that content belong to CNN and can't LWT be sued for it? Can anyone explain the legality of such a process? And can I just add a CNN clip in my monetized YouTube video like the show does?

Edit:
[Full interview ](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/07/591457135/john-oliver-finds-humor-in-the-news-no-one-wants-to-hear-about) In "Scandals" episode, the one where John compares Trump's and Clinton's scandals, at one point he says "Hillary didn't want to use government address to send all her emails, so instead she sent everything trough a non-government email account. She is, however, not the only one to have done that. Others include Powell, Kerry, Bush, Christie, Perry, Jindal etc."
Well, my problem with this:
Apart, from Powell, none of the others used personal email accounts to send "everything" ("all of their emails"). They used both personal and government accounts. I really don't get his mixing these up like that. 
How do you understand his claim? Am I missing something? Reading this book, eery similarities....almost as if the show is responding to the notions of the book. I can't really find any reference about it though. Is the connection between the two known?

For example, Chapter 7 is titled "Now...This" which of course is used it the precise way described by Last Week Tonight.# Official Clips

Roll Call has a playlist called "Congressional Hits and Misses" which is basically a collection of odd or funny things overheard by congress that week. Anything from weird sounds, funny quips, prop malfunctions, out-of-context stories, and bizarre words repeated multiple times in a speech. I fell down the rabbit hole and it felt very similar to "And Now This".In some segment, John brought up Nixon, which (for whatever reason) raised some applause from the crowd. John then actually responded to their reaction, asking in shock, "Cheering for Nixon? Wow, times have changed!" or something along those lines. I can't remember which clip it was from, though. Does anyone remember, by any chance?It'd be a good time to go over it.[This is the last episode until April 1!](https://twitter.com/LastWeekTonight/status/975108354669498369)

Apparently it's available on the fire readers, but not the old school ones. 

Any idea why, or when it might be available for other readers?The book showcases the dark side of big data. It touches on some topics that John Oliver has covered: the marketing of payday loans and for-profit colleges, recidivism models used to determine bail and prison sentences, and credit scores and their bastard child e-scores, used improperly in contexts like job recruiting or insurance.

As a preview, [here's a chapter of the book on recruiting: personality tests](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/01/how-algorithms-rule-our-working-lives), credit scores, automated resume readers, and pervasive discrimination galore!Really enjoyed seeing this discussion live last night! While it was not focused on John Oliver, his role as moderator and undeniable charm were two of the many things that I loved about it. Nell is brilliant and has been a part of several shows I love including LWT! 92Y has the full 60 minute conversation here: https://twitter.com/92Y/status/976239725479473155 Check it out!Hello Everybody

I remember an episode where John Oliver made fun of a (I believe it was spanish speaking) TV show with ridiculous overlays covering the entire screen and changing like every second, but I cant find it anymore.

Is there someone who can help me out?Hey everyone! I have been thinking about this part of an episode for like a week and I have no clue where it is. It's a video of a reporter messing up the "Last Week Tonight" name, and saying something along the lines of "Last Week Tonight Week Tonight" or something like that. John then put an animation of the new title with the "extended name". I'd greatly appreciate help if anyone knows what episode this is from!Any idea if they are going to touch on this subject anytime soon? I would really like to hear John's input on this, as well as seeing a more objective view of the situation. Especially with well documented sources.
So...every now and then i tend to find short clips of videos from LWT show, that acutally never are/were on shows official Youtube channel.

Can somebody explain me where they come from? is there more to LWT than what we can see on youtube channel?

example is this channel where a lot of stuff i see was never on shows i saw on youtube:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoD8kzdMUY8Has John ever taken a big Oliver-esque stabbity stab at the crazy personal taxation system in the US in comparison to countries that have a PAYE system, like the UK?

As a Brit it blows my tiny mind the annual sh1t the US taxpayer has to do to appease the IRS overlords in comparison to our never having-to-worry-about-it-and-by-the-way-your-healthcare-is-covered-for-less-tax-than-the-amercians smug, British way of life.

I feel for you guys and I'd very much like to see John rip the whole thing to bits and expose the crap show you have in comparison to other countries.Did he actually drink a BL Lime, or was it apple juice? There did not seem to be much carbonation when he slugged it down. But, then again, I wouldn't know the carbonation levels of BL Lime, as I would never drink that which looks like donkey piss filtered through a used gym towel.

John is the 🐐 either wayI knew it all week.  I knew there wasn't an episode tonight, and I managed to forget all about that this morning.  Be honest with me, who else did this happen to?  It'll make me feel better.Hi all,

I'll be in New York on the 29th and was hoping to go to a live taping. But every schedule I can find online doesn't seem to list any episodes past April 22nd.

So is it going on hiatus? Is the season ending? Or have they just not updated it yet?

Appreciate it!the lady from Princess Buttercup's nightmare in *The Princess Bride*. I can't stop hearing it now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drKfbbBu05w

I've Googled the hell out of this with no luck.  Is there anyone here who's been to a live taping of the show, getting your tickets via the official online request form?   I'm trying to find out what the turnaround time is for notifications if you're SUCCESSFUL.  (I'm assuming you hear nothing if you fail).

I'll be in NYC on June 1 but currently flying out before the taping begins.  Ticket requests for that day don't open until 2:00pm on May 8.  I'm willing to eat the airline change fee if I could luck out and snag a ticket, but I'm curious how long I'd have to wait to be notified if I was successful?  Yes, I know the odds of getting a ticket are low.

So, if you were successful, how soon were you notified?  24 hours after entries opened?  7 days later?  14 days later?I mean, he did have that volcano and all#Official Clips

Pack it up, we’re done here. I got a question about the latest episode (could not be able to watch it since 
1: I am in Australia, 
2: We got the wrong foxel go package (Why the Drama and not POP?). 
3: Each episode gets aired a week after it is aired in the US.

The major thing is.. Is there any news station outlets in Australia that have got coverage about the "John Oliver Chlamydia Ward"? Which so happens to be one and a half hours away from where I live..
Examples of actual News outlets (7News, Sunshine Coast Daily, Courier Mail/Sunday Mail, 9News, news.com.au (or any similar company)).

Horray! for these sites!

 More ComingAs a Reddit user, I've only glanced at this subreddit and was astounded by the the sheer amount of genuine witty fans that adore this near-sighted parrot's half hour lecture series, but after watching last night's episode and the final act featuring the Koala Chlamydia Ward, I couldn't help but realize that behind the apparent joke, some fans were absolutely **terrified** about John abruptly shutting down the show, and I have to wonder, if LWT truly ended, what would be the subreddit's parting words for the show? Perhaps expand about how you ended up watching it and why you can't live without this rat-faced bastard? I have my reasons but I'd luv to hear from this subreddit first. So I was trying to find Last Week Tonight on my HBO page through Hulu, and it wasn't on the front page so I clicked on Series.  I didn't see it immediately, which made sense that it wasn't before GoT or Westworld... or Barry... or Sex in the City (?) or the Leftovers (??) or Entourage (???) or Girls (????) 

Get it together HBO.com!  I know it's probably not your biggest money maker, but at least it wasn't cancelled in 2004!John Oliver seems to have conveniently left out discussing the very important meeting between the two leaders of the Korean peninsula. It is a milestone in world politics and diplomacy and John Oliver, who seemed so worried about North Korea didn't even mention it in his episode yesterday. 

Begs the question why? 

As much as CNN, Washington Post and other newspapers would like to claim, it is very evident that this Administration (note the use of the word Administration and not Trump) played a very important role in bringing the two leaders together. 

Did he not discuss it because even he knew he'd have to end up saying something nice about the current government? Given his fierce criticism and an opposition stance, that would seem like a U-turn and maybe he thinks he'd lose fans. 

If he was as neutral as he claims he is, he would've mentioned this and maybe even credited the White House for its efforts here. 

Shows that no matter how neutral comedians pretend to be, they only want to talk about stuff that would get them more viewers. Nothing wrong about that, just don't pretend that you're not like that. Be open about it. 


TLDR: John Oliver didn't talk about the two leaders meeting because there was no way for him to do it without saying something nice about Trump and he doesn't want to do that. The weekly segments used to come out each week on Monday morning but after 2017, it'll go months without anything and then they'll drop all at the same time. Is it because I'm Canadian? If so that's discrimination and I DEMAND JUSTICE!I can only find the Giuliani bit. 

Thanks!I sincerely believed this was the last episode. I was feeling so empty inside. Then I came here and saw that you've already figured out it was a massive joke and that there are more episodes coming.

John, you funny bastard, don't play with my feelings like this!Hello, I have been searching for an email address to write to Last Week Tonight, and couldn't really find one. How could I write to John Oliver and the LWT team? I really don't want to put what I want to say in a Youtube comment.I ordered my Marlon Bundo book and I read it. It then sat on my shelf. I thought about it for a while and I was thinking about what to do with a children’s book.  Since I don’t have any small children in my life I decided to give it to the public library. When the children’s librarian saw the book, it was like I had given her gold. 

The library was only able to order one book for the entire county. Now my public library had a book and plans on displaying it and having lots of story times with it. 

So if your Marlon Bundo book is sitting on the shelf collecting dust, please consider donating it to your local library. [Radio commercials](https://youtu.be/natZ84lcRso?t=29s) promising large profits without spending anything have become common.

As soon as I read it I wondered whether LWT might be up to more shopping. One can only hope.  I reckon with a bit of makeup, Tony Blair could easily be reused as a passable Joker.GOP, Trump are only possible due to a sophisticated propaganda network echoing false information, while fading out correct information. The government gave the broadcast frequencies to private TV stations under the condition that everyday they would provide public, neutral, unbiased news to the public and fulfil their role as a public information channel allowing everyone to become informed citizens.

Instead, we get Fox News and a misinformed electorate.

John Oliver, you and your team should pick it up!A year ago John dedicated an episode to kidney disease and life on dialysis in the United States,  and inspired me to look into living donation. After months of testing and planning, I'm one month from donating my kidney. On June 13th a stranger somewhere in America is getting my left kidney, and I never would have known that this is possible or started this process without that episode, so thank you Last Week Tonight!

https://youtu.be/yw_nqzVfxFQ Which episode does Oliver do an impersonation of Trump saying "China?" He really draws the word out, does anyone remember what season/episode that is in?Is it just me or does anyone else get to the end of each episode thinking "when are they going to dish the dirt on **that** court case?"

It seems like an eternity since (I think it was at the start of this series) John told us that Mr. Nutterbutter would be back to tell his story...

Have the producers forgotten about it?The whole ending monologue really, but that Zazu joke killed and I had the same second laugh as the audience when we all realized en masse that John actually is playing Zazu. John’s beak jokes will no longer be just about his nose!Sorry to make r/BritishMonarchy leak a little, bit I would get such a kick out of hearing John Oliver’s take on it. #Official Clips

Thanks and praise be! I've been trying to watch it on Sky Atlantic (I'm in the uk) but it isn't showing up anywhere.

Is there a rights thing in the UK or has it gone off for a bit?Trying to figure out if I'm crazy or not, but he seemed kind of off... Rest of my family agreed.Can someone tell me the episode where he made fun of that weird ode to joy video that won a contest in europe?For those who saw the episode thread I briefly had up, that was a goof, sorry!

https://twitter.com/LastWeekTonight/status/998207415429554177I know there’s a new one coming this Sunday. 

But even prior to this past Sunday there was loads of news to cover. 

I don’t mind that he takes breaks. It just kills me cause everytime he does, shit hits the fan big time. He has a very similar long form humorous exposition / informative comedy style about real world topics with a sarcastic sense of humor like john oliver, as exemplified in some of his YouTube videos:

Corruption in public art in Mexico: https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=ETgcJ8wmV3k

On the decline of Mexican Cinema: https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=2jYhgNuZ3Ik

Whitewashing in latin american advertising: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P6yFag_tpUo&amp;feature=youtu.be

And much much more.  Check them out.  They’re especially funny if you get the latin pop cultural references. Also check out his other youtube show El Pulso de la Republica.I love Last Week Tonight, and I watch it on YouTube in replay. But I was wondering if there was a way to know when the episodes are going to be released ? (As there are not released on a regular basis on YouTube) #Official Clips

&amp;#x200B;It's True![https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x36h4qn](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x36h4qn)Apropos of nothing, does anyone remember which episode John reacts to a clip (inevitably of something to do with Putin or the Russian scandals) by saying "cool" sarcastically, but in Russian? It's bugging me and Google results are elusive.  


EDIT: Thank you :). I figured this subreddit knew way more than I did!I think there was a period where this season felt a bit weak but after the hiatuses in July and August he's brought it back. Some of the best are Mike Pence,Rudy Guiliani, Prosectuors, Stupid Watergate II, ad Felony Disenfranchisement 

Some of the best moments are the Bundo book, packing up the show, and the recent segment about the mice. Late night comics seem to have the best schedule ever. Two and three-week breaks are scattered throughout their broadcast season.

TDS had a two-week break in July, and then another in August, and does 160 episodes a season (granting the show never has episodes Friday through Saturday, which is 156 less days a year, but then another \~60 days are scattered throughout as breaks).

I am always checking out the FF wiki to see when the next episode is airing because their schedule is not regular enough to tune in on Wednesdays (or, uh... download the show Thursday mornings). Bee had 39 episodes her first season, which was 13 weeks she wasn't filming, or about three months. Her show was cut to 33 in season 2, and this season is TBA. 

Oliver's first season had 24 episodes, then 35, 30, 30, and this year, another 30 episodes. That's 22 weeks he isn't on camera.

&amp;#x200B;

I am NOT complaining about a lack of comedy.

&amp;#x200B;

I am simply curious about the scheduling. Is is the networks, the hosts, or the hosts' managers who decide how many episodes there are in a season? Someone else? Do hosts, cast, and crew get such frequent breaks to prevent burnout? Did Johnny Carson have a similar schedule?

&amp;#x200B;

When the hosts are off, are the crew also on vacation? Or, do the networks have other crew gigs for them?It would be interesting if you could talk a few minutes about the "Hambacher Forst" in Germany since it is a good example how a whole region is being shaken by the coal industry  and how companies like RWE as well as politicians are doing little to nothing to chance anything about how things are done even three years after the Paris aggrement.

Video is in German but it should be pretty clear what´s going on.I think the children skits are the best, the D.C statehood song and Sesame Street child of incarcerated parent are the two best ending skits of the show #Official Clips

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks, LWT!I have no idea how to tell someone from John Oliver team about this so maybe someone here can tell them and they start a conversation about it.

Last week Telltale games shut down and layoff most of there Employee without warring. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/telltale-games-layoffs-winding-down-operations-2018-9

It so bad when you think about the fact there no Union for the Employee in the Video Games Industry.

in 2016 all voice actors in  Video Game go into big strike

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSoOF0rbsCA

and still because there no union.

I'm not an expert in this but as someone who see all this stories of "The BAD Employee situation in the Video Game Industry" someone big need to talk about it and bring it to the mainstream.

I can recomman a guy named Jim Sterling who talk a lot about Video Game Industry and how much it unregulated it is. 
https://www.youtube.com/user/JimSterling

and that beside other things Video Game Industry like Loot box which "unregulated gambling" and more

I hope someone here can send this to John Oliver team

I'm hoping that this reaches the desk of the last week tonight writers or John Oliver.  Hope it helps... https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Tk5SpAz0w7UMgbh5gO4VlSNMYrsTwwGKWXBm_GTrA4/edit?usp=drivesdkParticularity John's take on the "who gets to decide what needs correcting" piece? It's a good question and needs heavy consideration but  he seemed to be implying that people born with deprived sensory abilities (deafness) and people born with conditions that cause a host of related medical issues (achondroplasia) don't have genetic problems.

Both I and John Oliver wear glasses, we have poor vision, and while our poor vision is a minor inconvenience I can't imagine he would want his child to grow up to have poor vision. What I'm saying is I imagine we can both agree that living in a world where children by and large don't need glasses is a good thing, and if we can agree on that I imagine we can agree that living in a world where children aren't born blind is also a good thing.

Side note: I thought his take on the Chinese genetic scientist also seemed off. He's a scientist trying to alter the human genome for the better; did you really expect him to be concerned about the ethical ramifications of not letting people be born with a genetic illness?Have you ever looked at state by state laws for sale and use of fireworks? Its nutsMy views on human gene editing are same as my views on abortion. Her body, her choice. When the science has it figured out to the extent where the there is almost no chance of the process fucking up then I quite frankly don’t give a damn.

Culture changes over time, technology influences this change, why should we stop this? Because it would be a detriment to the community of people born with the same disability? That just doesn’t sound right to me. This honestly just sounds like “we shouldn’t give parents to option to make sure that their kids are born with all five senses, think about the deaf people”. 

Am I understanding this right? Am I misinterpreting something here?

EDIT: Phrasing.Every so often John Oliver dedicates some time to a country that is about to have an election which an American wouldn't have foreseen as interesting but it is interesting once John Oliver has made the case that it is.

But I didn't follow up, so: Which countries were they again, and who won their elections? And since I won't remember names, who was it in terms of John's portrayal of them?

Also in a way, that whole train thing was a huge waste of time and money but... i think it was really meaningful. just some fun and kind things going on in the world. we need more of that :) We need more cool stuff like that for "small cities" everywhere.

only thing i wished was actual ways to deal with corporate mergers. at this point... i don't think it's possible to deal with it anymore. a politician that goes against it is going to be in huge trouble and make some very very powerful organizations/companies/people really mad.

replacing the current politicians who are willing to oppose the powerful probably wouldn't work. (if you love your family, you probably don't want to anger powerful people).i love the concept/potential of big businesses and the increased efficiency resulting from corporate mergers. i think in some situations it's worked fine or great but in most situations, it's dangerous as fuck. extremely dangerous.well technically google owns youtube and youtube owns a lot of other stuff. he also mentioned google.

as for video hosting... there is competition... i think. maybe...

Crunchyroll is a subsidiary of Ellation, which belongs to Otter Media owned by AT&amp;T and The Chernin Group.

[netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix) is also not owned by anyone else i think.

[vimeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimeo) is also not owned by google i think. (Subsidiary of IAC) or something.

fb is also a competitor of youtube/google. instagram owned by fb tho i think.

[snapchat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.) is Snap Inc. which isn't owned by anyone i think.

so google, fb, snap inc, vimeo?, and netflix. kind of competitive i guess.

also there's a bunch of other video hosting sites out there that may host things with clear copy right infringement.that's some dirty stuff. pretty much all soda/energy drinks/drinks is owned by two companies. filthymy fav moment lol: [horse thingy](https://i.imgur.com/DYBSVHa.png)Best thing I've seen all day.Oh God, he's covered in glitterMaybe Trump meant Steve Scalise? Even then, he's a Representative.Man, flavor town sounds fucking awesome, sign me up.I seriously doubt he knows the difference between senators and representativesWas this the season finale or is there another episode next week?This episode was good, I rate it yellow rectangle.

(Also, I wonder how long it'll take to get that reaction gif.)PSA: WE GOT HIM!!!

The monkey screech at the end of the law and order sound made me laugh harder than I should’ve. 

TL;DW: tax code ~~re~~unformed, as well as junk science as garbage as some forensics based convictionsI binge watched  The Good Wife over the summer, so Josh Charles turning up for the CSI segment killed me.Scalise was released from the hospital at the end of July. Trump was just lying.You certainly could. Let's disregard whether or not we really have jurisdication on the matter and just assume we do.

Well....the first big problem is reciprocity. The US minimum wage and labor compensation is worse than some nations in Europe that US airlines fly to regularly, like maybe, Denmark or say, Britain. Now, immediately these countries are going to compel US carriers to comply with local regulations. How do you compensate a pilot who flies to England on Monday, Japan on Weds, and China on Friday? How does vacation time work with the differing regulations? The 1944 Chicago convention, an international treaty we have signed already specifically require countries to not regulate airlines this way. 

The bigger problem is equipment. For instance, the FAA requires aircraft to have maintenance work signed off by a licensed A&amp;P mechanic and mandates certain intervals to have certain maintenance work done. This is not uniform between countries. Does the FAA now have to regulate all the foreign repairshops? How do you know they are complying with US regulations without checking? We already have this problem, albeit limited, with US carriers outsourcing heavy maintenance work to El Salvador and Hong Kong. And we can demand these carriers to open their maintenance logs. If an airline incorporates in Somali and wants to fly in the US, how do we check?

There's certainly ways around this, but it's not as simple as just requiring foreign carriers to comply with US regulations. And there's not a pressing need for countries to solve this issue. Simply put, the Chicago Convention works fine right now.I think there's another episode next week, according to a Google search results card, but it'll start five minutes later.WE GOT HIM!

I cracked up over that whole celebration bit!I’m really unsure how I feel every episode is the best I’ve seen each week. 

I look forward to this show in the same fashion every week it’s ridiculous. I am glad to see Josh Lucas Josh Charles, Samira Wiley, Shannon Woodward in CSI: Crime Scene Idiot.The official YouTube channel for Last Week Tonight is unfortunately blocked in certain countries.

Nuh uh! I'm not trusting any of the dirty cops from HR!Oh my god the acrobat!It's okay. I think that about every episode too. Except the nuclear one. That one was a disappointment. That was my first time ever watching the whole thing besides youtube featured clips tyyou're welcomeI was already laughing at the We Got Him part at the beginning but the slam dunk had me howling. I think it was because they had him run in during a wide shot. Something about that shot made it all the more hilarious to me, like as if he had just come right out of the audience. 

I don't know why John constantly riffs on his bangs; in fact, I thought he looked better and younger with them. Now he looks like about 5 different politicians, Mnuchin being one obviously, but with his bangs he looked like the long lost Beatle.

Oh, and I'd legit watch that version of CSI. Or basically any show with the gravity of a procedural crime drama but with the lead being straight out of an NBC sitcom.I got Jordan Klepper vibes from him in the CSI thing.Loved John's bangs, he looked adorable with them, now he looks older and more serious. Unless that's just the Trump effect.His segue to tax reform is so dry and perfect.Surprisingly, this was one of the few segments where I enjoyed the ending skit. That being said, I hope we get a reappearance of the Catheter Cowboy before the season finale."This video is unavailable."I don't have it on video, but one of the phrases is "Colander, a kitchen item you know so little about you didn't know that I'm not a colander. I'm a tea kettle"  as suggested by reddit. it's the forehead right? i think it's the forehead. 

seriously though Jordan Klepper plays that overconfident idiot character so well lol. Although there was just a front page post about a sheriff dog accidentally shooting a gun that had just been confiscated, so, maybe the dog did do it.

I'll keep looking for it.

Edit: Couldn't find it, but did find: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/27/a-dog-shoots-a-person-almost-every-year-in-america/

&gt; This past weekend, a chocolate Labrador retriever named "Trigger" accidentally shot an Indiana woman in the foot during during a hunting trip, according to news reports. An Indiana woman had left her loaded shotgun on the ground with the safety off. Trigger stepped on it, inadvertently pressing the trigger. The woman took a shotgun blast to her left foot at point-blank range.

&gt; After getting patched up at area hospitals, she is expected to make a full recovery -- joining a short list of Americans who apparently have been shot by their dogs, according to news reports -- five others since 2011, and ten total since 2004 [as of 2015].

&gt; It's a bit of a misnomer to say a dog "shot someone." After all, dogs don't pick up firearms with the intent to shoot something. But they do end up inadvertently pulling a trigger from time to time.

&gt; When you have a country with as many people, guns and dogs as we do, this type of thing is going to happen from time to time. It does happen elsewhere too. For instance, a French hunter had to have his hand amputated in 2012 after his dog jumped on him, setting off his shotgun. A New Zealand man was shot by his dog in 2010. These international cases aren't included in the table above.

So, maybe it was the dog?^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

That three of the five methods had gotten a conviction already. We know bite mark analysis would be one, I can see a guy with a divining rod being one but that leaves 2 boy detectives, a crime sniffing pony and a sack of magic 8 balls. Which one do you think it was?[Here's that report from the National Academy of Science](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf) he mentions. It is *damning* reading.

From page 187:

&gt; In most forensic science disciplines, no studies have been conducted of large populations to establish the uniqueness of marks or features. Yet, despite the lack of a statistical foundation, examiners make probabilistic claims based on their experience. [...] Little rigorous systematic research has been done to validate the basic premises and techniques in a number of forensic science disciplines.

We just kinda noticed that back in 2009 and carried on mostly as we had been before. There's [a good report on hair forensics](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/fbi-overstated-forensic-hair-matches-in-nearly-all-criminal-trials-for-decades/2015/04/18/39c8d8c6-e515-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html) at the *Washington Post*, which initially broke the story.

In a more reasonable world, one where we cared about protecting the innocent as much as we cared about punishing the guilty, forensic labs would be blinded to the evidence they were testing, and they'd regularly be sent known-bad evidence to weed out false-positive bias.None of this is admissible in court. Are you eating the murder sandwich?! Ah, now I get it! Sorry!With that cast, I would absolutely watch that show!Recently, there was a dog in Calgary, Canada that also accidentally set off a firearm. Are dog-homicides making a comeback? Great, now I can add wrongful conviction to my list of things to worry about.

Glad to see the pony is keeping up a steady career after his appearances in the [LWT season 2 trailer](https://youtu.be/P1EtSBxm0S4) and [Sam Bee's show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPve5fL2jmI).

Edit: I'm well aware that up/down votes don't follow much logic, especially in this sub, but I genuinely want to know what I put in this post that warranted a downvote. I'd prefer some constructive criticism over this confusing hit and run!Can you use audio from the show of John speaking instead of the CGV?Sounded like a joke to me but I would vote for the bite marks, boy detectives (that's reasonable plausible, like the Secret Seven) and crime sniffing pony (less plausible but he's wearing a deer stalker so he must be good).[Blocked in Canada...](https://unblockvideos.com/youtube-video-restriction-checker/#url=ScmJvmzDcG0)

No! No! Don't you dare, you bastard! I *need* this!&gt;  one where we cared about protecting the innocent as much as we cared about punishing the guilty

We (apparently) don't even care about punishing the guilty -- or we'd try harder to avoid false convictions that leave the guilty free on the streets.

No, what we apparently care about is punishing the *accused*.I streamed it on Sling TV yesterday (Monday)  morning. The problem is that the dog was never trained in how to handle a gun. :PNice.

Good episode. I'm glad the main segment drew attention to the issues with forensic science and the way the scientifically illiterate public believes it always works flawlessly. Also, I would seriously watch that CSI show... I hope someone actually makes something like it.

PS: Fuck Jeff Sessions.That's why she looked familiar!It would have broken this rule in the sidebar anyway:

For example: ^this ^^is ^^^superscript, but you'll just see a bunch of caret symbols before each word instead of superscripted text.

The mobile interface is just weird.That's the money shot./r/thathappened He learned about the Twin from Janice in Accounting. Not sure it's sudden, hasn't it been around a while?This season yeah. But it seemed to come out of nowhere Also spoilers don’t always work on mobile and are just a bunch of dead links a lot of the time True, but that's not exactly a bug compared to the desktop version - it's just because spoiler tags are part of subreddit CSS, and CSS isn't applied on mobile. Maybe once reddit implements a native spoiler tag, that won't be an issue.I know but it’s super annoying Get it? Because he's a cuckDidn't realise we weren't allowed to post mirrors. Thanks for the updateI don't think there's an actual list anywhere, but feel certain that the twins were referenced in earlier seasons..Nah, his name is actually Johnny Trigger Warning. “Last Cuck Tonight” is always an insightful show. 😛Only for full episodes. Links to partial clips are fine.It's simply a recurring joke this season, like he has done in practicly any season(such as for example Janice in Accounting)scientology also already has a decade long record of uncover stories and their followers would probably not be swayed by a 20 minute bit.

scientology is like an anniversary 2 hour special kinda projectThat CSI parody is just spectacular. Why don't CBS think about it?

btw that Jeff Sessions is unfuckable, even if you fuck him so hard, he doesn't respond to the public at all.has it been 22.3 years since they appeared on the scene? maybe olsen twins are funny nowLouis Theroux probably did the best anyone could do.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_air_carriers_banned_in_the_European_UnionThis is a fair point. I was talking about companies operating within the U.S. (not just entering) but it's probably still a valid point. You can ban them for safety reasons. You can't however, ban them for not following regulation. And honestly, it's all diplomacy. If you can pull it off, you certainly can put any requirement you want on any airline. I'm just pointing out that the standing international agreement doesn't allow it.not following regulations is exactly a safety reason.My phone interprets markdown just fine?

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/lastweektonight) if you have any questions or concerns.*My comment and the YouTube policy I speak of is about the content of the video, not the ads themselves. Companies have complained about their ads appearing before controversial content so YouTube has implemented a stricter filter and demonetizing videos. The result of this is even videos simply reporting or informing about a controversial topic, graphic content, etc can become demonetized even though they aren't promoting said topic.

But to answer your other question, yes the NRA does advertise in the U.S. and even spreads [propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnIVVWtAag)I don't think so. I think they re-uploaded the 2016 one. He's wearing the same clothes and using the same graphic in both of those results. I think they're just trying to make a point. Sadly not, definitely the same clip as confirmed by LWT twitter and John's suit and tie. It's every bit as relevant now though, if not more so, that Dickey amendment is still in place :([GIFV link](https://i.imgur.com/E4lk22X.gifv)

_^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/livven/wiki/gifv-bot) ^// ^[code](https://github.com/Livven/GifvBot)_political ads are basically unregulated here.Thanks for clearing that up! :)This clip was from 6 months ago I believe. They reposted it on their facebook page as well. 

IIRC it outlines the difficulties of changing gun laws in the USA due to lobbying by the NRA. 

I might be wrong. Please let me know if I am. Oh ok.  I have seen that one.  I though it was something new.It's available in the US nowIIRC the spain case was a partial print so I think he was being a bit misleading about it the odds of a full print matching are almost 0Did they upload this in response to the Vegas shooting? If so, nice.just in case something does not work: [part one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pOiOhxujsE&amp;list=PLOKWcH1zBl2kfnCwyyZWk5MW28lgaNa7L), [part two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYbY45rHj8w&amp;list=PLOKWcH1zBl2kfnCwyyZWk5MW28lgaNa7L&amp;index=2), [part three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVuspKSjfgA&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLOKWcH1zBl2kfnCwyyZWk5MW28lgaNa7L). Yes, but technically it's not Google but Alphabet now, and as you say it owns a lot of completely unrelated stuff, so it still seems to be an oversight considering how much of his audience comes from YouTube!

I don't think that Netflix does any video hosting? And they aren't in the advertising business?

Monopoly doesn't mean there's no competition (or even that that company controls 50%+ of the market), it means that that company can profitably raise prices and/or exclude competitors :

https://medium.com/@KingFrostFive/steam-monopoly-monopsony-40b6461b4252

Even though Vimeo and Dailymotion exist, YouTube's domination is at the point where these companies are basically irrelevant.

Some competition might indeed come from Facebook, but they only recently have introduced videos, and it's not certain that they'll be able to capture all of the mindshare (also IIRC you need a Facebook account to access Facebook content, and group/friend restrictions apply, while YouTube is open to anyone on the World Wide Web).

Snapchat is even less in the same domain than Facebook... and are they even in the advertising business?the gag where he had the wrong country on the map when referring to foreign countries was kinda funny...

Part 3:

https://www.youpak.com/watch?v=mVuspKSjfgA&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLOKWcH1zBl2kfnCwyyZWk5MW28lgaNa7LI was only 5 when Port Arthur occurred. I lived in Queensland and I remember that Howard and Borbidge were incredibly unpopular at the time, though I didn't really know why.  It's interesting looking at this with what I know now and putting context to things.

I've lived in the US (Mighigan) since 2002, and I know plenty of people on both sides of the gun-control argument.  The anti-gun control people aren't unreasonable raving lunatics, just like the pro-gun control people aren't all upstanding, rational citizens.  Is it unbearable?  No.  People are more than the sum of individual items/beliefs, and I'm sure that I have beliefs that are unbearable to a lot of people, yet we aren't butting heads during every conversation.

I *am* disappointed that the US consistently fails to pass any sort of moderating law - or even fund research to perhaps illuminate what changes could make a positive impact to the issue of guns in the US, but seeing the public reaction from 1996 in Australia, I have hope that perhaps the US is on the cusp of change.  I don't think this is the case, but it's been shown that the pro-gun lobby won't give up - even though they seem to have overwhelming control, so we can't give up either on providing what we see to be a moderating influence. That was an interesting article. I imagine he is coming from the perspective of peace maker vs peace keeper. That we shouldn't be ignoring the larger goal of solving the issues in their homelands that are causing the exodus of migration to Western lands.Read this yesterday. Here's a very similar story about a company exploiting disabled men in much the same way: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/09/us/the-boys-in-the-bunkhouse.htmlStunning job with those text effectsWasn't it first posted right after the Pulse shooting?"funny." :/Now to abuse this by changing the insert image with the latest meme du jour!There are no complications of him saying ‘cool’ on the internet. At least I couldn’t find it...I am really not completely against him. I was just majorly let down by the interview because I was missing at least one or two critical questions. Buddhism is having its fair share of problems as well.

I don't like what he said about refugees because it gives legitimacy to the idea that we are being overrun by them. Of course it is a difficult situation, but they are not the main reason why poor Europeans are in a shitty position and are concerned about "those" people taking away more from them. [That process was already ongoing before the first refugees arrived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartz_concept).Nope. Never heard of Savile before him, but I may research his story out of interest -- I mean a historic figure who was posthumously exposed to have a double life? It sounds like an interesting story.

Also, I loved how Oliver used the story of Savile to set up his piece on the confederacy. Great trick.&gt; It's a shame it is just going to be watched by liberals who agree with him anyway. 

I wasn't 100% sure on the issue before I watched the episode because I wasn't aware of some of the counterarguments (namely the explicitness of the racism in the Confederacy combined with the fact that the statues were erected as a flexing of muscles).

It is true that unfortunately, the people who most need to see this piece are almost certainly not watching it.  But it does help the not-as-far-left leaning people who were not 100% sold on the issue like I was.But...cameos at the end are kind of a common thing on this show. Whether it's Weird Al singing a song or Steve Buscemi tap dancing or that guy who I recognized from something but am too lazy to look up who played that weird doctor in the Alex Jones episode.  Is it really a "surprise" when one happens?Great episode and I didn't hear about what was going on with that NYC mayoral candidate until now, Oliver's show is informative and to the point as always.&gt;https://www.freeze.equifax.com/Freeze/jsp/SFF_PersonalIDInfo.jsp

Soo glad it looks like they ended up using their proper domain rather than the shady-looking "equifaxsecurity2017.com" domainGood jokes courtesy of John Oliver. Delivering a high frequency “funny” disabling your bullshit. You’re not going to be getting away with your crap for quite a while We need tostitos!Of course i do."the most beautiful sat down pee you ever see"Thanks for the heads up, added!Do you have any?I'll be back in Season 5, I NEED TOSTITOS!Not my thing i'm afraid.What about the movie?Very Nice. Is this available Worldwide? I live in Brazil.What is the story?OMG lol, question answered.I just recently binge watched Westworld in one day, and please follow my advice: WATCH IT!Damn it Janice!  
  
*shows middle finger*Black Sails!&gt; I've been watching Fox News waiting to see one of these

Nice try, Donald.This cowboy is a good guy version of the man in black from Westworld.Was he cathing at the time?Was John's teeth fixed in that video? To figure it out the timeline.Or "tiny fingers that look like spiders"Oh that will definitely be a topic for 2018.  
We have Fifa World Cup in 2018, so expect Fifa 3.weight i believe lolWe need to see him meeting Beyonce. That will be awesome!the famous "THEY TURN THE FREAKIN FROGS GAY" technique.Yeah how dare he create an argument by supplying FACTS i was under the impression that USA soccer team was getting pretty good over the years, playing good soccer.Indeed, here in Brazil every single kid plays soccer, rich and poor. In almost every street, field, you can see people playing soccer.fun fact: my favorite team you play against real madrid saturday, we won the Libertadores cup, the "uefa champions league" of latin america. GO GRÊMIO!Messi is not from Earth. Him and Ronaldo (both Cristiano and our brazilian Ronaldo).what was really the biggest soccer player from USA? the most memorable name i recall is Donovan, and your national team was getting pretty good.That guy was amazing, even after those major injuries, he wen't back and won the world cup with Brazil. I grew up watching amazing games with Ronaldo.Ronaldinho started playing soccer on my favorite team Grêmio, from Brazil, and we all pretty much hate him, but no doubt that he was an amazing player.yeah, they really are, they won over Brazil a few years ago, awesome team, great soccer.Thank you for your answer.  
I can't stand see Ajit's face any longer!Ajit is ridiculous, plus he now makes those "cool videos" pretty much mocking everyone against him. He only cares about his bank account.Here in Brazil, USA net neutrality took over the news yesterday. We are all hoping USA win the fight for internet freedom!John don't deserve this.Actually yes. I bought some Bud Light Lime.Damn!  
This seems to be a trick USA television uses a lot!  
  
Neil Patrick Harris is real, right?And McDonalds!John is addicted to Tostitos.6 hours, op will be missed.Tell him about r/lastweektonight!! we need an AMA with John!I'm sure you will receive an outline of John's foot anytime soon.13 hours, Reddit sends the first e-mail to OP warning about inactive account.Dad, that is Budweiser Ceo John Oliver.That was gold, omg.Yes, he did. He is actually quite handsome now, like a sexy Milhouse from Simpsons.And TostitosDamn, i miss this rat face bastard.To answer the second question, his Miss America segment [helped increase donations to some scholarships aimed at women] (http://time.com/3426950/john-oliver-women-scholarships/)Colbert's hair in the video is triggering me.or as John pointed out: old old old Sheldon.That is definitely because of John's british accent.I'm glaad for John and his crew.Fuck yeah!!!! I miss you, rat face bastard!During Trump's presidency, John should have a daily show called Last Tweet TonightI feel that I can relate to this poster.I'm excited to see the show continue.

Was anyone else somewhat disappointed when they googled "isis won powerball" to see if that was a real story?What topics, more specifically?  Adction? Gambling (thanks ea).THANK YOU!! excellent help!Oh how i miss you, John! Gotta love his sense of humour.  
  
Stephen always has the time of his life when John is in his show! So as we, but we don't get paid for it.a mix between John Oliver and Tim Cook.Lawyer of John here: the mic says Fox Sports.I know they were not the same kind of host, but John Oliver and David Letterman are my all time favorite. I'm from Brazil, and I fell in love for late night shows because of David.In Brazil, our Valentine's day is in April (I think), so, BRINGE ME MY BRITISH NERD AGAIN!you are right!

You're welcome :)

[Here's a cool interview with the person behind the opening](http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver/)I’m doing my National History day project is on Confederate monuments. And when you’re trying to use specific information text is much easier to reference.I tried, but couldn't find any so farI hate his face so fuckin much!! Brazilian here, can confirm.how about me?Hey, anybody there?and i thought it was coffee inside that giant mug.Maybe I should have linked this tweet instead:

["Join us tonight at 11 on HBO where we’ll be attempting to pack several months of news into 30 minutes of show."](https://twitter.com/LastWeekTonight/status/965253347941994496)im tired of just the youtube bit :(wanna watch him legally tho :&lt;I can, i was just wondering what the cheapest subscription was. I dont watch hbo besides him, so i dont want to pay for a tonne of stuff i wont watch.its what im trying to avoid q.qAnyone have any idea how long HBO go users will have to wait to see the premier?Well, if it's at 2 AM, then I guess I'm watching tomorrow, as I'm not staying up that late ;-;You can find entire episodes on YouTube after air. They usually are done by accounts like JOHN OLIVER! That's it's disgusting or that it could get you to run across traffic.What defendants don't file to dismiss lawsuits against them?It wasn’t a link but my failed attempt at spoiler tagging a post’s text. Ugh I can’t wait to find out what happens!that sounds pretty good!Just a quick heads up - your account has been shadowbanned. Send the admins a message via this link and they should reinstate your account:

https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.comi pay for hbo and the episode isn't uploaded so far.hbogo brazil here. DON'T FORGET US, HBO!i use hbo go here in Brazil, and it does show Last Week Tonight. Try contact the support.Thank you! That's reassuring. You might be right. Thank you, will check it out.I wonder what games Hitler used to play.I don't disagree it's a good idea, but I'm scared YouTube might be damaged badly by it. YouTube has never turned a profit and the Adpocalypse last year certainly didn't help. There is a ton of great things on YouTube that I'd be sad to see go if YouTube ever had to significantly decrease revenue for creators. Viewership isn't YouTube's problem. The problem is advertising. It would increase critism of YouTube's content policy (which does need work) and might make advertisers more reluctant than they already are to use YouTube. i really disagree. People who wants, for whatever horrible reason, do harm to other people, WILL DO, regardless of what media is consumed. You assume Jon Oliver/writers are frequently reading this sub?&gt;He can't be President forever

He will die (hopefully soon because he eats tons of McDonald's and KFC), but he could be in office for awhile. To quote John from an appearance on the Late Show "if words don't mean anything why would numbers". I use a roku to access HBO GO, and it pops up immediately on the home screen. I don’t even have to begin a searchHugh Laurie is exactly the same. I love them both!Thanks for the help! I just watched s5 e1 on skyWas reading this thread just before watching tonight’s episode. He did briefly mention it but said he and his show cannot talk about it at length yet! Was this posted publicly? Perhaps I can link to that in the FAQ&gt;As someone living with Brexit

This sounded like the start of a prescription drug ad. Lol I literally needed this 2 hours ago and I missed you response.and then Murray will sue again, and lost.HE WILL BE BACK!New LWT videos are now region locked, sadlyso no bunga bunga?My condolences. I ended up getting a confirmation at 11:59  pm on the Saturday! That was a fantastic email to wake up to!CAREFUL JOHN, CAREFUL NOW.London?

Edit: it's obviously TorontoIf he actually became PM would probably be a pro EU, center-left politician who favors drug decriminalization. Honestly? I liked the first season, but for me it has to end there.

I didn't watched the second from the start because I had the feel that S2 was forced, and basically they did cause they know that ppl watched the whole first season for Jack's death.

Since I was curious, I decided to watch the S2 anyway, and then i saw the first episode of LWT... well, I guess it wasn't destiny :'Dwe have candidates deeply involved in traffic, a few years ago a helicopter with 500kg of cocaine was stopped and confiscated by the police, to this day no one was arrested for that...
Stuff like this is aways happening here, but yeah, after re-reading my submission I notice that yes, they are very similar

Edit grammarÉ melhor Jair... bebendo até as eleições acabarem :(  
Brazilian redditor too and yes World, we are fucked.*punchs desks repeatedly*  
"welcome welcome welcome to Last Week Tonight"The worse is that there is no hope, not a single politician that is acceptable, so yeah, melhor Jair bebendoMaybe, and this is a long maybe, Doria?  
I  told you it was a long maybe.A very very very long maybe
This argument is stupid and arbitrary, someone could even say that a spoiler like that is fine after 21 hours... it's just gratuitous.I'd invest.I was comparing it to earlier seasons.It's Toronto because of the crack. That is a fine impression! As far you know.Hayden is r/2meirl4meirlI think John (et al) did fantastic this week. The humor was above average and the topic was the obscure bullshit you can't find anywhere but LWT. I love it. If he isn't instated as the PM we can repurpose it to comemorate John leading his army across the Alps to claim the office. This NRA thingy got featured this week! I think we can all agree...Pancakes really are the fuel of life. I watched ONE fucking video from Watchmojo, just because it was a Dark Souls related video, and I've been getting flooded with their clips ever since. Nonsense! Jon Snow dies!This is Kim Jong Un's "well, i tried".*pushs red button*Fallon is by far my least favorite late night host. That fake laugh is r/cringe material. But i'll give it a try for that rat faced bastard. Man, i love this dude!Hope somebody sees this!That seems the right thing to do. Will Photoshop John into another fruit today too.Definitely not impossible someone in his staff visit us here. HI THERE STAFF MEMBER!Hello? Anybody?IMO they shouldn't release the moon trailer at all.Those are allegations, she was never convicted or trialed. Imagine it were you and you had no legal recurse whatsoever, you are snatched, jailed and carted to an unknown location that you had no control over, without you having any way of legally or physically defending yourself and you will get a glimpse on this rotten tactic.

What they are basically doing is terrorizing the immigrants and dividing the public opinion with bogus information. Wouldn't be the first time the government lied. WMD in IRAQ? Long records of criminal police elements lying and falsifying evidence? 

What you are looking at, is literally a mass deportation of humans by an agency, whose sole status operandi works on the premise of dehumanizing immigrants. The difference with a criminal caught by the police and an immigrant caught by the ICE is: that the criminal, be it a drug dealer, murderer, rapist, gets to legally defend himself in a full trial, while the immigrant is cart into a bus send to an unknown location.

We are literally seeing the repeat of dehumanization, demonization, and blaming of a human group right before our nose. This is literally what Hitler had done to the Jews in the beginning phase and historians will look back at this day and ask, how the citizens of the USA and the world, were able to turn a blind eye to all those atrocities. How did one single person, using cheap promises to the poor and uneducated, was able to get elected and quasi controlling the government as a dictator without the other parties and people defending themselves? Historians will look at this day and shake their heads. 

So yeah, let's frigging talk about the problems in this country. And one big problem is ICE.Reddit got a couple of sweet mentions.

Sadly because of those stupid threads though.No it started. Daylight savings is in summer half of year. We all hate it and it’s dumb. Sunday night we lost an hour of sleep. How can i invest?the ammount my wife wouldn't believe!I greatly appreciate that! Thank you!Well, most of them used both gov and non gov emails, so I'm trying to figure out why he said what he said.Yes, neither do I, unfortunately. Thanks for your kind efforts!I've removed this because the name was misspelled, and this submission hasn't had a whole lot of comments yet. You can repost this with the typo fixed, however!Nice try, Dan.Their official YouTube should have clips up by the time this comment is 15 minutes oldWell you were right. They didn't talk about Trump. They talked about Pence. "Fuck you Oprah"Only a wizard could stop Hogwarts' mail so OP might just had parents that are dicks. I figured the charities Pence's book's profits would go to would suck, but it's actually going to an art therapy program at an Indianapolis hospital and a group fighting sex trafficking. It is published by a shitty conservative publisher though. Mike Pence really does force all compliments to have an asterisk.  SnowflakesI'm certain it's illegal in other places in the US too. It seens to be the first in New York State though. Saw John Oliver running, my day is complete.can't wait to see trump's tweet about it.It's a play on [Marlon Brando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando)'s name1: bob will sue you.  
2: Oh that quality...  
3: What did you hide? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Because John is off promoting his Children's Book and won't be actively involved in preparations.

Edit: nameHopefully atleast he gave us a web exculsive. Hate to disappoint, but while I was able to submit the form I didn't actually get picked :(

Tried again last Tuesday and am hoping to get an e-mail this week! I hear the odds are pretty slim though. lol the UK is 15. John really is nobody in the UK
 The YouTube channel, HBO services or both? Yes EverytimeIt's the two tailed dog party. A two legged dog wouldn't make as good a logo. Who thinks the opposition is gonna fight back with fetus in womb earrings?Thanks for getting this thread - my connection bugged out so I couldn't do it in timeNope, nowhere near AlaskaOh, haha. Don't usually have a chance to watch these until the next dayTurbo Tax saved my ass this year.

First time filing, loved it, appreciate it.Why the hate?It was free coz I earned less than 33k in 2017.

But yeah, for majority of populus it has set a bad precedent.Used the freedom version, it's freeGoogle it, the IRS's site redirects to a different version of TurboTax which is free if AGI is less than 33kFair point. But, if Cohen is statistically more likely to be assaulted by black inmate rather than white, how is that offensive?He actually said that prison is interracial.I see what you're saying. It seems as if he is claiming that only black inmates are dangerous.Well, those kids won't really get nuked, while prison rape is very real.Yes, but that never really happened. Only two nukes ever used were dropped on Japan. Prison rape, on the other hand, is happening as we speak.[I gotchu fam](https://imgur.com/6pSp6kf)I got it from the best sellers section yesterday. Did he mention the Korean unification tonight?[No no episode tonight](https://www.reddit.com/r/lastweektonight/comments/8fvvf9/last_week_tonight_on_twitter_reminder_were_off/)I'm disappointed the ferrets weren't jaywalking or  fare beating. The show can't be over. He hasn't talked about the coal lawsuit. If he actually does cancel the shownwe need to get some pitchforks and book a flight to New York. That *would* make him stopping and working on a new project all that more epic. Full Frontal is good too. Love the mic drop at the end there! I’m not sure there is one, except to keep entering and hopefully be picked right away. If you aren’t selected, they don’t tell you at all. If you are, supposedly they notify you as soon as a week after the lottery takes place (so 2-3 weeks prior to the show). We actually did get selected as a result of others cancelling, but didn’t get notified until the morning of the show. Had I checked my email we totally would have gone— from Boston NYC is only a 4 hr drive. Unfortunately I didn’t notice until the afternoon. How far away do you live? 

Edit: Also, good luck!! Not sure if it made any difference, but I did use a NY zip code for the time we were selected. My son’s classroom had a bring-a-book-for-the-classroom day and I donated a Bundo book and then a friend’s daughter was collecting books for a local school library, focusing on under represented groups. So I got her a Bundo book too. 

You can also take your copy to a local “little library.”Thanks! Also, could you make tonight's thread? On my phone right now and would be a bit awkward.

edit: nvm, managed to do itOops, thanks for the heads up! Even took the screenshot, but forgot to apply itCause he is a Britishthat's fair. If they really do need these breaks in order for their shows to maintain the quality that they have... then I suppose I can live with that. Would still be nice to have both the quality and regularity thoughAgain; why the fuck are you here? To ‘enlighten’ us as to the wrongness of our ways in enjoying his content? Cuz...approximately zero assholes on the internet have ever changed my mind about anything.  He did. I made the episode thread out of habit, and deleted it right after I remembered. So I thought I'd make this in case I confused anyone.Oh wow okay thanks, this is really useful!! How was the show you caught? That's what I get for trying to make this on a phone. Made a new one!

Just like universal healthcare, we already had regulations for factual based news in the past and it all worked fine.

People could simply sue tv stations if they knowingly and purposely reported falsehood based news, just like anybody can sue a newspaper for slander and falsehood. Do you see newspaper crumbling because of that law? 

What we have right now IS literally Sinclair distributing domestic propaganda to harm America. Trumps raise to power is literally due to the propaganda of unregulated corporate media you are so afraid of. The White House is regularly dictating Fox News what they ought to show and talk about.

The difference between fact based coverage is chain of proof. You can proof a fact. You can't proof opinions.
Right now we have corporate controlled opinions sold as fact based media coverage literally helping the White House commit and hide crimes in broad daylight.The goal is to make propaganda unable to be formed in the first place by grounding News in facts and not opinions. If there is no propaganda, nobody needs to check any propaganda. If there is verifiable falsehood presented as factual based news, then it raises the question of why it is called News in the first place and broadcasted as such? Every channel should base their reporting on facts like it used to god damn be. I still remember when News used to be dry, straight to the facts and people were not confused and divided by partisan news media. People were given the facts straight and had the right to form their own opinion. What we have now is the mass media filtering out real world events to help establish a dictatorial regime that is Trump.

Trump has tweeted nonsense again? Report what he actually said.
Trump has committed treason? Report it what he actually did and the law he broke.
The economy has been on the upswing since 2014? Report it as such and don't call it fake news.
Don't shout nonsense about Trump restoring the economy.

Even the rightist redneck will wake up when he sees reports about corporate CEOs getting huge tax breaks, while rural farmers are being hit by self caused overseas tariffs.

They are not dumb. They are just manipulated. Simplifying and vilifying conservatives as stupid and backwards just plays right into the hands of Russia. A divided country does no politics. A divided country fights no tyranny. When you are busy arguing friends and family, all you do is getting exhausted to fight the real enemy: PROPAGANDA media mogul Sinclair and the GOP.No, you don't have to give equal time to vaccine deniers.

Vaccines work verifiably. That is fact.

Do you invite gravity-deniers to a physics convention?
Do you invite medicine-deniers to work in a hospital to fill quotas?
Why is it OK nowadays to let idiots talk on national news?

Quota based or so called balanced news is bullshit.

Only democracts care about balanced news, conservative media would never give air time to real scientists. All you are doing is giving idiots more exposure time.You are talking about facts.

Bridges collapsed.
GPD shrunk by 5%.
Tariffs will cause a price increase in over 10000 products.

Where is the dishonesty?

It seems you are so used to getting filtered, opinion-pieces that you call news, that you can't remember what actual news used like to be.Worked fine for decades in the USA. Still works fine in Europe and other modern Western countries. As usual only the USA are an exception. It is better to take care of 1 idiot generation, than 3 idiot generations. The latter won't remember what democracy, peace and freedom smells like. That generation will include your kids!https://fullfact.org

https://en.ejo.ch/ethics-quality/traditional-online-fact-checking

Who are you quoting? Where does it say country of Europe?Of course there isn't, I never said it. But that's like saying USA is not a developed country because some states are not developed as others. As if there is one single homogeneously developed state where people do not drink fecal and lead infested water (https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/02/12/tens-millions-americans-exposed-unsafe-drinking-water-each-year/330516002/) and are not forced into debt to get simple insurance coverage and higher education (http://massbudget.org/report_window.php?loc=Educated-and-Encumbered.html). But that would be splitting hairs, wouldn't it?

What I said is that there should be an anti propaganda law and rule to limit news to factual based coverage. I never said that proof of fact should be government controlled. In UK e.g. the fact checking is outsourced to third party organisations who uses a system of cross control.Not all guardianship are bad, but they do need good oversight and policies to protect the elderly.Ooo wow this is really useful thank you! Hey!

Sorry about that. The weather is absolutely horrid where I am and my connection was not stable. New thread is up.Reason this one was late was due to horrendous weather disrupting my connection - sorry about that. I am going to set up an automod thread for next episode despite my reservations about it (OP can't be edited), but clearly the benefits outweigh the problemsOne thing I dislike about automod is that I can't edit the OP after it's been made. Clearly the benefits outweigh the cons in this case, so I will set up a scheduled automod posting for the next episodeGOP members don't believe in Scientific method generally speaking.Does the president understand how trade works????There will be no more Nintendo Switch or PS4 console and games coming in to the states if he end all trade.. Which probably make every gamer pissed.

And as for the British Parliament House of Common footage using in comedy is against the law, its literally against the idea of freedom of speech and shame on those MP who wrote that law. As for the internet, go hunt those footages of these MP during the House of Commons meetings and make fun of them :)If your goal is for nothing to be about anything and for everything to be pointless, then you succeeded. There's a pointless photo of a guy here now.

Mission Accomplished ™For what? Pointing out the weirdness and absurdity of cutting and pasting a small part of the intro and making a post about it? Why do it? What's the reason? It's fucking weird and when people do weird shit, they need to be called out on it. It's a play on words. Discussion about the topics brought up by John Oliver. If you can that would be greeeaaat.

More than we could ask for. Gave it a try, didn't work. But appreciate it.Sadly no, would that work?You magnificent bastard! Thank you so much. You've done a great deed for humanity.The western part.Yes it was. It was when he mentioned Venezuela's rabbit breeding program. Yeah for sure, also for Colbert - you should definitely give it a shot, having 5 shows a week make your chances way higher than going for LWT! If you do try for it though I’d recommend going much earlier than we did, maybe closer to 1pm? Hope you get to watch the show soon!I think I know who you’re talking about lmao there was someone to my right who kept going “TOTALLY” and “EXACTLY!!!” to John’s jokes and laughing very loudly so I think it should be her?? Tbh after I got in I was too psyched to be brought down by anything though so I just let it slideI hope you do too!! Colbert tickets are much easier to score, I’m gonna catch him on Wednesday :-) there unfortunately isn’t any merchandise (I was looking for some too) but they launched some t-shirt canons into the audience before the start of the show. The souvenir is the experience haha ☺️Yup!! The stage manager also counts him down to when whatever clip is playing ends and he starts preparing his arm movements/etc to respond to the clipsThey’re just added in digitally! There’s no actual screen to his right. Do still try to get onto the list!! We’re lucky because we tried standby on Father’s day. The list itself fills up in 30 seconds so you and your partner should try and camp at the website and enter your information together! (Double your chances) 

I’ve read online that there are weeks that no one gets in on standby, so yeah it’s all circumstantial. Hey this is late but I tried to ask this during q&amp;a and he didn’t pick me!! I wanted to know too, oh well )’: Sure!! Yes it was haha I agree 100&amp;#37; what John said about ~~Winnie the Pooh~~ ..~~... Per~~vert Uncle Xi are trueSo if the government did something wrong, can i criticize it and tell them to fix their mistake?

I don't think so. Especially in China...What is with the soviet flag on xi jinpings' balls? and why are the chinese holding the soviet flag?Ohhh that's better. (Actually that belongs to the US playing card company so I don't think they'd be able to use it.)Dear John Oliver, I have another idea for you guys, you are welcome to use it.

So they are gonna have a LOT of problems keeping track of the kids: Hispanic multiple last names don't play well with American IT systems, they don't have SSNs, and you know little kids don't know how to write or spell very well. 

So they should assign them new numbers and keep them in a safe place. Like say, a tattoo.

Obligatory Fuck Trump.Okay let me give you an example. Mind you, the exact details change. If you had your last name entered 20 years ago there would be more technical difficulties than now.

[Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias.]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_I_of_Spain)

Which is his last name? Which is his first name? What do you put for middle initial?

Granted that's an extreme example but okay here's a more realistic common one:

Maria Jesus De La Cruz. 

The really tricky one there is De La Cruz, all those whitespaces computers do NOT like. The implementation I saw ~15 years ago allowed for one and only one space in the last name. So it gets changed to "Dela Cruz" for some people or "De Lacruz" or "Delacruz". So for the first example she is Maria D. Cruz, second one Maria D. Lacruz, third one is Maria Delacruz. Now figure out where you put the J from Jesus. Are you confused yet, because I am, and I wrote this.What, like, free housing at a federally-funded facility near the border?I mean totally expected. Didn't this same episode include criticism of the British Parliament knowing it would show 20 minutes of black screen in hbo: UK?It's not like we watch a lot of CCTV over in the USA... Yes, the national TV network in China is called CCTV.Forget to say, even there are Human Rights Violations in the states, America is not as bad as those two countries i have just mentioned.  
There are still rule of law and 1st amendment in the landAnd i remember there are torrent sites in China for Last Week Tonight...

Wonder if they get rid of that episode lolThese people don't have any human decency, totally zero. 

~~I hope they all rot in hell.~~This is how Trump makes half of the nation immoral , ~~just like Hitler and Nazi German Subjects~~That is not the Soviet Flag, that is the flag of the Chinese Communist PartyBut i assume they all look the same Em.. guys... the Chinese sites are all fucked...

Okay so the brits make it against the law to use footage from the house of commons.

"...no extracts of Parliamentary proceedings may be used in any light entertainment programme or in a programme of political satire..."

so he explained that the segment would be censored in the UK as others had been in the past. The rationale of the law I guess is the parliament is a bunch of snowflakes.VPN bro, the tech is out there...In my head I always thought of it as Commie China Television.Ahhhhhh.... Thanks for clearing this up. I was very, very confused. Legal in about 5 states. Others are staunchly against it.  Some are pushing for it. But mainly still illegal.Google "Brittnay Maynard" 

It was a national story and very polarizing. She has to move from California to Oregon to do it and wait a year to get her residency* before she could do it.

*in the States, if you move to another state, you can register to vote, have an official address, have a driver's license for that state, but you have to wait a year before you're officially a resident of that state. When I went to grad school, I had moved and waited a year to get in state tuition which is significantly cheaper....I'm a good researcher and I've been reading about it for a while. I have a half-baked fantasy of being on his staff to help with this segment. I hope HBO or the show's producers read thisI apologize. I'm very close and sensitive to this issue. I've heard many terms for it...death with dignity, aid in dying, and the one I said among them. I've heard others that aren't as common. I didn't mean to offend or be disrespectful. Have you seen the Frontline special The Suicide Tourist? A guy goes to Switzerland to do it and it's about his experience waiting and going and ultimately....it's extradonarily powerful and touching. 

This is a clip I share often: https://youtu.be/0M4BuKGhiYUSure. It's just a 2 min clip. Should be on Frontline websiteAlso How To Die In Oregon is a great documentary on NetflixCould be worse  
As far for my concern, as long as i am able to use vpn, then it should be fine....So Mexico is having an Election similar to "Fucking Yankee Doodle Suicide Pact 2016 V5.0"??I know John would recap that E.O...   
But Norway 7-11 Condom BS... lolI agree. I can't watch this with my mom. She likes the show and she's not opposed to sexual humor, but this was just too weird and she won't like that it's sacrilegious.I broke that up into paragraphs but apparently I have much to learn on the subject of reddit post formatting as well. This wasnt a topic suggestionSo apostrophes are causing it to look that way? Ok, I didn't add any of those as far as I know. But I'm posting from my cell phone via the reddit app so it may add stuff like that automatically so that it gets converted properly. [Moose Bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POggGteU0us)Yipe, HBO is a dragon-based Economy!!!In addition, the term HeXie(和谐) (Harmony) literally has another meaning. More like censorship.

HolyShit! You are right,John have to do one episode of this at-least. This is fucking horrify.medical legal in some states but not recreational..........Cool.......  
You got my up-vote  
APPROVAL!!!!! What about a solution like: Universal Basic Income.That looks a lot betterThanks for your reply.  I checked out some of the other videos on that channel and was less than impressed by what I saw. I didn't watch much of it but it nonetheless became pretty clear that the channel has an agenda other than just providing accurate, unbiased information. Doesn't mean what they said in the referenced video is wrong necessarily, but it's enough for me to move on.  Unless other information becomes available that indicates other incidents of dishonesty at least. Yeah, I think a lot of people confuse the two because they actually have never heard of the paradise papers leak at all yet.

This post was initially downvoted a couple times, and I guessed it was either the "I want my post on top" bullshit or misunderstanding.Yeah, kinda sad everyone not investing offshore recognizes the bullshit of it; but public opinion doesn't shape law much at all.

Billions of dollars of lost tax revenue is worthy of note, or should be. What like all of them...? 

Also the cartels. When I was posting this thread: https://i.imgur.com/NSarS3E.pngAh.. cause when i left Florida they have legalized it medically. And I am able to get some , smoked it, before I went back home.There was actually a recent episode on how the show is censored in England because you can't show Parliament because they are snowflakes. And he said that bit would be censored too.There's so much shit to go over thoughDoesn't he know he works for me, personally?He was parodying a local news segment that pointed a gun at the camera. Journalism is so fucked. No one wants to pay for news, or even just deal with ads. Yeah, that's the only episode on local news I think. That was with context. He flat out told everyone that it would be the largest mosque outside the middle east and it would attract lots of Muslim tourists and residents to their town, so much so that parts of it would have visible Arabic signs.

They threatened to say SBC for simply saying that and told him how much they hate Muslims and black people.Exactly! I hate when people lable harassment/abuse as strictly male on female. It only further validates a rather damaging stereotypeWell, sure, but it did at least reopen the conversation/make potentially unaware people aware of a very real problemSeriously! Especially after missing 2 weeks, his trump coverage was decently underplayed/rushed, given all that's happenedIt's over Anakin, I have the high ground!Did you not read the second paragraph. 1/3 of men have been sexually harassed. How is that not common?

Not even twice as many women have been sexually harassed. 2/5 of sexual harassments are men. How is that not close?"Did you not read the second paragraph. 1/3 of men have been sexually harassed. How is that not common?

Not even twice as many women have been sexually harassed. 2/5 of sexual harassments are men. How is that not close?"

This. 

x10I completely agree with you. It's just the way he made it seem (imo) is that men are always the harassers and women the harassed.That's not what I'm saying. The impression I got from John Oliver was that men were always the harassers and women the harassed. That is simply not the case and I'm pointing it out.I agree with you but I think the way he made it seem is that women are the only ones getting harassed.I have been sexually assaulted by 3 women so how the fuck do you explain that?

Roughly 2/5 of harassments are done to men according to the study I linked.My point is that sexual assault can happen to anyone so don't let them get away with it. I was just saying that John Oliver very much made it seem that women are always the harassed (imo) but I think that if he's bringing up the conversation it will do wonders for both sides.We did. That's alot of what Netflix was early on.Oh, bother.Anybody else get some serious phoenix wright vibes from tonight's episode?This was a powerful, great episode. Best one in a while.

That joke about how the audience got angry at the Cuba Gooding Junior joke more than they did any joke beforehand was spot on.

By the way, what is the context of that Cuba joke?This is a big reason why so many communities, especially minority ones, distrust the police. That distrust is what causes people to resist arrests, get impatient with cops, protest them, refuse to get involved with or call the cops (which in turn is of great assistance to local gangs who thrive off of their community's hatred of the police)...

When I see stories like this, it makes it extremely difficult for me to blame people who resist arrest. Two months ago, Antwon Rose was shot to death while running from the cops. At first glance, running from the cops seems like a bad decision, but when you think about all of the corruption and bad practices in law enforcement and criminal justice - including prosecutors - it becomes very difficult to say that what he did was completely unjustified. He had fully justified reason to fear what would happen to him if he just complied.

American police needs serious reform. Everyone on Reddit believes it's the minorities that need reform, but the police need it too. This anti-police mentality will never go away if the law enforcement &amp; criminal justice community continue their practices.Or Doug Jones. Yeah, he's now the Alabama Senator, but he was actually the prosecutor who prosecuted the KKK members who killed 4 black girls in the Birmingham bombing back in the 60s.Who is Cuba Gooding Junior by the way? And why is he a recurring joke/laughing stock here?Those jokes about the Cheesecake Factory were excellent.

&gt; Most people know as much about their local DA, as they know about their local Cheesecake Factory manager. Chances are, you don't know who they are, and if you do, it's probably because something truly terrible has happened.

&gt; Like the Cheesecake Factory, prosecutors have the ability to ruin lives in a second.Why shouldn't we piggyback on your movement. It can be very difficult for men (aswell as women) to get their own movement. We should share the movement and try to bring awareness out for everyone. I don't really see why the #metoo movement had to be only for women. I think men can have a more difficult time with sexual assault as they are often seen as stronger emotionally and physically and that they always want sex. There's some people who don't think men can be raped by women because if we didn't want it we wouldn't get erect. Don't get me wrong, the fact sexual assault/harassment is brought up will do wonders for both genders.You mean Xi?As another reminder, John's piece on [journalism](https://youtu.be/bq2_wSsDwkQ) referenced the Tribune Company a decent amount. 

Edit: Tronc (Tribune Publishing) spun off from the Tribune company in 2014. Whoops. Either way this is one of John's best pieces IMHO. Apparently Tronc spun of in 2014. Whoops, my bad. And College BasketballIs this real?Anybody else feel oddly defeated by tonight's episode? 

Like, it was a local thing, not even an international problem, but that almost made it worseExactly, sure some people can be only behind a movement because they're being paid, but I suppose it's important to remember the movement only started because someone was legitimately passionate about its ideasI mean, there's native advertising, but this isn't that. PBS listed their donors, but they don't seem to have anything to do with Sinatra. Deal with Europe, huh?

Deal with Europe, huh?

Deal with Europe, huh?

Deal with Europe, huh?

Dee wee your up, uhh?

When you listen to him repeat it repeatedly, it sounds more nonsensicalThat mock movie at the end was fantastic. I love how over the top destructive it was.To farm karma.I think I've watched almost all of his episodes. I honestly can't recall an episode where he talked about trigger warnings or college campuses or safe spaces.Hang on... You can't even access YouTube in China without VPN.I don't see any indication on their Twitter that it's off again next weekPossible new show name? 🤔

https://i.imgur.com/0e7pizw.pngOff week. They do those. Damning with faint praise.Private collection or auctioned off by an employee in the dank web.This was a really funny and important episode. So much good humor, I literally laughed out loud at Facebook's mistranslation of their terms of services.

I love that Facebook toilet analogy. Calling Facebook a toilet is very unfair to toilets; toilets make shit *go away*. Facebook spreads shit to your friends and to corporations buying your data.This is a tangent, but the scary thing for me about the Myanmar situation is... how bad is the average Myanmar citizen who is Islamophobic? Are they really as bad as we think?

The government, yes, and the people in the military perpetuating these crimes yes. But think about the average Myanmar citizen like the kind we saw in this episode; the people who aren't in the military. Are they really bad people, or are they brainwashed people?

When this kind of Islamophobic, hate-greenlighting, human right violation-indifferent garbage is so widespread among the citizens, how guilty are they individually? Think about what goes on inside the head of your average Myanmar Islamophobe who is being bombarded with propaganda, largely from Facebook, about Muslims. They were raised, indoctrinated and taught to be that way. They live in a society which doesn't tell them to know better. Can we really call those individual people bad, or are they just bad because they were brainwashed - products of their culture?

When a culture's *average person* is so okay with genocide and human rights violations, that is proof that that is a horrible culture and that its problems go beyond its citizens. As terrible and racist as those people are, there's a part of me deep down that feels a bit of pity for them because they were manipulated and brainwashed into being the hateful bigots that they are and I sincerely hope that on one day or another they realize just how horrible they were.The buildup to that reveal of who'd rep Kavanaugh on the show's animal SC really had me wondering for a minute. Shoulda seen it coming that it was Gritty, but part of me wanted Jeff the Diseased Lung lol Maggie Magaman wrote a nyt excusing Trump yesterday. In it the missing person "died and then was dismembered". No.. way to tone the nasty down.
