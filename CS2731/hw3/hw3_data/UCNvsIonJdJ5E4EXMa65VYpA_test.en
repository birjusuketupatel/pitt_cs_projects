Hi, I'm not sure if this has been asked before or if I could have found this anywhere else, but does anyone Know what lights Natalie uses in her videos, as someone who wants to make art pieces with similar lighting I'm really curious.
Zoë Blade offers most (I'm assuming) of the music Contrapoints has used for free on their website but all the tracks are listed under a heading of "Patreon sponsored" and I'm under the impression it's not all just the music Contra uses. I want to download and assemble a *Contrapoints Soundtrack* so-to-speak. Has anyone else done this or have any info on which tracks Contra has used, like a list or something? Worst case scenario, I'll just have to arduously compare each track the videos, but if I can avoid doing a bunch of work that'd be great lmfaoI think it’d be neat to have a list of all the characters and what videos they appear and and their beliefs and all that. Might even help Natalie keep track of all of them and start incorporating some underused ones.She's.... gaming at the moment, I guess?  Bit of an odd choice, but there for those who are into it.Judging by the titles on this sub it seems like a very inappropriate place to ask personal questions, but, Contra's channel is the only place I know of that deals with sexuality and seem to have an academic rooting. 

I got molested at work yesterday, and now I have some intellectual and emotional problems. Where can I go to figure out what to read in order to figure these out, without getting suckered in by some credibly disguised CrystalMan or BananaGirl?They let me geek out over them for a bit, I went back to my date, but they waved goodbye to me as they left. Super honored! 

I can't tell you how incredible it is to have your stars just crash land in your life out of the blue at your local bar. And Natalie, if you're reading this, just want you to know that I would have ditched the girl I was on a date with to go on a date with you in a heartbeat. There's a song that cuts in ~[5:36](https://youtu.be/QuN6GfUix7c?t=5m36s) during the vaporwave Marx gag, but it's not listed in the video description, and I can't find it *anywhere.* The lyrics are so vague and short I can't even pinpoint it that way.

If anyone happens to know what song that is, or where I can get a list of music used in Natalie's videos that would be great.Natalie has said before that she receives hundreds of messages from people that she helped pull away from the brink of right wing extremism. I am one of those people. I’m not a complete leftist by any means, but I on the topic of ethno-nationalism in the western world … I’m squarely on your side.

Alt-right forums like 4chan’s /pol and r/DebateAltRight are basically echo chambers where false or misleading statistics and infographics are taken as fact and people openly advocate for deporting non-white citizens at the barrel of a gun.

The alt right tends to use platforms that lack moderation. It’s smart to take advantage of that situation. They can’t easily enforce an echo chamber. Don’t let them have one. Put another viewpoint on the table. It’s very hard to bring someone back to sanity once he or she has been radicalized, but putting your voice out there might keep some people from jumping off that cliff.

***How I changed my mind:***

*NOTE*: I struggle to articulate the process of how my mind was changed in precise terms. As such, this is going to be a bit stream of consciousness. 

* I broached topics related to race with non-white people. Talking  with people that would be targeted by the alt right made it harder to dehumanize and discard people.

* I started questioning the alt-righters I was communicating with. This caused them to reveal their real viewpoints. Once I learned that my non-white friends would be forcibly deported if alt righters got their way, I took a big step back.

* I began asking alt righters about the idea of civic nationalism as opposed to ethnic nationalism. I learned that they reject civic nationalism and judge people based on their race rather than as individuals. In short, many alt-righters would accept a leftist white person before they would accept a conservative black person.

* I realized that I’m not necessarily “white” due to partial Jewish heritage. This means a lot of alt-righters want to deport me too.

* The video: “Baltimore: Anatomy of An Uprising”. In this video Contra explains how the circumstances of Freddie Gray’s life contributed to a bad outcome. It helped dispel the notion that the struggles faced by black people in the US are come entirely from within the black community. There are external factors at play.

* The video: Alpha Males. Contra presents a diagram that accurately describes the average alt-right worldview. https://youtu.be/vbE23R1J4ko?t=19m56s This reeked of a paranoid victim mentality that I find pathetic. My response to this was more emotional than reasoned, but it still helped put me on the right path.

* The extreme alt-right’s reaction to the Charlottesville rally really soured me to them. Sam Hyde said he wished MORE people were killed. He later walked back that statement.

* The video “Decrypting the Alt Right” helped me realize how helpful I was being to alt righters by constantly (if unintentionally) using their dog whistles without any qualifiers.

Part of the battle is getting alt-righters to reveal how extreme their viewpoints are. This turns off most normal people pretty quickly. Another key component is providing a smart dissent. I think if Contra herself was on these forums providing her viewpoint, I would have changed my mind more rapidly, but I can’t be 100% sure of that. Being partially Jewish also made me a target. It’s entirely possible I would have been radicalized if that wasn’t a factor (and yes, I hate myself for that). 

I don’t have all the answers. I just have suggestions.  Thanks for listening and … 

Nastrovia! Keep up the good fight comrades :)I've seen Nat use a light that she sets different colors via a remote, does anyone know what it is?I recently got very into Contra's videos and I've noticed on her live channel that she expresses sometimes extreme dislike for her older videos. I think she is a little harsh on herself with those videos and while I do agree with her that in retrospect they aren't perfect and probably represent a very hard period of her life, I don't think she should delete them as she has with some of her very old stuff. Modern Contra's videos are fantastic but they are very much borne of a mindset and a moment that is very different and much more radical than her older stuff. I think they provide a lot of persuasive power and add to rather than detract from her channel.

&amp;nbsp;

For example, I got into her channel through the most recent Jordan Peterson video. At that point I was pretty left on most issues but incredibly ignorant of trans issues. I found her video both enthralling and a bit off putting because I think I had still a bit of socialized transphobia. However, her style, rigor, and humor were very unique and so I went through the entire back catalogue of her videos and I found the earliest ones almost the most captivating. Not because they were better than the modern ones in any technical sense but because they presented an evolution of her worldview from one that was very similar to mine a few years ago to where she is now.

&amp;nbsp;

I grew into the internet around the same time as Contra, and I think her video catalogue provides a very clear roadmap for how someone brought up through the New Atheist movement or its modern Anti-SJW counterpart can come to accept and even celebrate the diversity of human experience that is the LGBTQ community. They provide a place to begin for people who are not ready or don't yet understand the why they're problematic to evolve with Contra. Many of those older videos are close to Atheist/Antisocial justice videos in style, humor, and sometimes substance because they reflect early stages of her departure from that movement. I think because of that very fact they are the most relatable to and, possibly as a result, the most powerful tool in convincing people from that community. 

&amp;nbsp;

Watching some of her self-commentary videos really opened my eyes to how much damage traditional cultural norms have done and continue to inflict on individuals with non-traditional identities. Watching her deconstruct some of her own patterns and regret them made me realize, more than any rational argument could have, how much of a problem values I used to hold are. I think Contra inadvertently excels at presenting her own humanity and I am incredibly grateful for having my eyes opened to these issues. This experience has made me want to be a better person and has earned her a fan for life. I've been sharing her videos around, and seeing several discussions on this sub about which videos are good entry points for her, since let's face it, your typical normie isn't going to watch "Gender Dysphoria" and think "yup, this is someone I want to spend all day binging their entire back catalogue then hopping over to her livestream channel" regardless of how artistically wonderful and emotionally honest it is. So I'm wondering what y'all consider to be the best video\(s\) or order of videos to introduce different people to her work?   


For me, if it's a SJW that just needs to see who she is to get hooked, my go to is "Why the Alt\-Right is Wrong", because everyone \(that can be called SJW\) is on board with explaining how delusional shit like White Genocide is, it shows her pre and post transitioning, and includes her own commentary on her ideological and personal development, all packaged together in a really tight and accessible video.   


For people who might not be fully on board with her politics I'd probably use one of her earlier videos, since she's definitely gotten more firmly leftists and has far fewer fucks to give to most anti\-fems and similar than she used to, something like "Pick\-up Artists" \(because even many normies can see that PUAs are fucking toxic\) or "For Whom the Bell Trolls"  


I'd love to hear what the rest of you beautiful people think though, which videos do you reach for when you want to try to ease your racist uncle into falling for the charms of our delightful Demoness? For meme purposes.  Thank you!This is one topic that's been touched on in several Contrapoints videos (towards the end of "America: Still Racist" in particular) that I think deserves its own video. 

Everyone from Kanye to Jordan Peterson seems to think the Left suffers from viewing everything from an oppressor/oppressed narrative lens, and that minorities have fallen prey to a "victim mentality" that cripples them from pulling themselves up by their proverbial bootstraps. 

I'd like to see this idea dissected, because I think there's a grain of truth here, but a real disconnect between the personal and political; it seems healthy and productive to "take responsibility for yourself" but it doesn't mutually exclude action against systemic problems (like Peterson seems to think). 

Anyway, I'd love to see a Contrapoints video on this, but I'm not going to comment on YouTube, so here I am. When I watched the video on JBP, I was happy that Contra had taken on this issue. She did a decent job at unwrapping some of the bullshit Peterson puts out there. 

Of course, to *really* explain everything that's wrong with Peterson would probably take a book worth a few hundred pages. But that's the dilemma we're in. Most people don't care enough about politics, or philosophy, or anything intellectual for that matter, that they would educate themselves enough to come to understand those things on their own. We have to cramp down criticism of JBP to a difficulty level and length that the average person is willing to listen to.

But to get to my point: I was disappointed with Natalie. Why? 

Because she said "Peterson is not a fascist." 

This is inaccurate. I understand why she would say that- because otherwise "everyone will think I'm crazy". And indeed I think her video on JBP has several layers to unwrap. 

A guillable person will take her words at face value and believe she doesn't think Peterson is a fascist. But she's basically telling us what she's doing: She doesn't call him a fascist, because otherwise people will stop listening to her and write her off.

I understand the technique, but I think it's doing more harm than good and could've been done in a different, less detrimental way. She could have avoided explicitly addressing JBP's fascist status at all and just stick to explaining some of the things which are wrong with him, as she did in her video anyway.

Jordan Peterson is an extremely dangerous person. 

I just rewatched Nat's video on Decrypting the Alt Right:

[In it, she mentioned fascist's tactique of denying their power level and outwardly disavowing being a fascist:] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx4BVGPkdzk&amp;t=7m39s)

&gt; If someone acts like a fascist, has fascist believes, repeats fascist talking points, and hangs out with other fascists, the fact that they publicly denounce fascism should be worth absolutely nothing to you and shouldn’t even enter into your consideration of whether they are fascist.

Rewatching it, it hit me how much this video is relevant in context with JBP. At the same time, it shows how smart Natalie is. 

I know that by writing this, there is a chance of being attacked online. Users from the JBP sub like to brigade r/psychology whenever there is an article linked there featuring JBP as an author. Before I grew wise to chosing my battles, I'd argue with these people to no end and one of them eventually admitted that JBP's views may be "close to a neonazi" but that it'd be an "ad hominem" argument to disagree with his "science" because of this.

But after all, this is online, and if we don't dare speaking the truth even in the anonymity of the internet anymore, then the alt right truely has won.Are they just a bunch of TERFs? Cause I saw them all misgendering contra and treating her like the character Abigail did. I (ashamedly) watch a lot of Joe Rogan episodes, not because I'm a fan of the guy but just because I like a lot of the guests he has on and the topics he discusses. Even when he has guests I can't stand (like Alex Jones or Jordan Peterson) I find it fascinating. Joe, as a person though, tends to really rub me the wrong way. He's like the stereotypical annoying white podcast host, but it's the only podcast where people regularly dive deep on some of the niche topics I like.

So far the only real leftist that's been on his show (as far as I know) was Abby Martin, and the episodes with her were pretty fucking good. If you're not familiar with Martin, you should watch her show Empire Files, it analyzes the effects of American Imperialism around the globe.

I was just thinking that Contra would make an exceptional guest on Joe's show. Joe never seems afraid of having people he disagrees with on his show so it doesn't seem like a longshot, and Contra has a perspective that would be very new and (hopefully) eye opening for Mr. Rogan. I think, as a massive Contra fan and a reluctant casual watcher of Joe Rogan's shit, that the combo has the potential for really good conversation and would put Contra's ideas on a platform in front of the people who need to hear them the most.

It was just a thought I had while high watching the Tiffany Tumbles video lolAfter watching Tiffany Tumbles for the first time I was left with several questions. Why are Tiffinays opinions so much more right leaning than before? Why is she so restrained compared to her original appearance? Is this video a prequel to Terfs? But then it hit me on a rewatch the videos do happen in chronological order! Around 6 minutes into Terfs Abigail's transphobic rhetoric gets to Tiffany. This is what I think set her on the path we see in the new video and is partially responsible for both the internalized transphobia and the overcompensation on femininity (the rib eating montage is a far cry from what the character is now). Tiffany isn't just hurting because of what she does to others like her but because of how the world has treated her prior to selling out!I believe it's pre-transition but where you still see contra in the videoIf there isn't we should come up with one....Hey guys. 

I watched Natalie's stream with Theryn as well as the shitshow that was the "Electric Boogaloo" stream and I really liked hearing Theryn's pov in both these videos. However I cannot seem to find any new stuff from her. Is she not posting anymore?I was wondering if Natalie has ever come out or referred to a defined definition of neoliberalism?

I was wondering because my day job is as a policy analyst (I do economics, environmental policy, and statistics). Neoliberalism can mean different things to different people (some people use it to effectively refer to the status quo while other use stricter definitions around economic theory). If this has already been covered in another thread I apologize. Thank you!I have never given oral to a fellow trans girl. My bits still get hard a lot of the time. What is the mouthfeel like? Nobody ever talks about it so how can I know? I just submitted my contribution for the Italian subtitles of the degeneracy video so anyone who can review them, please check it out. I did the best I could but English is not my first language so I could have made some translation errors.

Thanks in advance for anyone who will review them!This is white millenial atheists children of christian parents.

This is a major demographic shift as big as the ethnic shift. The causes of the shift are mainly gay marriage being rejected by christian denominations, and millenials having lgbt friends. College students children of noncollege white people might also be a big factor.

Religion is one of the strongest predictors of US politics along race. And non-religious children are far more to the left than evangelical or mainstream protestant parents.

Age and geography are not major predictors once education, ethnicity and religion are taken into account.

EDIT: I believe what's going on with this demographic is that it is mainly about priviledged people (white cishet males, and all the intersectional greys) who rejected the bigotry of their parents (both religiously, as well as being the first college attendants).I've finally decided I need to familiarise myself with this theory. I'm familiar with the science of gender dysphoria but I've always found gender theory in regards to the relation of chromosomes to gender, the difference between gender and sex etc. very inaccessible. However I want to understand so I can keep supporting people who need help, so I was wondering whether either Contra has addressed this well in a video before (I only know her newer stuff) or whether other good YouTubers have done it reliably?

Any good place I can look?

Thank you!Following on from my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/8s3vmc/has_contra_ever_done_videos_explaining_the_gender/) I'd like to ask for some clarifications on a few points regarding the relation of gender identity to chromosomes.

In my attempt to understand this I rewatched the hbomberguy Bill Nye vs. Pseudoscience two-parter, and, because I hate myself, watched the Steven Crowder response to the episode of *Bill Nye Saves The World* in question which Brewis critiques in part 2.

While I agree with the assessment of this video that largely the right-leaning YouTube community's response to Nye just assumed his science was wrong without proving it, once you get past about 20 minutes of Crowder just making bad jokes about the episode he does actually start to make scientific claims about Nye being wrong regarding gender science.

[Here's a link](https://youtu.be/ycVkZiHZUYE?t=7m35s) to the point in the video where Crowder starts making these suggestions. He's scant on actual citations unsurprisingly but as someone who knows even less about the issue than he likely does it still muddies the waters for me in terms of understanding the current understanding of the issue, especially how it relates to the current academic views Contra discussed in the 'What is Gender' video.

Would anyone with a good grasp of this issue who might be sadistic enough to subject themselves to about 5 minutes of a Steven Crowder video (don't worry like Shaun says, you can take breaks) be able to watch this excerpt for me and clarify/explain/debunk the counter theories he loosely suggests?

Thank you!The makeup stream where she tells us how it's done is unlisted. Does anyone know what device she uses?What's the consensus on this sub regarding Brittany Simon?

I found Brittany Simon through Natalie's stream, I guess it was controversial stream due to someone in the chat being triggered (as in legitimately triggered not meme triggered) by BDSM culture, but she struck me as a very interesting person and I subbed to her, despite not really watching her videos regularly. 

But after Laci Green broke my heart a few days ago in Louder with Crowder by allowing herself to be used by Crowder to throw everyone on the left under the bus with a "LIBERALS HAVE NO LOYALTY" headline, I found myself binging her videos. 

And what I found is that she has a great head on her shoulders, in a way that, respectfully, many leftist YouTubers don't have, including Laci. She apparently was so conservative that Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh were prompting her but she for the lack of better term, "Woke up". 

And what I like about this is that she had to justify every leftist idea to herself *as an adult* before changing her mind, unlike many of us on the left who perhaps got into it in our teens and through role models that themselves didn't necessarily got there by thinking shit through. 

So not only does she give good arguments for Intersectional Feminism for an Intersectional Feminist, she gives arguments for Intersectional feminism that takes into account and answers the objections of anti-feminists with a level of empathy that many people on the left can't muster.

And I also like for those same reasons, she sometimes goes against the mainstream Leftist arguments, which is kind of great, because I think such a civil disagreement actually makes our movement better, and the fact that she's open about it would stop a shitfest like Laci Green's where many people had this image of her views on stuff, that wasn't representative of realityHi everyone!

I just wanted to clarify one final point regarding gender here that I received great help from on this sub in my [two previous posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/8s3vmc/has_contra_ever_done_videos_explaining_the_gender/) here. Since this is getting further and further off topic from Nat's video I won't post again after this but I just wanted to tie up one loose end from my [two prior posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/8s8cpg/what_is_gender_furthering_my_education_continued/).

One critique of Bill Nye's exploration of gender on his show last year ([link](https://youtu.be/aQDBNJ3mPa0?t=27s) to bit from episode), which like Contra's was meant to act as a lighthearted introduction to the subject, was that when he mentioned that "we see more combinations than [XX and XY] in real life", he excluded to mention that typically those with non XX/XY combinations tend to have major medical problems.

I understand now that those who talk about non-binary genders aren't using the existence of other chromosomal combinations to justify gender existing beyond sex, but I would just like to clarify whether this criticism of Nye was routed in any actual science.

I very much assume it isn't, so I don't approach this from a critical position, but I just want to make sure I understand the science that Nye didn't go into.

I previously tried posting this question to /r/AskTransgender, however because before that I accidentally posted the question to rGenderCritical not realising what it was, the /r/AskTrans crowd naturally avoided me like an Abigail Cockbane scented plague (I thought it meant 'critical of archaic gender roles', I'm so fucking embarrassed).

Part of my question there was whether Nye's reference to chromosome combinations beyond XX and XY was an allusion to intersex people, so if anyone could also clarify that for me that'd be great.

Anyway thank you for your help everyone. Natalie has done a great job of trying to educate people about subjects the Internet has become too politically polarised to teach well, so I've been really fortunate that this sub has been willing to help continue her mission and help me understand the technicalities of this stuff.Yesterday, Contra held another livestream reacting to more of her old videos. She uploaded highlights today on her other channel, ContraPointsLive:

A month ago I posted [this reddit.com comment in response to the TERFs video where I wrote that I imagined Abigail Cockbane with a Katana](https://www.reddit.com/r/GCdebatesQT/comments/6un8d0/contrapoints_presents_pretty_much_a_satire_of/dm455oa/)... Now look at this [new Abigail Cockbane t-shirt!](https://imgur.com/a/5SxOL) It's Abigail with a Katana! In other words, my reddit comment has become a real t-shirt! skutch, if you are reading this, good job and I am glad I inspired you with my reddit comment! (I recommend the one in hot pink, looks best of all IMO)

However, my personal favourite of all the new t-shirts by skutch is definitely [the Tabby Manx one in black](https://imgur.com/a/KNrki). I want this t-shirt sooo sooo bad! It's just perfect for me in every way because I already have several [shirts with cats](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ed/7e/47/ed7e4770475d9b34971dbbf5a735da50.jpg) - and I also have [the Kate Moss lace panther dress](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5219/5387112821_6bfd681048_b.jpg) - hence my gravatar wearing one too.Just wanted to point out that the poster in the background of [this tweetpic](https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/920349013429374976) from the upcoming video is [The Lady Of The Camellias by the Czech artist Alfons Mucha]
(https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fa/2b/5a/fa2b5af8a07cee78762a4397698b9ccb--alfons-mucha-dame.jpg)

&gt; He created this poster for the play [The Lady of the Camellias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Dame_aux_Camélias) which is a novel by Alexandre Dumas (son), first published in 1848, and subsequently adapted for the stage. The Lady of the Camellias premiered at the Théâtre du Vaudeville in Paris, France on February 2, 1852. The play was an instant success, and Giuseppe Verdi immediately set about putting the story to music. His work became the 1853 opera [La Traviata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnKuht1ST-I), with the female protagonist, Marguerite Gautier, renamed Violetta Valéry.

But seriously. We do need *some* rules for the subreddit. I'd prefer to have as few rules as possible. Just the minimal necessary to keep things going smoothly. I've thought about this for a bit and have come up with the following:

1) Posts must be on-topic.  

2) Follow rediquette. 

3) This is a  *safe space*^*

4) Moderators have the final say when it comes to how to interpret the rules. 


*A place where minorities and marginalised people feel safe and welcome. That means no hate speech, no bigotry, no egregious abuse. 

As Contra said, some forms of speech will by their existence exclude other forms of speech. This is why places that have very few limits on speech like 4chan have a lot of fascists and very few minority voices. Because the latter just don't feel safe to express themselves there. In this place we respect each other, we are excellent towards each other and we strive to interpret the opinions of others generously, from a standpoint of inclusivity. 

I am not going to ban people because they post in certain other subreddits, not even if they post in hategroup subreddits.  But I'm also not going to tolerate trolling in this subreddit, not even subtle forms of trolling like tone policing or sealioning. If someone makes comments in this subreddits that aren't civil or made in good faith then their commenting history in other subreddits will be taken into account when it comes to evaluating the nature of potential moderation actions taken against them.

This thread will be stickied for some time to allow people to ask questions and/ or make suggestions. Is there anything you feel needs clarification? Is there something you feel has been left out of the rules which should be added? Make a top-level comment in this thread.

I could continue. But at this point, it's pretty clear.Hello!

I've never wanted to reach out to a YouTube creator before, and believe me I watch an **absurd** amount of YouTube,  so I'm not sure what etiquette is.

I don't want her address because that's creepy, but I'd love to send her a letter or something as I try to do calligraphy. Additionally I just want to tell her how amazing her channel is and how long I've been waiting for one like it. I'd also like to tell her the personal impact the channel has had on me.

Shaun and hbomberguy are two of my favorites to listen to, but both being white men, which they both acknowledge, some outside perspective is great. I'm also curious if she's seen these channels and what her thoughts on them are.

So.... does she have a P.O. box? If I just post something here will that reach her? Do I just do Twitter (I dont have one currently)?

Also, if she's not interested in receiving this sort of thing I completely understand. Honestly, I probably wouldn't be. But I think it's worth asking!From this video: https://youtu.be/zPa1wikTd5c?t=35sI LOVE Contra as much as the next guy (assuming the next guy isn't Olly PhilosophyTube), but I feel a little iffy about this video.

I do agree that Western Culture is a retrospective narrative used to justify tons of bullshit. I think there's an argument to be made that there IS a through-line connecting all of these disparate cultures, but I still don't think "Western Culture" really means anything specific. I have no real problems with Contra's conclusions.

I feel like the video is a bit muddy, though. She jumps from topic to topic very quickly with no real consistent message. The video lacks a strong thesis that connects all of these ideas (almost like Western Culture itself...). A lot of the skits felt like they distracted from the main content of the video.

The entire video should've been centered around the "SJW Reformation" point, because I feel like it's an extremely strong counterpoint to the right-wing tradition of claiming every movement is the end of Western Culture. So for the past 3 streams I've been using a new method to give a little extra during live streams, without having to budget it out beforehand.

Google has a program where you take surveys in exchange for credit on the play store called ["Google Opinion Rewards"](https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/). But how will this allow me to give during livestrams you ask? 

The play store shares a wallet with YouTube in general. This means you can not only use it for buying apps, books, and movies, you can use it for Superchats as well!

Just letting everyone know, especially those who wanted to donate, but didn't have room for it in their budget. So go out there and put some money where your 🍞 is!
Hey, I know Contrapoints says that  JP  misrepresents postmodernism a lot, and wondered if any fans of thay branch of philosophy can help me out with this.  At  first I didn't really care because I thought that even if he did, they  have been often accused by Chomsky and others of being deliberately  obscurist, so you could hardly blame him.  I also figured that the  effects of it he described made a lot of sense to me so that was good  enough.

Anyway, that is no longer enough  for me and i've decided I'd like to get into reading it in earnest and  figured some people on this board would be able to point me in the right  direction. I don't want to read any of the critics who fall on the  excuse that it is too hard to read or who take an initial negative pose  towards it, because even though theres some truth to that it also seems  too easy and these critics tend not to really see what it is that people  like about the movement.  I am most interested in getting a grasp of  the "canonical" interpretation of post-modernism and am looking for  pointers to some good starting points.

I have Zizek's "How to read Lacan" that I am looking through right now

I  also have Foucault's "Discipline and Punish" and Derrida's  "Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness", but don't want to get to far into  them without understanding how it is that they are generally understood,  so if anyone here knows any good interpretations of these authors I'd  really love some pointers.

I'll happily take any other advice except for suggestions to go lick my own balls or the like.I've seen a few of her cameos and debates and her two Youtube channels. I was wondering if there was a list of everything besides her channels that she's been in? “It was cruel, calopricious,... DARK!”

It was at around 2:28 in the video.Hail her non-hierarchical highness.

https://i.redd.it/yoan4b4mxke11.pngI’ve heard a lot of anti-Elon sentiment by people like Lindsey Ellis and Eric Taxxon. However, I haven’t heard anyone get into it all that much. As a result, outside of the whole pedo-sub thing, he seems no more or less bad than anyone else with millions of dollars. What do you think?In her academia video, Contra referenced Ayn Rand as an example of an intellectual the universities did not prepare you to debate. I'm wondering what her followers think of Rand today.

Edit: you people need to learn steelmanning.

Edit 2: alright, here I go digging in.Hiya. Does anyone know in which video she plays piano and sings a bit of Roadhouse Blues by The Doors? I marathoned Contrapoints videos a week or so ago and I saw this moment and it just tickled me so much, but I can't find it again and I want to watch it again!

Thanks. :)I feel kinda stupid asking this question, but what is the origin of “mouthfeel”?Hey Catgirls and soy boys and those that liveth betwenst. I am going to U of T this September, and I'm trying to think of a way to get Contra's Jordan Peterson response shown to Lobsterdaddy himself, because, it would be the funniest thing ever. Any ideas on how to do this? I have blanked this post as a courtesy. Permission to use the photograph was confirmed within hours of my posting this, and other commenters have raised concerns about privacy.Fandom is obsessed with that one time she talked about sucking dick.


&amp;nbsp;



^^that ^^mouthfeel ^^thoughDoes anyone know how we keep up with her now? I know she was thinking about rebooting her YouTube since being disillusioned with the skeptic community. I don't even know what she would have gotten banned for she doesn't swear on twitter and she barley posts. I recently read [Abolish Prisons is the New Abolish Ice](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/15/abolish-prisons-is-the-new-abolish-ice-219361) which talks about how there's a growing movement to abolish prisons in the United States. I think Nat would be a really good fit for the video on the subject - at the time of writing there isn't a single video on youtube about prison abolition with over 100k views. Furthermore there's a significant audience outside her regular viewers for such content - centrist and right wing libertarians *should* be in favor of such a movement. Such a video would be a good followup to the stuff she's done on the Boston riots. I live in SOMD and would love to see /u/contrapoints live if there's anything happening. Thanks!I found Natalie through an Hbomberguy video which referenced her video on the alt right. It shocked me a little, I wasn’t sure if it was man or a women. I watched the videos, a little strange, but funny, yes. The perfect mix of self-deprecation, surreal imagery and raw emotion, I loved it. I discovered trans people, not that I didn’t know they existed, but they seemed more like a volume less concept, more of an idea than a reality. I followed lots of trans people on twitter, got really into leftist politics and fancied myself to be quiet the radical. Bare in mind a year ago I would have been one to laugh at non binary genders as mental illnesses. I had constructed a great view of myself, I would be a radical who would help change the world, I would read all I could, incite a revolution, all that shit. But it was all impersonal at that point, I knew trans people were oppressed and I was an ‘ally.’ I knew capitalism was an oppressive structure and so it should be fought against. All of this was discovered in a bubble of privilege, a straight white male who would easily get along in the world and liberate everyone. 

Such lasted for a year or so, and then things got a lot more real. 
Natalie mentioned the word egg in her live stream, ‘when I was an egg’ I saw in the comments that someone said Natalie browses /r/traa. Curiously I looked up the subreddit. Who knew such an inconsequential thing could change your life.  I related to almost every post, puberty was a nightmare, I just kinda deal with a male body, am I trans, was I? I was excited by this at first, I would get to be a girl, I would get to have the body I thought was impossible and crazy and be treated the way I wanted. The honeymoon period lasted for around a month before I came back to reality.

The body image problems, the ideals of beauty and passing were amazingly depicted in the incel video, the SKULL really does matter that much. I obsessed, and probably will continue to obsess about my own facial structure, about whether I will a pass or be pretty. Now, when im walking down the street or in a city, I can only picture a future version of myself that is transitioning, getting harassed and made fun of, being denied future employment, lack of romantic options etc. Of course such is catastrophic thinking, but where there is smoke there is fire. Trans people REALLY do have it hard. They are not just a concept we should ‘support’ but real, thinking, feeling human beings. I don’t believe it is fair for me to have to think about this, no teenager should have to develop this double consciousness to imagine what cis people will think of me them. I shouldn’t have to worry about the future, not because of my own shortcomings, but because of society’s. I don’t want to loathe myself, I don’t want to be hurt.

All of this is real, and I just want to reiterate that. I see and know too many people who see politics as a mere game show, their chosen ‘ideology’ a ‘personality trait.’  Politics is too important to be thought of in this way, it affects too many people, and it hurts too many people. With the rise of fascism, rampant trans misogyny, sexism, racism, etc. it makes one realise that there is a battlefield of sorts, and I hope with all my heart that you are on the right side and fighting the right fight.

But all is not doom and gloom fortunately, for the silver lining is left tube, and online spaces in general. I cannot stress enough thanks to these creators for making me feel like I am valid and that there is a way forward. When I watch a contra points video, makes me feel proud to be trans, and things aren’t so bad for a while. I find it empowering to be queer and without a role model like her I dare think where I would be right now. People like Olly are making a leftist outlook accessible to all, and creating videos that are comprehensive and inclusive. His recent video on body image resonated with me very strongly. I want to thank you Natalie, Olly and all of leftube with the deepest gratitude. You cannot fathom how much you have helped me figure out my own identity and my own place in the world.

I’ll end this thing by coming back to reality again. I now have to go back to my little rural house, and stay in the closet, fight away my fears of the future and just try and live. I’ll stay strong, and I will help others stay strong. I send my solidarity out to all others in similar circumstances, and wish the best to them.  I hope my story has shown how important everyone in leftube is, how important it is that we support them, and how important it is that we all support each other.

Thanks for reading.

Sorry for typos :/

Edit: Still alive, hungover though. You're all wonderful! 

(I feel bad though cuz drunk cis me decided to say "transition to leftism" on a sub about an actual trans person's videos. Might have left the wrong impression and most certainly stole valour)You all know that their system of beliefs is very important for contemporary misoginy and in fact for Trump supporters nuclei. I want a precise and subtle dismantling of their theory. Specially of their bible "The Rational Male" of Rollo Tomassi. I believe she can do this in an exceptional way.I discovered Natalie a while ago and binge watched all her videos. I never thought I would find a channel so informative, well-researched, artistic, and entertaining on YouTube. 

I'm a huge classical music/opera fan and the song that plays when Natalie is cooking steak in the [Violence](https://youtu.be/lmsoVFCUN3Q?t=27) video is soooo familiar but I just can't remember what it is. It's been driving me nuts for weeks now. Help me, comrades!Natalie and Lindsay look really happy, so I'm happy too. That's all.... is she turning the fricken' frogs gay?They're all hot, but I vote Fritz/Freya. All day, any way. 

Who's your fave? ;)I just really like her voice.

Edit: Am drunk and can't stop pondering this

Sober edit: It has been settled. Everyone wants Natalie narrated biological determinism ASMR videos.

Other sober edit: I think I might need to block reddit after watching [StrucciMovies videos on parasocial relationships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLA-uFKjQ-g).Hi, I recently found her and to be honest, I'm not very smart but I can tell she is. I was wondering if there are any books that would help me kind of understand the various topics she talks about, where I could read them in hopes to be not only more open but of course to understand the topics better. Does anyone know what Natalie uses for her colored lighting? I feel like I remember her mentioning that it was something from Ikea, but I'm wondering if anyone knows anything more specific? Thanks!Would love to see her opinion on this topic since people like blaire white love to demonize puberty blockers and children transitioning. I know zinnia Jones made a pretty informative video but Nat has such an awesome style of reaching out to the common people and a bigger platform! :)I remember some video where Natalie cuts away to the famous "filth are my politics" line from John Waters' *Pink Flamingos*.  
Does anyone remember the video?Hello, everyone! 

I found out about Contra a year ago, and obviously, have watched every single one of her videos. For a while now I have been watching video essays on transfeminism, anarchism, media analysis, intersectionality, and more.

And I'm currently looking for new things to watch. 

Already follow Linsday Ellis, Hbomberguy and Philosophy Tube &lt;3 

What else could you recommend? Or what do you watch? The past 10 days or so Natalie's channel has been growing more than ever before.

Over the past 30 days, she added almost 50,000 subscribers which is about a third of what she had before. And for those that went to school for math... that means that she is just about to hit 200,00 subscribers.

She normally grew a lot more closely after posting a video but this upwards trend started even a bit before the Incel video and is much stronger than the previous high volume burts (notably daddy lobster and decrypting the alt right).

Either way, this doesn't mean much but I'm just excited at how fast her channel is growing since I found her before she was cool. :P

[Link to the stats](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/contrapoints/) (and a [pic for archivation](https://imgur.com/a/McYTU0U)) (And just to mention it. I'm pretty sure the estimated earnings are nonsense, especially for political videos that tend to be demonitized, so ignore.)[200k](https://i.imgur.com/MMVCUQm.png)

Congrats, Natalie!I know, I know. Heresy. Hear me out. 

Contrapoints takes apart opposing political views with the clarity and competency that you would hope for from a past philosophy professor.

Now, I don't want to learn about conservative politics from talking heads and self help authors. That doesn't feel right. I know they're demagogues and I don't want to write off right wing thought based on that. 

I want to engage critically and fairly with arguments from view points that I disagree with. I don't just want to straw man them and play tribal politics. I want to understand them in depth and know how to argue competently against them. 

So, does anyone know of a right wing YouTube channel that engages with left wing ideas in the same way that Contrapoints engages with right wing ideas? 

And I don't mean a fascist, I know that's different. Just someone moderately right wing and traditionally conservative who articulates their arguments in good faith. 

Any ideas?LAST EDIT: 8/09

I know it is not a competence, but I just it would be fun to have something to follow Contra's growth. I'll actualize this once in a while:

I recently discovered ContraPoints from her cameo in Lindsay Ellis's video (marxist reading of Transformers) and god dammit if I haven't watched all of the videos-- most of them twice or three times now. 

As the title suggests, I'd call myself a moderate conservative or a classical liberal; I think freedom is great, I think small government and more localized government is generally a good thing. 

That said, I've got a lot of problems with the GOP, and right-wing talking points in America have been friggin' terrible lately. Trump makes me embarrassed to be an American, and I don't like the shift of the Republican base from boring-but-benign Bible thumpers to fascists and shit-lords.

What I really appreciate about ContraPoints is that she's not dogmatic about party lines; she doesn't put people who are on the left in a "saint" box and people on the right in a "devil" box. I feel like she has a very fair point of view on things and explains her point well, all while being fantastically entertaining, and she's quickly become one of my favorite youtubers. 

I'm very much anti-alt-right; white supremacy is one of the dumbest and worst political positions a person could align themselves with. My brother, on the other hand, IS alt-right. His shitlord of choice is Alt Hype, whom I've been considering debunking via videos, but that would mean listening to a lot of them. It makes home-life difficult (he's living in our mom's basement at the moment between jobs; we are both adults) because blatant racism and Putin-worship turns my stomach, and my parents just shrug and ignore it, and I'm worried about my brother turning violent (he left a gun on the kitchen table as a message to my husband last time we were there, because my husband is an ex felon and my brother is a judgmental asshole). So if I want to go see my mom and dad, I have to button my lip and deal with racist shit, or risk getting shot or screamed at-- so in my last few visits to my family, I've just dealt with listening to his bullshit. 

ContraPoints is like a hot shower (of milk?) of sanity after these visits. It's like a reassurance that yes, there are good people in the world; yes, racism is bullshit; yes, tolerance and kindness are better than violence. 

I'm kind of just gushing here, but it actually is great for my sanity, and I'm glad to know people like her exist. I got myself banned and called a troll on the "fuck the alt right" subreddit because I commented that not all conservatives are racists and fascists (in fact I'd venture to say that the *majority* of them are not, but it's not like I've taken a poll), and I took the same stance on Antifa that ContraPoints does; fascism and fascist violence is bad, but that doesn't make anti-fascist violence a good thing. I don't think violence between citizens is justified outside of self-defense; I don't think American citizens hitting each other with baseball bats is a good thing.

So I guess what I want to say is, thank you, Natalie, for doing what you do. I don't agree with all of your points, but I am incredibly grateful that you're the kind of person I could sit down and *talk* to about our differences and come away as friends-- and frankly, that's more valuable to me than where on the left-right spectrum people are. I'd much rather be friends with an anarcho-communist who is willing to listen to and understand my point of view than a conservative who would rather steamroll me with the "rightness" of their own opinion instead of treating me like a fucking human being. 

Praise reasonable people! I am glad to know they still exist (and create incredibly entertaining Youtube content, no less!).

&amp;#x200B;I'd have to rewatch her whole channel (as if that isn't something I do on a regular basis) specifically looking for them, but the ones that immediately come to mind:  


* Incels: "I gotta get my hetero on!" 
* Autogynephilia: "The Erotic Life of Contrapoints" as a play on "The Erotic Life of Dennis Reynolds"
* Does the Left Hate Free Speech, Part 2: Analysis of "Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody's Ass"I feel bad for her.  She doesn't need to do this.  I feel that she did this in response to her earlier statement.

Or, she gets 5--20 bucks each question. 

I don't believe  that that would motivate her.

She doesn't have anything to prove.Fell waaaaaaaay down the a bad rabbit hole. Race and IQ, the JQ, etc. Help me before I do something stupid like try to detransition or whatever. If anyone is wondering, started small with Jared Taylor and shit, few months later and I'm attempting to explain why Hitler wasn't actually bad. I still have a moral compass and that's about the only thing keeping me from violence, but I know that most of my beliefs are really fucked up and against anything I consider moral. I know they're immoral, but I never fell into them from a place of hate, it was always from a place of love (however misguided) for my own people, and so a part of me still feels like they're right. What made me stop and think was when my younger brother joked about strangling blacks with his wallet chain, except that's not what he called them. I guess it just struck me that I had always seen as young and innocent was talking like that, because my views never came from wanting to kill other people, they come from wanting to secure my own people. Anyway, if anyone here can help or link me to somewhere I can do some reading to better myself, please do. I'm sorry if this isn't the right place but I'm a pretty big fan of Natalie ever since the Golden one talked about her so I figured here was as good a place as any. It was amazing and needed and got like over 300k views in a weekend. Why &amp; how??? This seems good/great but also some rapid change so I hope you're good Natalie &lt;3 I noticed this starkly in her late night livestream, she noted there was waaaaay more activity than she's had before and lots of folks chimed in that they just found her.

So the video... seriously, a weekend!! But why/how else did it just accrue so many views so fast?

I'm sure it made its way around newer internet spaces (like, incel community heh). 

Has Natalie hit an inflection point of popularity??? :D

Was a video like this about incels and radical internet communities exactly what we all needed, both in understanding ourselves and incels ?!?!? (yes)

&amp;#x200B;

So rapid, much views, very mouthfeel.There's a lot of intersection between porn, prostitution and transgenderism.

Trans woman often have trouble maintaining or pursuing high value careers, they often suffer from mental illness (Depression) and they often have elevated sex drives pretransition (thanks testesterone!). 

This is coupled with a desire or need for a large amount of money for the things required to transition, whether that be surgeries or hormones, and leads to a huge amount of girls to take to the internet (or in the past the streets) in an attempt to earn money from their particular unique beauty.

Additionally some transwoman are relatively lonely or self loathing, and have trouble finding acceptance or feeling positive about themselves, something that caming/porn can bring them.

This is an activity that is borderline routine in the early stages of a transwoman's life, camming or prostitution on some level to satisify their confusing sexual/body image urges and to make money to buy things they want or to support themselves after their life has gone off course due to a lack of success.

This can lead to condemnation and exploitation as well as an association with degeneracy which unfairly negatively impacts peoples view of trans people.

Also much like some homophobes being very closeted, I think a large amount of bigotry towards transwomans has some root in an attraction to them.

I'd like to hear Nat's thoughts on the matter since she always seems to approach things with a unique perspective.All my crushes are just on trans YouTubers Feel free to fill me in if you're more knowledgeable than I on the issue (speculations are also welcome).Just a little thing I noticed lol, so I thought I'd share. I've been meaning to rewatch her JBP video since the Incels video came out, although every time I've gone to her channel something comes up IRL and I get distracted, but because of that I've been able to see the views on some of her videos steadily climb up.

Quite a few of her videos have been gaining more traction since Incels just because of how many views it got, but the two that have been gaining the most views have been her How to Recognize a Fascist video (previously her most viewed video) and her JBP video, each of them gaining more than 100K views in the past two weeks alone. Also, from a quick glance at her SocialBlade, both of them have still maintained a very positive rating (How to Recognize a Fascist is at 78%, JBP is at 90%.) Other videos have gained quite a lot of views as well, putting quite a few of them over 300K and bringing other ones closer.

I know that I've heard a lot of people say that How to Recognize a Fascist helped them with, well, recognizing fascists lol, as well as helping them break away from more far-right ideology, so I think that it's really great to be getting traction now with the Incels video also helping people breakaway from Incel ideology. I remember the same happened when her JBP video came out with having people start reconsidering their views of JBP, which makes me especially happy that it's getting more attention now. I think it's really great that of her videos to be gaining the more traction, it's these ones; I hope that they continue gaining more views and helping people get away from potentially far-right viewpoints.

​

Anyway, now that my whole spiel is over, I'm gonna finally rewatch the JBP video after putting it off for the past few weeks lol.  


EDIT: Missed a few words. Also, while I'm editing I thought I'd add that I just finished rewatching the video, and while I watched it I was pleased to notice that the video still has ads enabled on it unlike the rest of her channel, it makes me smile that Natalie is probably making some ad revenue on her most viewed video :)Batter up, shes next. Or is it just me?Hi people, the article from the Verge brought me here. I've only watched a few videos, but Nat had me at "Derrida, if you wanted me to read your WRITE BETTER."

Anyway, I kind of wanted to think through the "post-modern neo-Marxism" that the JBP video dissects.

I think for conservative intellectuals, post-modernism boils down to moral relativism, sort of the reductio ad absurdum of the skepticism of grand narratives, in which any idea is as good as any other because a single objective truth isn't possible. So in that sense, pomo is a dressed-up version of moral relativism that's made to scare lay conservatives.

As for the internal contradiction between the grand Marxist narrative and the pomo skepticism of grand narratives, that's probably where the "neo" comes in, which does all the critical heavy lifting to paper over the oxymoron. Of course, like pomo, Marxism is another kind of dated bogeyman of the right -- these were more charged terms back in the 80s and 90s, IIRC.

I also have some thoughts about the irony of leftists creating a new vocabulary to express their identity politics, which the right then absorbs to start describing their positions. For instance, I posted a link to an article on toxic masculinity in gaming to a thread about how Anita Sarkeesian is bad and evil, and the OP dismissed the article by calling it toxic in itself. My mind reeled afterwards.

But whatevs, hi everyone!I have a high opinion about the father of my gf.
He is well literated, holds communist ideas and is a very interesting person to debate with.
But he holds a very negative view about Islam and is drawn through this to very right leaning parties and circles, although the only thing the has in common with them are his fears about immigration (them having a patriarchic and fundamental mentality).
He has in fact have had negative experiences: my gf was in very toxic relationships  with immigrants she goes to school with. The school has overproportionally more migrants and they don't make a good impression as loud and aggressive pupils.
My question is, how can I engage in a debate to maybe change his mind and bring him away from this toxic groups?
(Live in germany btw)
Greetings to everyone reading this and hoping to get some good ideasFor awhile there... actually a few years, I couldn't find any channel or something with leftist people debating the right-winger channels, which seemed to be everywhere. Her video on *The Left* and the alt-right was exactly how I feel about how leftists need to come together. We need memes, and camaraderie. We need to take notes from the alt right and 4chan and come together and do stuff like they do. We need to set out smaller attainable goals that can actually affect our society, and be "stone cold motherf****rs" not just reactionary...like I've been for a few years.  I just really think we need, as the left, to be more social with each other and unite. New Year's Eve Stream will start in 30 minutes:

https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/947618986010857472I love Contra's videos but occasionally she does something really weird. I just chalked it up to her weirdness but someone pointed out to me, for instance that the people wearing the rhino masks in the video about debating the alt right was a reference to a French* play I had never heard of about people turning into rhinoceroses. I went and looked it up and it sounded really interesting. I wonder what other references I missed because I am an uncultured, undereducated dumb dumb.

Like for instance, what was the deal with the black and white cutaways to someone speaking chinese (?) in the free speech part 1 video. It seems to get a call back in her most recent video. In the free speech part 1 video, they refuse to answer a phone and the same joke is repeated with reptiles in the "What's Wrong with Capitalism (Part 1)" video.

*or some other european, I don't rememberI've seen Contra mention this book as being something she couldn't stand having to read over and over again. She also had Tabby mention it as something you have to understand to be a proper leftist. What is it, why is it so difficult, and why is it as influential as it is?They said I was mad, but only I knew the truth!

Whenever the idea of "Contra talking to herself" in the form of different characters came up, I would bring up that the first video where she did that was a sketch in which the "Spirit of Love" gives Contra oral sex after an argument. 

No one knew what I was talking about, and for a moment there I thought I had a dream in which Contra went down on herself which... was somewhat disconcerting... but it wasn't a dream! It was real! And here it is: Pick-Up Artists | ContraPoints published 26 oct. 2016

I can now die happy with the knowledge that I'm forever vindicated.So, when I am not procrastinating on Reddit, I am a movie critic, and my favorite moment in the history of film criticism was when Roger Ebert told another critic at the Sundance Film Festival to STFU about minorities (specifically Asian-Americans) having to represent their whole group in their art. 

In his own words:

&gt;What I find very offensive and condescending about your statement, is that no one would say to a bunch of white filmmakers, "how can you do this to your people?" This film has the right to be about these people and Asian American characters have the right to be whoever the hell they want to be, they don't have to "Represent" their people!

I was brought back to that moment a lot when the whole Vancouver event happened. It seems that since Contra transitioned, she can't speak for herself, now every Tweet, Joke, Live Appearance and Video from her is the Trans Community Speaking. And this is not only unfair but creatively stifling. What if she wants to make awesome videos but doesn't want to be an ambassador? Should she be obliged to do so? 

I'm also reminded of Neil Degrasse Tyson who other black students tried to pressure him into pursuing politics instead of AstroPhysics, because "The Black community cannot afford the luxury of someone with [Neil's] intellect to spend it on that subject".

Source: https://youtu.be/eQLtPWPqsjA?t=2m48s

That person, by Neil's description, wasn't some keyword warrior SJW, he was walking the walk and talking the talk, had the best intentions in mind... but was inadvertently trying to put him in a box where he would have been miserable. He was telling him "Because of how you were born, you are not allowed to pursue your happiness."

Isn't that what many on the left are doing with content creators like Contra? 

I believe it is, and it's starting to take its toll, read this tweet and experience the level of grudge she holds. 
https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/955458213813645313

It's not just Transfolk either, I follow Korey Coleman and Martin Thomas from Double Toasted, they have had a movie review show together in one form or another for over 20 years (You might remember them from Spill.com) and they're both black. 

There was a small but vocal section of their fanbase that wanted their show to be more about "the Struggle", but they didn't want to reformat their pop culture show into something very different, this led to the word "coon" being thrown around and warnings of "N***er wake-up calls". It was all so dumb. 

I don't know, I'm not Trans or Black (I should say), but this is something I've had on my chest ever since the whole Vancouver thing happened and the Chelsea Manning stuff has ruffled me up again, sorry if it was a bit of a ramble on. What do you guys think?In chapter 4 of contrapoints video what's wrong with capitalism (part 1). At 12:40 the last conversation between the lizards ( capitalists) follows as such. 

* phone rings* 
L1 "well, are you going to answer the phone? "

L2 " there is no phone. There's only the sigh of an oppressed creature. The heart of a heartless world. The soul of a soulless condition. It's best to just try to ignore it. 

 I understand most of the video itself. Although I'm not exactly sure what this interaction is getting across. At least in my interpretation it's saying that they aren't ever going to listen to the people. Ignoring them will keep the condition soulless. Chapter 4 the message to the rich will never reach them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh0E_gM_Sf4&amp;t=205s

TL;DW: A professed self-hating trans woman uses TERF talking points to create a 'better' version of Contrapoints' TERF video.

Like, I seriously don't want anyone to brigade her channel, but I really felt gross watching this, and reading the comments. Contrapoints uses a lot of provocative and surreal images in her comedy videos, but the person that made this video frames her jokes as 'misogynistic' and that all TERFS want is a 'conversation' about what it means to be a woman. Or, rather, the definition of 'woman'.

Like, what is she trying to prove by making this video? She says that she believes that trans women are women, but what is the literal fucking point of defending TERFS and their blatantly, actual bigoted worldviews? The comments show the truth, that she's building up an audience of radfems that see her as the 'exception', like how Blaire White's audience sees her as the 'exception'. I fucking hate this stupid world where trans people are constantly challenged, accused of being perverts or deceivers or whatever else, because they dress feminine, or don't dress feminine, or take hormones, or don't take hormones, or get srs, or don't get srs, or identify as genderqueer or nonbinary or genderfluid or demigirl or whatever.

I'm fucking sick of it, and I hate that a trans woman is perpetuating it.



(another note: one of the main points in the video is the typical terf talking point that we should address female as a reproductive class, and that women are discriminated against based on their reproductive capabilities. One of the commenters said that trans men should be classified as female as well, since some of them are capable of pregnancy. Completely missing the point that many of them don't want to be pregnant, nor be classified as female)She stated in her latest tweet this change of her title.
( https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/929795733255020545 )

I still advocated for: Queen Natalie I, arch-daemonette of Slaneesh, enemy of the Imperium, victress over the Akkadians and the frog people, intellectual leader of left side of YouTube and arch-prophetress of the Dark Mother; as her full royal title. 

But instead of discussing her full royal title we now need to discuss the revolutionary goals of her party.

I created some propaganda to celebrate this historic event.

I tried to Shazam it but to not avail.There's a lot of..... feelings about Contra's decision to do this debate, and while those who are calling her a grifter, or naive, or unworthy of support now are going way overboard in my opinion, I get that there's a lot of concern about how she will come off, and what impact she can have. 

I'd rather focus on how to maximize her chances of doing well than assume it will be a horrorshow and she will either abandon the left or become a recruitment poster for the alt-right. 

So, I'm not sure this is the place, but screw it, here's where I start. I figure anything useful said here will likely get back to Nat, (and possible Theryn and Blaire, but I don't think that matters) and I figure it might be useful to brainstorm what some of the talking points will be, how BW and TM might respond to those talking points, how they might challenge Nat, and how Nat might effectively respond. 

This is a "Free Speech" loving crowd, almost certain to be overwhelmingly white, male, young, and reasonably wealthy, just based on the club, so that must be considered. 

Ultimately, I support Contrapoints because I think she's willing and able to speak to people who are opposed to her, and get through to them, because she's likable, clearly intelligent, and fairly resistant to frustration in the face of personal attacks. However, I think she needs to work on her debating skills, and part of that is being sufficiently aware of your opponents ideology and justification to predict many of their arguments and have counters ready and practiced, so you can speak them with confidence and clarity, citing specific sources when possible. 

it's also useful to not just practice refuting the facts of bad arguments, but to undermine their core reasoning. Hey now, you're a reader and I want to know this.

Is Ruby scared of Contra? Or am I listening to dank lies?Spent years following tj, sargon, Phil, bearing, metokur etc. Whenever people would comment on them I'd say that they just make edgy videos about cringey stuff. Your videos really were an eye opener, there is definitely an appealing narrative in the alt light content to be the disenfranchised! But then come the dog whistles and "free speech debates"...Even though I enjoy most of the content she puts out, sometimes (like in her recent videos) she starts to tackle how social issues and capitalism are inherently intertwined. By itself I think this is great and she brings a lot of legitimate points about the problems that capitalism creates. However, when she starts to get into the economic arguments of potentially better alternatives, her lack of education on the matter starts to show. 

For example, in her What's Wrong with Capitalism (part 2) video, she brings up the defense of capitalism that difficult and critical work needs to be incentivized, and puts forth what I like to call the "Roddenberry theory." Basically, that those who are intelligent/creative will want to pursue those things in which they are talented due to an internal motivation. This is a prime example of where reading some literature on the topic would help. It's true that those people in academia usually don't have money as their primary motivator, they are still partially motivated by money because they're still human. There will always be a select few who will always pursue progress out of altruism, but sadly they are in the minority (I know because I work in science academia.) The evidence of this can be seen solely by the fact that when you increase funding to a certain research area, more people will choose to pursue it. There is always a choice intelligent people need to make after getting their degree: "Do I take my skills and and sell them to a company for money, or do I use them for intellectual advancement." The lower the financial gap between those is, the more people will choose the latter and go on to cure cancer/build a fusion reactor. 

I'm not saying that Contra is simply wrong on these issues, but I believe that she would have more substantive and informative videos if she were able to address the argument from opposing sides that aren't ridiculous fascists. It's very easy to say why something is bad; it's very hard to say why something else is better. For the record I'm not trying to argue that pure capitalism is the one true way, I just think that there are well educated and researched arguments made on both sides of it, and you need to address the spectrum of views when doing an essay on something as monumental as "what economic system should we build our society on?"Are they available anywhere or do I have to steal them? ;3

Thanks &lt;3In future videos it would be interesting to see a character that represents flawed leftist rhetoric grow when faced with the worst facets of the left.
Dear Natalie,

I am a lowly transfem lurker from Kazakhstan. My name is Alice. This is my first post on Reddit, so pls don’t beat me.

I’ve just discovered your channel a couple of days ago and your video on gender dysphoria resonated with me deeply. I immediately wanted to share with Kazakh trans community the conflicting feelings I felt while watching it several times in a row. 

Unfortunately, most of the people in the community are not fluent in English. I’ve translated the captions to Russian in the best way I could (I am not a good interpreter), but stupid YouTube contribution system requires peer reviews for the subtitles to be published. I am not sure how many Russian speaking people watch your content, let alone review the subtitles.

I read somewhere online that the content creator can approve the subtitles themselves. Could you do that for me, please? I promise that there are no hidden advertisements, and I treated your work as a piece of art while translating - with utmost respect.

I can translate other videos in my spare time too, if you wanted to share something specific with a Russian audience.

Also, I love you and you are amazing, could you come to Kazakhstan and marry me? :)


EDIT: So I had a bit of “l'esprit de l'escalier” here...
Basically, if you, my dear reader, have nothing else to do right now, you might as well go and approve the Russian translation of the Gender Dysphoria video! (And the Croatian translation of What’s Wrong with Capitalism (part 2)!)

We assure you that these requests come with the noble intent of spreading ContraPoints love around the globe!

EDIT2: It actually worked! The Russian translation has been added. Now let’s push the Croatian one and we can call it a day!

To approve a translation, open the video on a PC platform, click the setting (cog) icon -&gt; subtitles -&gt; add subtitles -&gt; choose language, and there you go, you should be able to approve the latest version!

Thanks everyone for your help and for making my first reddit post a... Great Success! :)Does that mean it's only accessible once a month? Like a one day thing? Or is it a permanent chat that she sends out an invite to supporters each month? The wording wasn't super clear to me.

Thanks!While constructive criticism seems from time to time justified, it seems to me, as if constant outraged criticism could in the long term weaken the effectiveness of her Channel to fight/convert people from the right.

There are multiple channels which advocate for similar goals, like intersectional thinking, against fascism and reactionary movements, about gender and other topics. But it seems to me, that these channel lack the combination of (philosophical) argument, aesthetic and provocation/irony which make Contrapoints videos as effective as they are. (Her aesthetics are often integral part of her argument not just background noise, or funny distraction)

While her style will probably from time to time address and depicts things considered problematic (often to argue at the end of the video against problematic behavior), constant outrage could lead to her slowly changing her aesthetics and her videos into something less effective, if she would avoid controversial topics in the future.Regularly people want to post something on this subreddit that is not directly related to ContraPoints. Content that perhaps is of interest to leftists, content which talks about the extreme right and/ or content related to LGBT+ issues, or just content people think that fans of ContraPoints will enjoy. 

We don't normally allow such posts. But, since people do keep asking and since a lot of these links they offer are interesting and useful and also because I just can't say no to you lovely people I have decided to make this stickied thread. 

It's an experiment. I want to see if this takes off, if there is a need for a mega-thread like this one and if people will regularly post interesting things in it. 

This thread may be (temporarily) removed if and when we need the sticky slot for something else. 

---------------------------------------------

This mega-thread is a place where fans of ContraPoints can post links to interesting content that are not directly related to Contra, but which are Contra-adjacent. 

That small leftist youtuber you want to draw peoples attention to? A news article about transgender issues? A question about catgirls or catboys? Post them in this thread. I recall she posted to twitter about it a month ago, and i really need a good, concise explanation for why the term tr*p is transphobic ho help explain things to a friend. I'm kinda really bad at articulating these things myself. If anyone has any other good reccomendations for media about this, please tell me about it in the comments.I know that Contrapoints was going to do a video on this, and I have been thinking about it a lot lately.

I wanted to discuss it, but I don't have a forum to do so, so I hope you'll listen with an open mind.


I know, I know, won't someone think of the poor straight cis male? But I think looking at this frame of refrence can explain the idea more, and can help parse the transphobic elements of this concept from the homophobic ones.

**Disclaimer: For the sake of brevity I will be using the word "trap" a lot. This is not an endorsement of the term or its acceptability.**

**So why my interest in this subject**

|


I'm a trans camgirl and I've been making a lot of money doing so, I'm saving up for hormones and just in general it's financing a lot of girly stuff for me. I'm also dating a trans girl who is older and has been on HRT for a while.

Anyway, my main draw has been well... my genitals, and I noticed a huge amount of guys who would describe themselves as straight (and I would too...) who want to suck on cock, or generally like the aesthetic of a penis on an otherwise conventionally female person. 

I'm preHRT and have a very feminine face, especially when I cheat with makeup, and then have a giant... well anyway, so that's my gimmick so to speak, that and just being down to earth and conventionally female.

I asked my gf about what percentage of self proclaimed straight men liked penises, to which she replied about 50%.

She's been with a lot of people and is a fair bit older than me and I would actually trust her judgement on this, I was going to guess maybe one in three, and was trepidatious to guess even that high. So her estimate of about 50% surprised, and even shocked me.


My main concern was that there was an obvious sampling bias. People were seeking us out for who we were "chasers" as it was and that we were not in conventional circles.

But having male friends who were openly bi, or semi closeted about being bi, and talking to them, I've come to the conclusion that liking quote unquote "gay shit" is heavily frowned upon. 

These are traditionally manly guys in traditionally manly proffessions who keep their predilections on the downlow for fear of being ostrecized or abused for their inclinations.


But there does appear to be a massive interest in penises among otherwise straight males. These men have no interest in other men whatsoever. A preOP female to male would likely be a huge turn off, as would a "twink", and they often have relatively little interest in anal sex, especially themselves being penetrated, their interests are usually in the aesthetic or in sucking on penises, not on being fucked.

One of my first questions when doing shows is "Are you straight or bi" because it immediately tells me a lot of how to tailor the encounter, and the majority of guys describe themselves as straight, are interested in touching/playing with me but not being penetrated, and prefer a female persona and behavior from me and to treat me as a women.

Bisexual guys are far more interested in doing "whatever" all the acts both receptive and penetrative, and being a "dom" or "sub" is unrelated, most people are subs and the common straight sub act is to "worship" me as well as my genitals and to be treated to a femdom experience.

**Traps are gay is about hating on straight male enjoyment of penis, not on hating pre op transgender women**


|


So what does this have to do specifically with the "traps are gay" meme/nomenclature.

For starters I totally agree with and understand the aversion/recoilment that many trans woman have to this idea. The implication is clear, that the trap or trans woman is a gay male. But I don't think that is the meaning specifically of the phrase.

The phrase traps are gay is saying that "traps" as in the subject of traps, or concept of traps, are gay.


The people being called traps (females with penises, or overly feminine crossdressing males) are not what is being called gay. The people who enjoy or like traps are being called gay.

More accurately "traps are gay" is a straight cis male telling another straight cis male that "(liking) traps [is] gay".

That enjoying traps, or more specifically enjoying a penis on what otherwise appears to be and behaves like a woman, makes the man gay.

The concept of traps does not really even take into account the autonomy of the "trap" in this case. Which is of course trans erasure or just generally dehumanizing to trans people, but that's fairly par for the course as far as fetishism. Whether it's black people, lesbians, trans woman, or whatever, the act of enjoying them as a sexual fantasy usually involves forgetting that they are actual people.

Which brings us around to the men who do like preop or non op trans woman, or who do just like penises. Often maligned as "chasers", they are treated with almost as much destain by trans woman as by cis "anti penis" men. But this is a prejudice, much like all prejudice, which derives itself from the fact that most people are assholes, and so "penis enjoying" men as a group includes a large amount of assholes.

But in my experience "Chasers" or men who like penises but are otherwise straight are no worse people than anyone else, infact they have a tendancy not to dehumanize me or trans women with penises. They view trans woman as women, in part because they view themselves as straight and maintaining that worldview is important to them, and in part because they **are** straight and they like women, so they treat women the same penis or not.


So the real problem is not in the transphobic aspect of "traps are gay" but in the homophobic admonishment of straight guys who like penises, and the general societal cruelty to such men. 

If they or their desires are not acceptable, than trans woman who choose not to get SRS are not acceptable, and in my view the current "don't ask don't tell" view of genitals for trans woman is archaic. If a trans woman doesn't want to get SRS, for a variety of reasons, that shouldn't be anyone's business, but that also shouldn't be something they're forced to hide in order to be accepted as a woman.

For most woman, trans or not, the condition of their genitals is far from important to their persona and how they want to be treated. The "purpose" or desire of most trans woman (or as contrapoint puts them, trans woman in group B) is to be treated as a woman by society, by their partner, and in their day to day life.

While many women get dysphoric over the area, many do not, or do not feel the need to take the associated serious risks of major surgery (or for that matter the cost) when really they just want to have realtionships and interactions and exist in society as a woman, and with a huge amount of men (and gay/bi woman) enjoying penises there's no reason that this should be a requirement.

***


**So why aren't traps gay**.


|


Well if it wasn't clear yet, in my opinion liking "traps" isn't gay because the main attraction to traps is that they are feminine. Gay men are into... men, which traps, at least the stereotypical trap as defined in pornography are not. 

The "ideal" trap is one that appears female outside of having a penis, they are on the receptive end of sex and are submissive and stereotypically "female" (if in a problematic way, but you know, one thing at a time).

The penis/testicles itself is an ironically unmasculine region. They are highly delicate, easily the most vulnerable part of a male body, not able to support much weight, soft smooth and sensitive, and if masculinity is somehow defined by one's ability to be productive or "earn money" the penis is the only body part that has a net negative income over the course of a man's life. It's the only body part that invariably ends up costing him money. 

Enjoying it as a fetishized body part is not much different than enjoying say... feet, or what have you and while I'm not sure why there is such a huge prevelance in interest in penises, the overarching theme of men who declare themselves straight but are interested in penises in my experience is that they are straight.

They like women, they like being men, and they have no interest in masculine males. Further the desire for the act of penetration in males who like penises is about as prevelant as in men who don't like penises, or lesbians who don't like penises.

When lesbians use toys or a strapon that doesn't make them partially straight or bi by definition, it's simply a physical act which illicits pleasure. Similarly a cis woman using a strapon on a male is not an inherently gay act, nor is fingering or other acts of penetration.

A woman using a strapon does not make her somehow trans, or make her gay, or "male gay" either. It's just wierd sex shit.

There's a lot of wierd sex shit.


 ***

**But what about transphobia**

So a lot of people might get mad at me for empathizing with a cis male or chaser perspective. But this is a group that is the most likely to be an ally of trans community, and ignoring their obscure problems doesn't help alleviate transphobia, nor does treating them as a gross creepy group of people to be avoided. Many trans women very much so dislike their penises, and dislike using them. While I personally dislike using mine in a sexual sense (receiving head, penetrating, etc) I don't find it aesthetically dysphoric in the same way I do my voice/height, and this is a somewhat common point of view, especially of non op transwomen. They're fine with their penis. It's fine. This is fine. And being mad at guys who are interested in using your penis, even if you don't want to isn't fair to them. You're by no means obligated to let them see or use it, or even to give them the time of day, but as long as they are respectful and ernest, there's no reason to treat them as a lesser person/creep simply for liking what they like. Normalizing this sexual inclination, even if it is fetishizing can be good for a large group of people who are treated poorly for their interest in trans people, and can also help to alleviate or delegitimize transphobia.

There is a huge amount of transphobia and transphobic people, but I think the "traps are gay" meme isn't entirely about trans people, or even really at all. It's not implying that trans woman with penises are men, it's implying that implicit enjoyment of penises is gay. 


Anyway, I appologize in advance for whatever it is I did wrong. Please take my opinion/view as an unfully formed hypothesis developed from the perspective of a trans person, and point out any problematic or offensive parts in a academic way. I'm more than willing to change or adapt my view, and I'm well aware that it is an incomplete view, there are a number of offshoot problems and discussions one could have on this.


LISTEN. Here are some article's / videos who are already done against Ben Shapiro's claims about Transgender people and data, so if you want to make a video against Ben Shapiro's claims and misinterpretation's about Transgender study's and data, something like 'TRANSGENDERISM: A MEASURED RESPONSE' with the Transgender Flag and a funny head of Ben Shapiro next to the flag as a thumbnail maybe? Like you did with Paul Joseph Watson :D  (please o it &lt;3)

I actually was hoping that Hbomberguy would make a debunking video on this I want to bring this Information out, just in case. Knowing you, I think that you will find also more arguments. I hope that these videos and articles are a good help for you to start. Ben Shapiro needs a good take down and rebutal on his claims about transgender people and data. Also his question 'why arent you 60'  is pretty dumb because i think thats not a good comparison. Age is just a complete subjective idea and concept for another complete subjective idea (calendar) which says how often the earth has rotate around the sun since your birth. Of course everything is subjective in some sense like pain, but pain is still a fundemental part of us so i think you cant compare age and pain, altough they are both subjective, one is fundental in us....the same apllies to gender identity, so the comparison between gender identitty and age is stupid. The more accurate comparison would be maturity of someone, you know like foe example 10 year olds which brains are mature faster than others, and have a brain of a 40 year old or the other way around, adults who still have the brain of usually a 5 year old. PLEASE Hbomb/Contra, i know you can to this, please debunk Ben Shapiro's (and others like steven crowder, black pigeon speaks maybe?) claims about Transgender people and data ONCE AND FOR ALL &lt;333So, IIRC Natalie put the video on hold because she needed time to research, but I found a relatively popular Nintendo-focused video game Youtuber who identifies as male, uses masculine pronouns exclusively, crossdresses and identifies as a "trap". According to his twitter, he has a girlfriend.

Funny enough, as back as 2008, Transfolk had a problem with people assuming they were crossdressers, while now he, a crossdresser, has a problem with people assuming he is trans. 

This is his latest video, on Pokemon. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKHTZUfW5sQ


So, if there's anyway someone can pass this along to Contra so that she can interview him, pick his brain, or whatever, I think her video will be better off with first-hand sources. 




Okay. So I support the progressive cause, including LGBT rights as part of my personal political agenda/worldview. I vote democrat, give money to the party, and volunteer time to local political activism. I read revolutionary and feminist philosophy and try to be counter hegemonic in my life and actions.

I also totally end up agreeing with what the Justine character says in her debates with Tabby (Who I love and admire, a Tabby "Slash the Fash" sticker is on the laptop Im writing this on). Apparently, Justine is super transphobic in her views. "Whatever" I tell myself "they just dont get what she is saying"

Then something happened. I was hanging out with some friends, and they asked me if I would consider dating a girlfriend of theirs who happened to be transgender. I felt super uncomfortable, pled the fifth, they dropped the subject.

Now an Idea has sprouted in my head "What if, I ACT like a progressive but deep down have a bunch of transphobic ideas in my heart? what if I AM a bigot by Tabby standards, and only a progressive by Justine's worldview where performance IS reality." 

I mean, my parents say TERFy things all the time, but they still support the cause, they vote for LGBT rights, perform music at pride festivals, they gender trans people correctly. They Definitely do not " get it "though, and would almost certainly be called TERF's by people here. 

Now, Im probably overthinking this. Just vote Democrat, like the local pride parade on facebook and move on with my life. But the idea is interesting, how would you classify, in theory, people who hold bigoted worldviews in their hearts, but try to  fight for social justice, including trans rights? It reminds me of the thought experiment about the man who performs womanhood without being one his whole life. I mean, do such folks need to be purged, censured by the progressive community, or do we welcome and encourage their support (a votes a vote). I Guess Im asking whether I myself should be excluded from this conversation entirely XD

&amp;#x200B;

 Hey, I was thinking about vaporwave feminism and AESTHETIC as described by Natalie, and this video popped up in my feed. It actually predates Natalies video and potentially exists as an inspiration or influence for her. It even shares the same motifs of starting with an old TV getting its dial turned on low frame rate.

When the Incel video was posted it immediately became my favorite because of how much I felt I could relate to it, and also I'd never seen anyone to a more sympathetic analysis of that group of people. Since then, seeing how fast the views were pilying up, I kept popping back to it to see if it would beat the Peterson video. One month later, it has! 

Congrats to Natalie!!!! Really glad to see her audience continue to grow.Hi. I just watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfsbKmAcL2w&amp;t=3s) video discussing Nat's latest video and beneath it, I found an analysis of the video by a user called **Opinunate ted** which seems to be really worthwhile to read: 

Good video. Some points: Oscar Wilde was a gay man who belonged to a literary/artistic movement called "The aesthetics." His main points were that the artificial is better than the real, how things look and opera is more important than how they are and that the only function of art should be to be beautiful. His placement by Justine was intentional. Mao, in contrast, said "A revolution is not a dinner party, it is not a tapestry, a painting, a concert. It is not so refined. It is a conflict between classes." Art in Communist societies is meant to be functional. Tabby is wearing and surrounded by wearing communist symbols, even if she did identify as a type of Anarchist. She is also wearing ANIFA symbols, the two flags which symbolize Antifascism, and the letters ACAB which is used by some militant Anarchists to mean "All cops are bastards." (One I met had these letters tattooed to his arm inside a silhouette of a cat. He said that if the police ask him what it means, he says "All cats are beautiful." I wonder how widespread this is?) Also, "Wildcat" was a character in a British Anarchist comic, a young, androgynous female militant Anarchist who believes that action is more important than analysis. Depcicted as a cat. In a video debunking Jordan Peterson, Natalie used the famous Divine quote from pink Flamingoes as a summary of the philosophy of the Marque De Sade (who, she pointed out, is part of the western tradition). She was right. Sade's Nihilistic, hedonistic, inverted morality focused on the rights of people in power to do whatever they want, including every conceivable "perversion" up to and including torture and murder if they happened to enjoy it. Justine is the title of a sade book about a woman who is consistently immoral and triumphs. In another novel, her sister Juliette is consistently moral and fails and falls on the wrong side of the brutal power dynamics. I'm pretty sure I have met the prototype for this version of Tabby. She is a transwoman who belongs to a group called "The Degenderets." This subset of Antifa has a stated mission of carving out safe space for trans and gender variant people at protests, by force if necessary. They have carried baseball bats, color-coded to signify gender identity and sexual orientation. Recently, one trans woman in the group achieved notoriety by wearing a shirt saying "I punch TERFS". This was amplified when it became part of an art exhibit about the Degenerates shown at the San Francisco public library. There was so much controversy that the shirt was removed, but the baseball bats stayed. It turned out that the shirt was created by a cis woman, who wore it at the San Francisco Dyke March and got nothing but praise. Only when a trans woman was photographed wearing it did it get massive condemnation from some feminists. Anyway, I like the video, it was well thought out, but yes, on youtube, with trolls rushing to take stuff out of context to validate right wing, bigoted perspectives, I can see how some would regard it as problematic, too.﻿

I think this is the most thorough analysis I found until now and it had a bunge of really important points I havn't seen it brought up until now.So I have been talking to a lot of progressive's lately, critiquing the capitalist system in general, and framing our issues and values in a very Contra way.

These conversations though tend to devolve (from my POV) into a state of ideological demands, split up the biggest banks, guaranteed employment, expanded medicare ect... It leads to a situation like the Contrapoints vide where Justine is asking Tabby "Okay, im down, I agree with you, what should I do"

"REVOLUTION SMACH!", "Yes I get it, revolution, awesome, how do we do revolution, SPECIFICALLY"

Not a lot of our demands it are clearly articulated in ways that can get voted and passed in city council halls, implemented by a city manager or a governor or something. There are lots of lefty's with VERY specific policy goals, but these tend to be interest groups, and not very coordinated with the wider ideological corps.

So what kind of short term small goal realistic policy's do critics of capitalism begin proposing and fighting for. What is the guide for Justine politics, IE Aesthetically appropriate policys that are sexy to moderates, and passable within the overton window?  Just as importantly, how do we emphasize the Justine policys over the Tabby calls for revolution? Dont mistake this for a call for true moderation or something like that, no, Justine is no moderate. This is about building class consciousness on the downlow, how does one radicalize local politics without APPEARING radicalThere's very few links in the sidebar, and all the posts are very random.I happened to see an article about the whole  J. Michael Bailey/autogynephilia controversy that, in typical fashion, portrayed it as a bunch of PC leftists/trans activists trying to stifle open inquiry.  The article mentioned that one of the people leading this charge was a "transgender professor" Deirdre McCloskey.  This made my jaw drop because  Deirdre McCloskey is in fact a massively prominent *libertarian* economist who is super popular on the right.  How prominent a libertarian is she? Check out her cv.  [http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/main/vita.php](http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/main/vita.php)

Multiple awards with the name "Hayek" in them, including one "Hayek lifetime achievement award", an "Adam Smith Prize", multiple fellowships from various Koch funded think tanks, etc, etc.  In any non trans-related context where she is brought up, she'd be counted as "on the right" and referred to as a "libertarian economist".  But because she happens to be trans, when she criticizes Bailey for writing a book that was scientifically shoddy, damaging to trans people, and unethically researched... now she's considered an SJW?[From this twitter thread.](https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/922520305884647427)

&gt; With Halloween coming up, I've gotten several questions about whether I'm okay with cis people dressing up as me/Contra characters. Here's my official take on that, a thread:

&gt; What we're all trying to avoid here is jokey costumes where the joke is "lol trans people."

&gt; I drove for Uber on Halloween 2015, and saw a few cis guys dressing up as Vanity Fair Caitlyn Jenner and, oof, I sure side-eyed that shit.

&gt; So cis guys putting on a dress and lipstick and being like "lol, I'm ContraPoints"—I'd prefer it if you would nooooot do thaaaaaaat.

&gt; But if you want to dress up as any of my characters I'm completely fine with it, no matter your gender id. (Yes that includes the pink wig/lab coat look, which is not, believe it or not, how I actually dress off camera.)

&gt; This isn't even slightly problematic as I see it. You're not dressing up as me, you're dressing up as a character I invented.

&gt; Honestly I find it really adorable and flattering that people are even thinking of doing costumes based on me, a pretty obscure YouTuber.

&gt; So in short, go nuts with it, as long as 1. the joke/point of the costume isn't "lol I'm wearing a dress I'm trans lol" and 2. you send me pictures so I can favorite and retweet them.

&gt; Also, use common sense. It's not a good idea to dress up as Fritz because out of context that could be pretty threatening to people who aren't in on the joke.

TL;DR: Assuming her opinion hasn't changed, Natalie seems fine with anyone dressing up as her characters as long as the drag/character isn't the butt of the joke and that she gets photos.i feel like there should be oneI'm not sure if this post would be considered off topic, and if so, please send me quick bans off to the lands of incels and the Peterson band. However, I would just like to share something a bit personal, so if you want to skip my spiel about how I discovered ContraPoints in the first place (might be a bit too off topic), skip to the part titled "CLICKBAIT FOUND HERE!"

I first got into the YouTube University of Ideas and Cats when I was in middle school; up till then, I just watched video game clips. However, one day I found a channel (DarkMatter2525, not that important for this post) that told biblical, old testament stories in an animated and satirical manner, pointing out their less than logical and moral. I though they were funny, but they were also incredibly important to me, because before that point I never really thought about my faith as a Catholic. After months of thinking over it, I eventually lost my faith. Around High School, when I first got my smartphone, I started watching skeptic channels, and videos of Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens discussing religion. 

However, occasionally I'd see a strange toxicity to feminism or Islam, so when I heard about it too much from a channel, I stopped watching them. Also, most of them could get really, really smug. I can too, but I'm trying to work on that. Also, I admit that I too fell into the trap of disliking SJWs, and even once told a very left leaning girl at my high school that I agreed with feminism, but feminazis were a problem. Yeesh. (Also, if you haven't guessed it, I'm a white straight cis boy from an upper class household who plays a lot of video games. So not exactly the type you'd want to hear from about concerning critiques of feminism.)

However, during that same period of watching skeptic videos, I started watching videos from Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, which I think greatly helped me to realize just how many problems there were in America that disproportionally affected minorities. I'd consider that my gateway into thinking politically about what was going on in America.

After John Oliver, I went to watch a YouTube channel called Hbomberguy. I found him because of his video essays discussing video games, but I decided to check out his other videos, too, discussing the alt-right and the problems with them. After watching his videos, I eventually went to the channel Shaun and Jen, which I think helped me even more to further understand how many of the critiques of feminism or welfare policies were often based on fallacious reasoning.

Thing is, I didn't discover ContraPoints because of any videos criticizing TERFs or the alt-right, but rather her "Why I Quit Academia" video. After I saw that, the next video up seemed to be interesting, so I watched that too. After a couple more, I decided to watch pretty much all of her videos (there are probably a few I haven't watched yet from the earliest uploads). And honestly, I've got to say, she is one of my favorite YouTubers, if not my favorite. I love her sense of humor, her topics are always interesting and informative, she has a sense of style that I could never hope to match with, the list of positives go on and on.

 It's also amazing to be able to view the transition of someone from not really understanding what gender they are to a gorgeous example of sex reassignment surgery; that process being shared and visible alone, as well as her willingness to share her experiences, are more impactful for me than any essay or debate about gender theory. 

Also, yes, this is really problematic for the same reason she pointed out in he video on the Aesthetic, but for someone who never really met any trans individuals, it was a very helpful experience. It's not good how her looking so much like a woman is what it took to make me subconsciously perceive her as a woman, but I'm attempting to be honest here. I do believe that her example makes it easier for me to consider those earlier in transition or with a form less ideal after transition to be the gender they say they are. I'm sorry about that.

Now that that is over with,

"CLICKBAIT FOUND HERE!"
While I was slowly driven to the Left, my brother was driven to the Right (slightly, slightly). He is by no means alt-right, but he listens to much of Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro (who lean pretty hard into mostly traditional American conservative views). While I may have problems with them, I will not try to force him to stop listening to their points. 

However, recently when I brought up my problems with Crowder, specifically about his arguments concerning the gender binary, I brought up to him the problems with the points he was told about trans individuals (his views from Crowder were mostly opinions painted with rhetoric to sound like they were backed by facts, and Shapiro's arguments tended to be either using incorrect analogies or incorrect data. My brother really likes the "facts don't care about your feelings" mantra, so I think that my points at least somewhat helped him think about whether or not their arguments held merit.

So, I remembered that ContraPoints had a video going over the basics of the critique of the binary gender theory. So I asked my brother to watch "What is Gender?", and he agreed to at a later point. I think he'll do it tomorrow.

I've talked about all of this just to say that I think ContraPoints is exceptional because she is so thorough and reasonable with her explanations of complex topics that I think her points will be able to reach my brother. I don't expect him to become a trans activist or anything, but I do think this might help him get over the idea that "facts over feelings" is more than a catchphrase. I don't want to force him to the Left, but I do want to make sure that he chooses his political stances based off of evidence where he wants it, and his feelings where he wants it, with no one tricking him into thinking that his feelings are necessarily facts.

So thank you.

P.S. I don't like using the names of YouTubers when talking about them, so if I shouldn't have called the creator of ContraPoints "ContraPoints" throughout this whole thing, roast me on that shit.

P.P.S. I referred to ContraPoints as her, even when discussing the times when she had yet to fully identify as female consciously, because I don't really know how to treat such circumstances. Again, roast me on that shit.

TL;DR
I really need to thank ContraPoints for being a wonderful creator since the start, and I think her excellent writing and understanding of gender and relating information may greatly help to inform my family.So, right off the bat, I'm not sure if this is off-topic and someone with buttons can press them if they need to. I'm pretty sure someone's going to shit on me for coming off like an obsessed weirdo, which is alright because I am an obsessed weirdo. But, that said, I realize it's probably just the hormones and my soul-crushing loneliness I've been feeling since my libido's gone and done been replaced by a need to connect with a world I am disconnected from.

But, Natalie, I saw you say somewhere that if it was posted here you would see it and that's all I need.

Because it seems like you take people's criticisms and reactions very hard, sometimes and that you maybe struggle with being a public figure. So I really want you to know what a difference you've made to me.

I'm 36 now and when I was growing up transgender wasn't, as I'm sure you know, 'a little abnormal'. In fact, my only concept was having conflated it with an unflattering representation of a circus freak hermaphrodite in, I think, *Pee Wee's Big Top* for quite a long time. But I'd always been an effeminate guy and the only people I'd known who were accepting of that were drug addicts, which I was for many years. I was also an incel through my 20's and flirted with a lot of toxic thoughts about women, though the feminist in me resisted allowing them to take root and a did eventually meet a girl who accepted that part of me.

We broke up earlier in the spring, which was not a terrible break up and we're still quite close (I am happy to say I still have relationships with just about all of my ex's). I won't get into it all but among the things we talked about was that I was miserable and that she really thought I needed to transition. I'd done a lot of drag and many years ago I would joke that if I ever had testicular cancer, then I'd go all the way. I stopped joking about that, sometime ago and even when we were dating we talked about me wanting to transition. But I felt like it was too late for me. I was already in my 30's and I thought I couldn't be what I wanted to be, although I'd never looked into it.

And then I found you. I had followed Blair for a while, often shouting at her into the void in the comments section of her videos. I remember watching part of that debate and not thinking much, I feel like a fool admitting it but I can't lie to you. I eventually found your channel and began watching your content and just being so refreshed to hear an intelligent, articulate counter-argument. I watched so much of it.

This was back when you were identifying as gender-queer, I think. And then you started to transition and it just blew my mind. This was a thing people did. This was a thing you were doing. I remember thinking that you aren't that much older than me and whatever excuses I had started to fail me and then I was really torn. But watching you has been so encouraging and your words have meant so, so very much to me.

I decided I would transition, I think, four or five months ago. I've been on hormones for almost a month, so I'm still a baby. I'm a little lost. I don't have many (any) social outlets and, like I said, my libido is more or less gone. Stuff still functions, I'm happy to say but I just don't get that feeling of my brain being hijacked by tits and needing to do something about it. But that's just left me wanting so much to just connect. I'm starting a trans support group on Tuesday, so that will probably be nice.

I'm very lucky in that I have nice features and a petite frame; my doctor says she thinks I'm going to feminize beautifully and she seems almost as excited as I am. My only real problem is my facial hair, which is quite thick and can be seen even when I shave myself raw. But I'll figure it out. I already feel beautiful and I already feel happier and more at peace with everything about myself, even if right now I am alone. I am no longer imprisoned and I am alone in the sun and even alone, I feel your light warming my skin from wherever you are.

Thank you, Natalie Wynn.  
I did not do this because of you, but I don't think I would have ever done it without you.

I had a dream the other night, I think it's the third time you've been in my dreams. All I can remember is that I sang 'Landslide' by Fleetwood Mac, though it wasn't that exactly. The lyrics were different and it expressed how much you have meant to me and I sang it more beautifully than I ever could. So I wrote you this love letter, instead. I am sorry it was so long; you don't need to have read it. I will just pretend that you did.

But some day, if a short, pretty girl with a pixie cut whose age is only given away by her sharp eyes starts singing Fleetwood Mac to you out of nowhere, I do hope you won't be entirely surprised.  


Love,

Lilith  
I think that would be neat. Hey fellow Contrapoints fans,   
  Since I'm guessing at least some of you a politically-obsessed leftists like me, I'm wondering what you think of so-called 'Brocialists' vs other leftists. The thing is, since the rise of Trump, there's been a lot of talk about whether people voted for him out of 'economic anxiety' which led to talking about obsolete jobs and modernization etc.     
  

Some leftists who (rightly) criticized Trump, also, (to me at least) seemed to criticize his supporters for being 'obsolete'/rust belt workers who are simply helplessly flailing against a world that is relentlessly passing them by. This spiel by some leftists always annoyed me as it seemed  almost classist. Sort of a 'F\*\*k you, I've got mine, you guys just stop being racist arseholes and sort yourselves out. Move to a city and get a job in a juice bar' type of mentality. This thinking combined with the (false, I'm now sure of) belief that many leftists overly prioritize culture/identity politics over economic politics, led me dangerously towards this 'Brocialist' way of thinking. Obviously in found and still find all forms of racism, transphobia, sexism and all the other intolerances reprehensible, but when a large group of people complain about the loss of stable, well=paying jobs, some people who called themselves leftists, seemed to be able to say little more than 'You're obsolete. Deal with it'.     


  I gradually began to think that the only way to be a modern, leftist was to become fully tolerant of all identities, but competently *intolerant* of those who couldn't make it economically in today's society. This coupled with my reasoning that being tolerant of identities costs the rich nothing, while helping people out monetarily (welfare/better wages/free healthcare etc.) cost a hell of a lot was leading me to an unhealthy way of thinking.     
  The happy ending to all of this is that I discovered 'Leftist' Youtube Channels like Shaun, Hbomberguy, Contrapoints, and Philosophy Tube, who crucially are very 'woke' in the identity politics sense, but are also unafraid to to talk about 'old leftist' topics like class and economic inequality. Thus, I quickly realized that 'identity politics' 'economic' leftism can (and maybe even should?) happily coexist.       


Sorry for the essay, guys. Have any of you ever felt anything similar to what I used to think? Or did I completely misunderstand things?     
  I stumbled across this sentence in the book “This Book Is Gay” (2018 edition, page 136), and it really struck me. **“Becoming trans requires work.”** It’s just four words, but I feel like it packs quite a punch – both the “*becoming* trans” (as opposed to “*being* trans”) and the “*requires* work” probably wouldn’t go down well over at r/traa, but to me it feels like something that e. g. Justine might say, though I’m not sure if it matches Natalie’s own views.

What do you think? (Apologies if this isn’t too relevant to this subreddit… I just had to post this somewhere.)There was an impeachment against the leftist Dilma Rouseff because of her monetary policy. And there was a dubious corruption case against the leftist Lula who drove millions of people out of poverty. The neoliberal Temer acceded to the power who destroyed many of the Unions and lots of the laboral rights. So this paved the way for the ex military and supported by evangelists and the rich rural landowners Bolsonaro. He supports brazilian dictatorship that killed hundreds of people and tortured many.

&amp;#x200B;

You guys need to know what's happening in the 4th democracy of the world and one of the most important countries in Latin America. I imagine most of you are in the first world and do not know what is happening. Trump is a sweety democrat on the side of Bolsonaro.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, Brazil's almost half of the population is black.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the sayings of Bolsonaro:

"I went to Eldorado, there was a population of afrodescendants. The skimmest weighted 70kg. They don't do anything. They aren't even useful to procreate."

"Easy, Maria del rosario (MP of the congress). A few days ago you called me a rapist. I wouldn't rape you because you don't deserve it."

"If you see your son who seems to become a little like this, a little gay, you have to give him a good smack to change his behaviour"

"I could not love an homosexual son."

"I wouldn't give a woman the same wage than to a man. They have an extra right"

"Minorities have to adecquate to majorities, or they just disappear"

"I am in favour of torture"

"You can't change things in this country through the vote. It will only change something if we are in civil war. And we do the job that the military dictatorship\`didn't do. Kill 30 thousand people."pretty straightforward. i'm of the opinion that it doesn't necessarily do fuck all, and that the system will just put on someone who puts out a different rhetoric and sounds different, but in effect is still a neoliberal/neocon shithead that does all the same shitty things as the other side, just with a different veneer. Just asking bc I recently turned 18 and registered to vote just cause, and I'm curious to see what you people think.This video gives a good summation of why Trump supporters could be convinced to support great policies: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMSM1SoWTIE&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMSM1SoWTIE&amp;t=1s)

Off the top of my head - most republican voters support free healthcare and free college.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact is the hate we should spew on republican politicians isn't equivalent to what should be spewed on most republican voters.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's a lot of standoff-ish ppl in this part of the leftist-sphere, so that's why I wanted to contribute my zen understanding of things.

&amp;#x200B;

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Regularly people want to post something on this subreddit that is not directly related to ContraPoints. Content that perhaps is of interest to leftists, content which talks about the extreme right and/ or content related to LGBT+ issues, or just content people think that fans of ContraPoints will enjoy.

We don't normally allow such posts. But, since people do keep asking and since a lot of these links they offer are interesting and useful and also because I just can't say no to you lovely people I have decided to make this stickied thread.

-----------------------------------------------------

This thread may be (temporarily) removed if and when we need the sticky slot for something else.

This mega-thread is a place where fans of ContraPoints can post links to interesting content that are not directly related to Contra, but which are Contra-adjacent.

That small leftist youtuber you want to draw peoples attention to? A news article about transgender issues? A question about catgirls or catboys? Post them in this thread.
[My post.](https://zesstradyrr.tumblr.com/post/178954804730/thoughts-on-incels-by-contrapoints) It’s over 2500 words and written partly as stream of consciousness commentary as I watched it a second time. I feel like she's part of the HBomber, Contra, Shaun, etc. family.https://youtu.be/IBUuBd5VRbY?t=1020

Does anyone know what is coded or conveyed here? 
I get that the first word is "BEHOLDINGMAN", but I don't understand the rest of the message.

Also, just generally, what is going on in all the enigmas/subliminal flashes in the Free Speech videos?So Michael Brooks (who i admire) called Jordan Peterson a New Atheist phenomenon. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKm3\_QtGLiA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKm3_QtGLiA)

If we're only counting Youtube and Reddit Peterson is despised by those secular communities.

The only way that proposition by Brooks makes sense is if he's using New Atheist as a stand in for anti-sjw.

Jordan FUCKING Peterson, the guy who got smacked around by Matt Dillahunty for claiming atheists aren't real (unless they someone).

I can't even grasp this bs by Brooks. WTF?I just rewatched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TebCHHCw9rY) by Hbomberguy on a ctrl-alt-del and realized again how influential Natalie has been on her small corner of youtube.  There's this growing and beautiful trend among video-essayists (especially Hbomberguy, philosophytube, and Lindsay Ellis, aka Natalie's friends) to break out of the essay and add some surreal meta-narrative.

How would you label the genre?

Edit:  Hbomberguy came in here and schooled me, my life is complete.  Thank you daddy.[Made a comment a month ago in this thread and it got a positive response, so I'm gonna propose it to the sub in more detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/9geodi/new_video_tomorrow_on_catgirls/e63qxtq/) (And who knows, maybe Natalie is browsing the front page of this subreddit? 👀)

Natalie is known for her rigorous historical research in videos such as "The West" and "America: Still Racist". I'd like her to use her research skills to debunk common Tankie myths. I think "Tankies" would be a good topic for a video for a few reasons:

1. Yeah I'm sure most tankies will still be in denial, but it wouldn't hurt to have a video link on hand for the next person who claims Stalin and Mao did nothing wrong; maybe at least a few of them will listen and think a little harder about why they feel the need to defend authoritarian dictators who died 60 years ago (a bit of philosophical analysis on why people latch onto these myths in the first place would also be a good angle for Natalie to include)

2. It would be good optics towards the center-Left, centrists, and conservatives who think all far-Left ideology is synonymous with Soviet apologism. It's frustrating how many people hear the word "socialism" and immediately think the person saying it approves of all the regimes that have used that word. I think seeing Natalie disavow and debunk Tankie talking points would be helpful in getting some of these people to open their minds a bit.

3. Tatiana Tankikova only had a few seconds of screentime in the only video she appeared in ("What's Wrong With Capitalism: Part 2"), but she seems to be a fun character that a lot of people want to see come back (there was even enough demand for a [T-shirt](https://www.teepublic.com/t-shirt/2577309-tatiana-tankikova) apparently). Having her play a big role in a video about Tankies is a no-brainer. Plus since winter is coming up soon we could get some ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ cutaway gags or skits set out in her natural habitat (surely a snowy Maryland wood can pass for Siberia in a YouTube production?)

So yeah what do ya'll think? I honestly have no idea what topics Natalie will cover in the next few videos, but I think this could be a great choice.

EDIT: In the comments /u/OdaibaBay has suggested the possibility of her doing "a video about the Soviet Union, and how leftists in the modern era relate to it" which I think could be an interesting alternative if she doesn't want to do a video entirely focused on Tankies in particular (maybe they could just be discussed as a smaller part of such a video?). The complex historical and cultural legacy of the USSR is something that is kinda unavoidable whenever the topic of far-Left thought comes up in a discussion, and a video about that could be useful and informative. It could also be helpful in debunking the myths from both sides of the aisle. While Tankies tend to deny or attempt to justify the crimes of the USSR, there are also a lot of Americans who are entirely ignorant of the positive accomplishments of the USSR due to all the Cold War Propaganda smear campaigns it's been dragged through. In short, I think everyone could benefit from a more nuanced understanding.

Also I want to clarify that I never expected her to make a video that was just "OWNING THE TANKIES EPIC STYLE" or "ContraPoints DESTROYS Tankies"; she doesn't really do that kind of video anyway. All of her videos contain a level of sympathy and understanding towards why people believe what they do, and her main tool seems to be seduction rather than destruction. I'd expect her to keep that style when speaking about Tankies. I don't think "throwing them under the bus" or "obliterating" them so to speak is good optics, but I think a healthy bit of perspective could be.

EDIT 2: I also want to clarify that I don't think Tankies are in any way equivalent to authoritarian Far Right proponents, nor do I think they pose anywhere near the same threat that White Nationalism does to our society. For anyone who is trying to do the "both sides are just as bad" thing here, I'd encourage you to just not, because I don't think it's very helpful. Tankies are a fringe group of a fringe group, and while I think a video or a segment of a video on them could be interesting and possibly useful, I don't think they are anywhere near the same type of pressing concern as the Far-Right. I mainly proposed this idea because I thought it would be interesting and perhaps useful in addressing a gap in understanding, and because after Natalie said that talking about White Nationalism is "very last season" in her *America: Still Racist* video, it seems that there is a wider range of topics she's willing to address. I honestly have no idea what the next few videos will be about, and this was just an idea. I trust that if she thinks this is a bad idea to make a video on, she simply won't do it.[As mentioned in this tweet.](https://mobile.twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/1052973434152603648) ~~I can't believe she's a Libra too.~~

Any suggestions as to how we can validate and celebrate Natalie without coming across as parasocially challenged stans?

&amp;#x200B;There was a post last week about the brazilian elections, I thought to write this to make it clear how we arrived at this point, if you'd rather see a video instead of reading a very long post, here are some suggestions.

-------------------------
So, one possible point to start is 1964, when a US-backed coup installed a military dictatorship in Brazil, to “prevent” the very faint threat of communism in the form of a left-leaning president, of course. Thousands of political prisoners and hundreds of tortured, dead and disappeared people (including children) later, Brazil hosts its first presidential election in 1985, 21 years later.


Fast forward to 2002, Lula, from the leftist Worker’s Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores or PT in portuguese) is elected as president. Threats of a radical new communist president become unfounded as he was quite willing to work with companies and the market in his new government. The next 8 years (he was reelected) were marked by solid economic growth, reduction of income inequality and expansion of social programs, he left the presidency enjoying incredible popularity, which was only tainted by a corruption scandal in 2005 involving his party, however, there wasn’t evidence of Lula’s involvement. The largest opposition to him was some sectors of the elite, including the largest media organization in Brazil (by far), Globo.


Some background in brazilian politics: we have a multi-party system with over 30 parties, most of the population can only name a few of those. The main ones are PT, previously mentioned, PSDB (brazilian social-democratic party) and MDB (formerly PMDB), the presidency was traditionally disputed between PT, which represents the left, and PSDB, which represents the right. PMDB is/was the largest party in Brazil and they have no real ideology, they just sway to whichever way gives them more power.


In 2010 Lula named Dilma Roussef his successor, to strengthen her candidacy, they formed an alliance with MDB, her vice-president was then decided to be Michel Temer, a member of said party. It worked and the first women president of Brazil was elected. This was when economic growth became weaker and weaker, the growth in the past decade was in great part propelled by the expansion of credit in the country, which reached its limit, and increasing commodity demand from China, which significantly slowed down. As it became clear that the World Cup and the Olympics infra-structure building was filled with corruption and constantly getting delayed, her approval only plummeted. This all culminated in the very large 2013 protests, which reflected the discontentment from many different sectors in the society, they were largely aimless and failed to present any concrete demands or change anything.

In 2014, Dilma managed to narrowly beat Aécio Neves (from PSDB) in an increasingly polarized country. Earlier in the year the so called operation Car Wash started, it was an anti-corruption operation that unveiled big corruption schemes and jailed a considerable number of politicians. PT was heavily hit by it, it was not the only party and not even the one with most involvement in it, PSDB and MDB were also at least as involved. There is no excuse for this, PT was full of corrupt politicians, but the media specially focused on them in detriment of the other parties, which cemented a relationship of corruption and PT in many brazilian’s minds.

In 2016, Dilma’s popularity was incredibly low, the economy was in recession, she had no support in congress, including from MDB, which was desperate to put one of them in power to end the corruption hunt going on. That was when the impeachment process started, the charges against her were relatively minor, what was called "fiscal pedaling": an accounting maneuver to give the false impression that more money was received than was spent, as wikipedia puts it. While the process was legal, it was very clear that no other president with support from the congress would be impeached by it, that led many to call the impeachment a coup.

The new president was now Michel Temer, Dilma’s former ally and probably current enemy. His presidency was very unpopular, marked by spending cuts, specially in health and education, retirement reform, and weaker labor laws. Also he was involved in corruption way worse than Dilma’s, but that obviously did not lead to any impeachment.

Lula, which is still popular, was then planning to be PT’s candidate for this election. However, he got involved in a corruption case. The charges were that he received an apartment complex from a company (well-known to be corrupt) in exchange for political favors. His case was judged in record time (obviously politically motivated) and he was put in jail, meaning that he now can’t run for presidency, which he would likely win.

-------------------------

Now, we get to this year’s election: the four main contenders were Haddad, PT’s candidate, Alckmin, PSDB’s candidate, Ciro, PDT’s (center-left) candidate and our own fascist, Bolsonaro from PSL.

Bolsonaro was a congressman for almost 30 years with very little to show for it (except for all the family he elected using his name), he started gaining popularity for his incredibly absurd statements, pro-military dictatorship stance, and anger with PT. Some of those include (I can give more and source each one, if anyone wants it):

* A good criminal is a dead criminal (his slogan at this point)

* I would rather have a dead son than a gay son

* Women are paid less because they get pregnant

* I would only accept the election results if I win

* The dictatorship should have killed/tortured more people

* I would close the congress if elected

* Referred to quilombolas(people living in communities formed from fugitive slaves) using language used for cattle

and many more, really, if there’s a fascist, prejudiced position, he probably holds it. There were many cases of bolsonaro supporters attacking and even murdering women and LGBT people (one girl had a swastika “drawn” in her belly with a knife) during this election season.

Well, in a country full of prejudiced people angry at the system, with an incredibly high murder rate, living in an economic recession, and receiving anti-PT fake news via WhatsApp all day (frequently involving  a communist revolution and turning Brazil into Venezuela), he became the most popular candidate.

Alckmin(PSDB) didn’t attack him hoping that he would benefit from all this anti-PT sentiment. He didn’t, people were also angry at “the system” and PSDB is very much from the system.

Ciro (PDT) was the only one with a good chance of winning against Bolsonaro in the second round. However, PT decided to not support him and preferred their own candidacy, even with their staggering rejection rates. Result: The left was fragmented and Ciro came in third with about 13% of the votes.

As for PT, they tried to maintain that Lula would be the candidate for as long as possible, when they couldn’t do it anymore, they tried to sell Haddad as basically the same person as Lula. It partially worked, they got about 29% of the votes and advanced into the second round.

Bolsonaro, got 46% of the votes, a clear favorite for the second round.

Now, we’re in a situation where the majority of the country hates PT so strongly that they will vote for the proto-dictator fascist that is Bolsonaro, because he is the most anti-PT of all candidates, even if he checks all the authoritarian boxes. If the parties had united against a common threat, we might had prevented this from happening, but now it’s too late, all the polls shows him winning.

At this point, all I can do is cast a single vote (the second round is the 28th of October), watch this disaster happen and hide my gay ass.

Also, do you guys remember Cambridge Analytica and Steve Bannon? The ones who helped Trump by spreading fake news through facebook? Well, there was a video in which they announced that they would be working in Brazil. Bolsonaro’s son met Bannon and insinuated they were working together. And, as I mentioned, this election was marked by pro-bolsonaro fake news being spread via WhatsApp. You guys can connect the dots.

I know and love Philosophy Tube. Who else is good?Thanks to u/sapphorainbow's post, I have decided I want to represent one of my favorite educational personalities, but I want to make sure the places providing stickers and stuff aren't the only ones banking off of her hard work and IP, so does anyone know if Natalie is at all connected with the places selling stuff from her show?

https://www.teepublic.com/stickers/contrapoints

I refuse to throw money at capitalist exploiter dogs unless the CommieCat gets her chunk of the catnip too....and it's been a hard, crappy day for transgender peeps in the US, so this is a small way to cheer up Natalie, and possibly those here on this subreddit that need it.

So let's all say one thing we love/appreciate about Natalie and Contrapoints.

I'll start: There's an underlying message in all of Natalie's work that art is important and enriching to our world. While this is, to some extent, a given among many of her fans, I don't think anyone makes it the core of their work, or expresses it with the same panache as Natalie. Rock on, gold dust woman!

(PS ugh, of course there's a grammar mistake it the title, sorry about that)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B; I saw a turtle at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly. Hi everyone! 

A friend just send me a link to a local political story about a politician of the left being attacked because she was wearing a Rolex watch.

I'm a big fan of ContraPoints, have recently watched all her videos again and I know there's a perfect line about this kind of situation. She said *something like this*:

*When I was poor, I wasn't allowed to criticize capitalism, because it would be self-serving.*

*Now that I have enough money, I'm not allowed to criticize capitalism, because it would be hypocritical.*

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I couldn't find the correct quote or the video it comes from with google. So before I start to watch all of her videos again, I thought maybe one of you knows it and can help me? &lt;3I'm considering joining. Does she let her patrons on the progress of her next video?[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/23/white-supremacist-richard-spencer-physical-abuse-divorce-filings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/23/white-supremacist-richard-spencer-physical-abuse-divorce-filings)

I got into it because they're quick to point out how women, gays, etc., are treated in Africa and the Middle East, and while I'm still skeptical about immigration, I'm not a white nationalist anymore, and this is just another example of why I left the movement. They point out how badly Islamists treat women and then beat their own wives in front of their kids and claim women only understand violence. Fucking disgusting

&amp;#x200B;i can't respond to comments on my own post but i can still post. am confused. issue with this sub or is my internet just that shit?And I barely recognize her voice! It's weird. I can't imagine how she feels when watches these old videos. Does this sub have a discord server? I'm just looking for a place to talk with people who share CP's views or similar far leftistsI love Contra as much as the next trans female anarcho-syndicalist queer cat-girl and I just don't feel like this sub does enough to foster quality discussion. Case in point, the only post made here in the last two days (that hasn't been taken down) is someone asking for somewhere else to talk about ContraPoints. I think there are a few things the mods could do to make the sub a better place.

1. There should be a recurring sticky for each new episode. This is something that lots of TV subs do to help encourage discussion in a way that keeps it centralised and non fragmented and I think it could go a long way here. Looking at the front page of the sub, I can't see a single thread about "The Aesthetic" which IMO is a big problem as the entire point of this sub is to discuss Natalie's content.

2. A similar weekly or bi-weekly sticky for discussion of an old episode that rotates through her videos would help to keep discussion fresh and prevent the sub from stagnating. This would also allow newer viewers a better chance to talk about her older videos as they watch them at their own pace. For anyone who's worried about running out of videos, even if we did this weekly instead of bi-weekly, if we started this now then that would leave us with 44 weeks worth of discussion threads, not including discussions for any new videos made in that time. By then people who commented in the old threads might have new ideas about the videos and people who didn't comment or joined the sub after they were made would get a chance to take part in the discussion.

3. The rules should be expanded on and made more comprehensive and less fragmented. Get rid of the "da rules" sticky entirely, expand on the points you made and make them more concise, and then move them into the sidebar. People who really need to know what the rules are aren't going to come here and read the sticky, not to mention the fact that it's just confusing that what's in the side bar doesn't align with the sticky. Edit: Having been told that the sidebar on old/new reddit is different I went and compared the two and discovered that they are both equally worthless in terms of telling me what the rules are.

4. This is a smaller point and would probably be a lot harder than the others but I think we could do with a decent wiki. Honestly I'm not sure what a good wiki for Contra would look like but I know that what we currently have is hardly any good. Perhaps a list of episodes/characters with a summary? Maybe a simple paragraph or two outlining who Natalie is and what she does? Possibly an FAQ to prevent common reposts? ~~There is also a point in the wiki about how asking for her older videos is banned which further fragments the rules and adds confusion.~~ EDIT: I just realised that there isn't actually a wiki at all, this information is in the side bar which on mobile is listed as "Community Info" which I presumed was the wiki when I wrote this post

5. @the mods, you guys are *way* too heavy handed and you should really dial it down. Sorry, but it's ~~true~~ my opinion and the opinion of many others on this sub. I understand that you are trying to follow Natalie's point about how certain forms of speech can be oppressive (which I agree with!) but I think you take it too far. I've seen multiple completely harmless discussions removed and it really discourages and limits discussions when people don't even know what they are and aren't allowed to say. I also think that this Contra-dicts a lot of the spirit of Natalie's channel in regard to challenging and defeating bad ideas and it discourages those willing to learn from taking part in discussion here which just makes us seem like the conservative caricature of what leftists are. I'm not asking you to make this a free speech zone or anything, just clarify the rules and don't be quite as draconian.

These are all the things I could come up with that I think would really improve the state of the sub, please let me know what you think and add any suggestions of your own below, even if they directly contradict my own suggestions! The purpose of this post is to get a discussion going so that this sub can become a better place, so in the spirit of that please add your thoughts instead of just downvoting my post because you didn't like one of my points.

I'd really appreciate some mod feedback too, it would be nice to know that you're interested in hearing from the community and in improving the state of this sub.

Edit: Improved wording, formatting, and grammar(Sorry if this is a little poorly worded or rambly, I have a real bad headache and am a little high on pain meds lol.)

&amp;#x200B;

Natalie has mentioned in the past that there are a few of her older videos that she's not entirely satisfied with looking back on them, and there are a few other videos she's made that, while not necessarily outdated or anything, could maybe use an update because either things have changed around the topic or because Natalie has changed some of her opinions on it. I think it might be a good idea for her to go over them again someday (if she ever feels like it of course lol,) so out of curiosity, are there any topics that you'd maybe like to see her revisit?

&amp;#x200B;

I think a big one for me is honestly Trump tbh. She's touched on his presidency a lot, but she hasn't actually dedicated a video to him in almost two years now and there have been a lot of things that have come up since then that I think doing another video on him would be really beneficial. Natalie's videos have done a really great job at helping change their views about people or groups (most notably with her How to Recognize a Fascist, JBP and Incels videos,) and I think that another video on Trump would be able to point a lot of Trump supporters (or people who are neutral towards him) to reassessing their views on him.

&amp;#x200B;

On a smaller note, one of the things I've always had trouble with recommending ContraPoints to more right-leaning (and even center) friends is that Natalie has described Trump as a Proto-Fascist in a few of her videos. While it's something I do certainly agree with her on, it's made it difficult to actually get people to watch her videos because then I end up having to argue with them about Trump or else they just get dismissive of her right off the bat; maybe having an "Is Trump a Fascist?" kind of video would be a good thing to be able to direct people towards in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any topics you'd like to see Natalie cover again someday?  


EDIT: Spelling.It did not go as well as I hoped. Let me give you a bit of a back story. I am using a throwaway because my girlfriend knows my main Reddit. 

I found out about Contrapoints about a year ago and since then I became a huge fan. I was never a big youtuber, but I’ve seen all of her videos. (She is my only subscription on my channel except for a subscription to a channel about philosophy my aunt suggested but I never watched. So i don’t have many subscriptions and its a small channel.) 

I am 19 years old now. I met my girlfriend when we were 17 in high school. When I was 18 I moved out and began to go to the local university. My girlfriend is the same age as I am and she started classes there too. When I moved out is around the time I started watching Contrapoints’ videos and I took the battle against fascist dogwhistlers to heart. Mostly because I was a very bigoted person before. So I kept my new political views very PC (I have a roommate who helps) and I was finally able to think the way that I wanted since I moved out. Mostly I kept my thoughts simple and inclusive. I also have a big poster of Natalie Wynn in my room. 

When I began to see how important Contrapoints had become in my life I started trying to get my girlfriend interested. But she did not seem very interested. I thought Natalie could help her a lot, because when we met and she lived at home she was a very bigoted and cisnormative person also. We both were then. Since she moved out also and got a roommate it has gotten even worse for her. I would say her rhetoric is about fifty percent more bigoted/racist than it was. She is using offensive slurs a lot. She is also very centrist with her philosophy classes and note taking (somehow she is still getting all As, I got all As too my first semester but I also got two Cs). I can't even read or understand the racist notes on Nietzsche she takes for her philosophy class. I tried to tell her to be more accepting and less hateful with it, that it would help her more, but I think it got annoying for her to hear it. 

Anyway when we would hang out I would try to get her to listen to Contrapoints’ videos but it always seemed like a chore or like she didn't really want to. I found it really frustrating because Natalie was so inspiring for me. Eventually I stopped putting them on because I would hear and see her sigh in an exaggerated way when I would put YouTube on with her videos. 

Not long ago it was coming up on the day that we met (our anniversary) and we had a nice dinner at a seafood place we both really like. A few days later I got her a Patreon subscription to Contrapoints. I had hoped that it would be better than the videos. She seemed excited to use the Patreon perks and we had a nice night together.  

The next day we didn't talk, which is normal these days with school and stuff. I sent her a text message the day after and she didn't respond which I thought was weird. Then I did it the day after and still no response. She didn't write back to me for four days! Until I sent her a long message just asking for an explanation for why she ghosted me or at least let me know she is okay. 

A few days later she finally sent me a long email. She said that she wanted some space and that she needed to think. That things were changing and that they weren't the same as they were. She actually blamed Contrapoints for changing me! Which is true but I thought I changed for the better. She said I was being really strict with the anti-fascist rhetoric now and that I was saying too much about her being bigoted. That I wasn't fun any more. And also she said that she wanted to see other people and that she wasn't sure I was the person she wanted to be with forever in a relationship. This was very disappointing to see her go against monogamous relationships. 

That isn't all though. I talked to a mutual friend of ours and she told me some things really candidly. Our friend said that after seeing Natalie on her AMA Stream my girlfriend was really weirded out. Because I cried a little bit and there were other men crying in the chat too. (I didn't think this was fair, there is no shame in crying.) Also that she felt like following Natalie’s advice made me kind of less fun and more boring than how I was when we met at 17. Basically that she thought I became a little too "obsessed" with her. She also said that my girlfriend thought some of the things Contrapoints said about trump supporters were mean and far-fetched. And then she (not my girlfriend but our friend) said she researched Contrapoints and that she hated conservative men and kind of scolded me. I told her that was just Neo-Nazi/MRA propaganda, that Contrapoints wasn't really like that and she just didn't understand her. She said I was "talking down" to her and that is why my girlfriend left me. (I don't think she left me she never said she didn't want to see me any more btw.) 

Anyway what do I do? How do I fix this and get our friend and my girlfriend to be okay with Contrapoints? Curious to know the political leanings and values of people on this subreddit, and if you can recommend any resources so I may learn more about them.

I only know perhaps a handful of ContraPoints' material, and she has really peaked my interest in anti-oppressive politics, social justice, and Left-leaning politics. Do you have any resources where I may learn more on that?

Thank you.jordan peterson speaks at the fien de la mar theatre in amsterdam. i want to troll him by standing outside with a sign. 

i was thinking 'where's my daddy?"
with contra in the bath tub below that sign. maybe a URL under it.

unless someone has a better idea?I've noticed some of Contra's streams have been gone for a while, and after the recent ordeal she seems to have delisted her transition updates. Is there any chance of videos on her main channel going away? I was born and still am in the south. So I don't much of a chance to hear leftist views. On YouTube I heard of Blair White which lead me to Bing watch her content, that's when I came across her live debate with Contra. While I initially thought she wasn't anyway nearly as smart as as White I I went to her channel. After watching her content I was hooked. It was engaging,funny, and informative. She has my one of my favorite channels on YouTube . The debate gave me the wrong impression of her. Especially with how she wasn't called by her name in the title. Hearing about the hate she received is disheartening because it might allow people like me to learn of her. What do you guys think on it and please make sure to tell your tale! It seems like she can play piano (and guitar??) and she seems to enjoy classical music but has she ever said anything more about that? Did she take lessons or classes (esp in college)? Or is she just a general music nerd?Hello, do we have a discord server for ContraPoints shit? It'd be cool to connect with the community.So let me start off by saying that, before watching Contra, I was really confused about my dysphoria, to the point of not even thinking of it as such; her video on it actually helped validate a lot of things for me. 

That said, I've struggled to find anything on the topic that is as heartfelt and introspective as Contra's video, and I'm wondering if you guys might have any recommendations. 
Just wondering. When watching Contra's "How I Became a Feminist SJW" and I found a lot of similarities between her story and mine, and I was wondering if y'all had a similar experience. Okay, so her videos are good and all, but I was just thinking a reading list surrounding the channel/this sub would also be a cool idea in the interest of broadening ourselves and stuff.I am sure if you are on this subreddit, you have heard this insult directed at yourself or someone else. Now let's deconstruct this insult, shall we?

'Leftist' is pretty straight forward. It positions the insulter on the opposite side of the political spectrum. Also the fabled 'centrist' in theory shouldn't use that word as a centrist is in theory someone that sees the good on both sides and tires to combine them for the optimum result. In reality Centrists are just right wingers that don't want to admit it. Because for some explicable reason their compromise will always be pretty close to the demands of the right. So those people will (and have) used this insult before. 

Now let's jump to 'cuck'. Cuck has mostly lost it's meaning over the past 2 years, how it tends to do with insults that are thrown around constantly (like moron, that once used to be the official word for disabled people but now is just a synonym for idiot). But in it's original meaning Cuckoldry is a porn practice where a couple takes in a stranger (mostly black) man that will then fuck the woman while the man just stands next to it and watches. 
The original people who invented the insult cuck, were without a doubt white nationalists. Because 'cuck' stands for everything they fear: emasculation and white genocide. Not only does the black man in this scenario 'steal' the wife; since they are having sex, the pure white genpool is getting compromised. So when 'cuck' first appeared you could be certain that the one using it was a Racist. But nowadays it has been parroted so much by useful idiots that it's just a regular insult devoid of it's original meaning (for most at least; the white nationalist still uses it with the same fear he had at the start). 

Now to the meat of this all why I even made this long winded Post: 'globalist'. This one is fascinating. It shows how little the right actually understands of their own economic system. At any time you ask a right winger if he preferred less or more state interference, he will always vote for less. No regulations, no taxes, no nothing. Capitalism is best left alone and everything will sort it self out. That is their believe. 

But now that they basically achieved their goal (because lets be honest, the only way to deregulate the market even more now would be to completely disband the Government) they freak out. They discovered this thing called "globalisation" that apparently means that a Chinese worker will do your job from now on because in China there are no worker unions or an OSH Act. But most importantly the Chinese worker only makes a fraction of the money you make. 

Now this is the moment in life a right wingers believe is challenged. Could it be that capitalism unchecked, might be not such a good idea at all? But that contradicts his entire world view, which would mean he was wrong. And if there is one thing people don't want to be its in the wrong. They rather start a war then to declare they fucked up. And so the right winger has to double down and find someone that is responsible why his favorite system produces so horrible results, and since he is not a pretty creative man he'll just blame the guy he can't stand already: the one on the left. 

And thus globalisation, an inevitable result of unchecked capitalism and free market which the right always advocate for, is now the fault of the left. "Because they... they are Cucks! They WANT the Niggers to take over! They WANT that I lose my job to a Chinaman! These leftist globalist cucks! They say foreingers are people too with their brown money grabbing hands! They want to destroy my country!" This or something like this is the original thought process that created the insult. 

This concludes my deconstruction of the term 'Leftist Globalist Cuck'. Has anybody been keeping up with Anita Sarkeesian's videos?  I don't know if she has always had this in her or is this from the influence of the recent wave of Feminist Youtubers (I almost called them the "Younger generation" lol) but her most recent video is like a polar opposite of her super dry Tropes vs Women show. 

I like it, she seems more comfortable talking about movies than video games. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-bnANSqhE

It's not Lindsay Ellis levels, but it's still pretty charming. Also this videos have like less than 3000 views on average, WTF? It would be cool to see a video like "TERFs" or "The Left" where she argues both sides of Blanchardianism. I'd be interested in hearing her arguments against it since she fits so many of the criteria for AGP. Right now the only rebuttals to Blanchard are Julia Serano, who isn't very convincing, and SJWs reeeeing at it without any substance. It would also give her an excuse to dress up as a ridiculous transvestite and pretend to be Anne Lawrence.For those not aware Kraut and Tea is one of these 'Skeptics' out there. Shaun Andjen has a few videos on him. 

Recently however Kraut has made a few videos against Race Realism (because even though Kraut is a pretty racist himself, as a German he at least knows that that's bullshit). 

And the reception of his audience and as well as Sargons (or maybe the entire 'rational'-sphere for that matter) was less than good. 

It's funny seeing them now showing KT's bad methodology and flawed arguments after he went after one of their arguments. Ofc his videos are bad, he is a 'Skeptic' after all. These people couldn't read articles to save their lives. 

At this rate it's only a matter of time until the last centrists jump off the Anti-sjw train, so that only the alt-right conglomeration remains that was leading it from the start. 

Edit: Kraut and Tea's channel has all it's videos removed. From what it looks like Kraut has retreated and given up. I'd feel sad if that guy wasn't such an asshole. 

I guess now that the 'rationals' are turning on each other and people like Sargon admitting their open support for Richard Spencer and the Alt right, the new main focus has to be on the rightest of rightwing ideas since the facade of 'moderate centrist that favors logic and reason, you guys' is gone. That's it. Nothing more to see here, just some word play.She always says "baby I'm sorry" in the same way and it seems like a reference.

Sorry if this is off-topic.I was feeling nostalgic for old (2009,2010) YouTube and I remembered that stream where Contra and Dick chatted about the good old days of just 8 years ago, but I can't find it anywhere.I just found out about the ContraPointsLive channel (thanks, Soystream) and have been watching a lot of the videos, and numerous times, Contra has mentioned having "secret friends" who are right-wing and have some problematic views, and that she's worried about people publically knowing that she's friends with these people because left-wing people will think she's a traitor, or aiding and abeting the enemy or whatever.

Contra. I think by now, everyone's pretty clear with how you operate. You reach out. You don't write people off as lost causes. You give everyone a chance. You're the Gateway Swidge. We get it.

It's admirable, really. I think a lot of people on the left would theoretically like to do what you do, but simply don't have the emotional energy to spend dealing with someone who spouts toxic garbage all the time.

As long as none of your secret friends are openly advocating racial genocide, I'm pretty sure the vast majority of people are okay with whoever you're friends with, however dispicable their views, because *your* influence on them is one of the few slim hopes we have that they'll see the light, grow out their leg hair, and begin praying at the altar of Our Goddess and Savior Anita Sarkeesian. I mean, we need as many soldiers as possible for the upcoming Great Enslavement of Men, and enemy converts mean less soldiers on the opposing battlefield.

We won't disown you for palling around with Blaire White. We promise.I saw a lot of Primitivist comments in the most recent Contra stream which resulted in two questions: 1) What source is the primitivist steel-man and 2) Would the Brotherhood of Steel a la Fallout 1 &amp; 2 be examples of primitivism?A constant phenomenon of Contrapoints livestreams are people in the live chat section who constantly post bread. Does anyone know more about the meaning of this behavior and what it is referencing?With all the shit Nat’s been getting from quite a few people over these past couple months, to the point it really shows in her videos and tweets that she has been tired and a bit worn down, it was so much fun just seeing her having fun and laughing with Theryn. I think they have been really good for each other, and I’m really happy about that!I wanted to DM her on Twitter but since she doesn't have that turned on I figured I'd post here. Don't know if she reads the subreddit but oh well.

I've been struggling with my gender for years.  For a lot longer than I've even had the words to say that was what was happening. The amazing openness of the online trans community helped me a lot to get to this point, but nothing has been more key than Contra and her videos. Her video on Autogynephila especially has done so much to help me accept myself and to feel like I'm not just some freak. As someone who once turned to TERFism out of self hatred, it was very important to see.

I don't have much else to say. I'm just so excited to start actually living my life.I'm asking specifically about the gender breakdown in the youtube analytics tab. If anyone has heard her mention it in an livestream or interview I'd like to know. 

PS: I'm aware that there are more than two genders but that's how youtube has defined it. After the Twitter thread in which she defended her choice of title for April's video turned into an absolute shitshow, Contra has posted another [thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/975772706447732736) hoping to more clearly and less defensively explain her reasoning. Now, I don't have a horse in that race, but it's remarkable to me that she was able to step back and engage those criticisms in a new, hopefully more constructive way. Takes a lot of guts, whether or not you think her first response was inappropriate or not, to come back and try again. I'd have deleted my Twitter ages ago if I put up with half the shit she does.I’m unsure if this would be the best place to ask this question, but I remember Contra talking about new symbols being used by the Alt Right and one of them was the Betsy Ross flag. Is an upside down Betsy Ross flag also a symbol used by the Alt Right? I’ve seen a few people wearing hats with the symbol at work. According to Contra herself on the latest Lindsay Stream. 

Just thought you all should know, in case you needed a little bit of Irony in your life.  Generally im sympathetic to, and find myself in agreement with much of what people like contrapoints says. However there is one thing that is really bogging me, and I thought maybe you can help me figure it out. Contrapoints , in the name of intersectionality, has in quite a few videos argued on assumptions of... let's say "general perspectives", like that of "the perspective of a white man", a "trans women" or a "working class black person" (For example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95akpkkQXyo 3.30). I find this line of thinking both very provocative and flaud. It seems very counterintuitive that you could group people by lines of race and gender and assume that there would be so much commonality in experience that one could talk in terms of "a white perspective". From my own experience it doesn't map on to reality at all, I don't feel that what people posit as the perspective of "a white man" is representative of me what so ever. This is also why i find it so provocative, it lumps me into a category and assumes what I think based on arbitrary things like my skin color and gender. Have i missed something?Is there any way to reach Contra directly? I couldn't find anything like ask.fm, but I would really like to send some sort of a letter to her.  
If that's not a possibility, I may gather enough courage and just post it here. I hope she lurks here... 
  
Thank youAlso would you classify it as a political or philosophy channel?Apparently, Contra recently made an interesting twitter thread that got deleted afterwards:  
  
https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/978804370530848769  
  
As someone explains, "She was talking about the whole "people are saying you /have/ to date them!" take and why it exists. It was actually one of the best threads on the topic I've seen.".  
  
Did anyone read it? I missed it but I'm interested in the topic, so a tl;dr would be appreciated.  
  
There's no more information than that, but anyone that has read that particular thread will recognize it.This is something that's been bothering me for a long time, but I think I'm now able to articulate it. TERF rhetoric and mainstream "intersectional" feminist rhetoric are very similar; the key difference being that mainstream feminist rhetoric often criticizes men, whereas TERF rhetoric is directed at anyone with a Y chromosome. A feminist might complain about men taking up too much space on the train, whereas a TERF will complain about "MtTs taking up space in feminist discourse". Feminist critiques of men often include things like sexual aggression, objectification of the female form. The only difference is that "intersectional feminists" define trans women as women (at least nominally), whereas TERFs define trans women as men, and therefore all the standard feminist ideas about men transfer over to trans women. 

The thing I don't like is that I wish acceptance for trans women didn't hinge on the answer to the question "are trans women real women." My answer to that question is "who cares?" Because clearly trans women are not chromosomally female most of the time, the extent to which we are women is that we possess some, but not all of the characteristics of a chromosomal woman as well as filling the female social role. But calling a trans woman a "real woman" is just semantics. There's no such thing as "real" or "fake", there are just various criteria one can use for classifying people into categories, which are arbitrary.

So when I hear someone say something like "men shouldn't be allowed in this club because women need a space where they don't have to be afraid of men", from an intersectional feminist point of view I can't pass judgmement on that statement until I know what the speaker's definition of "men" is. If they use one arbitrary classification system like chromosomes, I have to be outraged. And if they use another arbitrary classification system like "gender identity", there's no problem. But that's not how my outrage-ometer works. I don't think of "men" as being a narrow enough category that all men might be dangerous and all women are safe. And I don't think TERF rhetoric is fine when it's directed at men, and evil when it's directed at trans women.Hey all, just watching JP’s latest appearance on Rogan (couldn’t help myself). I think I’ve got the rhetorical trap he lays down to a pattern, and was hoping to get more thoughts/eyes on it b/c this isn’t really my field. Any thoughts?

Jordan Peterson Hypothetical Speech Pattern:

[Anchor]There are Biological differences between men and women

[Diversion] And this is good!

Yin and yang

Order and Chaos

Compassion and competition

This is necessary

[straw man]

But we can’t pretend that order is equal to chaos

[flashpoint]

Because one leads to prosperity and the other leads to death camps

The anchor statement is the overall scapegoat for a grave existential threat / cause of all your unhappiness

The diversion is a bunch of easy truisms to access a few quick yeses before the anchor is thought upon critically 

The straw man is erected to garner the attention, again of the target audience but also a pre-emptive feint to setup critics

A flashpoint, like a rhetorical flashbang grenade, is something provocative connected to the subject, but removed by rhetorical goalpost backing and will shock itself above all other thoughts being discussed (also more likely to be remembered).

 He is suggesting that women’s equality will lead to death camps. BUT the insinuation is removed twice over by the buffer and straw man. He would in this case be accused of saying women’s equality leads to death camps, but he will say that he only said chaos leads to death camps, always has throughout history.Does anyone else want to read cute domestic Tabby/Adria/the rest of their polycule fanfic or is it just me?Hello. First of all, I apologize if this thread doesn't belong here, but this seemed like the most appropriate sub, since Contra mocks TGO constantly (rightfully so, to be clear). 

After watching several videos on the guy (and some of his own) I'd like to share some thoughts and I would appreciate a feedback. 

While he has stupid political beliefs, to me it seems like he is more of a misguided idiot than a genuinely hateful person. Maybe it is because he makes an effort to look presentable but to me he doesn't appear to be irredemably evil like Anglin, Cantwell, Spencer, Cottrell etc. At the very least, he tries to stay healthy, seems genuinely bothered by sexism in the alt-right, and is always polite. He could even be a somewhat decent role model if he dropped fascism and larping as a space marine/nordic god. 

I am not trying to defend him from criticism or promote him or his views, I just wanted to share my thoughts and would like to hear yours; mainly, if he is a lost cause or is there any chance he could snap out of it? Disdain for fascists/WNs is justified but I believe if there's any hope an individual could abandon that mindset, he should be given a chance and maybe even hope rather than be shunned. 


PS. Please ignore my username - it is a joke and I am actually a registered Democrat. Need it for strictly business reasons. I can't seem to find the video, her singing version was great.Vote [here](https://linkto.run/p/K4V9HOHJ) you filthy degenerates!


Results will be posted within the coming week 🦋So I had an idea a while back that you can sort of divide contras videos in to seasons or, a more pretentious way of putting it, chapters. 
Chapter 1 would be the first videos where contra isn't even on screen and just talking over footage. 
Chapter 2 would be the videos in front of the book case, where contra talks about her life and experience. 
Chapter 3 would be the videos which are more of a response to other people and not just about contra herself. 
Chapter 4 would be the recent videos with the higher production value where contra takes on harder subjects. 
And chapter 5 I think started with the Peterson video, which is sort of a combination of chapters 3 and 4.


Chapter 1 - In the beginning
- Feminism did not destroy atheism
- Criticism or bullying?
- What makes a trans chick “cool”?

Chapter 5 - Dark mother

- The west


While the idea of referring to our civilization as "western" is certainly modern in terms of phraseology, it is not that new a concept when it comes to the actual unfolding of Western history.

One example would be St. Augustine and his famous 5th century work, The City of God. In his book, St. Augustine incorporates ideas borrowed from his predecessor, the philosopher Plato, namely the idea that heaven is a perfect realm, and that the world is a fallen realm, a mere shadow cast by the light of aspiring perfection. The City of God being the hallmark objective in the quest for salvation, while the city of man languishes in it's own corruption. It was written as a condemnation of the old pagan religions, and as a promotion of the Christian religion.

Religious differences aside,The City of God is important because it directly links an ancient Greek philosopher to the growing Roman Catholic church, and to the theological practices of modern Protestant faiths. I distinctly remember being an active member in the Southern Baptist church, and hearing the pastor echo themes that were Augustinian in nature, themes that then could be traced to Plato himself. A perfect lineage could thus be drawn from a church in the 21st century to 4th century BCE Athens.

Aside from St. Augustine, the concepts of democracy and republic can easily be traced to the ancients of Greece and Rome. And just as easily, can the concepts of monarchy and absolute rule be traced, traditions that further flavored the continent of Europe, traditions that were rejected by the Founding Fathers, who reached for the previously mentioned democratic traditions.

And with politics and national identity, come some darker aspects of western civilization... aspects that include imperialism and self-idealized notions of ethnic superiority. White nationalism of the 21st century would have found easy friends in the Roman Empire. Likewise would the oppressed and formerly oppressed peoples of today have found solidarity with the conquered and subjugated peoples of times past. It is a tragic truth, but the dark forces wracking modern western civilization today have been active since the first Romans and Greeks declared themselves as such.

Western civilization, surely modern in wording, but it is not a new concept in practice. It is a mixed bag of wonderful advancements, and a harbinger of suffering and sorrow. It depends entirely on one's perspective, but for certain has it's bloodline remained intact throughout the ages, and it's legacy... it remains to be seen.
I might be totally off base here, but I think Contra is well-equipped to cover this, being 50/50 bisexual according to a recent tweet and having dated as both genders. (And very successful at it as a man, if *Autogynephilia*'s mention of "several partners" is true.)I mean we all know how smart contra is, and the blaire white debate was really cool to watch, so i'd love to see more in the future! Was there talk of another blaire white debate? If u see this contra, pls do it, haha. Or any other (right wing) youtuber. What do you guys think?I’m a curious boy.This is an issue I haven't seen discussed outside trans groups and I would really be interested in seeing Natalie discuss it, it's something I've dealt with far to much latelyDisclaimer: I'm brand new to this community and I joined and posted for self-interested reasons. I am also a fan of Contrapoints and it occurred to me this community would be a great place to find what I'm looking for. Thank you for existing!  


I'm a digital consultant with very little experience on YouTube. Seeing that politically it's a right wing shitstorm overall, and wanting to help more left voices succeed, I'm trying to level up by doing time consuming research. HOWEVER I'm also interested in talking to YT platform experts in progressive content, including news, personalities, politics, etc.  


If anyone here is willing to self identify as an 'expert' (a slightly empty term) and be in touch with me directly, I'd appreciate it. Yes I do have wishes to grant, but my preference is for sustained cooperation around shared interests as opposed to paying money for chatting.  


As to who I am: co-founder People for Bernie, founder Ready for Warren, team member [act.tv](https://act.tv), labor communicator, former Israeli refusenik, proud DSA member, infrequent campaign operative, and left trivia enthusiast.  


Thank you, Contrapoints community (and thank you Natalie for creating it!).  
I can be reached at clenchner@organizing20.orgOkay im new to contrapoints and to educated political discourse in general. Growing up in a red state i always assumed my opinions were “liberal” but honestly idk what that means at this point. 


Everyone seems to have a different explanation of liberals. The right conflates the entire left into “liberals” but ive heard people consider liberalism relatively far to the  right in the modern US political landscape.From what i can gather, natalie is farther to the left than “liberals” and often speaks negatively about “neoliberalism”. I find that I agree with everything natalie says so i guess im not a liberal? Idk what my opinions would be labeled as anymore. 


I appreciate any explanation; i figured a like-minded community could fill me in better than most other places on the internetHey all, big fan of the channel here with a quick question. Not sure if this is the appropriate way to ask, but does anyone know if Natalie has ever commented on Zizek's work, particularly his article on the LGBTQ movement in The Sexual is Political? As someone coming to terms with her own gender identity recently, and with a passing background in philosophy, I've been trying to engage with it and make sense of it, potentially with the intention of producing some writing on it. 

So I was curious, considering Natalie comes from a background of academic philosophy, and is a leftist, and is trans, if she had ever spoken about this article in any medium. If not, I'd appreciate any further reading anyone can recommend! There was a video where Contra quoted John Milton's *Paradise Lost* towards the end of the video. Can anyone remember the quote or the name of the video?

16:17Hi,

i apologize for my bad english skills and my unorganised writing, I hope what I write is easy to (not mis-) understand.I noticed recently that I lost interest in most of the "anti-sjw" youtube channels I used to watch and that my views never really had too much in common with theirs (ok, i have to admit that is a generalization)  to begin with.

The reason why I was attracted to content from Anti-SJWs is, to be honest, that I am a shameless cis white guy escapist who just loves consuming and creating stuff  because of power fantasy and "sublimation" and I felt threatened by this idea that dogmatic sjws could censor media so much, that there will never be the type of escapism I used to enjoy again.

But now I think this idea is very ridiculous;

1. hollywood ect. just want to make profit; if wonder woman and new star wars make profit they continue to do them; if jurassic world or whatever makes money they will continue to create that stuff despite some people calling it sexist

(this is just an assumption, i dont know what people think of that movie, this is just meant as an example)

2. I noticed that even pages like resetera, marysue seem to go mainly after big commercial projects; there are some cases where they wanted to ban some small indie game developers from sites or some artists from deviant art, but I cannot even remember the specific cases.

It just doesnt happen often. Also it is just a ridiculous idea that feminists and blm-activists will be able to ban every single new small media project with tropes in it they dislike.

Many "SJWs" dont even seem to be interested in banning stuff.

3. I feel the free speech IS threatened, but from many many more forces than SJWs.

Instead, the PC-culture or how you can call it plays only a minor role in the fight against free speech. There are certain new Internet Laws in different countrys with horrible effects on the right of free speech, many Anti-SJWs are very often very antifreespeech as well.

4. Media culture is soo big today; i am not an american but I guess Hollywood and all the very identity politics focused media are just one part of the gigantic landscape of todays media (i include all the stuff on the internet).

So SJWs arent even able to "conquer" media because a huge part of it is created by random users on the internet.

I noticed a big decline in my interest for big corporate entertainment in general.

Big Budget doesnt have to make a project good; knowadays when I want infantile Hero fantasy i just watch a fanfilm of something, play indie games etc. Many corporate entertainment stuff just feels boring to me knowadays because of its many restrictions; it always has to be profitable.

Big Marvel Movies just feel like 2h Product placement to me; doesnt matter wether the lead is male, female, black etc.

Just because Captain America is white doesnt mean I can relate to him or have fun with the movie. I guess I will not stop to consume sexist entertainment with offensive tropes in them (right wingers seem to get easily triggered as well, just by different tropes;

 for example the battlefield 5 "scandal" or the sasha baron cohen prank hahahaha), but I also dont really think SJWs will be able or even necessarily want to clean the internet of sexist tropes entirely or something like that haha.

So even though I am an infantile pig who loves dumb hero fantasys and problematic tropes, Anti-SJWs dont really have much to offer for me; in fact they never did; i just didnt realize.

Though that raises the question for me:

If it is true that sexist media can have a negative effect on people, what can SJWs ( i dont mean the term as an insult) even do?

There may be more Cartoonnetwork series; games and hollywood movies with queer themes, race issues as a theme etc, and also more diverse characters in niche media as well, but there will be always a lot of new sexist content as well, it will never be completely iradicated.

Even though I am for democratic socialism (okay whe have it in my country,I just whish that all other people get free healthcare and basic stuff they Need for surviving), despise reactionary movements etc; I will not stop watching and drawing and playing douchy macho heroes who save princesses and (nonwestern?) countrys\* (so I like some tropes that could be harmful to less privileged groups) unless someone will take that stuff away from me, even though I am otherwise in all other areas i can think of for social progress (at least I think I am).

I mean I like content warnings; then people can at least avoid content they dont want to see.

But will people always be able to avoid sdxist content if they want to? I guess not.

So do you people on this sub/ SJWs in general view people like me as a threat?

Do you even bother that some sexist media, even if it is maybe noncommercial, will always be produced and consumed?

What can be done against people like me?

What arguments are there to maybe even convince people like me into stopping consuming and reproducing sexist or maybe even racist tropes?

I hope for admitting this stuff I dont violate the rules of this Sub; this post isnot meant to make other people feel bad.

If you Thing it is a harmful post; just delete it; i wont be angry.

\*if (White?) heroes save a nonwestern Country in an fictional Story, that could be viewed as colonialist fantasyI definitely see her as either a Capricorn or a Taurus.does anyone know what the new font contrapoints is using is?

https://i.redd.it/j3b0sk82sra11.pngContra has already admitted she only makes videos because she enjoys mood lighting and set design, so I think it is best we evaluate her videos on these vital qualities. Which is your favourite ContraPoints video based purely on how it looks?I've been watching her series off and on and I see recurring characters like Tabby and the Nazi one.

Are there any more and which group are they supposed to represent?contra is doing a marxist analysis of transformers with Lindsay Ellis

[https://twitter.com/thelindsayellis/status/1019737744291971072](https://twitter.com/thelindsayellis/status/1019737744291971072)The word tranny in my mouth sounds like a slur, and even calling myself that in jest feels gross, "a transgender(ed)" is a mouth full and sounds wrong, a transgender person, a trans, all varyingly wrong and long.

In Contrapoints most recent video Natalie calls herself a "trashy tran" and tbh it's the perfect amount of self derogatory, short, straightforward, not super slurry and without any connotations.

I elect that trans people just use it as an easy to use catch all singular noun for transgenderded peopleses.

I'm a tran she's a tran, they're trans, he's a tran, this recently painted train is a tran, etc. 

Rolls off the tongue.I wanted to go watch some of the commentaries she made on her earlier videos but the whole live channel seems to be gone. :(Hey, so, I was coincidently watching a Contrapoints livestream when this all went down, and I discovered they're not all deleted, they are just unlisted. I would post the URL to the old video, but I'm not sure if Natalie would be cool with that, so I won't. Just so everyone knows.

https://i.redd.it/2tq5yj9v1eb11.pngI'm going to teach a class at my synagogue for high school students about antisemitism in the Internet Age, and a lot of Contra videos are very useful for the subject. I'm planning on using "Debating the Alt-Right" and some others, but I don't know exactly how to handle some of them. Our synagogue is very progressive (except for Israel lol), but I feel weird about a lot of the "Alpha Males" and "Degeneracy" videos because there's nudity and crudeness. I don't mind any of it personally, but I obviously can't know what the students would think, let alone their parents. But, these videos have some great things that I want to teach but can't really handle personally due to my lack of expertise on those subjects. Anyone got any advice?I can't find it anywhere. It isn't even listed in the subtitles or the music credits.Hey Catgirls and soy boys!!!! (My new name for the Contrapoints fan base.) So, I have a centrist friend who I want to bring to our side, and Contrapoints is known for her abillity to appeal to moderates in her videos. So, I would like your recommendation on which of Contra's video would be best at convincing someone to ourside, as, I'm not sure which video would work best. What would you recommend? While showing a (male) friend "The West", I was treated to some interesting thoughts about Natalie's Titania costume:

"I don't know why, but this makes me feel slightly uncomfortable"

After discussing it for a brief period of time, we came to the conclusion that it was not the costume itself, but the implication of nudity! In an attempt to press the issue further, and to determine if this feeling was brought on by the fact that it's feminine nudity, I asked him about his feelings about her attire in the pre-transition video "Alpha Males". In this video Natalie is wearing roughly the same amount of clothing however with one clear difference: exposed nipples.They did not voice any displeasure at the nudity in this video at all leading me to make some interesting conclusions.

My friend and I are of the opinion that a trans woman is always a woman even if it's prior to them realizing it. Yet when faced with two examples of the same woman nude in two different scenarios he feels discomfort with the overtly feminine one.This raises the question: what if an individuals gender identity isn't the issue when being perceived by a third party, but rather their presentation. My question is if by merely performing traditional gender expressions, does a person automatically become subject to all of the prejudices that come with that gender presentation? Obviously no woman should be held up to such perverse standards that by simply wearing the same amount of clothing they are looked upon in disgust, but the question still remains.

If there are questions, anecdotes, or opinions to add this i would be very interested in continuing the conversation, but for now I guess i'm going to have to give Judith Butler a read again to see where academic discourse has taken this conversion in the past.I saw Natalie's AMA livestream for patrons last night. She mentioned that she's preparing a video for release sometime within the first two weeks of August. However, she didn't mention the video's topic.

Separately,  Olly from Philosophy Tube [mentioned](https://youtu.be/R5RTkcsufTY?t=27m46s) that "another creator" he talks to is planning a video about incels. This is just conjecture but I get the sense that he's talking about Natalie. They do communicate socially and professionally as evident in Olly's [200k Subs Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QVbMQ5cchk) and [Intro to Hegel](https://youtu.be/OgNt1C72B_4?t=17m4s) videos. And it seems like it's only a matter of time before Natalie covers incels given that she's already handled other anti-SJW groups.

Personally, I'm excited about the possibility. Natalie has the sensitivity, incisiveness, and humor to make a great video critiquing incel views. It seems like she could speak to their frustrations while also demonstrating that their ideas are self-destructive, let alone outrageously hostile to women. 

What do you think, r/Contrapoints? Does this possibility seem likely for August? And how would you feel about Natalie addressing the topic?[Why is no one talking about the mouthfeel? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuddenlyGay/comments/92n72p/comment/e370m4r?st=JK64TQVX&amp;sh=59843993) 

It seems that Natalie's videos are starting to reach out, so now whenever people talk about genital preferences there's always a person who's watched Contra. Anyone know what song plays during the What's Wrong with Capitalism Pt. 1 video at about 1:30 in when the title appears? Nat has credited all the other music in the description except whatever it is and I gotz to know! 😁Seriously, watching Natalie's videos has got me into far more cool stuff than even the arts modules on my degree. Wittgenstein and Marx seemed pretty dull when I studied philosophy, but Nat just has a way of bringing this stuff down to earth and making it interesting, and now I want to look up more for myself!

I have been converted!I’d say “gothic, vapor wave, gay AF surrealism” what’s your takes?I was wondering where I could find some really nice Contra posters for my room. I saw some really nice fanart on Twitter, but I don't know where to find more.We're all just sitting here building a cult of personality. Not even that. At this point Natalie could form an actual cult. At least half of the people here would do literally anything she wants so long as it didn't involve turtle harm.Found it funny so thought I'd share (at around 5:53 time mark) 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBZNlremmR0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBZNlremmR0)Hey,

I have some friends (all of them less left than me, ranging from "liberal" to "moderate" to """moderate""") who I want to introduce to ContraPoints. I am wondering what you think is the best video to show them first that would most likely get them interested/hooked?

I think ideally it should be a video with a lot of humor and fun skits throughout so it doesn't spend too much time on "boring, serious political stuff". I think my friends would really appreciate Contra's style of humor but I'm afraid the videos that jump into the more long/serious discussion will turn them off too quickly if they don't ease into it. For example, as fans of Filthy Frank and iDubbbz videos, they'd probably love the first few minutes of "TERFs" because of the random nonsense Jackie Jackson opens with and the cutaway of Tiffany Tumbles making a huge mess pouring BBQ sauce all over herself, but I'm afraid once it gets into the serious discussion about trans issues and misogyny they'll say "this is boring let's watch something else". Same thing with "What the Alt-Right Fears", they'd love the anime inspired intro, but I'm afraid the jump to Contra just talking into the camera about serious stuff might turn them off too quick.

I think "What is Gender?" is a good candidate in the sense that she has a LOT of funny cutaway gags and other humor sprinkled evenly throughout the enitre video, and it's relatively short and sweet. The subject matter itself though might not be the best for newcomers though because the question of how many genders there are seems to continue to be one of the most controversial issues today. On the other hand, the Incel video seems good in some ways because her arguments there won't be very controversial among normies (except maybe when she relates it to trans issues) and it's pretty interesting, but the downside is it's really fucking long and the humor is more thinly stretched throughout the video which may bore newcomers (sometimes getting people to even agree to watch a video that long in the first place is difficult).

What do ya'll think? What's a good video to introduce people to the ContraPoints channel and let them know what it's all about without scaring them away with heavier content too quickly? If you got any of your less left or normie friends into ContraPoints what video did you show them first?I'm from the Humanities, I study Philosophy with a focus on Political Philosophy, I'm a full on 100% leftie. I basically agree with 100% of what ContraPoints says.

However, I've been thinking recently about the "Post-Modern Neo-Marxism" thing, and I think that maybe the outright denial of the possibility of such a thing has been a little disingenuous.

There is a lot of overlapping between the left and postmodernism. The problem with the right is the conflation *marxism* with *the left* in general. But I think that talking about "Post-Modern Leftists" is actually pretty spot on.

- For starters, the only people *actually reading* the postmoderns are leftists. There are no libertarians or right-liberals reading Deleuze or Debord or Derrida, so there's that. So if the postmoderns fall *anywhere* in the political spectrum (it's hard to say if they do), they fall on the left if only because that's their audience.

- Secondly, the truth is that most of the left is, by this point, effectively "Post-Marxist". Except a handful of "actual card-carrying communists", most of the people in the university left will, indeed, tack on some sort of Post-Modern Argumentation to their political position. This is actually my case! 

- Examples of the above are: being skeptical of the "Metanarrative" aspect of traditional Marxism, being skeptical that the notions of "Progress", "Class", "Burgeoise", "Revolution", "Intellectual Vanguard", and many other key schemas and mechanisms of Marxism seem to me at this point (and maybe always) inapplicable. A key aspect of this is a rejection of Hegel's dialectical schema of development, which is at the heart of modern thought and that Marxism had swallowed up pretty wholesale (with reversions). I would say that core aspect of Marxism today is out the window and that makes it "Post-Modern" in some important senses.

- It's hard to not see an element of post-modernism in the development of the different movements that comprise today's left. LGBT, Feminism and Gender Politics in general are surely carrying notions from Post-Modern philosophy: rejection of (gender) essentialism, a sort of "Wittgensteinan" approach to the definition of societal roles, a general skepticism towards the structures that contain and define these notions. The very idea that this is not mere "class warfare" but a whirlwind or kaleidoscope of minorities and oppressed people from different walks marching loosely together is, in itself, quite postmodern when compared with the old "One Class Militancy" notion that comes from Marxism. What's for sure is that "Queer Philosophy" and "Queer Epistemology" fall, without any doubt, on the "Post-Modern" side of the Philosophy theater (Kristeva, Butler, Preciado, etc.). That is most certainly an important bridge between the Left and Post-Modern ideas, and that's pretty undeniable.

- Historically, it's pretty hard to deny that Post-Modernism is the son of Academic Marxism. You can trace this line pretty easily, and mark the "Middle Grounds" with some degree of certainty: Benjamin is the bridge between old Marxism and the Post-Modern Left from the Frankfurt School (basically, the principles of a Post-Modern Leftists' understanding of history are expressed in his text "Theses on the Concept of History"). Herbert Marcuse is a bridge between Existentialism and "Old Marxism" that breeds a sort of "Existential Marxism" (see Marcuse, Herbert, "Heideggerian Marxism"). Lyotard, Marcuse and Vattimo are other interesting links from various philosophical schools "tying" new ideas to the left, making it "post-modern" in some important senses: Marcuse brings existential analysis into the left, Vattimo brings Nietzschean ideas of Nihilism into play, and Lyotard *invents the word post-modern* in a clearly leftist book ("The Postmodern Condition" was a key reading for a whole generation of leftists). Even Foucault can be understood in this way: during his entire life he polemicized and debated Marxists about their "dated conceptual toolbox" (and was even understood by some to defend Neo-Liberalism towards the end of his career) while being 100% a part of the left. The tension between the "Old Left" and the "New Left" was the signature of the Cold War intellectual development in the left. Talking about a "Post-Modern Left" coming out of that process is not crazy in the slightest.

So, in sum, I think the left is, today, in many many senses, actually post-modern (as in, strongly influenced by the cultural advent of Post-Modernism as an intellectual event), and while I do agree that Post-Modernism is outright incompatible with Marxism definitionally, I would argue that today's left is, for the most part, not marxist in the traditional sense of the word.

Thoughts on this?WaPo, but still. Does this article scan? I know there are leftist philosophy oriented people in here who could characterize postmodernism far better than I could.

EDIT: a community of vulnerability, not weakness.

EDIT2: Dr Layman made an excelent criticism of the video. Which is too bad, because I loved Ollie's video. But I strongly recommend it to you, because the answer video is too good. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K24OfSP4YAs

EDIT3: Ollie answers "I don't know, very interesting question. For what I know, they very much seem to be based on blame on women, but they also seem to have kind of a nihilistic vulnerability. The gates of hell are locked from the inside. I don't really know if they are a community of vulnerability or of strength."

Also, I loved the wide level of answers I got in the chat. Wow, so nuance, much answers.Former anti and current cuck speaking, one of the things that I noticed a little while ago was that SJW YouTube is for more interconnected then anti-sjw YouTube. What I mean is they both acknowledge each other far more and have each other as guests on their videos all the time. If you have a moment where they read a bunch of hyperbolic problematic nonsense chances are good it’s being done by another Social justice YouTube personality. 

It’s such a little thing but it’s just really cool. What surprises me is that this just doesn’t happen in the anti-sjw sphere at all. They’re friends on twitter and all support each other but they almost never feature each-other in their videos. 

I wonder why that might be..... I often hear arguments against the alt right that depend on undermining the idea of "white people" and "Western culture." But if "white people" aren't a well-defined thing, how do we know who White privilege applies to?She surpassed Anita on wednesday night and suprassed ollie a few hours ago.

Edit: My intention is to show the vertiginous growth of Contra. I love Ollie and Anita and want for them to grow. Philosophy Tube is actually growing at a very healthy pace. I'll be happier when I talk about how Contra surpasses alt-right figures. But I do not mean it as a competition, but as a milestone. And particularly, a milestone getting Natalie and leftube in general nearer the numbers of the "skeptics" and the fascists.

Edit2: do you believe posting these kind of things is unhealthy for the construction of the cooperation inside leftube? Do you believe posting when alt-right users are surpassed would be healthier or would you prefer me not posting about comparisons at all?In the Jordan Peterson video, Natalie references a "BBC interview." But it's not! That's Channel 4 News. They're different things goddammithttps://youtu.be/AR7ryg1w_IQ?t=1120I just started watching with Incels (linked from some other reddit post.) I really like her style and I feel like "youtube essayist" was a good description. I have appreciated the respect and self awareness she shows the audience especially on sensitive topics.

I actually have a question though about introducing this channel to others. Does most of the content present both sides, and besides the arguments about socialism, does this channel mainly stay away from alienating viewers based on their religion or personal beliefs?

I'l clarify -- I might recommend Thunderf00t based solely on how he analyzes things like the solar roadway, juicero, or other scientific subjects but he also has a ton of videos about atheism that are very antagonistic. Additionally he constantly seems to pick fights with Anita Sarkeesian and gamergate, etc.. Content like this makes me unable to recommend him based on the science content alone since I feel like it implies I agree with the channel, rather than a single subject on the channel.

Does ContraPoints generally keep out of the YouTube style drama?

Thanks

Edit: I watched a bunch more stuff and am convinced that the respectful tone continues even if some of the content is intense and may put some people off. Kudos, I'll gladly recommend this to people in my circle (who generally are teachers/social workers/etc and who value kindness above most other things.)Just to let you know where I'm coming from, I generally agree with most of Contra's points, but I'm not really a fan of Anita. However, I don't think she is an incarnation of Hitler/Satan/Stalin either. I promise you I'm not here to start shit so please don't ban me, I'm just genuinely curious as to what you think. Does anyone know the time the videos usually go live at?I'm posting this here because this is kind my attempt to put Natalies tips on recognizing a fascist to use. I say this because I do not think I am exaggerating when I say an actual fascist is currently trying to gain political power in Massachusetts. Not some random crazy guy that just decided to run, this is a man who is actually gaining strong support in the state of Massachusetts, a man who has campaign for and help pass several anti-lgbt laws in Uganda, Russia, and Ukraine. I believe he intends to do the same in Massachusetts and I want to argue that the amount of support he has gained in the past few years is worth worrying about.

I would like the introduce everyone to a man named Scott Lively. I live in MA and right now we are in the middle of an election for the next Governor of MA. Scott Lively was a new candidate who ran against our current Governor Charlie Baker, luckily he lost the republican primary but he managed to gain nearly 40 percent of the votes. Someone merly running isn't enough to be worried about but after getting almost half of the republican votes I think his presence is worth taking seriously.

The argument I want to make is simply that Scott Lively is a true fascist whose main goal is to outlaw what he would describe as "gay propaganda" or "the celebration of people who live outside the mainstream".[Video 1](https://youtu.be/GFeLWb9wDb0) Mainstream being "traditional family values" (I'm probably using too many quotation marks but like I said, I'm not the brightest).
Republicans who advocate that marriage should be between a man and a woman are nothing new, but I believe Scott is just trying to fit in with this crowd to downplay his real motives.

Scott's Campaign focused around 3 points; Pro Life, Pro Gun, and Pro Trump. These seem to be the biggest topics around Republican voters but Scott doesn't truly care about any of these topics, his main agenda has always been around fighting the homosexual agenda. Back in 2012 Scott explained [in his own words](https://youtu.be/ND-D4BungdA?t=92) why he can't openly talk about his position on gays as a politician. This video is from a Russian anti lgbt documentary(full video also proudly describes him as the number 1 threat to American homosexuals). I've met a handful of ex Lively supporters who were shocked by his real views which makes sense, his campaign was focused solely on popular conservative talking points.  

Although Scott strays away from his opinions on the LGBT community when it comes to mainstream news he has promised a bill he calls the [Free Speech Supremacy Clause](https://youtu.be/0G_Zsb4xRSY) which makes it so "The first amendment will trump sexual orientation regulations", or what we call anti-discriminatory regulations. This bill essentially makes it so if you were to fire someone for homophobia they could in turn say that you are attacking their free speech or their freedom to express their religion (its like a legal version of the old counter argument "well you're being intolerant of my intolerance" which seeks to give homophobic beliefs the same anti discrimination protection as gays.) I can see how some people could agree with this in theory, the idea that people shouldn't be discriminated against even if they hold bigoted beliefs, but this bill could give legal protection to those who express or act upon those beliefs from their employers. But is Scott simply saying that Homophobes and Homosexuals should have equal protection from discrimination? No, in Scotts own words "If your definition of homosexuality is being able to do whatever you want to, and that you should be able to go and engage in sex with another person, and that because of that, the disease you have is going to spread to that person and they're going to take it home and give it to their wife, how much tolerance should we have for that? We should have zero tolerance for that." ~ Scott Lively.

Now I'm gonna go more into detail about why I think Scott is a true Fascist disguising his beliefs as religious tolerance, or religious freedom. 

The rule of law vs the rule of man (or human rights vs civil rights).

During his campaign Scott proclaimed that the rule of law is rest's on the foundation of the Bible, which is the origin of law itself. "If human beings make laws then there is no reason to follow them other than fear of man, and why should I be subject to laws based on the whims of another man. He goes on to argue that we must recognize that their is law above the law, "If we recognized the law given to us by the almighty god, and we understand we are accountable to law above the law, that is the basis in which the rule of law can exist, anything else is the rule of man, and the rule of man can be overthrown by the next man that comes along." He goes on to argue that the pilgrims traveled across the see with the intent to spread christianity, "The Mayflower Compact, our first constitution, said that its purpose was the advancement of the christian faith." To Scott's credit, this is correct, but he cuts the quote short. He's trying to argue that since it's our first constitution then we need to recognize it as law, the full line from the Mayflower Compact is "Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and Advancement of the Christian Faith, and the Honour of our King and Country, a Voyage to plant the first Colony in the northern Parts of Virginia", he takes out the part about the honour of king james since it would both piss off a bunch of patriots and show that this we haven't upheld the first constitution since the declaration of independence(this probably isn't the exact date but you get my point, again I'm stupid.)

Scott then goes on to explain natural rights vs civil rights using a quote from the Declaration of Independence. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." While putting extra emphasis on the word "Creator" he goes on the explain that our natural rights come from God, under our constitution they cannot be taken from us, and that civil rights that contradict our natural rights(the word of god) are an "act of tyranny."

He believes(or at least say's) that the law of god is the only real law, and he will use his position as governor to uphold these laws. Any laws that contradict the bible shall be opposed, which is a perfect way he can spread a fascist homophobic ideology with the average christian voter in my state. All quotes used above can be found in [this speech from his campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL2XT_hXUZ4).

Finally I'd like to talk about his career before he entered politics. Scott has spent nearly a decade traveling the world to preach about the evils of homosexuals, he wrote a book known as "The Pink Swastika" where he proves through his own research that Hitler and the Nazi party was made up of violent homosexuals and that "only someone as evil as a homosexual could commit a crime such as the holocaust". He has preached his beliefs in Russia, and has appeared in anti gay russian propaganda. When Russia and Ukraine began to establish anti-gay propaganda laws, which made it illegal to "prohibit homosexual advocacy to children", which he describes as one of his [proudest achievements](https://youtu.be/EiateDgcxKU)

Most recently he was sued by a Uganda human rights organization known as "SMUG" for international crimes against humanity because of his possible influence for passing the Uganda bill (nicknamed the "kill the gays" bill) which can give life sentences for homosexual behavior. Unfortunately the case was dismissed because "based on a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the ability of foreigners to seek American court action for human rights violations committed overseas, that Lively’s actions did not meet the legal standard to be heard in federal court,”. Even though the judge dismissed the lawsuit he made his personal views of Scott Lively very clear, he went on to say "the question before the court is not whether Defendant’s actions in aiding and abetting efforts to demonize, intimidate, and injure LGBTI people in Uganda constitute violations of international law. They do.”

So this is my entire case against Scott Lively, I believe he intends to gain whatever political power he can to try and outlaw homosexuality under the illusion of "family values" to trick the average republican into supporting him while using the idea of "religious tolerance" to spread homophobic propaganda while outlawing anything that shed's homosexuality in a positive way. Jesus christ I haven't written this much since high school, thanks for reading my conspiracy about how christians are trying to take over.

“Choice” and “consent” aren’t magic words that make everything feminist. Anti-abolitionists once argued that slaves were happier as slaves, and there are victims of sex trafficking today who are so internally oppressed that they believe they consented to their own subjection. But that doesn’t make it okay, it doesn’t make it a real choice, and it certainly doesn’t make it feminist. It’s just inconceivable to me that there could be anything pleasurable about being whipped, and bound and abused. I just don’t see how that applies to sex. I can’t imagine being turned on by the firm grip of Master’s hands around my thighs as he bites the side of my neck, my back arching as the straps are tightened round my wrists and ankles, yes, and I shiver up my spine as I anticipate the first drop of hot candlewax on my pert, exposed breasts, and the intense, full-body shock that surges through me as his flogger cracks across my innocent pale buttocks, awakening my inner goddess and dissolving me into a deliquescent paradise of shuddering orgasms… No, I just don’t see anything arousing about that.Moves will be given in [algebraic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess\)).

[This is the starting position, shown at 2:30.](https://i.imgur.com/EBtTany.png)



White's king is in check from the rook on a1, so it must be her turn. (The rook could not have moved to a1 due to the pawn on a2, so it must have promoted by capturing a white piece on a1, unusual to have happened in a game.)

But Justine, using the black pieces, goes first.

Tabby–Justine, *The Left*, 2017

1...Kf2

This not only fails to capture the white king and win the game, but is an illegal move that puts her king into check from the white king.

2\. Ra4 Kf1

Both of these are illegal moves for aforementioned reasons.

3\. Kh2

The white king is on h1 in the very next shot, despite just being moved to h2.

3\...Ke1 

Not the best move; with 3...Ke2+ she could have gained two steps toward the a2 pawn. This finally brings us to a reasonable position.

Black's goal is to approach the a2 pawn with her king, defend it, move the rook out of the way and promote it to a queen. But White can always stymie that with rook checks from behind. My chess engine calculates a long, boring draw from this position.

4\. Kg2 Kd2 5. Ra7 Rc1?

We can't see the move because it's out of frame at 3:09, so I have to infer from the next full shot of the board at 3:54. This move is a mistake, hastening and guaranteeing the draw. Better was 5...Ke2.

6\. Rxa2 Rc2+ 7. Rxc2 Kxc2 8. Kf3 Kd3 9. g4 hxg4+ 10. Kxg4 Ke4 11. Kh5 Kxf5 1/2-1/2

Tabby correctly announces that the game is drawn by stalemate.

---

I don't know what to think of Natalie's chess skills based on this. The first several illegal moves suggest someone who just learned to play chess or looked up how the pieces move and nothing else, but the rest of the game shows good understanding of endgame theory and stalemate.I am on the hunt for Contrapoints gifs and jpegs. Mostly reaction gifs, so I can bug my friends into watching this channel. Would anyone like to share?In Contra’s recent video, I don’t think that she really expanded on Tabby’s best argument. The only argument that Contra presents as viable is Tabby’s argument of authenticity (i.e. refusing to conform to expectations of femininity because it is who Tabby is). However, I don’t think Contra really gives the solidarity argument (the necessity of standing up for non-conforming cis women, NBs, and non-passing trans women) its due.
 
Justine either says or implies that: we’re not in the forum but the circus, that high-ground arguments don’t work, and that we’re in an age that values spectacle over reason. But, like every age, this too will pass. Eventually, we will return to the forum, and it will be the arguments and acts of people like Tabby that lay the foundation for the advancement of trans rights. Sure, Justine will get by, but she won’t really have anything to her name other than the fact that she cleverly navigated the transphobic minefield of a shitty political age. Admittedly, that’s an impressive feat, but for what? If things don’t get too bad, then she becomes little more than a chmess grandmaster; if they do, she becomes a Lionel Bengelsdorf/Quisling-lite/Blaire White. Leveraging her privilege to do either of those things is unproductive at best.

I think it’s also foolish to say that the fight of GNC people and non-passing trans folk isn’t Tabby’s fight. Donning a passable façade does not reliably shield trans people from transphobia. The argument that a feminine appearance is good enough to (mostly) prevent womanhood from being revoked only works if we believe the bar cannot be raised or lowered, when, in reality, we are one regressive identification law away from being forced into our brothers and sisters’ everyday reality. To pretend that our lot isn’t the same as theirs, that our fate isn’t entwined with theirs, is, frankly, privileged and shortsighted. That same logic is the basis for the whole “drop the T” argument, and it’s bad for the same reasons. So long as they are subject to hate and discrimination, we will be as well (1).

Finally, I think Contra is really letting her regrets get the best of her with the segment about the interviews. She did lose the debate, although I personally think it was only a pyrrhic victory for Blaire (2), but she didn’t lose it because of her (admittedly awful) pink wig. She lost the debate because she went to it in the first place. Anyone who’s ever debated, taken a serious philosophy course, or had to write a really long paper knows that it’s much harder to make a positive argument (presenting and arguing for something) than it is to make a negative argument (breaking down and arguing against something). It is easier when you’re arguing for something that’s more mainstream because the average viewer probably has some foundational knowledge of your argument, but for concepts that are outside of the mainstream, a person making a positive argument in a debate is forced to present both the argument *and* the foundation on which it rests. This is why it takes half an hour or more to debunk clever sounding bullshit that’s only contingent on familiar and widely accepted concepts (see: autogynephilia, capitalism). When you factor in the reality that media itself stands to benefit from portraying trans people the way that the public already thinks of them, you begin to realize that there won’t ever be such thing as a fair public debate.

In other words, trying to navigate the minefield is often a trap, even if you are nimbler than your kin. Instead, you should buy a megaphone, tell everyone that the damn lizards have built a minefield for the express purpose of killing us, and make the point that it shouldn’t be there in the first place. You don’t win by becoming a chmessmaster or a Bengelsdorf. You win by framing the argument yourself, by gaining scientific recognition, and by being as much of an activist as you can manage.

In the end, I think what Contra was trying to say is that the trans rights movement *will* need people to step up, and that those people need to have the finesse of Justine and the principles of Tabby—someone who can walk through the minefield but doesn’t just do it for a show. At least, that’s the conclusion that can be most easily reached with the puzzle pieces we have. However, I think that any sort of conclusion suffered because Tabby had valid points that went largely unexplored (3).

--Notes--

Note 1: I’m not saying that every trans person is obligated to become a defender of the faith, but this video and my counterargument aren’t about that. Contra specifically states that she’s talking about trans people that are in the public eye.

Note 2: I do think that the Blaire White debate was only a pyrrhic victory for Blaire, mostly because Contra herself said she still gets messages from people who saw that debate, found her content, and changed their ways. It was a net positive in the long run because Contra was relatively little known then, and the exposure was more important than the result. I think it *would* be a mistake now.

Note 3: I say point*s* because I’m sure I'd have another if I didn’t drop out of my Benjamin class, but I really, *really* wasn’t down on reading The Arcades Project.
From what I’ve seen from “The Left” and the new video is that Justine represents the reality of society, and Tabby represents out ideal of society. The new video is representative of how both sides can be wrong and ineffective and that we need a middle ground of the two sides. So the “I love you” at the end is symbolic of how the two sides could interact, and is also of course symbolic of the tension between the to sides. Tabby’s shocked reaction is apart of that tension. The more cynical and realistic people really do love the “Tabbys” of this world, however the Tabby’s won’t compromise. So this new video is really representative of both the internal conflict of the cynical realists and moderates in this issue (in context of the passive cynics and the utopian revolutionary’s) and the external conflict between the two sides. I posted a couple days ago about being a new subscriber and since then I've gotten pretty much caught up on the ContraPoints YouTube channel.

One thing I noticed is that a lot of old videos are spoken of as if they exist but shouldn't be watched. I have also noticed that a lot of stuff in the back catalog seems a bit dated.

I'd really like if there was a playlist of videos that include some of the new ones but also hand pick the "old" ones that are still good/relevant according to Natalie.

When watching in reverse, a lot of stuff about The Golden One was very confusing. I'm still a bit confused about the Anita/Thunderf00t/Sargon references but I stopped watching the back catalog around 2016 because I felt like the channel has grown a lot since then and the political climate is so different that I missed a lot of the then-current references.

It really made me want a list of essential videos. I hope this is a helpful suggestion!

 -- I originally posted this using a CP = ContraPoints abbreviation and some kind stranger pointed out how unfortunate that is. Thanks kind stranger and I hope this sub is aware of the unfortunate shared abbreviation.A lot of the comment's I've read on 'The Aesthetic' have been confused or angry at contra - for humanising or justifying truscum arguments. I ultimately agreed with this view, but I interpreted the video to actually be critiquing a focus on the aesthetic.

Firstly, I think Tabby's monologue at the end is portrayed almost as heroic. The music swells as tabby claims to "stand up" for the women who don't fit into a cis-aesthetic. After this, Justine can only offer a retort, and the debate moves onto standard critique of leftism.

Justine even cedes her point: "You're right. You have to be yourself. Trying to be someone else is always a bad look." 

I think Justine's realisation is also supported by the clips shown of Shapiro at the end. He talks about trans women still being men despite surgeries, etc. No matter what a trans woman does to conform to a cis-aesthetic, they will still be rejected. 

I also interpreted the video to show Tabby's methods as more effective than a focus on aesthetic. In Tabby's words, she's a "fucking queer icon" because she stands for what she believes in. "That's why everyone knows who tabby is. When was the last time anyone talked about Justine?" I took another meaning from this: that standing up for what you believe in will cause change. When was the last time change was caused by conforming to a cis-aesthetic?

Justine's own point that all the trans women murdered in America "don't look like you or me" is the final nail in her own point. What has trying to fit into society done to fix this? In the face of very real opression, a focus on aesthetics is pointless.

I think the video is portraying this focus on aesthetics to be a privilege, one not afforded to many trans people. Justine "mostly passes" and can "laugh with her friends" about non-conforming trans women. And while Tabby is privileged to an extent, her attack on Justine's aesthetics ring true, that she can only make that point because of her privilege and position.

I ultimately interpreted this video to be a critique on aesthetic, and the value placed in it. Seriously. Since when is that word thrown around to mean anything and everything?

Justine doesn't have any truscum views in the video. She's not rejecting Tabby for not transitioning or not getting srs or something. She's arguing on the most effective way to get political change to happen.

It's just not truscum. At no point in the video does she invalidate Tabby's womanhood, she just argues that society won't take her seriously if she doesn't conform, which you may or may not agree with but has nothing to do with what people consider "truscum".

I get that Justine is  p r o b l e m a t i c. She's been written as problematic on purpose. But saying that she is truscum and Natalie endorses truscum is a huge stretch. I find it very unfair how people are assuming that.What snippets or even paragraphs of Natalie's dialogue would be fun to mix into a DJ set?  I'm thinking either a hook for some house tunes, or an extended, poignant phrase to layer over an ambient section.  Ideally nothing too meta (so, no "why is no one talking about the mouth feel"), but super weird and political is fine.  I might start with Tabby's "No voting - only smashing" or even Cockbane's 'BDSM isn't feminist' that recently became a copypasta

If I end up getting it together by next weekend's party, I'll post the Soundcloud link of my set.Is it coming out soon? Is it already out? I know it must have been a hella good conversation. Does anyone have the link?We are banning any truscum, trutrans, trender stuff, at least temporarily. Please refrain from the tru vs trend debate, at least for the time being. Such content will be removed but probably not subject to a ban.

Divisiveness in the trans community is not helpful. In fact it's harmful. Trans is trans. When tru looks down on trend and trend resents tru, we do the bigots work for them. They want us to tear ourselves apart while they sit back and laugh.

The arguments about Tabby against Justine are getting tiresome. Contra isn't representing either one of those points. She's deliberately setting up a dichotomy to highlight schisms in the community. Discuss the dichotomy, don't take sides.

The terms "trutrans" "truscum" "trender" "latecomer" etc are for the time being verboten. Discuss the politics of the asthetic. We're getting lost in signal to noise ratio.

Thank you. Keep being an awesome community. We love you all.I wanted a closer look at the discussion in the center of the episode about the nature of womanhood, so I transcribed it.

&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: So you literally are what TERFs think trans women are. Literally a man's idea of a woman.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: Well, men have the power, men make the rules, and it's ultimately men who are the judges of womanhood. So you can't really blame me for having to deal with that situation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: I can blame you for dealing with it by demanding we all conform to a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: Not stereotypes, performances. You like philosophy so much, haven't you read Judith Butler? Gender \*is\* performance. We're all born naked and the rest is literally drag.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: Womanhood is not what you are, it's what you do. And trans women have to be virtuosos of womaning.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: So according to you there's no difference between a trans woman and a drag queen?  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: No, you're misinterpreting what I'm saying. I don't mean performance in the sense of pretending to be something you're not. I mean performance in the sense of everything you do, the way you style yourself, your posture, the way you speak. An authentic performance is just a habitual performance, and nothing more than that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: So trans women just starting their transition are pretending to be women?  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: I mean, isn't that kind of what it felt like? You transition the same way you get anywhere in life: you fake it till you make it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: So according to you a trans woman is just a full-time drag queen.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: That's what any woman is.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: What about gender non-conforming cis women? They're not "doing womanhood" in that way.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: Well, yeah, that's why those women are marginalized. They're going off the grid of what society recognizes as womanhood. And you don't want to end up like that, do you?  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: And hold on. Are you saying that if a cis man dresses like a woman, talks like a woman, takes female hormones, is gendered female by other people, and spends his whole like pretending to be a trans woman, then he's literally as much of a woman as we are?  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: Yep.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: That's absurd.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: But it's absurd because the example is absurd. No cis man would do that. It's like asking is a straight man gay if he only sleeps with men. Like yeah, pretty much.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: See, this is philosophy at its worst, pointless speculative fiction. And it's a distraction from what we're really talking about, which is you getting rid of those combat boots.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: Look, your performance theory doesn't explain why trans people exist in the first place. If gender is just a bunch of learned behaviors, then why did we reject our male upbringing and decide to live as women?  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: What matters is that we identify as women. We can express that identity in different ways, but it's the identity, not the performance, that makes us women.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: But you can't be a woman without performing womanhood. Without action, and without social recognition, the identity is meaningless. If womanhood is nothing to you but a private daydream then you may as well do what those assholes say and identify as a helicopter. Because unless you're living womanhood, the identity is literally that meaningless.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: That's very unfair to pre-transition trans people.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: Well, this isn't a Tumbler cuddle party girl, I'm trying to talk about what's really true.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: I didn't say it was insensitive, I said it was unfair. Identifying as a woman before you transition is a psychological reality that implies a potential to live your inner truth. No one has ever sincerely identifies as a helicopter, it's just a troll example.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: True. But even if they were sincere there would be no reality to it because helicopter is not an actual social role. Whereas you can become a teacher, a doctor, or a woman. But you have to work to get there, and ultimately, society has to let you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: What do you mean?  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: I can identify as a doctor and go around handing out diagnoses, but if no one recognizes me as a doctor then I'm not really practicing medicine, am I?  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: But that analogy means that our womanhood can be revoked at any moment, all it takes is being misgendered.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: It's scary, but isn't that the situation we're in? Why did you get so angry when that TERF called you "sir"? Isn't it because in that situation she robbed you of your womanhood?  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: That's rediculous. I am a woman. That's my reality. It doesn't depend on other people's opinions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justine: I know you're a woman. I'm just saying that in that one moment, you effectively had your gender cancelled. Another way of looking at it is gender is aesthetic, not rational. Either you're perceived as a woman or you aren't. There's no reasoning your way into it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tabby: Oh, don't worry about that. I don't argue I'm a woman. I smash.  
&gt;  
&gt;...Hey folks, to make sure we stay focused on the arguments from Contrapoints’ video and strive to find the middle ground, instead of all this infighting, I thought it might be helpful to summarize either side’s arguments in more neutral terms. I likely didn’t pick up on everything so feel free to share your input and we can update this list as we go:

1. Aesthetics as Politics: Tabby treats aesthetics as inherently political if it lacks any sense of self, in which case it amounts to nothing more than propaganda. Justine sees it as a tool for trans women to gain acceptance in society and to be seen as legitimate women. 

2. Reason vs. Spectacle: Tabby takes a more idealist stance, that women of all kinds should not have to be marginalized, and that it is society’s responsibility to accept them. Justine sees marginality due to divergence from the norm as an unchangeable reality, that acceptance can only come from conformity to society’s views on women, that standing from the norm is asking for marginality.
 
3. The Direction of Causality: There appears to be an agreement that identity and expression are associated, but the direction of causality is disputed. Tabby argues that aesthetics are the product of a psychological reality, while Justine sees Aesthetics as creating the identity; it persuaded society to treat one as the identity they are trying to be perceived as. This last one comes to a middle ground on its own: Tabby and Justine agree that aesthetics can be expressed in more ways than the hyperfeminine if maneuvered correctly, but Justine insists that the individual should meet society halfway, by expressing basic levels of societal respect (don’t punch terfs). Tabby disagrees, as she sees it as the first only way to achieve her goal set in point 2 above.
So one point I've seen made in this whole discussion is that Justine is very close in presentation to the main ContraPoints persona, leading some to go as far as to assume that she is mouthpiece for Natalie's own convictions. While (as people have rightly pointed out) this is not likely, I haven't seen any explanations as to why Justine isn't as visually distinctive as the other characters, and here's my two cents why.

Justine is a self-caricature of the persona Natalie takes on when she's participating in debates on platforms on the right side of the spectrum, and a way to process criticism levelled at her on how and why she does that to begin with. 

The clearest point towards this is Tabby's recurring criticism in "Athestetics" and "The Left" of Justine of "you go to brunch with these people!?", which Nat mentioned in an AMA as a comment that was made to herself about the fact that she participated in debates on right wing platforms. But it's also reflected in how Justine is written.

Justine holds very muted versions of the sort of views that the main ContraPoints persona will promote, but has this almost obsessive focus on optics - which is, of course, exactly what allows her to be accepted on the abovementioned platforms. She sees this work as important and able to make a difference (unlike Tabby's "larping"). But it also makes her a target and highly at risk of being misgendered and humiliated, hence her cynicism, defensiveness but also the empathy towards Tabby's humiliation. 

I know this is all a bit obvious, but I thought talking about how the character of Justine is constructed would help reassure some of the people afraid Justine is meant to serve as a front for Nat's "true" views. One of the interesting things I find about this vid is that it pits a character written to be charismatic but utterly unpersuasive (Tabby) against the personification of the entire time and effort ContraPoints has invested into being persuasive enough to change people's minds. Justine will always come across as compelling even when she's spouting nonsense, while Tabby will never present a monologue with the same panache because that hits against the constraints of her character. But I for one think that this is not reflective of any authorial intention on Nat's part to favour Justine. Justine is useful (as is Tabby) to help convey certain ideas, but I find Natalie is distancing herself from fully endorsing this way of thinking and being by creating this character (a quite unpleasant one at that) open for ridicule and criticism.

If there's a quote from Nat that clarifies this, or a comment I've missed in another thread that addresses this, please link.The recent video got me thinking.  

^^^For ^^^the ^^^sake ^^^of ^^^expedience ^^^I ^^^will ^^^be ^^^excluding ^^^AFAB ^^^trans ^^^people

And while thinking A E S T H E T I C; I came up with a useful proof for a hypothetically perfectly passing post op transgender woman being a woman, this is not to say that not passing people aren't woman, but it's a proof that passing woman are, which can in turn be used as a proof or an argument for gender identity.

Anyway the proof:

* Words are 100% malleable and redefinable. They can change spelling, meaning, and even become the exact opposite of what they once meant. What things are don't change, just what words refer to. "Literally" literally doesn't mean literally any more, gay has gone through a gambit of iterations, and 16th century English is unintelligible, please stop teaching Shakespeare, it is literally useless.

* Therefore words mean what they mean, if everyone on earth agrees on the definition of a word, that is the definition of a word. If everyone agrees the word "man" refers to women then when you say "man" you mean women, because.... that's language

* A perfectly passable, post op woman with no one alive who does not believe they are a woman, is therefore a woman. If every single person on earth who met this woman would agree they were a woman, then they are by definition.

* Therefore said woman must be a woman

* Therefore any definition of the word woman must include women who are perfectly passable


Obviously this is super p-r-r-r-o-o-o-b-b-b-l-l-e-e-e-m-a-a-t-t-t-i-i-c-c. But also explains the desire for perfect A E S T H E T I C is explained because it logically guarantees you womanhood.

The problem comes when you apply this to all woman or suggest that it is a requirement, I think an obsessive need to be what you are can cause a person to act irrationally or harmfully. Similar to how an Anorexic person's desire to be what they already are makes them sick, an obsession with being perfectly A E S T H E T I C can lead to self loathing, cruelty and exclusion of others.


The problem ultimately lies in the view that someone not believing you are a woman robs you of your womanhood, since gender is identification if someone else identifies you as a man, you are in some way some small bit a man, or at least you fit under someone's definition of a man.

I don't think this hold up to scrutiny, because words don't change what a thing is, would a rose by any other name smell as sweet? You cannot be defined by words, words are given definitions to identify you. 

Therefore I view gender as a qualitative adjunct to a relationship or interaction.

If someone misgenders you the interaction has no gender because you do not in turn respond to that interaction. You do not become a male back at the person misgendering you. social interaction is a two way street, a person interacts with a woman as a woman and the woman interacts back as a woman, if a man interacts to a woman as a man that does not change her gender it removes gender from their interactions.

I think this view holds up to philosophical scrutiny. And anyone who identifies internally as a gender is that gender in their interactions with themselves. If you interact with your spouse that way then that is how your interactions are gendered, gender is how you interact. If you interact with everything as a woman then you are a woman, even if no one believes you.**Hi, girls**

Hey! A lot of posts are getting mired in discussion about the the characters themselves, how close they are to Natalie's views, and people taking sides with the two characters. A lot of people are upset with this, but I think it's great. With a few exceptions, most of the discourse going on is wonderful. I feel like there is some really interesting philosophy to talk about that is getting swept under the rug, though!

To get the other stuff out of the way so we can get to this philosophy:

* I think neither character was right and we are supposed to find a middle ground.
* I'm gonna dig into Natalie's twitter for context, but this is not an attack on her beliefs or her motivations for making this video the way she did.
* I'm going to correct these character's philosophy literacy, but I think these character's purposefully have shaky philosophy, and I'm not trying to attack Contra's literacy. I think she is more well read than me by a lot.
* I don't think this video is about anything other than binary MTF transwomen, but that doesn't give us more of a right to talk about it.
* I don't take this video personally at all because I think that it is specifically about being a public figure, and is told by two voices in Natalie's head. More over when we attack these fictional characters, we are saying, "you should feel ashamed for these thoughts" which are very normal thoughts for trans girls to go through. It feels more personal to many. Let's be nice

Okay, some context. I'm a trans girl (well intersex, but I identify as trans), I used to run a trans beauty blog that addressed the issue of passing a fair amount, and I have an undergrad degree in Aesthetic Philosophy, so needless to say this is my favorite Contra video yet, and I'm excited. Let's get to it.

**You like philosophy so much, haven't you read Judith Butler?**

This is the biggie. This is the idea of the video. "Gender is performance." Judith Butler famously moved away from our sexuality and Lacanian gaze based views of womanhood and what it means to be a woman, and proposed that gender is something we do. Justine is saying that trans women have to perform womanhood, otherwise, are they really women? If nobody sees them as women, are they women? She's saying at least, if not passing, people have to see that they are trying. We hear this idea a lot nowadays, that gender is a social construct. Justine says "haven't you read Judith Butler?"

But has Justine? Not very well. Justine get's Judith Butler totally wrong. Next sentence out of her mouth? "Gender is performance." Okay, define that... "We're all born naked and the rest is literally drag." No, this is totally wrong. Butler uses the idea that Gender acts as a sort of performance to start her discourse, but quickly clarifies what that means. She means gender is a series of actions we take. Butler goes on to clarify that she used performance as a shortcut word, but introduces a new word "performativity." It is not performed, as in our real self faking it, but performative, as in it is something that we actively do, and that action makes it become a part of our real self.

Justine gets halfway there. "I don't mean performance in the sense of pretending to be something you're not. I mean performance in the sense of everything you do, the way you style yourself, your posture, the way you speak." Okay, but Justine never explains the difference. She goes on to act as if the way you speak, style yourself, and your posture are something you should move to be more "womanly" and in doing so, a clear distinction between pretending and "everything you do" is unclear.

The step that Justine is lacking is that she seems to advocate consciously doing these actions. If you do these actions consciously, they are no longer "performativity," they are just "performance." The difference is that in performativity, the actions that you are doing contribute to who you are as a person, and in performance, they do not. A key difference is that performativity is not something you control.

Maybe Justine is aware of this, following it up with "An authentic performance is just a habitual performance." If you do it enough on purpose, it will just become real. But still it's a conscious choice being made. I think that this is adding a bit to Butler. Characterizing this as purely Butlerian is disingenuine on Justine's part.

**A Wittgenstein Gal**

Sorry Natalie, but I'm diving into your personal views because you say something really useful for my analysis.

&gt; Well like all philosophical questions "What is womanhood?" has no definitive answer. But I'll tell you my thoughts. Remember, I'm a Wittgenstein gal: I don't think the answer can involve "identifying" because meaning is public &amp; practical, not private &amp; psychological.

(Let me take a moment to remind you that I absolutely do not think that Natalie and Justine agree, and this tweet is in no way proof that their opinions align; I have taken it out of context).

This tweet gives us something really interesting to go on. Justine would absolutely agree with Natalie on this point. But can she agree with Natalie/Wittgenstein and with Butler at the same time?

Butler's stance is being characterized by Justine to basically be the same stance as this Wittgensteinian "meaning is public" thing. It's close. It's really close. But at the end of the day it's almost more in line with Buddhist philosophy.

Buddhist philosophy basically states that we are only the sum of our actions, and that every action contributes to who we are. But, and this is a big but, it also holds that this sense of being and identity is not solely public. In Buddhism, we are the sum of every action we take, public and private, and peoples interpretation of those actions is not what matters, but the actions themselves, because they are tied to intention at some level.

Let's finally get back to some trans stuff so I can use a metaphor to explain what I mean. To Wittgenstein, if you dress like a woman, put on makeup, grow your hair out, and absolutely never pass and everybody treats you like a man anyways, you are not a woman. To Buddhist philosophy, if you dress like a woman, put on makeup, grow your hair out, and absolutely never pass and everybody treats you like a man anyways, you are still just as much of a woman. It is about the actions you take, not how people see them.

**It doesn't depend on other people's opinions.**

Back to Butler, note that I said almost. I don't think Butler would totally agree with either camp. But, despite talking about how society has largely shaped our conception of these categories, Butler never really says that society gets to be the judge. To Butler, society just sets up the target, they don't judge the shot. She emphasizes the action itself as the final word. The only other contributing factor she even focuses on is intent, distinguishing women from drag queens by their intention. 

I could go on about how intention is tied to identity, and since society isn't the judge, we get to create our own vision of what a woman is and then perform those actions, and how Butler is probably more in line with Tabby than Justine, but a bit moderated, accepting that some of the broad strokes are defined by society. I'm not going to though because that argument would be longer than this whole post. Just know that I think this is the case.

So in Tabby's absurd example, and it is a rather absurd example, of a cis man going through transition for no reason, Justine decides that that person is a woman. Butler would entirely disagree. I think Butler, would also disagree with the characterization of society as a judge and arbitrator in general. To use real examples, I think it would be hard for anyone to make an actual philosophical argument that Joan of Arc or Hua Mulan was a man.

Justine takes Butler's ideas and only says the first half without the very important second half. She says "performance" instead of "performativity" the entire time, which is hugely disingenuous, she sets up society as the arbitrator instead of letting the action be it's own arbitrator, and completely contradicts Butler's view of intent.

She claims to have built her viewpoint on the foundation of feminist theory, deriding Tabby for not being familiar enough with it, but actually has it all wrong. In the end she is not actually proposing a philosophical position of any sort, though she seems to want all this philosophy to back her up. Tabby isn't in a place to defend herself from what is essentially pop-feminism mumbo jumbo, and so Justine uses it to prop up her position, which is not philosophical at all, but is political and practical

**Reality plays no role in politics**

Now it's my turn to do some analysis about the video itself, and not just break apart the philosophy discussed in the video. Early on, I think Justine is very honest about her goals. She is presenting a very political, liberal not leftist, optics centered argument about one specific person, Tabby. She has a point, the bat thing was bad optics. Moreover, at first, Justine is treating this as a political issue, then expands on it, saying that the world is a world of spectacle and a world of aesthetics, it's not just politics. Time to quote Natalie again. (Once again, I do not want to tie all of Natalie's opinions to all of Justine's. They just provide context).

&gt; The way I think of it, the purpose of my transition is to become a woman *for most intents and purposes.* That's a very public, social goal that primarily involves the interactions I have with people around me.


&gt;But pedantically speaking, before I transitioned, I was a man *for most intents and purposes.* I was socially and publicly a man.

This is Natalie's take on herself before and after transition. This happens to also be my exact take on myself. This is basically the place where Justine's argument begins. It's very reasonable and hard to disagree with. There is something important here though. "For most intents and purposes." 
This disclaimer says to me, and I don't want to speak for Natalie, but it says to me that it isn't just public perception that makes you a gender.

Justine does not take that extra step Natalie does. She doesn't acknowledge that identity plays a part in it at all.

As Justine goes one, she starts acting as if she has the philosophical high ground, and that it isn't merely a political position. Perhaps this is where people get a bit confused about this video, because they don't realize Justine's feminist philosophy is complete bunk.

I said I'd do some analysis, and here it is: Justine, as a character, is on the defensive. She has the weak point and she knows it. She goes from saying it's a political optics thing, to saying its just the way the world works, to saying that she has philosophically sound and feminist stance. She just can't defend any of her points and has to move more and more broad. If that sounds familiar, it's basically how Jordan Peterson wins debates. It's impossible to debate against. When the fact that she's going broad is attacked ("Life is not a show.") Justine goes narrow again ("politics is a show."), just to go back to saying it applies to everything in life two sentences later. How do you attack that?

As she progresses she talks about being pretty and the "trans girl black pill" and how Contra lost the debate to Blair because of optics (which at the end of the day, no moderates were swayed by or even watched, the Blair followers agreed with Blair, but it was Contra's channel who grew, so it seems like it raised more awareness for Contra's side. Isn't that winning?). Justine is an embodiment of deep insecurities in the mind of every trans girl. And she just grows more extreme. 

As she gets more extreme, her philosophy grows more and more incorrect. I feel like people would be far less upset at this video if they realized that she is completely wrong with all the philosophy that she quotes. (If there was one thing I would change in this video, it's to have Tabby be literate enough to call out this bad philosophy so the audience doesn't actually believe this is Butler's stance). (Also, I know people are upset for other reasons, too).

**I know you're a woman**

To finish off my point, Justine doesn't seem to even believe what she is saying. She recognizes Tabby as a woman. When Tabby stands up for herself and says she's a woman, Justine says, "I know." Clearly she knows that she doesn't actually have the philosophical or moral high ground, just as, say, Jordan Peterson knows he doesn't either. Both of them just think their political aims are worth pretending that they do. (Or maybe it's just because Justine is one of two voices in Contra's head, and so she only exists in apologetics, not in real opinions).

I think that we are always supposed to find a middle ground between the two sides with Contra's dialectic videos. For this video, we have some help in that we can actually read Natalie's real opinions on this in her [twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1006648025148723200.html) I keep quoting from, as well as by actually reading Judith Butler's very nuanced view on this situation. 

As a tangent about this twitter thread, I actually think, judging by my interpretation of Justine as a Natalie parody who takes from Jordan Peterson and Blair White, that Natalie is much closer to Tabby's view now than she was when she wrote this twitter thread. And I think her view as stated in this twitter thread gave more credence to the idea of gender being more than social than her video on AGP did. It's seemed like a change over time to me. I don't mean to ascribe a position to the video, it's probably my own biases. But I thought that the way the video seemed to stand up for Tabby at the end signaled a clear time where philosophy (especially bad philosophy) can't win out over something that you just know to be true. 

The video ends with Justine conceding this point, saying that Tabby is right. She essentially rolls back every argument except for her initial one that the violence was bad optics. To me it seems like a concession that she was exceedingly going broader as a poor defense mechanism, and with the association Contra's audience has between this technique and figures like Jordan Peterson, It seems by association to be a concession that her philosophy was wrong.

I think the final argument about meekness and violence is in a way the only valid argument in the material. It's not hard to figure out that there is a middle ground that is the right answer between their stances on the nature of femininity and presentation. But at the end, this question of meekness and violence lingers. I don't think Blaire is doing our community any favors by playing the acquiescent conservative stepping stone. I don't think Zoey Tur is doing us any favors by threatening to beat Ben Shapiro up on TV. Which of these evils is greater? (cough, it's Blaire, cough) Does it matter? 

The video doesn't take a center position of meeting halfway between these two extremes. Rather it poses these two characters, Tabby and Justine and less extreme than Zoey and Blaire, but more extreme than "trans centrists." It shows that anybody in the trans community, regardless of their opinions on this sort of thing, can work together, that we don't have to regress to the center, but we can also keep each other from going to the harmful Zoey and Blaire extremes by being on the same team.

**Ugh**

I didn't mean for that to be so long. I guess my thoughts were way more complicated than I realized. I just thought the point about Justine not knowing her Butler totally changed the video and nobody has mentioned it yet that I've seen, but it's hard to mention briefly, you kind of have to dive in. I don't mean to be didactic about it, I just wanted to introduce discussion about the philosophy presented in the video into the conversation. Thoughts?**Edit: it was pointed out to me that I'm saying these discussions are "cool" when they have real consequences. What I'm trying to say is that it's been very educational to me to see all sides. I feel like it's hard to approach these topics as a cis person and I like the video presents topics without answering them so that I can think about them on my own. I never meant to trivialize anything or view this as a purely academic exercise. I'm saying it's cool because I finally feel like I got a real taste of the full discussion, good, bad, ugly, and all. I'm ignorant. I know that. But sometimes it helps to see the full, ugly side of a viewpoint to better understand why it's wrong.**

All of the discussion following the latest video is insanely interesting. I feel like I'm being welcomed into a discussion that's much more complex than I ever imagined. Whether Contra meant this or meant that, which character is "right", whether it makes sense for a character to *be* "right" or that doesnt exist, etc. 

I understand some people are a bit unhappy with the video and that it's been pretty divisive, but these topics are divisive, otherwise we wouldn't be talking about them. I think Contra has done a great job of presenting a discussion in a way that's open to interpretation. **By doing this, she is not another "sjw telling people to believe x y z", she's opening the hard questions for everyone to see.** I think *that* is the point. The video is partly for people in LGBT to think about, but also the most backwards, anti-sjw people to watch. Maybe if they can see how confusing this all is in the first place, they'll have more understanding. This is a discussion for everyone. 

It's really cool to get a taste of some questions that the trans community is dealing with. I've always been accepting of LGBT in general but when it comes to harder questions, I'm sort of at a loss because, how the hell should I know. Now it feels like I'm coming to these questions  with at least a small taste of what it's like to be on the other side of them.In the nature of putting effort to "feminize" to pass, to someone who's not lucky enough to possess "feminine" features that can be amplified through dress and makeup, wouldn't female mannerisms instead amplify how actually "un-female" someone is? I'm guessing that might be the point of the character.I'm pretty sure that Zoe Blade creates all of the music used on Contra's videos.  Does anyone know where to find the music played over the ending credits in the "Aesthetic" video?  I want to listen to a longer version if it's available!I watched Aesthetics yesterday.

But before I get to that, I have to jump back a bit. I'm a trans woman who has been on HRT for almost 9 months. I'm 31 and have known I wanted to transition for a decade, and doing so was huge for me. I'm starting a PhD that's closely tied to philosophy and have always felt a lot of kinship to Natalie's perspective on being trans. That said, I don't pass.

So two weeks ago, at the very beginning of my PhD, in which I'm teaching as well, my spouse and I decided to buy this beautiful rug from a reseller we'd heard good things about. The problem is that when it came it smelled like approximately 1000 asses. It was packed with dust and gave my spouse a huge asthma attack. I spent the time in between then and now trying to call a cleaner who could fix it. Eventually I found someone who was super nice on the phone, offered to pick it up for free (the thing's huge), and best of all, he gendered me correctly on the phone.

I spent the whole summer doing voice training and started at a very deep and "male" place, it's been really hard, but I made progress. This was the first time anyone, ANYONE, had called me "ma'am" and "miss" on the phone, blind. And not just once, but throughout the days organizing the pick up every time he got it right. It felt great. The effort I was putting into it worked. That confirmation gave me so much confidence for these first stressful weeks that I didn't feel as scared and pathetic as I usually do when I wear a dress or skirt or go out with make-up on. I was a visible trans woman teaching, studying, being present in classes, being a resource to students - little things like really help given how exhausting transitioning publicly is.

Then he came to pick up the rug this morning, and almost immediately I was "sir" again. I even corrected him, "you actually got it right with ma'am," but no, I was "sir" through the whole interaction. The invoice on which he'd written Ms. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ was scratched out and replaced with Mr. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. My gender was revoked, to quote from the video.

But I don't tell this story just to give an example of something every trans person is well aware of. After it happened I was really upset, much more than any one-off misgendering (which I usually don't care about), and told my spouse. She was the one to repeat the Tabby lines: "Who cares what that idiot thinks," "I don't think you need FFS, you are a woman no matter what," "People should just get used to it, they should just know," etc.  But then I talked about how it is important to me to pass when I want to pass, and she switched to the Justine lines: "Of course, it's important to me that people know I'm with a woman and not a man, I know how you feel," "Well maybe you could focus on the hairline, and here's how you can save money for surgery," "Maybe if you'd known he was coming and had more time to prepare," etc. That's when I began thinking back to Aesthetics and seeing how much of its arguments had been played out in my experience and in the way the only person who is really supportive of me knows how to address that experience.

Right now the debate on the sub seems to be about authorial voice and intentions in the video, about whether we're supposed to read between the lines or pick a side. You know what I think? I think that this video wasn't made for me. This video offers me as a trans woman nothing, and it's clearly not something for cis people who don't have any understanding of the stakes of its debate. From the Justine standpoint, the exchange reinforces my self-hatred and my partner's insensitivity (let's face it, it happens with the most supportive people), and from the Tabby standpoint turns my desires and principles into a problem to be fixed. This video hurt in the same way that the interaction with this delivery guy hurt, because I'm not on either side of the debate or anywhere in between. I'm not trying to insist that this person should recognize my womanhood no matter what. I'm not trying to rationalize the revocation of my gender based on a failed performance. I just want my fucking house not to smell like dead sheep, I just want to get the fucking rug cleaned. The reality of being trans, the lifeworld of being trans, isn't some endless debate between pragmatic performance or idealist defiance, it's all this day to day shit. It's getting the fucking rug cleaned. It's going to the dentist. It's taking out the garbage. It's being there for your trans friend who got called a "faggot" while taking out the garbage for who knows what reason. What am I going to do for that friend after they slip into a dysphoric loop because of something banal like that, tell them to watch that new Contra video, Aesthetics? Nope.

Remember when in the Incels video Nat said that it's important not to expose yourself to toxicity? That's how I feel right now. I feel like I'm subjecting myself to an amplification of what I already go through by watching Aesthetics and by thinking about it. And in fact this sort of thing has been in the last few videos, from Tiffany Tumbles to Incels to now, and it's clear that Natalie is trying to work something out that's pretty upsetting to both her and people like me. Much like putting a content blocker up to protect yourself, I need to do that. Because I need to go to teach a class full of 30 people who I know see me as a guy in a dress on Monday and I don't need any more of this "debate" in my head than there already is.A few months ago I posted a list of videos and articles/blogs in which Ben Shapiro gets debunked on his nonsense about trans people and data:

https://np.reddit.com/r/BreadTube/comments/8ho3yn/ben_shapiro_lies_about_transgender_people_and_data/

It makes me really happy that left wing/anti-reactionary youtube is rising and reactionaries getting more bad time like milo is irelevant, alex jones gets banned, peterson gets more debunks and so on and even shapiro gets more negative things.

Anyway, thats another topic. 

What I like to see is a video from Natalie on debunking Ben Shapiros nonsense about trans people and data. Of course she can use the list that I posted (if she is active in here) as a help-tool. Shapiro makes many wrong statements about trans people and data and i think it is time that Natalie does a video about this like she has on Peterson. Shapiro gets more debunked on yt about other stuff but no bigger youtuber has ever made a debunking video on his nonsense on the trans topic. 

Of course if you have more videos/articles/blogs where he gets debunked, simply post it in the comments :-)

But also to be honest, I dont care THAT much if Natalie or hbomb or shaun does that debunking...or maybe two of them or all three of them do an epic debunking video, blasting Shapiro and show even more what a hack he really is. 

But I really DO think that someone please finally does this &gt;.&lt;


Like at the beginning where her character was mixing white and black and then drinking it[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7Ft2E\_ibxQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7Ft2E_ibxQ)

It's beautiful! What are your thoughts on this??

Do you think this will create improvements within the trasnsgender community? I was honestly just about to post the exact same thing I just found in [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/9hth6g/i_think_it_is_time_that_natalie_makes_a_video_on/) from hours ago, but I entirely agree with [u/b3t4s0yb0y12345](https://www.reddit.com/user/b3t4s0yb0y12345)'s sentiment that Nat should do a video responding to Ben Shapiro's views on trans issues. So I'm posting this anyway in the hope that I'll help add fuel to the fire so eventually Natalie will notice a widespread sentiment from her fans that this is something they want to see.

To respond to some of the disagreement with the idea of doing such a video that the last post received, I don't think this would have to be a 'debunking' of Ben Shapiro as I concur this isn't the style of ContraPoints, but I do think an overall attempt to explain to people *why* Ben's views on gender dysphoria and the trans identity is misguided. Secondly, I've seen some people say that it's best not to bother with Shapiro at all because a: you'll never win over his hardcore fans who think he's this generation's Aristotle or b: because it's best to leave such disgusting people alone rather than giving them more attention, but both of them are wrong for the same reason. This video wouldn't be to convince people who have already denied the legitimate science of gender so much that they will agree with Shapiro almost no matter what they hear from a trans intersectional feminist, but to convince the ordinary people who are misled by Shapiro's widely popular videos. Shapiro's statements on this issue, such as the one with Zoey Tur that was shown in 'The Aesthetic' or his appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, have colossal view counts. Nearly tens of millions of people have seen these things and have likely taken Shapiro's arguments for granted. The dangerous influence this could have on our society, especially young and impressionable people, can't be understated and needs to be addressed by someone with the visibility and expertise Natalie has. 

That's why Ben Shapiro can't be ignored and why it's crucial Natalie make this video. If anyone can tweet her about this or bring it up on Patreon (I'm not on either platform myself) please do. This isn't a matter of 'oh wouldn't this be a fun subject to cover", this is really fucking important.Hey folks! Contrapoints’ last video on the aesthetic has been making me think back to an article I was assigned to read in my sociology of gender class in college about a year ago. It basically discusses the topic of ‘doing Gender’ and how people can challenge rigid perceptions of gender. I’ll leave a link below and I’d love to hear people’s opinions.

[Doing Gender (West and Zimmerman 1987)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/0t4/crcees/files/summerschool/readings/WestZimmerman_1987_DoingGender.pdf)What's up with Jackie Jackson in the Aesthetic? Why is she so tired and why is she wearing those sunglasses?It was nice to see how Justine in The Aesthetic points to the double standard of "passing." The way that the concept of "passing" is only applicable to trans people and not to cis people. Cis women are fully clockable and have no idea what they are doing, while trans women have to directly communicate with the Eternal Feminine just to be taken seriously.

Also, did you know Julia Serano foreshadowed this video in 2007? :p

&gt;The crux of the problem is that the words “pass” and “passing” are active verbs. So when we say that a transsexual is “passing,” it gives the false impression that they are the only active participant in this scenario (i.e., the transsexual is working hard to achieve a certain gendered appearance and everyone else is passively being duped or not duped by the transsexual’s “performance”). However, I would argue that the reverse is true: The public is the primary active participant by virtue of their incessant need to gender every person they see as either female or male. The transsexual can react to this situation in one of two ways: They can either try to live up to public expectations about maleness and femaleness in an attempt to fit in and avoid stigmatization, or they can disregard public expectations and simply be themselves. However, if they choose the latter, the public will still judge them based on whether they appear female or male and, of course, others may still accuse them of “passing,” even though they have not actively done anything. Thus, the active role played by those who compulsively distinguish between women and men (and who discriminate between transsexuals and cissexuals) is made invisible by the concept of “passing.”So, I think watching Contrapoints' latest video helped me in a weird way last night. I frequent an LGBTQ youth center near me (I'm an 18, soon to be 19, pansexual transman), and twice a month they have a trans/nonbinary support group. The topic of discussion at the group last night was on passing, what it means to us, and how at times the concept can be *p r o b l e m a t i c*. Having just seen the newest video that morning, I had had just enough time to contemplate what had been discussed in it. The conflicting ideas that trans people should attempt to emulate the stereotypical look of their gender, versus the idea that simply identifying as a girl is good enough, that we shouldn't have to conform to gender stereotypes just because we're not cis. Even though, as most of her gender related videos are, the video was centered more on mtf trans people, I as a ftm trans person was able to relate it to myself. I feel this pressure sometimes to be a super macho dudebro, when deep down that's not the man I want to be. Same goes for some of the transgirls I know, but instead they feel a pressure towards extreme feminity, when they don't necessarily want that. It was also interesting to talk about how some of my nonbinary friends don't really always have a gender or aesthetic to conform to when they try to pass. After all, how can one pass as bigender or agender or genderqueer? Sorry if I rambled a bit, but I really just wanted to get this out. I mean, obviously the Freedom Report part was written to be off. I'm too dumb to analyse what that means, but I haven't seen anyone talking about it yet, so just to list off some obvious points:

* Jackie Jackson (that's her name, right? the reporter/moderator/hostess of the show) was really dull and uninterested
* The lighting was red and green iirc?
* Abigail Cockbane got a makeover. She looks a lot more serious and... I don't want to use the word badass, but that's the closest word I can think of?
* The music felt unsettling.

I know that the "debate" was discussed as a segue into Justine's whole thing, but I wonder if there's more to that. Or maybe I'm being dumb.When Justine metions that a trans person's gender can be revoked by others by simply misgendering them, it's something that it's surprisingly familiar to cis people.

I know this cis guy, when I met him he was waaaay over the top with how manly he appeared to be, how ridiculously manly? This 20 year old man would refuse to even catch female pokemon "because they're for girls". Later, I found out he had gynecomastia and was constantly afraid, paranoid really, of being perceived as unmanly by his peers because of it. So he would overperform his gender 24/7.

And I also know this cis chick who was pretty much the definiton of conventionally beautiful. The right face, the right proportions -everything, but she was terrified of having sex or being naked in front of others because she had hairy boobs she would constantly shave to the point of hurting herself. She told me her body hair made her feel "Like less of a woman", and she was afraid of people seeing her as a man because of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I know that trans people go through this too... I'm not sure what lesson to get out of this, and I was hoping one of you would help a clueless cis out.What does it really mean to eat barbecue? Like, really eat it?

In the fourteenth episode of Nickelodeon's The Adventures of Pete and Pete, we encounter a character named Inspector 34. Inspector 34 is a perfectionist, who can seemingly perform any task perfectly: parallel parking, squeezing toothpaste from a tube, filling an ice tray without spilling water, and so on. To finally defeat him, Little Pete Wrigley challenges Inspector 34 to one last performance: eating barbecue chicken. Brandishing a fork and knife, the Inspector finishes the meal cleanly, neatly, and perfectly--not a single bone ajar, nor any drop of sauce out of place. But as he is smugly placing his silverware down, seemingly victorious, the gathered crowd begins to murmur with suspicion: "Moisty naps?...You're supposed to use your hands... It tastes better that way..."

Pete hits him with the bad news: "Barbecues are SUPPOSED to be messy. Eating perfectly... is imperfect."

What the Inspector had missed was that the essence of a perfect barbecue requires performative enthusiasm: spilled sauce, messy hands--in a word, wild abandon of the sort we saw Tiffany Tumbles display in her Trans Tips barbecue video. By contrast, Inspector 34's seemingly perfect approach to chicken consumption had robbed the act of its verisimilitude.

What Justine misses in evaluating Tabby's gender performance in the face of the uncooperative co-performer Abigail's misgendering is that her emotional reaction is not a performative failure, but rather a deeply competent example of gender performance in itself. A perfectly feminine reaction would be an imperfect one. Declaring "I'll smash your fucking face!" is, to a certain audience, not Tabby dropping her performance, but rather an expertly-executed extension and elaboration of the performance, making her womanhood more believable, more relatable, and more real.

I know a woman with a stereotypically male first name. When it would happen, as it did on occasion, that a foolhardy bill collector or customer service representative would call her "sir" on the phone, she would never hesitate to get Truly Angry and spit venom in their ear until she got an apology (and oftentimes, a better deal from an apologetic supervisor). Her womanhood was unquestionable.

Tabby's performance, as exaggerated as it is, rings true.

The unfeminine, perfect imperfection of her rage grants Tabby's womanhood a kind of verisimilitude that the seemingly-more-perfectly-feminine Tiffany Tumbles struggled to achieve when misgendered by Abigail in "TERFs." Indeed, Tiffany's performance faltered in the face of Abigail's repeated attacks, most notably at 6:50. Tiffany allows a cruel remark to defeat her, seemingly unable to summon the kind of righteous indignation that allows a personality like Tabby to defend her own womanhood from the oppressor.

If Tiffany's performance falters when confronted with Abigail's misgendering, Tabby's performance falls apart when confronted with high heels. She cannot bring herself to summon the same enthusiasm for bougie nonsense that allows Justine to perform a catwalk with enthusiastic verisimilitude. Tabby recognizes that her audience is Justine, and that Justine expects a particular kind of gender performance in that moment, and her reluctance to provide it undermines not only the performance itself but also her own self-image. And though she at last relents and demonstrates a measure of catwalking competence on the second attempt, she is still deeply uncomfortable with the exercise; the performance is "feminine," but it feels "fake," and by extension Tabby's own internal sense of femininity might be called into question: if she feels "fake" performing this kind of womanhood, and if her performance therefore lacks emotional verisimilitude, is she "really" a woman? Is she really eating barbecue if she isn't enjoying it?

Tabby resolves this by noting that there are many ways to perform womanhood, and Justine's way is not the one-and-only. There is no singular archetype of the eternal feminine; Tabby has forged her own revolutionary definition of womanhood, and she inhabits it perfectly well already, and is rightly admired for it. And yet, for a moment there, Tabby--the fierce, combative catgirl whose confidence in her own womanhood lets her go toe-to-toe with transphobes and come out unscathed--crumpled in the face of an apparently-well-meaning ally.

We can contrast this with Tiffany Tumbles' debate with Adria. Tiffany's carefully choreographed performance crumbles during Adria's discussion of the feminine penis; she can already feel the judgmental eyes of the youtube audience turning against them both. Adria, of course, is indifferent--she is not performing for ignorant transphobes; she is performing for herself, for her girlfriend, and for her leftist audience. If anything, having the confidence to assert her own womanhood without appeasing transphobes enhances the verisimilitude of Adria's performance for her intended audience. But Tiffany doesn't have a leftist audience or a communist girlfriend; her performance can only really appeal to transphobes, and Adria's unfiltered sincerity cuts through Tiffany's filtered insincerity like a hot knife through butter. She can only lash out and beg Adria to stop. The ultimate result of this painful transaction is that the verisimilitude of Adria's performance is enhanced, while Tiffany's is utterly depleted, as one might expect--Tiffany's performative strategy is zero-sum with the performances of other transwomen, and Adria refused to crumble.

So, what would have happened if Tabby had refused to crumble? What if Tabby had completely refused the shoes and confidently asserted that womanhood was not about shoes from beginning to end? Well, her own performance would have gained verisimilitude; but Justine's performance would have been diminished. If Tabby can convincingly argue that womanhood has nothing to do with shoes, then Justine's womanhood becomes a sham.

Tabby is too kind-hearted to do this to Justine. If a random cisgender misogynist told her that a woman needs high heels to be woman, Tabby wouldn't hesitate to bring the heat. But Tabby doesn't want to invalidate Justine. She allows her own performance to be temporarily diminished for Justine's sake. It is a gesture of pure self-sacrifice: Tabby gives up her own verisimilitude and grants it to Justine.

Justine, rather than recognizing that this selfless transaction has occurred, revels in the victory. Her victory speech: "That was iconic; I'm living for this; I'm living this for you;" can be taken quite literally--it is not so much a compliment aimed at validating Tabby's performance as it is a celebration of her own triumph. It is cruel; it is ungrateful; and Tabby already regrets letting her have that. The unspoken subtexts are twofold--that Justine's vision of womanhood is "the real one;" and that because she's particularly good at it, she is "more of a woman." Justine's performative strategy, like Tiffany's, is zero-sum. It would not be enough for Justine to simply perform a catwalk well--the catwalk doesn't speak for itself. Justine's performance requires Tabby to accept the catwalk as a measure of femininity, then earnestly try to match Justine's enthusiastic verisimilitude for it and fail. "Fail" not in the sense that she can't look good in heels--because she clearly can--but "fail" in the sense that it Feels Fake to Tabby's internal sensors and thus clobbers her where it hurts most: her self-image. Justine's is a vampiric performative strategy. Tiffany demonstrated what it looks like to "lose" with that strategy, and now Justine is demonstrating what it looks like to "win" with it.

Of course, they both know that if Tabby forcefully rejects the catwalk as a measure of womanhood, Justine's performance will implode. But Tabby isn't hard-hearted Adria. For all her bluster, Tabby's heart is still soft! Tabby doesn't want to destroy Justine--she wants to bring her around. And so, Tabby offers a way out: You perform Justine's ideal of womanhood, and I will perform Tabby's ideal of womanhood, and our performances will be judged according to our own ideals.

But Justine sarcastically rejects the notion: "Well kids, today we learned a valuable lesson about the importance of being yourself."

And so, Tabby unsheathes her katana: Mine is a vision of womanhood that anyone can achieve. Yours is a vision that not even cis women can live up to. I have thousands of people invested in my vision of womanhood--how many people are invested in yours?

Tabby's finger is on the nuclear button--if Justine can revoke Tabby's womanhood, and by extension revoke the womanhood of Tabby's friends and comrades, Tabby can revoke Justine's. Mutually Assured Destruction. MAD. "You're MAD, aren't you?"

Justine relents. She accepts Tabby's terms: combat boots can be womanly too. She relinquishes Tabby's womanhood back to her, at least partially; but she still will not accept the Aesthetic of Smashing can be read as a womanly performance. Smashing, Justine claims, is Masculine. (It is a strange argument; would she argue that trans men should performatively carry baseball bats and threaten TERFs to demonstrate their masculinity?) The conversation ends with an uncomfortable détente, this final argument unresolved. The parties came to the brink of mutual destruction during the Shoe-ban Missile Crisis and are eager to de-escalate hostilities.

The video itself doesn't tell the whole tale. If Justine ultimately lost the argument, it is because we, the real live audience, reject her vision of Objectivist every-woman-for-herself womanhood and embrace Tabby's: A womanhood for the working class. A womanhood of Solidarity; We become women by supporting each other.

Nobody gets left behind. We're either women together or freaks alone, as Tiffany discovered.

When Adria imploded Tiffany's performance, she was ruthless. Even afterwards, when Tiffany begged for forgiveness, for acceptance, Adria refused to embrace her. Get away from me--You are alone. Die.

The strange irony we are faced with is that Tabby's Aesthetic--the Hissing, the Bat, the Smashing--is performed by a sensitive, big-hearted girl who wants to reconcile, persuade, and collaborate; while Adria's Aesthetic--the Nerdy Glasses, the Civil Inclusiveness, the Sensitive Academic--is performed by an ice-cold Stalinist ready to Gulag gender-Kulaks like Tiffany.

So wait--Was Justine right, after all? Is Tabby's Aesthetic wrong for Tabby? If Tabby doesn't want to hurt anyone, why is she carrying a bat?

Well, Tabby's bat isn't for Smashing People--it's for Smashing Oppression.

Perhaps we might think that we wish Tabby were more like Adria. Adria is a stone-cold killer. Adria would have demolished Justine. But Tabby isn't Adria. Tabby is Tabby. She really does want to save everyone--and that's part of why we love her. Tabby is an idealist. Tabby is a hero--she'll forgive you, and believe in you, and fight for you, no matter how screwed up you are.

Back in April, Blaire White posted a video, titled "I TRY TO LIVE AS A MAN FOR THE DAY." The interesting thing about this video is that it's not really "about" anything except for gender performance. There are no distractions. It's pure gender performance, through and through--and what makes it really interesting is that her performance is exactly the opposite of what the video claims. She isn't trying to be a man--she is demonstrating her competence at being a woman. The premise--she wears men's clothing, walks through a hardware store, pumps gas, and so on--serves as a "handicap" that allows her expertise at a certain kind of female performance to be all the more impressive, believable and real. The imperfection, if you will--the unfeminine garb and premise--is what makes her femininity perfect and grants her performance its verisimilitude.

It's a fascinating and complex performance. To use Justine's phrase: Blaire White, for all her faults, is a "Virtuoso of Womaning." She is embarrassed to be wearing male drag. She cannot help but sway her hips as she walks. She is so visibly uncomfortable pumping gas that her boyfriend steps in to help her. She is a woman, trying to be a man, and failing because she is a woman.

We can easily believe that her performance reflects an inner truth. Blaire White is really eating barbecue. 

How would our cast of characters evaluate her performance?

Justine, and Tiffany perhaps, would applaud her for her technical skill, her performative competence, and her adherence to their shared ideal of womanhood. It's "good optics" to conform to the most conservative possible version of womanhood--you will reach otherwise unreachable audiences and challenge their preconceptions.

Adria, Tabby, and Abigail would presumably roll their eyes; what does being bad at pumping gas have to do with being a woman? Society has moved past such stereotypes, and putting them forward as some ideal of womanhood diminishes all the working-class women who pump their own got-damned gas. Tabby and Adria would likely be more generous in granting that Blaire's performance reflects her own inner truth--but all three would object to the notion that any of this is the universal yardstick by which we should measure anyone else's womanhood.

To return to Justine: If she believes that men are the ones who judge what a woman is, and if Justine believes she was a man before transitioning, then does it not follow that Justine was once, by her own reasoning, a voting member of the what-is-a-woman-committee? How, then, does she justify having used that position of power and privilege to help define womanhood in such a way that only deep funding from a popular Patreon could ever hope achieve it? She quips that teenage gay boys on Instagram are the only ones who have any coherent vision of contemporary womanhood, but glosses over her own role in defining what it means to be a woman; and what is seemingly implied but left unsaid is that Justine does not see Tabby's vision of womanhood as coherent.

Justine's picture of the Platonic ideal of womanhood seems, to Tabby, hopelessly dated. An anachronism straight out of last century. Where does it come from? Justine claims that there is an archetype of the eternal feminine, but who would believe that being a woman in 2018 means the same thing that being a woman did two or three generations ago?

We might suspect the answer is 4chan. 4chan's ideas of gender are so reactionary that you really do have to look back to the 1950s to find their match. And not just their ideas about women--who else but 4chan could have brought you a legion of Millennial Mad Men incompetent enough to think wearing fedoras and saying "m'lady" was the height of masculine performance in the 21st century? Is it any wonder their ideas of contemporary femininity are just as backwards-looking? One wonders: Does Justine's Archetypal Woman actually come from Instagram, or does it really come from 4chan?

One can imagine that a community of black-pilled Justines would be every bit as toxic and self-defeating as a community of incels.

Tabby has a much different vision of womanhood. Her womanhood is a modern one, built on a diet of Tumblr, intersectional feminism and Marxist theory. In Tabby's heart, the archetypal Millennial Woman is not Ivanka Trump--it's Mae Borowski.

Going deeper, if Justine believes that white men are the ones with power, the ones who determine what womanhood IS, shouldn't we take a critical look at what these powerful men are actually telling us about gender? And who is the whitest, richest, most powerful man in the world? No, not Trump--but the man who got Trump elected: Mark Zuckerberg.

Zuckerberg has abolished the old religion. The old flesh-and-blood arbiters of gender have been cast out from the temple and replaced with robots designed to Listen Carefully And Patiently. Zuckerberg has proclaimed to the world that your gender is a thing you can select from a drop down menu--a datapoint to be shared with friends, analyzed by reasoning engines and sold as psychometric data to marketeers and advertisers. The Zuckerbergian Vision of Gender is too efficient, accurate, and reliable to bother with useless and trifling details about genitalia and chromosomes, leave alone subjective and unreliable human judgments. Your gender in 2018 is a licensing agreement with Facebook, and Facebook will never misgender you.

The Algorithm will correctly gender you with the tireless android relentlessness of a T-1000.

The Zuckerbergian gender paradigm is, of course, wildly profitable--so it has already won, however much the reactionaries in legislatures and newsrooms across the nation try to stop it. They will, in the end, be crushed by the inevitable march of capital.

The money flowing into the vestigial organs of the old gender paradigm is already drying up. When North Carolina passed its bathroom bill, 3.76 billion dollars fled from the state. When Tinder added More Genders, the feature produced 25 million new matches. The market has spoken: the old gender binary isn't just Wrong--it's something even worse: Unprofitable.

Today, the gender on your Facebook profile has more verisimilitude than the gender on your passport. The new gender performance is writing your pronouns on your Twitter byline. The new gender performance is checking a box on your Tinder profile and tagging your selfies on Tumblr. As far as today's liberal capitalism is concerned, if you tell Silicon Valley that you are a women, then you are a Real Woman.

Tabby would object, of course; the new gender paradigm was created by activists, not capitalists. It is Ours, not Zuckerberg's, and our genders were real before the technocracy ever acknowledged them.

Anyway...

How to deal with the problem of Ben Shapiro? The man seems determined not to cooperate with any real person's vision of gender whatsoever--not Tabby's, not Justine's, not even Zuckerberg's. The Aesthetic's finale seems to say there is no winning play. We can't win.

Or can we? We could follow the example of an expert. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez surely qualifies:

"Just like catcalling, I don’t owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions.

And also like catcalling, for some reason they feel entitled to one."

Maybe it's like WOPR says: the only winning move is not to play.Well I have one male friend who I usually talk about politics. We live in Mexico, so not everything is related to US topics, but the US topics that we do discuss about we disagree. He is right leaning on issues such as transgender laws, gay marriage, and basically was pretty much "Don't ask, don't tell."

He showed me videos about guess who... Blaire White. We continued the debate, but I knew Natalie is much better than me to explain points of view, so I showed him videos about transgender issues, like "Tiffany Tumbles", "Aesthetic", and "What is gender".

I thought that he would not like anything, but he absolutely agreed with everything Natalie said in those videos. I wouldn't say that he is left leaning now, but he said that his views were changed by her. 

I'm not trying to make Contra like Jesus or Naruto, but it was really nice to see some change of heart, it was nice to see someone grow out of the "Anti-SJW" mentality, which I find really mean-spirited. Butterfly Queen, Natalie "Contrapoints" Wynn x Messanger of Chaos, Erik "Internet Comment Etiquette" SalviaIn *Autogynephilia* 43:01 (oh god this sounds like a scripture reference we're a cult) Contra asks Abigail "what did you wear when you were 14?" and a clip of Abigail smoking is shown with "Bring Me to Life" by Evanescence playing.

That song was released on 2003-04-22. If Abigail was 14 years old at that time, she was born between 1988-04-23 and 1989-04-22; let's pick the earlier one for convenience. On her first appearance in *Is BDSM Feminist?* she is 27 years, 10 months, and 26 days old, and currently she is 29 years, 5 months, and 2 days old.

Starting her academic career at 18 in September 2007, and assuming standard American degree lengths with summers off, she could complete a 4-year undergrad and a 2-year Master's by 2013. Presumably she put her academic career on pause to become a feminist activist and author. If we assume that she has just graduated this spring and was immediately hired as a professor as we see her in *The Aesthetic*, she started her Ph.D. in the fall of 2015, a good school year before the first ever ContraPoints video on 2016-04-23. Which happened to be her 28^th birthday.In my philosophy class whenever we're reading some stuffy old man now I have Foppington's voice reading the words in my head, and it makes it fun enough so I can read for longer periods.

*"But your spirit, alive within me, had driven from my soul all sordid desire for earthly success, and those whom you protect do not commit sacrilege."*tl;dr, Don’t hold your breath. 

So I was at an event for Hank Green’s new book and had a chance to ask him if he would be doing anything with Natalie soon. He said that he really enjoys her work but that he feels he would do best to appreciate it from the outside and that he doesn’t want to insert himself where he’s not needed. The conversation was all of 20 seconds long so I didn’t have time to follow up or anything, but the gist I got was that if a collaboration were to happen, he won’t be the one to initiate. Sometimes I need some reactionary camp to roast, it pairs well with bourbon.Hello all,

I'm a video creator for the David L. Rice Library at the University of Southern Indiana, and we're currently working on a video on a video that is trying to convince people on why voting is important. This video features myself debating a character called Hayden Strawmin, who is meant to imitate apathetic voters. I kind of want Hayden's costume to be a sort of punk outfit, so I'm looking to Tabby as kind of an inspiration. So far I have a red leather jacket, and some black skinny jeans, but I wanted to know if you guys would have any costuming suggestions.

Thanks in advance, Best Wishes.I thought we could have a roundup of movies that share in some way the Contrapoints "vibe", whether it is her politics, her ideas, or her style and aesthetics. May or may not be transgender and LGBTQ-related.So a lot of us really do love Tabby (I know I do) and her role as kind of leftist clarion (despite her terrible optics for muggles) But I want to ask/explore about what Tabby and Contrapoints relationship with Anime.

I mean, I LOVE Anime, PMMM is basically my religion and every day needs a sample of the Nier soundtrack to get through. However, while anime if filled with empowering female characters, and examples of gender fluidity/openness, it also is famous for its female objectification through fanservice, and other P R O B L E M A T I C elements (looking at you Eromanga sensei). 

So Im asking, how feminist is anime? and what does Otaku feminism represent through Tabby? So, I've seen this sort of pattern happen around Contra a lot and I've tried talking about it and discussing it with people before, but have largely only gotten either radio silence or have been told I'm just making a mountain out of a mole hill. Does anyone else see this pattern around Contra's content or am I just seeing things that aren't really there?

&amp;#x200B;

I see so much talk in left-wing spheres online about not tone policing people, letting people talk about their honest experiences, fuck optics and how things look, etc., but I notice that that just seems to all go right out the window when a controversy around Contra pops up?  I've seen this happen several times already so does any one else see this happen or am I just making connections where there is none? Is the problem that I'm conflating IDPol left with leftist left or something?Folks, I dunno if this falls within the sub's ambit, and I'm sorry if it doesn't.  I know I'm not saying anything new; but nonetheless, I'm distressed, I don't know what to do, and I figure this community is more likely than most to have something to say about it.  I'm sorry for asking y'all to help me out here.

I'm having trouble dealing with my inability to help people who I see peddling, well, basically the whole rightwingosphere with which Natalie mostly deals.  It hurts to see people spewing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories or rambling about postmodern neo-Marxism or railing about "the women" and "the gays" and "the transgenders" not only because I believe they're hurting other people, but themselves.  I used to live with a guy who's been sliding down the redpill/incel rabbit hole for the last three years, and it hurt like hell to fail over and over to do anything about it.  I look at Jordan Peterson and despise his entire agenda, but I also see a scared old man spending his twilight years tilting at windmills and dragging a whole bunch of disillusioned and insecure kids down with him.  Today I wandered into a new Discord and found it filled with discussions of how a Jewish conspiracy is working to create a race war and destroy the West, and my immediate instinct was not to punch the Nazis but to cry for them, and the good they could have done and still yet do.  I want to reach out and try to bring them out of the scared, confused, venomous place they're living, but I can't see any way I won't just make things worse.

I know there's an ugly paternalism and a sort of epistemic imperialism in presuming that *I* have "the truth" and "the morals" such that I can judge them as "needing help."  This is, nonetheless, the way I feel.  It hurts like watching a parent hit their kid in the supermarket.  It hurts like listening to my grandfather talk about the Japanese internment camps, or my dad talk about his sister's alcoholism.  It hurts like the first time I read Browning's *One Day in Jozefow*, an account of the foot soldiers of the Holocaust.  I hurt for the tragedy of it all and the fear and, yes, the feeling of powerlessness to do anything about it.  And I don't know how to deal with it.

Does anyone else feel this, or something like it, when confronted with faces or words or memes filled with hate?  If so, how do you deal with it?  Is this just a privilege of feeling only indirectly threatened by it?

I'm sorry again about this.  This stuff just sends me spinning off whenever it catches me in the right mood, and I don't know where to turn.  Once again, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place; and I certainly understand if it's deleted as such.People, please. Enough is enough.

As for the recent controversy, we are not going to allow people to use abusive terms to describe Natalie. You know the terms we are talking about. A deeply uncharitable narrative has been pushed on twitter and some other subreddits and we just will not have that here. This subreddit is a safe space. No bigotry, no hate speech, this includes personal attacks directed against the content creator.

Be respectful. Mind that an artists stated intent with her work might be more relevant than the emotional response that this work evokes in you.

Your feelings on this issue are relevant, important and can be shared here. 

Avoid accusatory language. Keep things at your own experience. Don't say "You did.." say "This made me feel like.."

Use this thread to discuss the recent  issues please.  Regardless of the perspective of the mod team on these issues, we are aware that they are currently relevant in the community and that we need to provide a place for them. So even though Natalies video “The West” came out a while back, I wanted to share my thoughts on it. In the video she describes different ideas of what The West might be. Here, I decided to talk about my personal opinion of the West : “The New Modern Good West”. I feel that this might sound like a bit of a weird interpretation from a leftist perspective, but here are my reasoning for this conclusion.

So, first of, Heritage vs Culture. I feel that to go on with this, it’s quite important to establish the difference between these two, as it feels like the alt-right and similar types of people use the two interchangeably. Heritage, from my view, is everything that happened in history to or was done by certain peoples, the good, the bad and everything in between. It is the most important thing through which culture is shaped. Culture is the interpretation of its peoples heritage – ever changing based on generation and its ideals. While the history of the West is incredibly bloody and gruesome, the current culture is anything but. We look at things like religious persecution, racism, slavery and genocide in our heritage and we accept them as part of what we are, we learn from it, we try to not repeat our past mistakes. And yes, things like 3rd world exploitation still happen, but I don’t imagine there being a single everyday person in the west who would support it, if they were fully aware of this problem. After the destruction caused by WWII, we saw tolerance and collaboration grow, we saw the start of the EU, which while does have some problems, stands now as an incredible symbol to the new “Good West” and it’s ideals: democracy, tolerance, cooperation, peace and solidarity, slowly forming a truly beautiful cosmopolitan community, that made Europe more united then ever in our history. That is what The West and its culture in my mind is today – a wonderful dream of a better tomorrow.

Now, a few other things to add. Firstly the name itself “The West” is actually really wrong. It makes sense historically, since it’s an evolution of the old, bloody West of the times before WWII, but if you look, West isn’t really West anymore. Contradictions are on both sides. You have places like Russia and some Easter Europe states that are basically the antithesis of the current Western values. I could go on talking about what horrific evil the current Russian government is, but it isn’t really the point and probably not necessary. And on the other hand, you’ve got Asian countries like Japan or South Korea which are more Western then a lot of the countries you would traditionally call so.

One of the points of in video was that The West always had an in-group and an out-group. The current “Not-really-West” does as well in my opinion. Hilariously, I would say that the out group mostly are the people who call for “protecting our western values and traditions” because of their intolerance and refusal to work with the different.

Now, I know one of the main points against this will be: “What about all the conflicts in the Middle-East? Isn’t it proof that the current West is just as imperialistic and power hungry as the old?” and it is a really valid argument, but my answer to it is simple, look how people treat these conflicts. Sure there are those who support them, but there are a lot of those who don’t. I think majority of people these days would say that the Iraq war was a mistake, and that it is the right thing to pull troops out of the Middle-East, look at yourself, the person who would make this argument against this post, you exist. How many protested against the colonial conquests of the Old West? From all I know from history, nobody did for a really long time except possibly a few philosophers who, if not support colonialism, supported some other horrible thing. Now I imagine it would be a political suicide for any elected official to start a conflict, however small it might be.

I hope you didn’t find this too naïve of a look into the West and its culture. I am quite interested to hear your opinions about this. I might have overlooked or not considered something when writing this and if so, I would be happy to be corrected.

Edit: fixed a small mistake, really shouldn't be writing such long posts so late...The point first, and then a short background on myself for context. Are any of you guys part of an organized religion (specifically Catholicism but really any established religious institution) and leftists simultaneously? I recently converted to Catholicism, only a year or two after having my leftist beliefs crystalized. I see the emphasis on self sacrifice in the interest of something higher than yourself as the common thread between these beliefs, and it’s why for me as a new member of the church, no other political ideology is compatible. It seems like not many people share my beliefs in the parish I’m in now, it’s the struggle lots of us have where our right wing or centrist friends agree with us until we start saying words like socialism or anti fascist. And a lot of left wing people feel justifiably alienated from religious organizations for that reason. I just watched Natalie’s video where she responds to the “Chesterton” guy who accuses her of being a degenerate hedonist or whatever and glib uses of Catholic imagery ensue. That didn’t bother me and I found her points agreeable as I usually do, it just got me wondering about other religious leftists out there and if any were on this sub. If you’re not religious, how do you feel about people like me? Yeah, hi, I'm the guy Tabby wants to hit with a bat.  Not alt-right but I sure get called it a lot.  I didn't know where to say this that there might actually be a chance Contra would see it, so I figure this is as good a shot as I'm gonna get if the mods here allow it.

I've been watching your videos for a while, at first to try make sure I don't sink TOO deep into my own filter bubble political echo chamber, then for the production values and the humor, and then because I felt like I was learning.  And the biggest element of that is that it feels like you're the one SJW voice who's willing to give a serious, authentic lens to both what your side believes, and what your critics believe.

So often when I listen to Sarkeesian or Riley Dennis or anyone like that, it feels like I'm being gaslit.  You have no idea how many SJWs I've talked to who've pounced on the slightest failures of perfect politically correct articulation like "used to be a man" or "look like a woman" and acted like they don't know what people who say these things are TRYING to convey, just looking to trip me up over words and make me look like a monster.  Seeing Justine call Tabby out on the "PC bullshit", even though I know they're both just characters, was an incredibly validating thing.

So thank you for going deeper than the party line, and for sounding like a real human being when you talk about trans issues instead of a feel-good soundbyte that'll hit you with a bat if you question it.  You're probably the most persuasive SJW out there, and I want you to know, really know, that you are softening hearts, because you're softening mine.So, I moved to the US not too long ago and for a long time I subscribed myself to the libertarian ideology. I've always lived by my golden rule of "live and let live", and Libertarianism seemed to me as the logical conclusion of such rule.   
I really liked the fact that within the libertarian point of view I would be respected as an individual and not treated different for being a minority.    
But in the past year and a half I've felt libertarianism becoming an empty shell that Is used just to score points for any right wing person. I'm an individual and I'm supposed to be seen as such before any other external characteristics comes into place... That's what I thought until I noticed how I stopped being an individual every time so called "Small government" pundits such as Shapiro or Crowder expressed themselves while making political statements.   
They always use identity politics: The immigrants, the Muslims, the Mexicans, the invaders. How can one hold such hypocritical views? "I judge everyone as an individual but those Mexicans are stealing our jobs", it's just so hypocritical.  


I've started getting out of my echo chamber and came across channels like Contra points, Shaun, three arrows and they've helped me get out of the false dichotomy of "The leftist are obsessed with identity politics - The right values the individual over the collective". Sorry for making this post so long, I just had to let it all out.I use to watch Blaire for her personality &amp; her poltical views now I dont like her politcal views but I still like her personality so I still watch her videos unlike shoe0nhead who I use to like for her political views and her personality but I don't watch anymore cause I don't like her views and I find her cringy &amp; annoying ( **HER sorry for typo in the caption I ment her)i've taken a planet sized blackpill on the environmental crisis and it has me to the point where i'm too exhausted to even cry. i maintained in the past by trying to just focus on the positives in my own life and doing things i enjoyed but i can't even do that anymore. i can't really sleep or focus on anything, and i've just become obsessed with death. i listen to music about suicide, read stories about the end of the world and monsters and depression, even the pictures i draw are of monsters or people killing themselves. sorry for edge factor but basically i wanna swallow a bottle of xans and not wake up again more than i don't as of late.Hiya all! I want to ask people's opinions on career paths from studying gender, particularly from a transgender lens. I am considering an academic route but I was curious if people have any other alternatives, I worry that I may experience the same sort of dissatisfaction Contrapoints felt studying graduate philosophy.

I'm an undergraduate in Social Science at the moment and I've developed a keen interest in academic discussions of gender-related issues (hence why I found our own Loving Queen). When I began to feel dysphoric and suspected I may be trans, my instinct was to find books, journal articles and on the topic, from social scientific and psychological perspectives, and I found myself particularly engaged in lectures that related to gender.

As I've grown more aware of my personal transgender identity, my fascination with the field at large has held firm. This has led to my conclusion that my interest is not just a symptom of my dysphoria, but a tangible and lasting curiosity which I could see myself dedicating a career to.

The question is what kind of career, thoughts?I've now watched "The West" a couple times and I think it has some truly insightful ideas and is a wonderful video in general. But I don't get one thing. Why is there the Magog/Frozen thing in the beginning? I don't understand how it relates to what the idea of the "west" is supposed to be. Considering how every single detail in CP's videos tends to be deliberate, I am absolutely sure that the problem here is me never having seen videos by Magog or the film Frozen. So can someone explain to me how that scene is relevant to the idea of "the west"?[Jordan Peterson tweets "No Comment" without much context](https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/991752958638546944)

If he did watch the video, wonder if he was concentrating on the explanations and slight criticisms of his practices, or if he's more disturbed of Contrapoints being intimate with the mannequin version of him?Saw the meme of her floating around, read the Current Affairs article - any particularly good first videos of hers to watch? Heard it can be pretty self-referencing so I don't necessarily want to jump in the deep endHi, I discovered Contrapoints a while ago and I am not sure this is the best place to ask this question. Her subreddit just came to mind because she seems like such a genuine person when trying to persuade or make arguments for her case, which I really appreciate.

My question is regarding gender and gender identity.

My background that may be relevant; I have viewed the word gender synonymously with the word sex for a very long time.

Anyways, I hope I am not breaking any rules and I want to convey a genuine good faith interest in your response.

**What makes you feel like a different gender, and what purpose is there to invent or change your gender identity?**

My thinking is that a focus or value put on gender (or sex in my case) is essentially redundant except when talking about biological aspects of it because I generally dislike labels that are so flimsy.

I think that may also be the reason for why I view gender as sex.

My question may be extremely vague and hard to answer.. It's difficult trying to express what I wanted to ask. I guess I just really don't quite understand what Contra is talking about. Any answer about gender or gender identity that you think would help me understand is appreciated. Hello Contrapoints audience, I, like many fellow "Peterson cultists" have been itching to hear reasonable contrary viewpoints, as you do when in a cult. The Contrapoints video was a breath of fresh air in a fog of lazy leftist criticisms. (Sam Seder, David Pakman, who I usually like, Kyle Kulinski) The video was upvoted to the front page of our subreddit and widely enjoyed. Contra's video is very entertaining and the criticism is real and tangible rather than a rattling off of shallow ad hominem attacks. 

One of Contra's main threads of the video is exposing the weakness of Peterson categorizing people as "postmodern neomarxists" because Marxism is fundamentally a big ol narrative and Postmodernism says no to that sort of thing so how can there be people who fit into both these categories? Correct! Fantastic point! Unfortunately the point has been made by Peterson already and is integrated into his position already. Like pretty much the exact same thing Contra said.

TL:DR
Peterson already made the point in the Contra video and the idea that Marxism and Postmodernism are intellectually incompatible.

Evidence: https://youtu.be/rSzpc2vh8Ow

PS: I apologise that I have been unable to find another video in which Peterson says word-for-word, "you can't be a Postmodernist and a neo-marxist at the same time." Its difficult to find due to the massive array of long-forum content Peterson is in. Sorry :(If you scroll down far enough on the twitter thread for the recent Current Affairs CP article you see [this](https://twitter.com/CandySBlack1/status/993911725908021253). I attempted going through the user's twitter feed to see if they give any context but couldn't find anything except more [accusations](https://twitter.com/CandySBlack1/status/990377367402156032). Couldn't find anything on Natalie's twitter either (not that I expected to really). So I was wondering if there was any context or if this is just a case of internet delusion and mud slingingIn Contra's video about recognising fascists she advised people not to host these guys on their platforms like podcasts because it gives them more exposure. I agree with her, but what about when it comes to massive platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter? Should they host fascists?

I feel like if we're going to call on these platforms to ban ideas we oppose then inevitably the people who hold those ideas are going to learn our trick and use it back on us: if Facebook felt a public outcry about, for example, socialists on their platform was hurting their image (and thus their profits), they'd probably start banning socialists. Remember the whole "Bernie Bro" thing? That was basically manufactured outrage to get people to associate Bernie supporters with sexism and racism, imagine if you marry something like that with a sentiment that hate speech needs to be banned from these platforms.

Of course they'd be within their rights to do that and no one is entitled to their platform, but you can imagine how crushed a political group's exposure is without Facebook or YouTube or Twitter. If Contra was for whatever reason barred from them almost none of us would even know who she is. I know I'm making kind of a slippery slope argument here, but I really don't feel like it's a good idea to encourage large corporations to crack down on who's allowed to say what on platforms that host nearly all ability to reach out to people on the internet.

I'm curious what you guys think.Hi fellow degenerates, I've submitted Portuguese subtitles for the Degeneracy video and they're now up for review so give it a go if you can.

P.S. They're in Portuguese(Portugal) so Brazilian brethren don't hate me pls.
P.P.s. Thank you person/people that added the Spanish subtitles, those were a great help for sentence structure and what not. Mi gusta.Shoe0nHead recently tweeted [this](https://twitter.com/shoe0nhead/status/994836168696049669) in defense of her friendship with Lauren Southern. For those who don't know, Lauren Southern is essentially alt\-right, although I think she identifies as an [identitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identitarian_movement) \(which is yet another coat of paint for white nationalism\). She has been on missions with Generation Identity \(a European identitarian group\), including one to physically stop refugee boats from reaching Europe. Needless to say, I think June is way off here, because I don't think the denial of the humanity of whole groups of people is just a "difference of opinion in politics".

This makes Natalie the friend of a friend of a fascist, which is weird to think about, if nothing else.

Talking about this might get too personal, so perhaps we could discuss the general situation. **What do you think your responsibilities would be if you were friends with someone who had an alt\-right friend? What if one of your own friends started going down the white nationalist route?**

Personally, in the former situation, I would feel obliged to confront them about it. But other than that, I'm torn. How many times would it be necessary or appropriate to voice my concerns? Should I give them an ultimatum of choosing between the fascist and me? Would that just drive more people into the arms of fascists? And putting myself in their shoes, I wouldn't like to have to defend any of my friendship decisions to anyone. Others don't know the full history and complexities of my friendships.

In the latter situation, where my own friend is being drawn toward white nationalism, I would almost certainly end the friendship. But maybe, if I had the energy and time, along with the motivation \(e.g. if the person meant a lot to me\), I might take it upon myself to try to deconvert them. But if I chose that option, I would be wary of creating an environment where it's acceptable to have those views while having "mainstream" friends and suffering no consequences.

Whatever you may think of June's own positions on feminism etc. – and any issues arising from there – that's not what I want to discuss here. I'm specifically talking about her friendship with a fascist, and defense of it. However, another important point to discuss would be how to distinguish between someone having a few problematic views \(which you could call a true "difference of opinion in politics"\) and someone being unsalvageable as a person \(e.g. being an outright fascist\). **Where would you draw the line for your own friend? And for a friend of a friend?**Hey, sorry for the boring post, but can anyone recommend a method of getting in touch with Natalie? Posting what she does on this terrain, it'd be no surprise if she got hassle from anonymous shitlords, but you'd still hope there would be some way of getting in contact. Natalie! Can you hear me!?Has Contra made a video or written a post talking about the various books on the shelf? I would love to knowhey, 

I'm a transmasc dude who has been out since October now. Contra's videos on gender dysphoria and being trans helped me realize my own identity. I think she does a good job of explaining queer concepts to people who are not used to reading GSS works or using queer lingo. Title says it all lol. I'm interested in her thoughts on it, a lot of trans woman use camming/porn to fund their transition, and as a way to feel desired/validated.

It's a complicated subject involving a lot of exploitation and the fringes of society, I'm interested in her thoughts.So here's the thing, the EasyOnMe video was downvoted to oblivion, but this works to the determent of our little community, because it made his bad arguments and our rebuttals to his bad arguments, much less visible.  

I'm not saying you should upvote these videos if you don't want, but if your first impulse is to downvote, why not leave a comment explaining your disagreement instead? 

I think it's good that people post videos critical of Contra's *arguments* here (not saying those that attack her or are transphobic, of course) and we should welcome it.  

Why? 

Because I trust that we are right about most things, and I welcome the chance to correct misinformation. My arguments for the social construct nature of gender are now strengthened thanks to that video and now I'm more familiar with that type of arguments, and I believe the same is true for everybody who watched that video and read the many rebuttals in the comments. 

 
We can't allow ourselves to become like Nat's classmates as described in the "Why I Left Academia" video. We can't afford to *not* have arguments against common bullshit arguments.

And hey, maybe, one of those videos ends up being right and they find a flaw in Nat's reasoning. That would be great! Because correcting that flaw would strengthen her arguments even more!Hey Contra! I'm gonna keep this simple. You give me warm fuzzy fuzzies. You speak my language. I'm an intellectual, went to grad school, etc etc. You're the most real person I've heard in a longtime. I just found you last night, but everything I've seen honestly makes the depression less heavy... just, thank youBit of a long post here but I think it's important for Contra as someone who wants to sway others from Reactionary politics
 
So in Contra's last video on Jordan Peterson, she included a brief clip of Dave Rubin having a conversation with a guy by the name of Colin Moriarty. Colin brought up Contra as an example of an intelligent, rational leftist youtuber in response to Dave's assertion (and I'm paraphrasing here) that there are no rational people on the left. Dave admitted that he had heard of Contra but never really looked into her. This was the first time Dave has mentioned Contra at all on his show as far as I know. This clip served as a teaser for Contra perhaps going on Rubin Report if she continues to grow and reach more people. Or maybe it's just a joke on Contra's part. I am going to assume the former, however, for this post. 

Today on Twitter Colin @ed Contra in a tweet asking if she would be interested in making an appearance on his podcast series Fireside Chats. If Contra does want to get on Rubin Report then I think going on Colin's podcast would serve as a stepping stone. Before I further explain my thinking on this, I should first explain who Colin Moriarty actually is and how he ended up on Rubin in the first place.

Colin Moriarty was a prominent editor at the number one video game news site IGN for many years. At IGN Colin reviewed games, wrote editorials, and created some pretty great journalistic content about specific developers in the industry. He also co-hosted the IGN podcast Podcast Beyond with Greg Miller, who would become the public face of IGN as they attempted to be a more personality driven website. Podcast Beyond was where I first discovered these two and I have followed them throughout their careers.

At the beginning of 2015, Colin and Greg left IGN, along with video editors Tim Gettys and Nick Scarpino, to start a fulltime youtube channel called Kinda Funny. Kinda Funny produced podcasts about general topics including entertainment, lifestyle, comedy, and pop culture. They also had a second channel dedicated primarily to video games.

Things were going well for awhile but here is where Colin's story becomes really interesting. In March 2017 on International Women's day, Colin posted what has become an infamous tweet in the Kinda Funny and wider gaming community. The tweet was "Ah. Peace and quiet. #ADayWithoutAWoman". This sparked a lot of criticism from those within the games media press as well as many fans of Colin. Colin perceived this a people dogpiling him over a joke and because the rest of Kinda Funny didn't outright defend him, Colin felt abandoned both by the industry and his friends. This led to Colin leaving the company, although this was not the primary reason. Colin claimed creative differences and a different vision for the company were the reasons he resigned which are definitely true. However, the tweet was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Now the previous relationship Colin had with the gaming press community is quite complex, but it boils down to this: The gaming press has become more overtly political in recent years, especially after GamerGate, and the vast majority of the members of the press are left-leaning. Colin is a self-described conservative and mostly believes in a libertarian philosophy. His twitter icon is the Gadsden flag, his username is @notaxation (referencing the American Revolution credo "No taxation without representation", which is surprisingly lost on some people who claim he doesn't believe in taxes), and he is a fan of the works of Ayn Rand. However, he is not a Trump supporter in the slightest and actually left the Republican party because of him. But, Colin is very anti-political correctness and his ideas about politics often ruffled the feathers of his peers. Colin simply viewed himself as the lone conservative in a sea of liberals with an axe to grind. 

Now here is where Rubin comes into play. After the tweetstorm and his exit from Kinda Funny, Colin was asked to appear on the Rubin Report to talk about the tweet incident as well as political correctness in games media. Up to this point, Colin was a fan of Rubin but I am not sure if they had actually met in person. Rubin and Colin became good friends and Colin viewed Dave as the one person who had his back in a time where he was alone. Since his first appearance, Colin has returned to The Rubin Report several times to discuss similar topics like free speech and political correctness. Now Colin operates his own youtube channel called Colin's Last Stand where he talks about history and politics as well as a second gaming channel and his aforementioned podcast Fireside Chats. This is all to say he and Rubin are big buds now. 

So after all this, why should Contra talk with someone associated with a man like Rubin who has given charlatans with awful political views a large platform and who has remained willfully ignorant of any prominent figures on the left. Well here is where it gets personal for me. Colin had been a major part of my life for almost ten years. He and his co-host Greg gave me so much joy in my life and I hated to see them "break up". Since the whole tweet fiasco, I have seen Colin drift further over to the anti-PC Reactionary crowd. But unlike a lot of them and those who appear on Rubin, Colin actually hears people out and when approached and spoken with calmly can admit he is wrong. Colin also maintains socially progressive ideals. He has long been an advocate for trans rights and is mostly sympathetic to the entirety of the LGBTQ community. He even made sure that he used Contra's pronouns properly on Rubin and was intent on not misgendering her. This is something not a lot of Rubin guests would even consider doing. However, Colin isn't perfect. He has said a whole lot of P R O B L E M A T I C things in the past, such as, not believing in nonbinary gender identities and pronouns as well as essentially believing in the concept of the 'model minority' in relation to Asian Americans. I do think Colin does not say these things out of malice but out of ignorance. He needs some education, and Contra might the best woman for the job. 

Contra has helped me tremendously over the past several months of watching her videos. She has helped me with my discovery of gender identity (her video on autogynephillia might have saved my life)) as well as showing me in an approachable way the more leftist political ideas like no one in the past has been able to. I hate to see someone like Colin be swayed by an opportunistic charlatan like Rubin whose only goal is to spread the false narrative of "Political Correctness is the death of free speech and the cultural Marxist monsters and ANTIFA super soldiers are coming to take you and your family to the gulags for accidently misgendering a trans person". Colin is stubborn in his political views, so I don't think Contra would ever be able to convince him to become a card-carrying member of the left, but he is open to a dialogue about many social issues and might even be open to some more leftist and progressive ideals. I think this is definitely something Contra does well. Maybe not turning everyone into an anti-capitalist or a Marxist but she does help those who might be stuck in or about to fall into the Reactionary rabbit hole come to their senses. If she and Colin can get on good terms, then the likelihood of actually being on Rubin Report will be much higher as Rubin very much respects Colin. 

TLDR: If Contra wants to get on Rubin, Colin Moriarty's podcast is a way to get her foot in the door. Also, I miss my boy Colin. Since Contra's video on him, in which she derides Peterson for conflating the contradictory philosophies of marxism and postmodernism, he seems to no longer be using the phrase "postmodern neo-marxism" and is now saying things like "a strange pastiche of postmodernism and neo-marxism" (quote from his recent Munk debate).

EDIT: Nope, coincidence.  My bad.I've been wondering why there aren't more left-of-center youtubers going after really bad arguments that Sargon, Peterson, etc. make and we were both happy to find Natalie.  I know part of the reason is that its easy to be angry and riled up about your "right to act like a dick to other people" and that is why the alt-right-lite youtubers are doing so well.

edit: Wait there's a megathread for this! ~~What are some other youtubers that seem to have Contrapoint's wit and humor?~~*BBBHANging* Where she shows a map of a city that was red lined in the mid 20th century then overlays that map with current day demographics?

Basically, she proves that in a very simple and elegant way that "yes racism actually still is a thing."

Any help is appreciated! (My friend needs a scary map)It is bizarre but perhaps not surprising that contemporary anti-feminists  like Peterson see their mission as returning society to proper respect for "biological drives and hierarchies". This is the descent to the absolute bottom and a complete rejection of the Western tradition they claim to champion. Peterson is contradictory in this sense because the ideal of "Logos" was never a material growth but was a spiritual principle; i.e Athena sprouting from the head of nature wielding Zeus. 

The obsession with grounding mythic concepts in biological science is misguided and haunted by the "Great Twitch" nihilism described in "All The King's Men" : "all the words we speak meant nothing and there was only the pulse in the blood and the twitch of the nerve, like a dead frog's leg in the experiment when the electric current goes through."

I know Natalie has pointed out that most of the reactionary right's appeal is based on fear, but since she has such a potent grasp of Plato and the Western tradition that these guys claim to defend, I hope she'll perhaps create a Stoic conservative character to address this. At the least it could lead to some new wigs.Contrapoints had a chat with a traditionalist youtuber by the name of the ditstributist (hes also had a debate with kristi winters), i curios as to what you guys think of him and his videos, along with the convo.

I'd probably have to go with Alpha males as it was my first, although I also love pick up artists. Tl;dr Do you think a conversation between Contra and Peterson could frame Peterson’s ideas in a context where his discriminatory fans would recognize Peterson as the “traitor” to their views i believe he is (and which i think contra thinks too in the sense that JP is not a transphobe or a racist or a nazi)?

I’ve seen recently the Roaming millenial livestream where they discuss peterson quite a bit, and I’ve found that Contra actually agrees with some of the claims Peterson make (and the ones that catapulted him to fame), and in the areas where they agree she actually criticizes the way JP communicates his ideas because he leaves the door wide open for actual transphobes and other hate groups to grab his message as a defense of their twisted views.
This view is something that i wasn’t able to formulate before when discussing JP with a very SJW friend, since i heard JP and couldn’t find myself to disagree on much of what he said. Of course, that was possible because i filtered out the context and stick with the content of what he said (e.g. compelled speech should be outside the law, maybe as rules inside certain places like campuses or work but not something enforced by the state) 

This led me to think, maybe if JP and Contra get together and frame their common points, it would have the effect of making the hate groups that see peterson as their champion to recognize the fact that peterson himself is not defending their views (as he states it multiple times, but fascist do tend to deny their status as fascists when confronted, and expect other fascists to do do as well) and flock away from him, and allow his more centrists followers to have a better understanding of the criticism leftists make of JP?And for those of you who need to know [the origins of these Sims Survivor streams...](https://imgur.com/a/llPbJ)^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

Oh, and [the Che Cat t-shirt](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0218/3856/products/2001_1294-Asphalt_grande.jpg?v=1475258051) already exists [too](https://rlv.zcache.ca/che_guevara_cat_t_shirt-r9ea906c11acc4e25858bb4662178b906_k2gml_540.jpg).&gt;[36:11](https://youtu.be/dPx8nuUm024?t=36m12s) "To give an example, I am transgender and I am able, basically, to withstand a lot of bullying on Youtube and in part because this is my job. I don't have another job to lose. Everyone knows I am trans. I cannot be blackmailed. Everyone knows my deadname. I am not worried that people are gonna post that kind of d0x on me and get me fired or ruin my relationship with my parents or something like that. But a lot of trans people are in a situation where that is a threat. But the threat of bullying, which is kinda like a mass effort, the reality is that there are pundits on Youtube who are rightwing pundits and they foster an environment where people are intensely hostile towards, for example, sexual minorities. Not just us, but racial minorities as well, and women."

D0xing is not to be underestimated. Especially in the context of graphic violent threats such as the ones that have been posted in response to the Decrypting video. As I wrote elsewhere, I was d0xed by assholes half a decade ago (not because I am trans, as a feminist blogger) and it was really scary back then when almost no one knew about about d0xing and "d0xing" wasn't even a term used outside of Darkweb circles. This happened at a time when an ex of mine was threatening to post revenge porn on Twitter. That ex was contacted by a group of hackers who wanted to avenge themselves against me and they conspired together with my ex to organize and carry out the d0xing. The d0xers not only d0xed me and my family but also tried to involve hapless unrelated third parties in the d0xing. Twitter was uncooperative when I contacted them, left the d0x on their platform for over a week and refused to take them down unless I faxed them a copy of my passport. Worse, in my case the d0xers had posted a mobile telephone number that wasn't even mine while falsely claiming it to be my mine essentially to encourage people to phone-bomb a random hapless stranger. Twitter left this phone number online for over a week. These people d0xing me even tried to contact the hospital where I had undergone breast cancer diagnosis (which I had foolishly admitted on my blog after a female musician I once knew had died of metastasized breast cancer) and tried to obtain my medical dossier from the hospital. They falsely reported my IP address as an infected computer to virus tracking websites (which didn't even perform a rudimentary reconnaissance test to check whether there was any validity to the report they had received about my computer) and got me blacklisted through those sites, which provide the intrusion detection signatures that firewalls and anti-virus software use. Most people don't even know about these tricks that can easily be exploited get you blacklisted and stigmatized across the internet.

Back then, literally the only thing that made my d0xers back off was counter-d0xing them and filing criminal charges against them, which was difficult to do from across the globe because as a European I had never dealt with American or Canadian law enforcement in my life. I recently discovered that one of those people involved in the d0xing is still tracking me on Twitter. Yes, half a decade after the fact they are still out for my blood. Please do not underestimate just how ugly or enduring d0xing campaigns can get. These people on the internet hold grudges that last for decades.
Probably still blocked on his Twitter though. Personally, I would tell Steve Shives to chill the fuck out and show willingness to engage with anyone but the most pure SJWs before including him in any of my work, because he is, kind of rightfully, an avatar of everything wrong with the unreasonable left.

Unless all of our left wing allies are as calm and collected and willing to engage as people like Shaun, Natalie, and Dusty Smith (there are probably others that I can't think of right now), we are going to look like scared little pieces of shit, unwilling to engage with any scrutiny.I myself am not blocked by Steve on Twitter or Facebook, but then again, I have never attacked Steve personally or posted anything asinine on his wall. I have vehemently debated others on his wall and been debated at, which Steve actually allows as long as it's respectful, no insults, etc. I am not on Youtube myself so I don't know whom you are referring to with "the purest of SJWs". Maybe you can specify? 

If you followed Steve over the past couple of years you might have noticed that he was subjected to some really awful online abuse (that tries to pass for scrutiny) when he spoke out against #Gamergate. Not just ad hominem attacks against himself but also against his wife, so I totally get it that Steve has adopted a zero tolerance mentality towards online abuse to protect himself and his wife. That's not being a "scared little piece of shit", that's being responsible towards others in your life affected by abuse levelled at you personally.

I get it that you're upset at being blocked, but try to look at this from Steve's perspective for a moment. How would you feel if you spoke out against abuse, only to be showered with abuse yourself?  Would you allow all these strangers to throw up their bile all over you and your wife, the person you love the most, to do so on a daily basis, and respond to them with: "Yes, thank you and more of that please!"? Of course not. After a while you'd get fed up with it all and start blocking people left and right.  

Also, what would you say if I told you I myself am blocked by CP on Twitter (after I myself blocked her on Facebook first, but still)? And I don't blame her for blocking me because I really was being asinine and aggressive. (And in turn I myself thought she was nothing but a lying fraud deceiving and manipulating everyone when I blocked her on FB, mea culpa). Maybe it is better for the sake of public discourse for people to block one another and just keep eachother at a respectful distance. Some people might be on the same page, on the same side, essentially working towards the same goal but just cannot see eye to eye for whatever reason. It's a good thing to have enough self-awareness and discipline to remove oneself or someone else from a situation that isn't likely to end up well. That's not being "a scared little piece of shit", that's being a responsible [battle-hardened](http://maolovesart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/He-will-win-who-knows-when-to-fight-and-when-not-to-fight-Sun-Tzu-Mao-Loves-Art-.jpg) adult. Since people are always asking about this, I thought Ι'd put here at the top so everyone sees it. I think and will always think of her as multiples because that was how I first encountered her on Youtube and first impressions are lasting impressions. I cannot think of ContraPoints and see just one face before me. [I see all the faces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjbNLVQ_Iwk). But she literally described being trans in a recent Livestream as "doing a lot of work just to be normal". I guess ditching queerness and "they" all goes back to her wanting to be normal.Well, I guess at least this will allow her and others to see who means her well and who is just a mean motherfucker. It's no effort at all to correctly gender someone. Anyone who refuses to do so is either a big 'ole meaniepants or has a bigoted agenda. Which I suppose are the same thing. Well, my personal policy is to call people whatever they've indicated they want to be called. I am very "libertarian" when it comes to these issues because I very strongly believe in the freedom of the individual to make personal choices. Which I guess also includes the "freedom" of someone else to be mean or a bigot, but I in turn have the freedom to not put up with someone being a bigot.To the anonymous benefactor who gave me gold yesterday, thank you so much! I took advantage of your generosity to make me a very representative snoovatar, so [check it out!](https://www.reddit.com/user/CandySBlack/snoo) Sorry if it doesn't fit the sub, I couldn't think of another place, specially since in the last stream some folks wanted to talk about it but mods asked to avoid the subject in the chat, so I know it's a matter that many contra fans want to discuss.Out of the loop, what happened? I'll allow it for now as an exception. We don't really have much content and this is something our users might be interested in. I love these. I do think she's being too harsh with herself though. Dick is one of Youtube's oldest vloggers and leftist channels. Recently he was diagnosed with a degenerative disorder that is killing all his nerves and prevents him from working or functioning normally. The last couple of days he's been very aggressive and bellicose on YT and twitter, with jokes involving misogyny and the n-word. He also hinted multiple times that he hadn't been getting any sleep for days. Apparently he was waiting on some test results, that apparently turned out very shitty: https://twitter.com/DickCoughlan/status/917361196147372032Oh god that sucksIf you watched that discussion in betwen that sjw guy, Smith I think, and Sargon, there is in about 1 hour 1 minute this moment, where in Q&amp;A one of Sargon´s fans had some really retarded opinion. Boy basically said that rich and poor makes this perfect loving harmony, and that middle class is the enemy that only creates these stupid intellectuals which have no value whatsoever. Sargon laugh at that, agreed and encouraged guy to make a youtube channel. Dunno dude, the middle class, one that makes majority of doctors - lawyers - engineers - sciencists, and these people are supposedly blamed for perish of lower class. Not the society, economical system, local enviroment, deregulated banks, corrupted politicians, but the middle class...Steve isn't a sheltered teenager though, he's a grown-ass man who's been making videos for several years before any of this "SJW/Anti-SJW" stuff was a thing. You'd think he'd be used to this kind of thing by now. Ignoring or outright blocking people who send abusive shit is to be expected, but dude seemingly runs an algorithm that blocks people who've never even *heard* of him.  Personally he's free to do that; I don't care about him, nor how he manages his online presence, but it's a bit ridiculous for him to do that without recognizing how it makes him look. It's also him doing that + his general pompousness that gives people a sour taste in their mouths. He's just generally PR poison for the left.

Him being a lot of people's immediate thought when thinking of modern progressives doesn't really help anyone in this regard, even if he represents progressive causes about as well as Lena Dunham represents feminism. Though the latching onto of these straight, white public figures with progressive views as vanguards for all Western social liberation movements is one of the most annoying things about the right. I don't see how this can be effectively dealt with, though.

Taking the harassment to his personal life, though, is generally inexcusable and never serves any purpose in online discussions beyond dragging it to a less civilized level.I thought the same thing. I don't know what it's like to have gender dysphoria but I can't help but feel she resents her old self. Yeah, she's mad about the boy. (I don't mean The Golden One, I mean the boy she was.) Never seen CP laugh as hard as at [9:20](https://youtu.be/vbE23R1J4ko?t=9m20s) but a minute later she's tearing up and it's:

&gt; [10:51](https://youtu.be/vbE23R1J4ko?t=10m51s) I don't allow myself to be seen naked anymore because I hate my body, and that is in some ways a downside of having come out as trans. Now there is this... the fun I was able to have with this masculine body, I cannot have anymore. I don't have that kind of freedom with my body that I used to have. That will improve as hormones and other things make me feel more connected to my body again. But the thing is that, I will never get it back. Even if I were to come a cis woman, I wouldn't get it back. Because it is a kind of freedom of the body that is specific to men. Only being a man do you get to have this kind of freedom with your body. Women just can't do it. Because your body as a woman is viewed as having this power and this danger. Either it is this object of sexual obsession, or it's unfuckable and worthless and disgusting. It is at no point funny in the way that a male body is funny. And being able to have a body that is sort of sexually neutral in the way that a male body can be... it's not that it's not sexy, my male body is sexy, it is, like I know what a hot man looks like, and that's a good male body. But, no one really takes a hot male body seriously, you know? It is a culturally relative thing. There is an interesting moment in Plato's Republic, where Plato has one of the characters say: "How could women be allowed in the gymansium?", right? This area where everyone would be naked and doing sports and athletics, right? *Note, [the quote from Republic](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.6.v.html) CP is referring to here is this, which Plato attributes to Socrates as a mouthpiece: "Yes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women naked in the palaestra, exercising with the men, especially when they are no longer young; they certainly will not be a vision of beauty, any more than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia."*. Plato was surprisingly gender-egalitarian - considering that, otherwise, he's a massive shitlord. But, the anti-women-in-the-gymansium character says: "We can't have women in the gymnasium, because the men will laugh at their ridiculous bodies!". Which is interesting now because it is so foreign a way to think about male bodies. Because the idea in Plato's time -among men, anyway - was that men's bodies were beautiful, and glorious and radiant. I mean, the Golden One actually seems to think like this. The Golden One has this old Socratic view of the human body, where the male body is beautiful and female bodies, at least in ancient Greece, men derided them as ridiculous. Whereas now, it is impossible to think like this because now we view the female body as being kind of heavy or burdened with this inherent sexual power. Whereas male bodies are kinda goofy and ridiculous. But this video, at least I made good use of my male body while I had it, right?"


Will it ever cloy

This odd diversity of misery and joy

I am feeling quite insane

And young again

[And all because I am mad about the boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MwmH61Aw4g)I don't think she resents it. But I think there is a little mourning that happens in early transition. Not that she wants to go back, but she knows that body is over now, and it's a lot to process. Secondly, she often yells at her old self and says "just transition dammit!" I think this is a response to remembering how bad her dysphoria was then, and she see's now that she was suffering with apprehension and fear about taking the final steps. She empathizes with that person from a year ago, and wishes she didn't have to go through that. Which I understand, to some extent. I was addicted to heroin and pills for over 10 years, but too scared and addicted to stop. I was comfortable using, and I knew quitting was going to be a hard road. But now that I'm 2 years sober, I think about my drug days and regret all the time I wasted trying to survive that way.First of all congratulations on your sobriety, you're and an incredibly strong person for working so hard on it. Second I really appreciated your response, it feels really insightful and make a lot of sense. Okay, so Sargon said more than once that Black married couples had similar income as White married couples, which he seems to think is a slam dunk for his point about marriage, not race, being the important factor. 


1: I [see evidence](http://blackdemographics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2012-Black-Family-income.jpg) to the contrary. Indeed every family type has whites earning considerably more than blacks, at least if you assume (fairly I think) that whites actually earn more than "All Americans" given that that would include blacks, who are shown to earn less, and latinos who I think we can safely assume don't earn MORE than whites, and Asians who are too small a group to significantly impact the average. 


2: Sargon links the rise in unmarried black households to welfare, but when you look at [the timeline](http://blackdemographics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Black-Women-Historical-Marriage-1890-to-2010.jpg) there was a slight rise in the 50s to 70s, which is indeed when several of the welfare programs kicked in, but it was also when blacks started rabble rousing about inequality, you know that whole Civil Rights thing. What's more, white people were given far more access to welfare through the 50s-70s and yet their marriage rate rose, why could this be? (It's because of intentional efforts to undermine social cohesion within the black community now that it was organizing and becoming a threat to the white hegemonic order, but you didn't hear it from me)

It didn't really kick into high gear until the 80s though, what could have [happened](https://youtu.be/uwOq8zB-ido?t=19s) then? Oh right, the War on ~~black people~~ Drugs, the most effective attempt to undermine black social cohesion since slave trading. Suggesting that it's just some unknowable cultural feature with no cause is ludicrous. Suggesting therefore that the only solution is for black people to all, individually, just start being better is even more absurd. 

So in short, not only does marriage not explain all the income disparity, marriage disparity is pretty clearly the function of white supremacy acting on the black community in order to preserve its status as a perpetual lower class. 

Edit: finished the rest of the debate. 


As a principle, using violence against someone for stating their political opinion is wrong.   

There are times when doing wrong things is necessary to prevent worse things, war is only one of these times, another is revolution, and counterrevolution. The issue is that morality is often not about checking against core principles but balancing relative costs. Is it better to lock your addicted child in their room to help them break it, or give them their freedom and merely try to limit the damage? Is it better to use violence to contain and stamp out a growing and dangerous movement or try to debate it and hope it doesn't gain power and bring about catastrophe? Aaaaand suddenly you're discussing likelihood and potential harm vs the moral cost of acting and the efficacy of that action. Because assuming your axiom is just sooooo pure that it requires no contextualization and is therefore better than a more nuanced view is just so damn juvenile. Its why people like religion, it offers pretty straightforward "do this, not this" rules that let you feel rock solid in your own moral choices, and in judging others as less moral than you, because you followed the rules and they didn't, it frees you from the need to consider the complexities of context, and potential outcomes. It's a deontological rather than utilitarian ethical framework which is fine as a quick check in most situations, but in the messy moral gray areas they break down and you HAVE to consider pragmatic, outcome based utilitarian calculus. 


Peaceful marxists want to dismantle a system the feel is immoral, and as a result the will abolish the bourgeoisie as a class, because that class is defined by actions considered immoral by marxists. Suggesting that this concept is unique to collectivist or is itself inherently immoral is absurd and easily shown as such with one question: "Would you like to eliminate rapists?" Or racists, or thieves etc. Not by wholesale slaughter, but by making the thing they do that defines their "class" impossible to continue doing. The pragmatic questions of "how" of course remain a great challenge, and many answers (to all these, including the bourgeoisie) are immoral, but the desire to do so isn't immoral other than to the extent that you disagree with Marxist definitions of labor exploitation being immoral. 

The argument about deplatfoming is simple. If you have a platform you have power. You give both volume and legitimacy to those you let use your platform. That means you have a responsibility to consider the merits of the message before empowering it. Objecting to ill considered platform granting is not the same as shutting down free speech. Some ideologies are inherently immoral, and even if they're popular they don't deserve legitimization. Instead they should be confronted and debated by two types of people. Those with a platform who are capable and prepared to counter the negative impact of them giving visibility to bad views with the positive impact of them eviscerating those views for the audience. The other is by anyone without a platform, or without much of one. Individuals should challenge hateful views whenever possible, and if you feel you were out maneuvered by the bigot, learn how, and how to do better next time. 

Finally, the concept that in the battle between antifa and facists, or Marxists and white supremacists, each is as bad as the other because both consider violence to be an acceptable method of getting or maintaining control or defeating an opposing view point, is the kind of nonsense you get when you believe in a rules based moral system that doesn't require you to consider context. The difference is that while the means may be similar, what it is that white supremacists and fascists explicitly want is inherently less moral than what marxists want. One is based around race, national origin, sometimes religion, physical characteristics, and various other deviations from a norm that are considered detrimental to unity, or purity, or their elevated in-group's well being, whether they are right or wrong it is an ideology which favors people based on unchosen characteristics rather than actions. Marxists want a society where you cannot use the wealth or power you gain through your labor to allow you to escape the single unified class of people who do what labor they can/want to/is needed and create/join a class of people who leverage their own excess productivity, or that of friends/family, to induce other people to provide you with some of their labor/the fruits thereof and free you from having to do any labor to have wealth/power, which in turn frees you to amass more and more wealth/power and perpetuate the cycle, taking more and more of the product of other people as they are presented with fewer and fewer alternatives. It is, in short, based on an action, or type of action, that marxists believe harms people, and communities, and can and should be prevented. You can disagree with any part of the ideology, but it doesn't rest on the concept of treating people differently because of morally neutral unchosen and unchangeable characteristics or the bunk belief that purity is inherently better than diversity.
I'm very sorry, I love the shirts, but I cannot allow links to stores.

If you could host the images on imgur without a link to anything commercial I can allow it. &gt; You'd think he'd be used to this kind of thing by now. 

People always say this but I don't know how valid an argument this is. People are always asking others to toughen up on the internet. Well, blocking people liberally is part of getting tough online.

&gt; Ignoring or outright blocking people who send abusive shit is to be expected, but dude seemingly runs an algorithm that blocks people who've never even heard of him.

But do you realize that you are effectively already using such an algorithm every time you log into a large webmail provider like gmail or yahoo? They too employ algos to block suspicious content. Or that blog platforms like Wordpress already employ such algos to prevent their blogs from being flooded with spam comments? People take it very personally when they end up being blocked through automated means but in this day and age of bot armies it makes sense to pre-emptively automate the blocking process. You might be able to discern individual people when you have a couple of hundred followers, when you have 50 000+  subscribers like Steve it is no longer a viable option. At that level it makes sense to automate it.

&gt; Though the latching onto of these straight, white public figures with progressive views as vanguards for all Western social liberation movements is one of the most annoying things about the right. I don't see how this can be effectively dealt with, though.

This approach to certain content creators being treated a modern-day vanguard is IMO more a symptom of the reich wing fighting these meme wars and infowars and seeking a target for their warmongering than of left-wing content creators like Steve Shives or ContraPoints declaring themselves a vanguard. AFAIK they have never declared themselves to be such a thing.

With regards to [that Buzzfeed article that CP tweeted several days ago](https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism?utm_term=.jmGg80ppq#.gjDpj9AAX), where Milo Yiannopoulos and Bannon at Breitbart were messaging eachother about fascists using the hashtag #war, I want to remind those of you who are too young to remember [Occupy Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street) in 2011-2012 that [#war became a hashtag of the American right back then](https://twitter.com/search?q=breitbart%2C%20occupy%2C%20%23war&amp;src=typd) in response to [the sudden unexpected death of Andrew Breitbart in March of 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Breitbart). I was on Twitter at the time doing research on the Occupy movement when Breitbart had a heart attack right after he released his scathing  documentary about the Occupy movement, [Occupy Unmasked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHcr_8Qgdos). I recall to this day how right-wingers on Twitter instantly changed their Twitter profile pictures to Breitbart's portrait and began aggressively tweeting threats against Occupy under the #war hashtag. I still recall when tech magazine [Wired published a somewhat sycophantic article about Andrew Breitbart describing him as a hacker](https://www.wired.com/2010/03/ff_andrew_brietbart/) so if you are wondering why so many of these reich wingers are upper middle-class techies, look no further. Wired told these right wing techies that Breitbart was a hacker just like them who p0wned and hacked the establishment media, so he was cool and they could regard a publication like  Breitbart News Network as just another clever social engineering hack. That Wired article was effectively the tutorial that created and paved the way for Milo Yiannopoulos. Buzzfeed unfortunately doesn't mention this part of the Breitbart backstory, but I think it is significant. I think a lot of these warring right wingers turned reich wingers are under the impression that they are avenging the death of Andrew Breitbart, which they at the time believed was part of a government conspiracy to have Breitbart assassinated over the Occupy documentary (this was a conspiratorial narrative pushed by Alex Jones who insisted Breitbart had been assassinated and of course that he was going to be assassinated next). For these right wingers Breitbart was a political martyr whose death they have to avenge. When Milo Yiannopolous and Bannon are messaging eachother with #war hashtag, they are effectively reminding one another of their commitment to avenging the death of Breitbart. These people need a vanguard to rail against, just as they need a social scapegoat, be it PoC, women, trans, gays, immigrants, the poor, etc. Content creators become that vanguard and object of their infowar. When the long-term stated goal of your reich wing infowar is to ["destroy the New York Times and CNN"](https://twitter.com/LessGovMoreFun/status/901185544327245825), you start off with the easy targets: leftwing Youtube content creators. You declare them the vanguard and you destroy them. I know that CP has said that she thinks the alt reich on Youtube are delusional for thinking they are replacing the mainstream media when it is so obvious that they parasite on the mainstream media, but I think CP is smart enough to understand that in their delusional info-warmongering she and other leftwing content creators have become a target in lieu of "destroying the NYT and CNN".

I know CP refers to herself as an entertainer, thought in the Livestream with PhilosophyTube she did take issue with centrist and reich wing content creators calling themselves entertainers as an excuse not to have to practice more discernment with regards to the kind of people and viewpoints they platform. So AFAIK CP has never even hinted at herself being the vanguard, but the reich wing do view her as the vanguard because when you are engaged in an infowar you have to declare someone the enemy. I myself took CP to task for as a representative - because this was how I perceived her upon first encountering her content, as a self-appointed, self-declared representative of certain discourses, ideologies or groups - but in retrospect I think that criticism was unwarranted because CP representing a viewpoint or a group in the context of infotainment doesn't mean she is representing anyone other but herself. She has repeatedly stated that she is sincerely trying to make her representations as fair as possible while offering a critique. In the context of online infotainment that is all you can really do. And doing so while the alt reich has declared #war against you is brave and commendable. I feel the same way about Steve and all of the other content creators. Therefore I do not fault them for being careful on the internet.OK, sorry Merari! I totally understand not wanting to link to a webstore.

13OCT2017 [Polite Conversations 38 - Fascist Fashion with Contrapoints (pt 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92RBWVf06bY)Best part for me from this podcast is CP describing the [outrun sentiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/outrun/comments/33r5mi/what_is_outrun/):

&gt; [1:46:19](https://youtu.be/92RBWVf06bY?t=1h45m19s) [Vaporwave] is an aesthetic that I know from Youtube, but it also developed on Tumblr and other sites, where basically the music is kind of, sorta borrows a lot from Synthwave but also involves a lot of slowed down music from the 1980s. Like, the most famous Vaporwave song is from [an album called Floral Shoppe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floral_Shoppe) and the artist is Macintosh420. *NOTE: the artist's name is Ramona Andra Xavier who goes by the name Vektroid or Macintosh Plus, the song is ["Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU8HrO7XuiE) which samples ["It's Your Move" by Diana Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uno7f5IGAPI)* It's just a Diana Ross song slowed down a lot. It sounds very trippy and chill. And there are all these kinds of offshoots, like Simpsonwave which uses this kind of music and then uses Synthwave and puts Simpson clips over it. It is all kind of nostalic and dreamy. (...) On my channel, I use this aesthetic a lot. I am holding onto it. In my mind it is more associated with the left than with the right. Vaporwave has always had a kind of leftist, kind of critique of capitalism feel to it. A sort of nostalgia about 1980s and 1990s consumerism. Especially in Japan, these music videos set to old Japanese coke commercials, but in a way that uses the sad longing of nostalgia to also express the emptiness of a consumer lifestyle. (...) In my opinion this 1980s stuff doesn't lend itself well to fascist aesthetics. Because it is just too, to me there is something fundamentally effeminate about it. I think it is particularly the dreamy, kinda vapory feel to these things, like the slowed down songs. The emotions it expresses are not fascist. It expresses a subtle nostalgia or dreaminess. It is not about glory and power. [I can see fascists going more with metal which they do sometimes go with. That seems to be more compatible with their basic values.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKIoJOwxDwI)
 
Had to chuckle at CP saying 1980s synthy music transformatively reused in vaporwave is effeminate, because when I was a kid in the 1980s, the [purveyors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pf7iWrU_D0) of the [synthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlXcF0WwFTI) pop [sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3j2NYZ8FKs) were mostly men and the music was pretty much considered a gay thing, something you'd hear at a gay club or from the gay DJ.not overly fussed if no one else is, but not sure if this is the sub for these things that are tangentially related at best... especially when they're already being crossposted a bunch of times anyway.

idk maybe just bitter cause i think contra would have interesting things to say about this and i spent ten minutes listening to this balloon who can barely formulate a sentence before realising she wasn't going to be involved.I'm sorry, I'm removing this post. It's not really that related to ContraPoints and slightly beyond the scope of the subreddit. I agree with you. I've removed the post. But ContraPoints actually had a conversation with Destiny, and the theme of this debate is what Contrapoints talks about.Yes, but that is not this conversation.Honestly couldn't get past the horrible "youtube skeptic" title. Hopefully someone else can.Okay, watched some more. He doesn't actually address anything scientifically.  He just sort of repeats Contra's points, then says "why does he care about this? Why does he not recognize MY particular opinions about race? Why didn't Contra try to debunk MY pet theory about race and 'psychological characteristics' in a multiracial society???"

Then a bunch of historical revisionist dumbassness about how American white nationalists beat Hitler, ignoring that it was the USSR that did it. Watch the videos that ContraPoints uses as reference. They're much more in depth and sciency. Don't have time to watch this video at the moment but their arguments have likely already been debunked.The callbacks in this video are amazing. A makeup intro, the airhorns, King Cobra, flashes of old videos, bathing and talking about the Golden One. It's amazing.This video is great, it's really strong and scores alot of style points.

My only criticism is that isn't doesn't drill down enough into degeneracy as it is seen today.  It's a great primer on the idea of "degeneracy" as something conservatives/fascists want to stamp out, but it does little to explain how *that* aspect relates to modern alt-righters.

Her previous videos dive really deep into alt-right thought generally and that is what I find most interesting. However I don't think we see enough of that here. she seems so happy in this video!!
None other than The Golden One himself just posted a #PRICELESS [response!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BlNGZunYM8&amp;lc=z23oizrpyuajs5rih04t1aokggzwutaovr0aher4muyebk0h00410)

&gt; The Golden One

&gt; You will be spared from the Inquisition as you have observed the correct levels of admiration for my aesthetics :-)
Moreover, in regard to the Degeneracy Question, I have no problem with individuals like you (in fact I rather like you - no homo). However, I have a massive problem with the porn industry for example; an industry which destroys women's lives and saps the life joy from young men. 
Lastly, you are indeed a perfect arch-nemesis, like a Daemonette of Slaanesh to my Golden Primarch.﻿


I'm more annoyed about the misgendering than the video itself!"Top 10 Anime Rivalries"This is before she started using she/her prounous.

Not that this fascist fuck would respect them anyway, of course.That is actually really adorable! If the golden one ditched the nazi and facist shit, I would love him!Yeeeah it's right there around the time when she started using she pronouns so maybe I can't blame him, but still my heart stings everytime he says "He" :(((((Oh god I want them to get married or something hilarious like that. She's going to end up married to a Golden One, adopting 2.4 white kids and playing housemaker.

I kid.His reply is literally the "I don't mind queer individuals, I dislike queer culture" that contra closes the vid with.

Also, OF COURSE he would be referencing WH40K... There's nothing really to debunk. He's not making any points. 

He's just repeating what Contra said and then saying she's wrong, but providing no actual evidence. 

I can't even watch this. It's just an idiot. ###r/completeanarchy

It's on her live channel, and it's really great. It's also definitely the cause for all the callbacks, she's seeing the things she liked and bringing them back in. That part with Camille Paglia - I never thought I'd see a modern "feminist" embracing an antiquated historical perspective written by men in a time period when society was still a patriarchy in its purest form and women were still largely regarded as property.

In fact, the whole notion of civilizations rising and falling has been (more or less) dismissed by academic historians for quite some time now.I smell a sitcomI would watch the shit out of that. 

"No honey, you can't burn a cross in the neighbours front yard. It's bad for their lawn and, ironically, you look terrible in white." Yeah I did! That's why I recognized so many of them. I probably wouldn't've otherwise.Camille Paglia is not really a feminist, more of a post-feminist. When I was a teenager in the 1990s she was the Milo Yiannopoulos of that day and age, only more educated and less crass. Feminists hated her for going after the then young budding feminist Naomi Wolf, which resulted in an epic flamewar between them that was played out in the mass media because there was almost no public internet at the time. Also the gay press hated her and called her a homophobe. Some of the arguments she makes in the segment CP sampled go back to things she said about homosexuality in the 1990s. I actually have a copy of her book Tramps and Vamps (1994) that has an essay about homosexuality with points that are very reminiscent of this segment. IMO Camille Paglia simply expanded her old argument to include trans and queers. She very strongly believes in the [Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_and_Dionysian) and the need to maintain a balance in society and hence preposterously argued that the AIDS epidemic was a natural corrective for wayward homosexuality. I still suspect that Milo got a lot of his arguments from reading her.Urgh, thealthype is one of those annoying gishgallopers who bombards you with a mountain of lies, halve truths and cherry picked data. Just like with creationists or climate change deniers if you wade through the BS and thoroughly debunk one point, he'll drop it and bring up 20 more. 

Unfortunately he seems to be gaining some traction amongst the reactionaries, who are easily impressed as their movement lacks much in the way of thinkers.  And, CP, since I know you're still lurking, the CIA feminist in me can't help but notice that in your plea at 19:47 you subconsciously lift a passage from Lolita when you speak of "gentle decadents" who want "to be allowed to enjoy our special delights in peace.", "timid strangers who merely ask the community to allow them to pursue their practically harmless, so-called aberrant behavior, their little hot wet private acts of sexual deviation without the police and society cracking down upon them".

This is the part from Lolita, chapter 20

&gt; "Nowadays you have to be a scientist if you want to be a killer. No, no, I was neither. Ladies and gentleman of the jury, the majority of sex offenders that hanker for some throbbing, sweet-moaning, physical but not necessarily coital, relation with a girl-child, are innocuous, inadequate, passive, timid strangers who merely ask the community to allow them to pursue their practically harmless, so-called aberrant behavior, their little hot wet private acts of sexual deviation without the police and society cracking down upon them. We are not sex fiends! We do not rape as good soldiers do. We are unhappy, mild, dog-eyed gentlemen, sufficiently well integrated to control our urge in the presence of adults, but ready to give years and years of life for one chance to touch a nymphet. Emphatically, no killers are we. Poets never kill."

And this is you

&gt; [19:47](https://youtu.be/9BlNGZunYM8?t=19m47s) Listen, I don't want my position to be misunderstood. I know that most people will  probably always be straight, cis, monogamous and procreative. And, you know? That's probably for the best. Someone needs to have the babies and keep society running. All we gentle decadents ask is to be allowed to enjoy our special delights in peace. My goal is not to purge masculinity from society or anything of the kind. In a perfect society created by me, there would be plenty of beefy studs around, so don't you worry about that. And that's the difference between me and the fascists. I want a society where people like me are simply allowed to exist. And - this is the imporant part - where people not like me are simply allowed to exist. Fascists want a society where only people like them are allowed to exist. The queer quest is to survive. The fascist quest is to be the only survivor. So if society can tolerate for thousands of years the existence of priests, which is to say bejeweled men in dresses who have no children and are a giant tax exempt drain on the economy, well, you can certainly tolerate queer people who crack Nazi codes and write you musicals and sing you sing you songs. So if you think the meaning of life is to create as many white babies as possible, you know what? Fine. Go make white babies. But I really must insist upon my right and the right of all degenerates to coexist alongside you in our own decadent communities of race mixing, sexual anarchy and [rocknroll.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngmhjiR3QOo) (had to link up to the Hole cover because I just discovered that my radfem sister [Meghan Murphy digs Courtney Love] (https://twitter.com/MeghanEMurphy/status/919336557256916992), believe it or not!) 

You and consenting adults can have your special delights AFAIC but keep your hands off the children. Kids need to have their heart broken by someone their own age. 

As for the part at [14:37](https://youtu.be/9BlNGZunYM8?t=14m37s)...

&gt; Doctor: Very cute. But don't you think they might have point about the drugs and alcohol? 

&gt; Oh, Gawddamn! Fine! We'll talk about the alcohol thing. Look, there's, like, ContraPoints fans now who watch my videos and look up to me and I have to be responsible, and I hate it. Look, if you wanna drink I am certainly not going to stop you. But don't even think about driving, OK? Drink lots of water and pace yourself. There's plenty of time to be blacked out when you're dead. And you're gonna be if you don't take it slow. Alcohol is dangerous, it's unhealthy, it's only fun in moderation and it can put you in really vulnerable situations with really horrible people. So I would never recommend that anyone get involved with alcohol for any reason. I mean, unless you like having fun and feeling good. 

Thank you for "talking about the alcohol thing". I have noticed that your voice sounds less shot when you're drinking water for your voice training and HRT. You have two good reasons right there to moderate your booze intake. when did she start taking estrogen?Less than three months ago I think. She talked about it during one of her livestreams and at that point it was almost two months.Wait... are you equivocating Contra's plea for queers to be left alone to Humbert's plea for pedos to be left alone? That seems like a bit of a stretch. Humbert's argument is a co-option of the "leave us gentle decadents alone" rhetoric that queers had been using for ages beforehand.He hangs out with Christina Hoff Sommers, she must have turned him on to Camille Paglia.Not really, because [based on what I read in her Twitter stream](
https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/786204543617003520) I would assume CP would not include child rapists, or any rapists for that matter, amongst degenerates who should be allowed to enjoy their special delights. I am pointing out her lifting a page from Lolita which is her favourite novel by her own admission to show how she has subconsciously internalized that novel and how it occasionally pops up in the things she writes. She said that back in 2015 when she was trying to be a writer she realized "I wasn't going to be the next Nabokov", so IMO it's inevitable that as a screenwriter these Lolita references would show up here and there. I have noticed other references to Lolita in other CP videos, other than the obvious ones, like the "ladies and gentlemen of the jury" in the Alpha Males video. I might do a breakdown of those references sometime here on the sub if I have the time for it.She told the whole story [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHN3GEeXMfs)What I think also should be considered is that Nabokov was a moralist and that anything Humbert says should be seen through the lens of that. 

It was not Nabokov's intention to present a sympathetic figure, not someone who is honest with himself or anyone around him. 

The book details his slow desend into madness culminating with him ending up in jailtime and - importantly - with this downward trajectory being all the fault of Humbert himself who is a rather pitiful, negligent and in a lot of ways oblivious. 

Humbert is constantly seeking excuses, justifications and explanations for his own behaviour after the fact instead of dealing with himself head-on and being honest with himself. He is what we today would probably call a narcissist. 

If he uses an argument in favour of "let live and be free" then he would be doing so in order to make excuses for what he knows to be his own faults. 

Not, as someone like Wilde would do it, because of any value seen in a pluralistic society that has room for many kinds of people.  The latter I think is what Contra is talking about when she says: 

&gt;I want a society where people like me are simply allowed to exist. And - this is the imporant part - where people not like me are simply allowed to exist. Fascists want a society where only people like them are allowed to exist. The queer quest is to survive. The fascist quest is to be the only survivor.&gt; a Daemonette of Slaanesh to my Golden Primarch.﻿

wtf i hate 40k nowI think you may be on to something there.
 
The Golden One calls Contra a Slanneshi daemonette (though I think of her more as a daemon princess) and himself pre-heresy Fulgrim. Not Guilliman, Dorn, Sanguinius or any of the other loyal Primarchs or even more “manly” traitors like Angron, Horus or Perturabo. Instead he chooses the only Primarch who was seduced by Slannesh. Fulgrim was a happy little fascist exterminating “inferior aliens” and “traitors to the human race” before becoming corrupted via his quest for perfection in all things; physical, mental and spiritual.
 
So clearly The Golden One wishes Contra to seduce him away from the bland, joyless world of white supremacy into the fabulous, hedonistic life of a lefty degenerate.
 
Now we just need a ship name for them, fanfic and talented artists to start drawing romantic 40K themed artwork of the 2 of them.Why are Nazis so obsessed with WH40K? I thought it was a game for beta nerds.[GIFV link](https://i.imgur.com/chtUI2Q.gifv)

_^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/livven/wiki/gifv-bot) ^// ^[code](https://github.com/Livven/GifvBot)_I say this with all possible love to my kindred beta nerds: all nazi's are absolute dweebs.

Combine that with the fact that 1) warhammer is a pretty decent part of chan culture and 2) just looking at the basic factions, there is definitely a possible fascist reading of WH40K:

* The god emperor used to be a liberal hippy that tried to bring humanity to greatness, until both forces from outside the imperium and the sudden (class) consciousness of the Men of Iron brought that greatness under threat, justifying the rejection of liberal values in favor of an imperialist, totalitarian military industrial society that seeks to purge those whose minds become infected by foreign entities.
 
* One of those foreign entities, Slaanesh, is literally the embodiment of the degeneration of a race, brought on by the decadence of sexually liberated, pampered space twinks.

* Another is the Tau, who are blatant stand-in's for the evils of communism. Aka, best faction &lt;3

*  All of this is set against the backdrop of a the arrival of the Tyranids, giving rise to the unending war that the Imperium needs to eternally justify its totalitarian structure.

* Lastly, the orks: the dumb, brutish warrior race who are somehow the only ones who have it all figured out. Which is honestly just a weird mixed bag from a fashy perspective.

Basically, if you identify with humanity in this game, which seems like something people are naturally predisposed to, you're already taking up an essentially fascist perspective. 

*(Usual caveats to this kind of deconstruction apply: this is one possible reading, liking warhammer doesn't make you a fascist, we can critique stuff we like for the sake of understanding rather than attacking etc etc)*

Idk, let's just be happy they haven't fucked up Tolkien yet.Oh yes, that ASMR #FAIL was LMAO. I've also screengrabbed the Abigail titles for the next time someone on my timeline bitches about Riley Dennis. So sick and tired of people bitching about Riley Dennis destroying ancient Rome every day. ["ΟΗ ΝΟΟΟ, RILEY DENNIS WAS IN GREECE, WE'RE NEXT!"](https://twitter.com/RileyJayDennis/status/912324943660175360)Alright everyone, I have some relevant quotes from Camille Paglia's 1994 essay collection *Tramps and Vamps* right here for you. First, here's Paglia on the Apollonian-Dionysian Fuckboy Philosophy and blaming gay people for the AIDS crisis, from the essay ["No Law in the Arena, A Pagan Theory of Sexuality"](https://www.scribd.com/doc/66774822/No-Law-in-the-Arena) (p.93): 

&gt; I see the dynamic of history as an oscillation between Apollonian and Dionysian principles, order and energy, which become, at their extremes, fascism or chaos. In sexual terms, this promises eternal conflict between repression and debauchery. We must learn how to make tiny corrections to avoid the uncontrolled swing of the pendulum that, over a generation, swept us from Fifties conformism to Sixties rebellion to Seventies excess and the cataclysm of AIDS. We now live with the smell of funeral pyres.

&gt; Dual vision allows us to hail the epochal liberation of the senses in post-Stonewall gay culture and at the same time to acknowledge its massive destructiveness. There has been a contemptible failure by gay leaders to admit the slightest moral responsibility for the enormous part the gay community played, helped by jet travel, in the rapid spread of AIDS throughout the world. That the harm was not intentional makes the gay role all the more tragic, in the original Greek sense. The Stonewall victory was in many ways Pyrric.

&gt; The fatalism of imperial philosophy gives death a simple, secular dignity. Life is dust to dust, without the trick ending of salvation. Hit plays and films of the moment use mawkish Victorian sentimentality to present AIDS sufferers as noble victims whose only problem is lack of acceptence and love from society *Note: for those of you who don't know which movie she's referring to, it is the [1993 movie Philadelphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGRcdI3rOaU) which was criticized for its portrayal of a terminally ill white gay character and his black lawyer.* But gay men challenged nature and lost. What is "safe sex" but a return to the normative? - as dictated by tyrant nature. Promiscuity is a pagan choice, but then be prepared to pay the price. Of short, intense Romantic lives, represented in our time by gay men and rock stars, it can be said (revising a famous motto of the American Revolution), "Live free and die!"

&gt; My model of dualism is the drag queen, who negotiates between sexual personae, day by day. I sometimes call my system "drag queen feminism." Queens are "fierce," in every sense. Masters of aggressive, bawdy speech, *["bitchy sarcasm" anyone?]* they know the street and its dangers and fight it out without running to authority figures, who would hardly be sympathetic. *Note: Remember here that this book was written before widespread public use of the internet and certainly before social media or Livestreaming, technologies which now allow LGBQT to be public online and also to network with other people from the privacy and safety of their own homes. To be a drag queen or a queer in the early 1990s meant still having to brave the streets to meet likeminded others in person.* Queens, unlike feminists, know that woman is dominatrix of the universe. They take on supernatural energy when ritualistically donning their opulent costume, the historical regalia of woman's power. Prostitute and drag queen are sexual warriors who offer a pagan challenge to bourgeois gentility, now stultifying modern life from corporate boardrooms to academia to suburban shopping malls.

I'd say this part about drag queens being the way of the future stands in stark constrast to the segment that CP used where Paglia is pointing to trans people as a sign of societal degeneracy. Back in 1994 Paglia was into drag queens and pointed to them as the correct way to balance the Apollonian and the Dionysian, but she has apparently decided since that she doesn't like trans? I find this inconsistency very typical of the kind of inconsistency we constantly see with Milo.  

Next, Paglia on feminism and her contemporaries from the essay ["The Return of Carry Nation: Catherine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin"](https://books.google.nl/books?id=f_LlAmt--pkC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=camille+paglia,+the+return+of+carry+nation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EOxdPGKBY8&amp;sig=NxshOZCYJrQpWGQKA48abHoOPR8&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv7uHXoYDXAhWCExoKHeGPDawQ6AEIQTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=camille%20paglia%2C%20the%20return%20of%20carry%20nation&amp;f=false
). Towards the end of this essay Paglia brings up her beloved Apollonian-Dionysian Fuckboy Philosophy once again: 

&gt; Pornography lets the body live in pagan glory, the lush, disorderly fullness of the flesh. When it defines man as the enemy, feminism is alienating women from their own bodies. MacKinnon never deals with woman as mother, lover, or whore. Snuff films are her puritan hallucinations of hellfire. She traffics in tales of terror, hysterical fantasies of death and dismemberment, which shows that she does not understand the great god Dionysus, with his terrible duality. The demons are within us. MacKinnon and Dworkin, peddling their diseased rhetoric, are in denial, and what they are blocking is life itself, in all its grandeur and messiness. Let's send a message to the Mad Hatter and her dumpy dormouse to stop trying to run other people's tea parties. 

It was because of such dramatic hyperbolic attacks on MacKinnon, Dworkin, Susan Faludi and especially Naomi Wolf that Paglia was hated by feminists at the time. Paglia went out of her way to dismiss her feminist contemporaries: **"These are bobbysoxer Fifties personae, a docile, good-daughter style also detectable in those spoiled, bland yuppies, the failed Clinton nominees, [Zoe Baird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoë_Baird) and [Kimba Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimba_Wood)."** (p.55) Or how about this: **"An enlightened feminism of the twenty-first century will embrace all sexuality and will turn away from the delusionalism, sanctimony, prudery and male-bashing of the MacKinnon-Dworkin brigade. Women will never know who they are until they let men be men. Let's get rid of Infirmary Feminism, with its bedlam of bellyachers, anorexics, bulimics, depressives, rape victims, and incest survivors. Feminism has become a catch-all vegetable drawer where bunches of clingy sob sisters can store their moldy neuroses."** (p. 111)

Given Paglia's very negative opinion of feminism and her feminist contemporaries, it's rather strange for me that CP would refer to Paglia as a feminist when Paglia was already so thoroughly excommunicated from feminism when I first encountered her.OMG, what a birthday gift for CP, a personalized response video! And already 450 comments. The comment section under this video is a RIOT!I support Contras idea, that antisemitic narratives are often the core of various conspiracy theories (like nationalistic anti-feminism + xenophobia). This idea is on of the main arguments of the "Alpha Males" video.The idea of degeneracy destroying civilizations is probably the result of seeing historical events as the result of simple narratives (instead of using complex explanations).
The "Golden One" is the best example in it. He probably views history as a real life version of "Lord of the Rings" and "Warhammer 40k".
This creates a mystic story which is absurd when compared to the reality. The "demon Riley" is a weird caricature of the actual person. The National Socialist view about German History and the "Aryans" is a weird caricature of actual history.To understand the Golden One, you need to know Lord of the Rings and Warhammer 40k. And you should know, that he thinks, that the real world works similar to that.

It is weird to see him trying to be nice in rhetoric and style while still advocating for his fascist ideas of degeneracy and hypermasculine heteronormativity.

Is the Golden One serious with his advocacy against "Anti-female sentiment"?

It would be weird to see more Contra/GoldenOne Warhammer fanart.That video description is kinky tho...The hilarious part is that he is being serious.Yes, that's the one. A person who goes by the alias of @BigMoneyEddy
on Twitter [tweeted that drawing](https://twitter.com/BigMoneyEddy/status/921462073673916416) to CP two days ago.I could write a response to his video as long as my forearm. His claim that feminists hate women, his rejection of pornography as a corrupting influence while at the same time he sits there playing "Fash Skyrim" killing feminists and the Frankfurt School while befriending the convicted killer [Varg Vikernes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varg_Vikernes#Life_after_prison), his idea that he can excert obsessive control over his future offspring, the fact that he talks about protecting his future daughter from sexual self-objectification but not his future sons (I guess he will just ask the latter not to play with themselves? #nofap and all that?), his "no true fascist" fallacy, his conspiracy theory that the Dzooz are paying people to leave death threats to CP on Youtube... where to start?! BTW, have you ever seen [his response video to Lauren Southern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykm8nJ7U-mI) where he talks about ["the fucking feminists, 40 year old cat ladies trying to drag other women along with them into the sewer"](https://twitter.com/soiendure/status/921462416214552577) or the other one (can't find it right now) where he holds up an image of American pop singer Ariana Grande from the Side To Side video and then proceeds to complain that "this is what our society is up against"? The fact is that unlike the Golden One and his dreams of taking back Constantinopel (as a Greek woman I say "thanks, but no thanks" in response to that offer) [Ariana Grande has actually survived a literal terrorist attack on herself and her audience just this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDuVOvN5JU) but [she did not turn into a muslim-bashing fascist as a result of that traumatic experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBIqTe4EriU). I think that Ariana Grande, regardless of the Golden One's low opinion of her, has a lot to teach people like him when it comes to compassion towards others.[CP responded to The Golden One](

&gt; Well, your aesthetics are good, I'll grant you that. Not even degenerates seem to be able to hate you. A lot of the people who affiliate with you, though, well, not so much. ;) 
-Daemonette﻿its a bit funny though. i genuinely thinks he doesn't see himself as bigoted towards women. he thinks it's his duty to protect them, and sees that as respect towards themThe Degeneracy video has been placed behind an age-wall as of... a few minutes ago. Meaning, you can't watch it if you don't log into Youtube to verify your age.What, why?

Have people been  report trolling Natalie again? I was wondering the same thing! Did CP do this herself or this another one of those false flagging campaigns? Resisting the urge to start listing videos you can watch on Youtube that are immensely more explicit than this video that have not been placed behind an age-wall... *deep sigh* 

Or... [COULD THE DZOOZ BE RESPONSIBLE?!](https://imgur.com/chtUI2Q) "Here is a shekel for a good Goy, go false-flag CP's video and put their aesthetics behind an age-wall!"It is fascinating, that objects symbolize complicated ideas and references in her videos. This is one of the main differences to usual political commentaries on Youtube and offers many interpretations.Oh shit man that's hilarious. She has an official nemesis.The Golden One apparently gave his followers on Facebook [specific instructions for how to respond to CP](https://www.facebook.com/TheGloriousLion/posts/1444481185588073)This guy is the biggest dweeb on the planet.omg they just need to kiss and get it over with The fact that The Golden One has a calm and charming demeanor is what's so scary about him. He has all these awful terrible views on women, LGBT people and POC but he manages to twist words to make it seem he's not being hateful. His commitment to the gym and aesthetically pleasing body draws more people in. The Golden One is romanticizing fascism and bigotry with his charming personality and conventionally attractive body. I know I'm giving him too much credit since he does act like real life is Lord of the Rings or Warhammer, but I can see the interest in him. I don't know if most people are able to see through the rose colored glasses since he has so many supporters.

[Also, have you seen The Golden One's brother?](https://www.instagram.com/alexander.f/) Also pretty fashy but just as charming and attractive.Love it. 

Should be "estrogen crying" though instead of "estrogen, crying".

Contra is referring to a livestream she did earlier where she described how taking estrogen pills made her emotional. She calls it "estrogen crying". This is gold.I think you're right about the NB and orgasms.

What I was talking about is that the term "estrogen crying" is something Contra mentioned in a livestream. I know, I saw [that Livestream too](https://youtu.be/vbE23R1J4ko?t=15m10s) and yes, when I heard the Favourite Things parody I too guessed she was referring to the Livestream. My favourite line from a Favourite Things parody remains ["girls with blue whiskers tied up with noodles"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuOLOQGDmTw) which gets bonus points for surrealism AND unintentional kink.No worries. :) Sweetie, no. Please. I'm already on top of this and attempting to find an amiacable solution. Please don't fan the flames. 40k started out as kind of a random hodgepodge of eighties sci-fi shit and then solidified by third edition into kind of a dark satire about a dystopian fascist/theocratic society. Later editions, trying to appeal to a wider audience, ditched the satire in favor of lionizing the main human characters, although the depiction of the society didn't really change, so now the game is kind of unintentionally engaging in pro-fascism cheerleading. I think that's a big part of it.I feel The Golden One is too cartoonish to be too dangerous. Like Aurini

But there are definitely other Nazi's recruiters who are much more calm and convincing. And thats the point. When black people get angry because another police officer suffered no consequences for shooting another unarmed black guy or Latinos get angry when the POTUS pardons a sheriff who targeted Latinos and subjected them to horrendous conditions, the calm fascists goes up to the gullible centrists and says "Can't these guys just calm down for a moment?", and his calmness is mistaken for rationality.

For a somewhat smaller example of this, when Shaun's video Lauren Southern (I can't confirm that she is a fascist / Nazis, but I think she might well be) was taken down, Southern claimed that she disliked the fact that the video was taken down and that it went against her values. So with her signalling a virtue (maybe some one should come up with a term for that), she is able to frame herself as 'a virtuous pundit who is interested in hearing all sides of a debate' and not, you know a white nationalists who tries to drown refugees. And then idiots like Rubin eat it up and get her to come his show to complain about the angry left&gt;When black people get angry because another police officer suffered no consequences for shooting another unarmed black guy or Latinos get angry when the POTUS pardons a sheriff who targeted Latinos and subjected them to horrendous conditions, the calm fascists goes up to the gullible centrists and says "Can't these guys just calm down for a moment?", and his calmness is mistaken for rationality.

Wow, that's a great observation. There's also a double standard regarding the anger between marginalized groups and non-marginalized groups. If marginalized groups are justifiably angry, people brush it off as "irrational and emotional" because they equate emotions with irrationality. It's harder to empathize with them because we are conditioned to think that these marginalized groups "deserve" unfair treatment whether it's because of the misunderstanding of their culture, anecdotal evidence, religion, etc. While if let's say, a white straight cis man gets angry about being criticized for saying ignorant things like "trans people have a mental illness", people would stand up for him. Claiming he's a victim of free speech and unfairly treated.

As for Lauren Southern, I think she knows that her ideas are immensely unpopular. I'm not sure if it's because she knows her ideas are morally wrong or if it's because she was conditioned to think that she's morally right. However, I guess she's willing to criticize Shaun's video being taken down as a move to make it seem she's tolerant to many ideas, when really she's a bigoted person who tried to drown refugees.

We need to be more strategic about this. The left really needs rebranding and better marketing strategies. If it's one thing about the right and extreme right that I'm impressed by is their marketing tools. It's like what contrapoints said in her video about Milo and Anita. Milo (the right) has style but no substance, Anita (the left) has substance but no style. While style and no substance can give you immediate results, it's only short term and people will see through the bullshit, but only when it's too late and they're in deep shit up to their eyeballs. Substance and no style doesn't give immediate results when it needs to, and we need results right now before it's too late. We got it down, we have substance, all we need is style. Personally, I think substance is harder to get than style, so we can do this, but we need to do it quickly and efficiently.How does this dude have 30k more subscribers than Contra and yet make garbage videos?I thought the points were asinine, to be honest. Nothing you can't find in a typical reddit comment about freeze peach.

I wasn't talking about that though. I just mean the quality of the video is trash. This dude's mic sucks and he's still doing that thing where he just shows clips from other people's videos and then cuts to still image of a smirking cartoon character. How do you grow a channel to over 80k subscribers and not learn some better video production techniques? I guess the right will tolerate and lazily produced garbage if it validates their worldview.&gt;as a 3rd party if you pressure somebody out of a platform that's a violation of their freedom of speech

Pretty sure that's not how that works.Contra's response

1 I didn't attribute to Hitchens the claim that "any speaker is entitled to any platform." Only that they are entitled to some platform, which I think is implied in Hitchens' notion of the "right to be heard" and is certainly something that the J.S. Mill view seems to endorse. I don't wholly disagree with this idea myself, so I don't think I'm being too uncharitable here.

2 The complaint that people who have said nothing racist/sexist/etc could face unjust repercussions under hate speech prohibitions doesn't have any more force than any worry about unjust applications of a rule or prohibition. Assuming we all agree that there should be prohibitions against sexual harassment in the workplace, the fact that some people might be unjustly penalized under the prohibition doesn't mean that harassers should be given free reign. The same applies to hate speech: if people who have not said anything bigoted are being penalized as bigots, I agree, that is unfair and bad. But that doesn't imply that we should all be given free reign to express bigotry in the workplace.

3 Microaggressions might not be conscious efforts to silence people, but they may contribute, however unwittingly, to an environment that silences and suppresses certain people. This is a point that I really need to support with examples to be convincing, and I'm planning to do just that in my next video on the topic.

4 Re your "speech is not a finite resource" point: as I argue in the video, there are certain situations where one person's speech may inhibit another person's speech. Though I do support even the Nazi's right to be free of government action against their speech, I think it's naive to say "I support both the Nazi's and the Jew's right to free speech" in a given forum, where the toleration of Nazi speech creates an inherently hostile environment for the Jewish person, who likely won't be comfortable existing there. No, it's not an absolute prohibition on the Jewish person's speech, but the environment created by a prevalence of Nazi speech will likely end up having a silencing effect on people threatened by it. So it's not as simple as saying "I protect all speech equally."

And yeah, you can always say "just suck it up and deal with it" to the Jewish person, and some people will try to deal with it, they won't be silenced. But many will be. There's a reason why, in all-speech-permitted spaces like 4chan, certain viewpoints tend to thrive, and other viewpoints tend to be absent. And I don't think forums like that are conducive to productive discourse. Universities should not be 4chan.﻿"discussion"I'm sorry?oh, just saying it's more of a dick coughlin monologue really. he's not great at the "letting other people speak" part of a discussion.They were just posted on the ContraPointsLive channel on Youtube so I posted them to here. I only watched the beginning of it so far. god love you if you make it to the end, i couldn't.If that's how it works then what does it mean when fascists pressure women, people of color, Jews and LGBT people into silence with threats and intimidation?

We should really thank this guy for making such a strong case against allowing nazi rallies.I kinda paraphrased poorly, that wasn't about pressuring/threatening people into silence, it was about pressuring venues into not hosting Nazis. Anita Sarkeesian has had venues cancel on her due to threats. I don't see any YouTube skeptics going to bat for her free speech rights.^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFKtI6gn9YYes. I once decided to watch parts of one of these crazy "flat earth" documentaries to have fun by seeing their world view. It stopped being funny, when they mentioned the responsibility of the Jews (and the Vatican) behind the "round earth" and denied the holocaust. Since if the earth is flat, but the truth is hidden from us, everything else is probably part of the illusion.

Holocaust denial is disgusting if you life in a city with a memorial to a destroyed Synagogue and "Stolpersteine" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein ) reminding about killed and persecuted humans in every second street.**Stolperstein**

A stolperstein (German pronunciation: [ˈʃtɔlpəʁˌʃtaɪn] from German, literally "stumbling stone", metaphorically a "stumbling block" or a stone to "stumble upon", plural stolpersteine) is a cobblestone-size (10 by 10 centimetres (3.9 in × 3.9 in)) concrete cube bearing a brass plate inscribed with the name and life dates of victims of Nazi extermination or persecution. The stolperstein art project was initiated by the German artist Gunter Demnig in 1992, and is still ongoing. It aims at commemorating individual persons at exactly the last place of residency—or, sometimes, work—which was freely chosen by the person before he or she fell victim to Nazi terror, euthanasia, eugenics, was deported to a concentration or extermination camp, or escaped persecution by emigration or suicide. As of 31 January 2017, over 56,000 stolpersteine have been laid in 22 European countries, making the stolperstein project the world's largest decentralized memorial.

^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28That was an amazing nightTrue. I guess she grew tired of answering seriously to fascists? but i get wanting to just laugh at them for once. 
The other criticism i would have is that she talks about those homophobic communists from, like the 1970's, and then conclude that communists too hate LGBT but that is no longer the case. I recently got congratulated by Maoist for joining an LGBT org, the revolutionnary movement in the Philippines (and in most place actually) is LGBT positive  etc... 
It's as if you talked about Betty Friedman calling lesbians  "lavender menace"  and then concluded that feminists still are homophobic todayWatching this stream is impossible to describe.

I tried to create a picture which tries to recreate the atmosphere of that stream.
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNKxYGrWsAATjL6.jpgI like it! These rules look good. Let's see if they work, or if we need to add further rules and clarifications in the future.

One question regarding your definition of "safe space":
Is it possible to discuss (and criticize) all the toxic reactionary groups which appear in Contras videos? For example quoting "the Golden One" and describe the absurdity of him using Warhammer 40k lore to describe feminism.

It would be also nice to clearly define things like xenophobia, antisemitism, transphobia, homophobia, islamophobia, advocacy for fascism ... as against the rules. (It is clear that these toxic things are against your rules, but it would be nice, if they are explicitly mentioned as against the rules.)Yes, discussion should always be possible. 

Yes, all forms of bigotry are against the rules. Bigotry I define as the irrational belief that a group of people should be treated as lessers based on an immutable, harmless and innate trait they possess. This means no racism, no homophobia, no transphobia, no misogyny, no misandry, etc. 

I won't allow people to deflect from their own bigoted statements by tu quoque. This means that when people point to a dictionary and say: "Bigotry is defined as not accepting an opinion and you don't accept my opinion that these people are degenerates..  So you are the *real* bigot here", well, that's right out. 

I also won't allow a redefining of bigotry in the other direction, stating that it is impossible to be bigoted against white males for example, because white males hold a position of power in society, I see that as a form of bigotry in itself. We should strive for equality for everyone in society and recognise that in certain conditions it is possible for any individual to be unfairly discriminated against because they belong to a certain subgroup. 

I make a distinction between critiquing an idea and critiquing a people. It is fine to say (for example) that certain forms of Islam promote beliefs which are problematic in one way or the other. It is **not** fine to then say something denigrating, exclusionary or bigoted about *Muslims* based on that opinion. Beliefs are not people. People are worthy of inherent respect and dignity. But the only way to determine if a belief is respectable is by examining it and see if it can withstand critique. 

This then means that you're always free to critique belief systems like evangelical Christianity or fascism when they seek to be exclusionary or damaging towards minorities. Critiquing a harmful ideology cannot be bigotry. 

I feel that "no bigotry" logically follows from rule three. 

  Can I shitpost? Or make comments that are shitposts?I'm inclined to say no because semen isn't flesh.Depends on what you mean by that.Making dumb jokes.

Like, there was a post here that said "Is debate Useful? A discussion with philosohpyTube" and I answered "No, Fite me". Stuff like that.That's perfectly fine. Ok, thanks.This is fantastic coverage, will be using it as part of my “you should definitely be watching Contrapoints” starter pack for friends. What's all this about the author of the article being a terf? I don't know. It's a positive article about Contra, so it doesn't seem to me as if it's written by someone who would hold bigoted opinions about her.  The author also doesn't misgender or deadname her. 

I haven't researched the author and I don't really care to. It's a good article that's bound to get some more positive attention for Contra and that's nice, I think. He's approvingly retweeted some articles advancing the idea that  children and teens are transitioning due to peer pressure, iirc. It seems to be an idea held by people who are otherwise transpositive, so it's inline with this article, which isn't transphobic at all. However, it's not a terf-specific idea, so maybe I missed something else he's done.http://transadvocate.com/the-new-york-magazine-lies-to-parents-about-trans-children_n_18875.htmTau, while fun, are just shitty faux utilitarians.

Definitely agree about the nerd shit tho. Most fashy ppl I know are nerdy socially awkward guys.She's a commie too, she's just putting out there how pervasive a lot of this shit is. There are plenty of brocialists (just check out leftypol as an example), so it's not as if the problem went away, even if it is much better.yeah, I thought it was a good piece and was surprised to see a barney going on about it on twitter... If it's just the parroting of those stats about desistance we should probably make more of an effort to make a distinction between actual ideologue terfs &amp; someone who cited something misguided. idk.I mean, kids transitioning can be an issue. On the one hand, it's better for trans people to start their transition early, on the other hand, many kids who feel like they might be trans turn out to be cis and just going through a phase, and it would be medically unethical to start someone transitioning if they're not really trans. Which is why a lot of minors end up taking puberty blockers so they can effectively hit the pause button on their bodies development, and if they still want to transition when they reach majority they can do so without crippling dysphoria in the meantime. "When a children’s gender identity clinic in Toronto was shut down earlier this year for practicing conversion therapy on trans kids, Jesse Singal, a liberal and science editor for New York Magazine, published a 10,000-word defense of the doctor who ran the clinic and his methods."

https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/03/lefts-history-of-transphobia/ 

I'm going to look more into this obviously but so far, Jesse Singal seems a little shady with regards to trans issues.


I'm still happy that Contra is getting good coverage, here's hope that she gets interviewed and written about more in future!Well, just because someone was wrong in the past doesn't mean they can't learn and change their minds. 

I also feel that unless someone is unredeemably obtuse or a professional troll they shouldn't be excluded from a debate. Again, because reasonable people can change their minds when shown that the people they disagree with are human beings capable of an open discussion. 

Someone like Ken Ham or Milo Yiannopoulos, there's no point in talking to them. They're not going to stop being deliberately antagonistic and wrong, because they've learned they can make a lot of money from being disingenious.  But someone who is willing to change their minds when given evidence and sound reasoning should not be excluded.

This article is positively glowing and good reports about Contra only help her channel. &gt; just shitty faux utilitarians.

Goddamnit, we can't even have left unity in make-believe space.I thought that was normal The problem is that the article didn't factually lay out the issue like you did. Instead, it jumped to the conclusion that increasing referrals to gender clinics means large numbers of teens are transitioning due to peer pressure. I think most of the people interviewed were parents unsupportive of their child transitioning rather than experts or trans teens themselves. They literally aren't tho. They dogmatically revere these literal "ethereal" members of their society, and they all live under a fucking caste system. Warhammer 40k is just a dozen different races that all basically have different flavors of horrid totalitarianism. The Empire is a giant fascist theocracy, and the ethereals are the fill-in for the emperor with the Tau.

Rant aside, fuck online leftism (besides some of the memes), terrible do-nothing posadists.Oh no, if I have to be serious of course I agree with you about the Tau.

Just to continue the flow of paragraphs and because this is something I'm still trying to clarify for myself: 

I'd be hesitant to dismiss online leftism that much. Of course it's useless without real actions, but it's probably the most effective propaganda vector we have *(as of right now)*. I'd love some stats on how often this happens in general, but at the very least it got several people I know, including myself, properly agitated and organized in the real world.

Something like the notion of 'propaganda of the deed' is great and it's going to be a crucial part of future tactics, but it's going to be a lot more effective if you have a narrative and people know what, say, things like capitalism, neoliberalism or ungovernability even mean. 

And the memes really are pretty good. This issue for me is that internet leftism, beyond memes and making fun of reactionaries, quickly decays into people who effectively advocate doing nothing. Either *blank* group isn't left enough, or it's not my affiliation, or it's too sectarian, etc. Or leftcoms/ultras with the perspective that militant leftists groups separate themselves from the proletariat and disturb the natural flow of inevitable revolt; which has *some* legitimacy if you consider how much the rest of them complain about how ideologically impure any group or coalition(or future proletarian revolt lol) is, but ultimately means that there's no way to organize. 

So yeah, I engage with the memes and some of the leftist pages that are more encouraging and less bogged down by ideological infighting(r/chapotraphouse). However, doing grassroots coalition building encourages me more and is way less nihilistic than online leftism.
I see your point. it's true, Antifa for example has a problem of extreme virilism (i mean i support bashing the fash 100% but why does it have to be white cis dudes who do it? huh) 
I just think that to illustrate her point, it would have been better to take a more recent example. (just screeshot leftypol indeed loool) 
Also, has contra explicitely said she is a communist?!! would be awesome but her ideology seems more of a undefined type of leftism? where did you see that ?^^ I don't think we disagree about that: my last post was me defending the best of what online leftism can do, but the issues you raise I definitely recognize as well. 

Let's just say I'm still (cautiously) optimistic about the positives outweighing the negatives as far as leftist social media is concerned, while noting that its goal really is to get large scale grassroots action going.I mean I always assumed through the context of her videos &amp; use of comrade. Also [this seems pretty telling](https://twitter.com/contrapoints/status/912115132838408192/photo/1)AntiCa is a terrorist organisation, you guys. 

So much for the tolerant left. &gt; If it's just the parroting of those stats about desistance we should probably make more of an effort to make a distinction between actual ideologue terfs &amp; someone who cited something misguided. idk.

There's citing something misguided, and then there is being obstinate for years about something you have no experience or education in: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNfz9DvVAAE32j3.jpg

People who have heard something terrible that they didn't analyze because they've never met a trans person, we can work with. People who treat gender identity issues as a way to grift are functionally terfs, whether the radical feminist monicker is accurate or not.
So at first I thought this video was going to be a pro-abortion argument or something

Then it knocked me for a loop xD good job guys!

P.S. not implying a pro-abortion video wouldn't have been good I like those tooyou're quite right, i didn't know the extent of his writing on the subject. the more i read about singal's views, the less sympathy or benefit of the doubt i can find for him.Relevant link, supporting your argument: 

https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-is-bad-science/[Does the right hate free speach?](https://twitter.com/DickCoughlan/status/925911959123447810)Brittany wants to fuck Contra so badly lmao. She's everything I hate about fervent pro-bdsm people, in that she just says a lot of stuff that is *really* questionable. Like I'm tangently in my areas BDSM scene and it's painful to be around people like her in person. What do you mean exactly? do you think that her defense of BDSM is bad? I am genuinely asking, i have complicated opinions on the subject. She doesn't put BDSM in a very good light for people who aren't in the scene. She's very "everyone's fetish is valid and safe and BDSM is NEVER harmful" which are both blatantly false things. The way she talks about BDSM as a whole is so off-putting, if she were my introduction to BDSM I probably wouldn't have continued. And she talks about going to meetups as the first thing you should do which is pretty not great advice. But she doesn't do that. 

Granted, I don't know her very well but in this stream she gives an example of intervening in a practice which was unsafe and she says multiple times to make sure that what you are doing is consentual and responsible.I have to respectfully disagree. So much of her content seems to be how to mitigate risk, recognize red flags and preserve one's own autonomy. I'm...kind of a swirl cone when it comes to bdsm vs vanilla and have found her perspective to be interesting and fairly well informed.I'm sorry, but this is off-topic. I saw this live yesterday and I really feel for Natalie. I hope she feels better soon and doesn't let the people who are way too into ideological purity bother her.

We're all human. It's not realistic to demand from someone that they are flawless. I only saw the recorded version did the live episode have more thoughts?The live one went on for a bit after this. I don't really recall specifics as it was very late where I live and I was watching it on my phone in bed trying to stay awake.

I do remember her mood though. She was a bit bogged down with the negative reactions to her recent interview and with the limitations of the transition process in general. 

I think some of the responses to her giving that interview are way over the top and out of line. From what I have seen in her interactions with others Natalie is a very kind person who is conscious of the effects her words may have on the person she is talking to. She really doesn't deserve this vitriol. I don’t get why people think Nazis were cool. They’re such tightwads about purity and decency that they’d kill you for being different. Maybe it’s because they were the inspiration for the Galactic EmpireI seriously question if they are a university. @coelophy is insanely talented. She is without a doubt the best artist in the SJW sphere. She also takes commissions for an extremely reasonable price if anyone is interested.What exactly is /r/destiny about? Is Destiny a person? He's a twitch streamer who regularly does political discussions/debates.  He's had contra on a few times in the past.really agree with the comment in there that contra has been putting too much of a burden on herself, that thing she said in a few early videos that she can be Tank for social justice movements on the internet was always pretty concerning - that can only go on for so long, especially going through something as (i presume) emotionally intensive  as transitioning.

doesn't help that the left (or at least lefty internet spaces) demand so much of people in positions of influence either. can't be fun taking abuse from both sides. 

hope she's good.He's a former StarCraft pro who now streams debates, mostly with the far right. He used to be anti feminist and right wing himself(regular right, not far right) and is now roughly speaking a neoliberal. He's been doing the debate thing for a few years now. His audience is more left than he is.Subreddit for the streamer Destiny and the guy arguing against all the idiots in the discussion.

Contra and Destiny have talked a few times, and destiny often talks really highly of Contra and her videos.

There's no doubt that Contrapoints has had a huge impact on his view of the world.

I learned about contrapoints from their conversations on his stream, and she frequently pops up on the subreddit.As someone who has followed Destiny since the beginning, I can't say he was ever anti-feminist. I suppose his economic philosophy is center-right in terms of being very pro-market but he also very much supports social programs to combat inequality.

He used to be a lot more callous with his language, but has since acknowledged that regardless of context throwing slurs around empowers actual bigots and has for the most part reigned it in.I remember when he just started playing league of legends, he was against feminism. That's when I first watched him. I don't remember the specific arguments he used, but he definitely didn't do his research on it back then. I think he believed the usual line of women already have equality under the law, feminism is not needed anymore etc.Fair enough, I did fall off for a while because by the time he was playing League I was playing Dota, but regardless 2017 Destiny tends to be very left leaning on basically everything but economics (and even then he supports wealth redistribution to combat inequality, he's just not a full on socialist/marxist).Yeah, hes a better debater and person now. The phase I was talking about was around 2012 I think.That's so nice of you guys over at r/Destiny that I have just added you to the sidebar as the first of our linked subreddits. If that's what her majesty desires then it is what she shall have. Can you explain why this is on-topic for this sub please?"Race realism" is just a dogwhistle for white supremacy though. 

But ok. I've approved the post. Personally I ship Contra and the Golden One, because that's just sitcom levels of hilarity. 

"Honey, could you noooot do thaaaat."

'What?' 

"Sweety, you can't go burn a cross in the neighbours front yard. It's bad for their lawn and - ironically - you look terrible in white."There's a lot of history here. This is a pretty dense topic. But a couple wikipedia articles can get you started.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee#Legacy

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_the_Han_River

Basically a "benevolent dictator" colluded with big corporate families to stimulate growth and the US and Japan gave economic aid whenever South Korea needed it.Only at the moment! We have 1 PS4 player haha. If console players spread the word or invite their friends we can diversify :)Haha 😂 yea I'd like to get more ppl but I don't know where to post it besides this subredditContraPoints has buckets of style. This vid once again slays it. And a page for her characters:

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/ContraPointsI am not sure, but it could be custom made by Zoë Blade. Contra uses a lot of her music. Hmm. 

I don't know if this is about "our" ContraPoints or a different person who used the same name. 

Interesting though. I don't have an account on that site and don't really know what their editing rules are. Also my redditing keeps me very busy.

But if you have the time and inclination, go for it! :)Natalie is someone that I implicitly and explicitly trust to handle such a debate with intelligence, grace and style.

One of her more admirable qualities is the ability to feel empathy with and sympathy for people she disagrees with, yet she is smart enough to handle herself in the face of disagreement and not be pressured into straying from her core beliefs. 

I look forward to this. I expect her to win this debate, by any metric in which a win can sanely be ascribed. 

Of course, I am a total fanboy so I am not the most impartial  person in the room here. Debate needs to have a function though.

If there is no disagreement of opinion then it's just a pleasant conversation where you agree with each other all the time and not a debate.

You can really only debate someone if there is a strong oppostion in point of view. 

I support Natalie debating the extreme right because she is smart, capable and a likeable person. She is going to convince some of the onlookers that she is in the right and that those disagreeing with her are wrong and that's the purpose of debate. To convince the onlooker. Sure, but that's a matter of gradation. The goals and beliefs are the same, there's just a difference of opinion on how to best go about that. 

I support Natalie in this debate because I think she can do an excellent job of it. I don't think she's someone who would easily be seduced to the dark side, as some people on twitter seem to think and I certainly don't agree with the notion that no debate with these people should be allowed. 

That sort of ideological insistence on purity of association is exactly what Natalie talked about in her video "the Left". The left tends to have an optics problem as well as a (perceived) extremism problem. 

The right is far better at appearing reasonable and one of the causes for that is its tendency to on the surface at least look like they just want to have an open discussion. So let's have that discussion. Show the onlookers exactly what is wrong with their positions, where they lead to and what the man behind the curtain looks like. 

Play them at their own game. Our optics could easily be more attractive because it's not just a facade to hide actual evil, as is the case with fascists. 

Her twitter repliers are in full-on disavowment mode over this and that is precisely the wrong attitude to have. I'd say support her. Don't, as Tabby would do, hiss at her and say she's now forever tainted. Instead trust that this is Contra we're talking about, who knows what she is doing and who has the smarts and capability to win over people to a saner point of view with this whole thing. I'm sorry, but a deleted comment cannot be recovered by moderators. If a moderator deletes a comment then it is not really gone, it's just hidden from view for users who are not admins or moderators of the subreddit.

This is how those sites work (though they work far from perfectly) they can reveal these comments which are normally hidden from view. 

In your case, you deleted the comment yourself. This means that not even a moderator can see it anymore and we can't restore it. It's gone I'm afraid. Not direct Contra content but an interesting vid and related to what she talks about enough for me to allow it. Being excellent to each other and viewing peoples opinions charitably instead of in the most negative way possible is in the rules for a reason. This includes using the voting system.

If people cannot behave in threads like these then they will be locked and I will remove the voting functionality from this subreddit entirely. 

This is very funny and insightful. Thanks for posting. :)I enjoyed this video a lot, thanks for making it. A comprehensive argument explaining a lot of the common sociopolitical climate in a sane and non-confrontational way. 

Also it has Contra. It's  great!Sweetie, don't call me (or anyone else here) an idiot please.

I upvoted you to give you some visibility. I don't have an answer for you though. No harm done.Someone on reddit linked me the "How to recognise a fascist" video.

I watched. Then I watched it again. 

Then I watched all her videos.

ContraPoints is the only Youtube content creator I am subscribed to. I love everything about her. She is very intelligent, wittty and she just oozes style. It's a shame it's come to this but I understand her decision. 

The backlash against her decision to participate in a debate has just been appalling. People who call themselves fans have gone so far over the line with toxic critique that it's understandable and sane she decided to distance herself from her audience. 

I feel sad that I won't be able to watch her late night livestreams anymore but I understand and support her decision. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_EOhEkZdYIwfJ1kyyl8GQwI get that this is a humorous post. But there are people out there who do "demand answers" from ContraPoints.  To those I would say:

She doesn't need to answer anything. 

Contra is under no obligation to pander to overblown hysterics by people who viciously attack anyone who doesn't yield to their notions of ideological purity.

She is an adult, an excellent speaker and confronting and debunking the extreme right is literally her job.

And that is just all there is to it.I understand and no worries, it's a perfectly fine post.

I wanted to explain the subreddit position (Which, well, is *my* position, really) on the issue the pun is based on though. 

It is but not a good fit for the sub, sorry.

Thanks for commenting though and showing us you're not a spam bot. :)We don't have a discord chat for the subreddit. We might think about adding one if we get a lot more subscribers, as of now the sub is still small. Yes, but we are not affiliated with that. Contra herself has no involvement with this subreddit.

She can if she wants to though, we'd love to have her on board. When one of her "does the left hate free speech" videos got falsely flagged and a bunch of people reuploaded it to show support, I saw the1janitor's mirror of it.Great article, thanks for posting. :)u/drewiepoodle, do you maybe have some resources for OP?Here is another Contra gif you did not know you needed:

https://i.imgur.com/5jajVNq.gifIncest adjacent stuff?I've definitely taken a turn to the left since Trump.  I have a lot less patience for cries of "free speech!" "oh no the SJW's!" than I used to. Please use a less inflammatory title in the future. :)

It's all good, but I almost got my banhammer out. 

I'll add some flair to nuance things up a bit. I made it 7 minutes through, couldn't watch any more. He keeps on calling him a liar, and has only addressed a few of his points. He corrects himself about what killed Heather Heyer, stands by his comment that SJWs are responsible for women getting raped, and stands by his "entirely unbiased inquiry" into wondering if Richard Spencer is controlled opposition. Like, who asks that question?

Maybe it's because Carl of Akkad over here doesn't believe in Speech Acts, but maybe it's time we introduce him to the concept, that once you say something it changes the landscape around you. Carl says he's the product of miscegenation. Between who and what, Carl? A nineteen year old boy and an unconscious 12 year old girl lying in a coma bed in 1993? I just heard a rumor, Carl, and I wanted you to address whether this is true or not, and if you don't answer this question, I can assume that means you're hiding from the truth! This is what Trump did to Obama over the birth certificate, the very act of speaking it creates the insecurity needed to justify its own existence.

Believe it or not, there's a reason why we don't debate absolutely everything and that's because it gives stupid ideas too much credence. By continuing with speech acts about his birth certificate, Trump stoked up enough fear to force Obama to address a completely stupid question. This is ultimately an act of power. If you can get someone to address your own insane theories, that means that your concerns win out over theirs. 

Let's remember: all speech is speech acts. Every society has restrictions on speech. No one is ever "just wondering". Every time any one of us opens our mouths, its an opportunity to shift the overton window and fight in the culture war, which has always been there.Sure, done.In her latest livestream Natalie mentioned she had just finished reading a book called Capitalist Realism. You could try that. 

She also tweeted a few days ago that:

&gt;"I stayed up all night reading J. Michael Bailey's "The Man Who Would Be Queen." I have concluded that it is a bad book. Goodnight."anyone have the original version? I've downloaded several of her videos but I hadn't gotten to this one. I'd love to compare them.The blurring of the nipples made me laugh out loud. This is why I love ContraPoints. Smart, funny, great style and the absolute refusal to take herself seriously. She posted a link to it on twitter some time ago. You can probably still find it if you go down her list of tweets. She deleted the link from the tweet and the video was either made private or deleted.I'm in the US and this was the url for the video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-c2qnfUNXE

shows up unavailable for me.Oh that's a shame.apparently she's been having multiple issues over the past few days with it (https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/941777985421697024). I managed to rip it yesterday when it was fully viewable for a while.She hasn't reacted to it yet. She's only done her first 12 videos.I can't believe that Natalie had to endure all this nonsense and heartbreak over something which was eventually cancelled because some lazy woman just couldn't be bothered to reply and decided to ghost everyone. 


I am slightly peeved.

Personally, I think ms. White should just be blacklisted from future events. If she can't be professional about these things then people shouldn't give her the attention.According to the organisers multiple event organisers tried reaching her more than once and got no reply.

Based on her history of cancelling without giving notice I cannot fault them for assuming she planned to do so again and taking initiative, rather than run the risk of attendees showing up for nothing. 

I don't think this was a case of "hard to reach". It was, for the organisers, a case of cutting losses. ContraPoints accepted an invitation to debate Blaire White with Theryn Meyer as moderator. The event would be hosted by an organisation which in the past had given a platform to someone who turned out to be racist. 

She got *a lot* of hate for that from the more radical leftist twitter sphere, who saw it as a "betrayal" because I suppose in their minds it's important to be ideologically pure and you're not allowed to associate with the enemy in any way. 

Some people claimed she was a TERF now. Some people claimed she could no longer be trusted. 

It was really very bad. Contra was upset by all this and decided to be less involved with her fandom from now on. 

And now the event is cancelled because ms. White couldn't be bothered to reply to phonecalls or emails for two weeks and the organisers assumed she was ghosting them, as she had done to others in the past. I agree, this is Contra at her best. Most of the tweets about it have since been deleted, sorry.

There's still some threads on this sub. 2nd page.I'm sorry, but I am going to have to limit the amount of off-topic posts just a small bit. A few are ok every now and then, were a small sub. But we do focus on ContraPoints and this is not directly related to her. It would be better suited for a different subreddit.If it has to do with contra.I'm sorry, I don't see what this has to do with ContraPoints.Eh. I'll allow it. This is a subreddit about ContraPoints and posts must be on-topic. 

I'll allow this one, because I get why you would post it here, but I will be removing more off-topic posts from now on. 

I hope to find some kind of sweet ratio of allowable offtopic/ tangentially relatable posts that will not lead to the subreddit turning into something it's not supposed to be.

Until I find a better way of dealing with that it's going to be on a case by case basis.

--------------------------------

On topic of these editors notes: Oh god, these editors notes. This is hilarious.Super vid. Great style, excellent production value as always. I love that it's a part one of two. I get the feeling that a lot of those authors were made up. I don't know much about Marxist writers though. It's a part one of two. 

I expect she is laying the foundation in this one and will adress its consequences next vid.Nazism is a social ideology. Communism an economic model. Communism is not and can not be responsible for mass murder. Ruthless dictators are. 

Unless you are willing to be consistent and also hold capitalism responsible for the crimes against humanity the US perpetrated in South America and Asia. 

Having a discussion with someone does not equal agreeing with everything they say.

People really need to learn this. Having a discussion with someone is not giving an extremist a platform and I have no reason to assume that boy is an extremist. 

You are going to need to explain how a way of organising the economy requires mass murder.

Because from where I am standing that is conflating completely unrelated issues. 

But, since you are adamant in your convictions here, you are also willing to hold capitalism responsible for Korea, Vietnam, Allende, Iran - Contra etc. etc?I'd have to look up who that is first. 

You seem to be confusing several different issues into one tangled mess instead of approaching things from an open-minded perspective.

Certain individuals can be pointless to converse with, because they will refuse to be intellectually honest and will abuse any attempt at conversation as a means to gain more infamy. Milo Yiannopoulos is one of these people. There is no reason to ever discuss anything with him since he is just not honest in his intentions or in his ways of conversing. Nothing can be gained from it. 

There however can be a reason to have a conversation with a fascist. The tickler there of course is that if a fascist is willing to be intelectually honest they soon will have to admit that the core principle behind their philosophy is racism, hatred, exclusion. 

A decent human being cannot maintain a fascist ideology and intellectual honesty at the same time. So on the one hand you are blaming the social ideology of western imperialism, but on the other hand the economic model of communism and you do not see an inherent dishonesty in this?

All things being equal, this is not a pick and choose. It's either the economic models on both sides or the social philosophies on both sides. Only if capitalism is much more than an economic model as well. In case any of y'all felt the need to defend Theryn during the clusterfuck around the Vancouver event, this provides some strong evidence that she's shifting ideologically at least partly as a result of interactions with Nat. 
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQWRczcXcAAInoy.jpgI've seen some from shoe, but usually pretty surface level stuff like "TERFS are bad mmmmkay". Theryn has been doing the intellectual work to really understand and help others to understand how things like "free speech" can be used as cudgels against marginalized groups, and how racism can have more forms than saying "I hate black people". I don't know the other person you mentioned.Wouldn't be shocked, though shes now marrying deeper into that culture. Perhaps this "race realism" split will eventually lead some of the antis down the path of righteousness. We should let them know that there is space for them in our movement, and not all their current fans are strictly anti.
Hell, I might even try to put together a roadmap for how to subtly shift their presentation and positions to minimize audience loss while stepping back as much as possible from the bullying and badly supported neo-regressive philosophy. Good right? To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Contrapoints. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of history and philosophy most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Natalie's filth as politics outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation - her personal philosophy draws heavily from John Waters, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about ALCOHOL. As a consequence people who dislike Contrapoints truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in Natalie's existential catchphrase "Become my patron on Patreon," which itself is a cryptic reference to Marx's masterpiece Capital, as everyone needs money to live. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Mother's genius unfolds itself on their YouTube pages. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Contrapoints tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty Copypasta.I brought it up in light of Mexie's conversation with Contrapoints where they discuss the creeping similiaries between nazism and veganism.If it's behind her, that would mean it's being used as a rim light. I'll have to look. I wish she'd use more powder for those times she looks so shiny. TBH, sometimes it's hard for me to call one a key light and another a fill when she uses such dramatic colors.Awesome, I wasn't sure if she used gels with Fresnel Lights or LED's but that's really helpful, thank you.you should have put Fritz (nazi uniform) on "authoritarian right" and Abigail Cockbane (TERF) on the "authoritarian left"The Golden Twink is not exactly his own character. It's more just Natalie/Contra in a costume. Why is Fritz Authoritarian Left?  FFS[EDIT: .....oh, I just remembered what /s means. Never mind...... 😳 But, in case anyone actually believes that argument, I left the angrypants post below. Revel not in my shame.]

Oh, one of those. Fuck off, and read Mein Kampf.

No, seriously. Read how  Hitler spelled out in his own words how he used the name as a ruse to snag leftists.

Then look up what the red triangle meant in the death camps.

Maybe browse a bit on the Commisar Order after that.

Then, maybe end with the Martin Niemöller poem, just for fun.

Don't complain, just make your ownBecause it was the closest fitSeriously.Fair enough Made this a while ago.

I implore you to make your own!It's hard to say where Tabby lies, because she defines herself more by being against things than being for them. We know she thinks "revolution" is an answer sufficient unto itself, but that's about it.I like this one. Jackie Jackson is iffy because she doesn’t have opinions outside of “free speech”, but I can’t think of a better character for libertarian right.My read on Jackie is that she focuses with one kind of freedom in particular: "Freedom of speech". For all I know, she could have socialist leanings.Some criticism of Chelsea Manning's position on immigration:

It can be difficult to have open borders and a welfare state at the same time. It's probably not impossible, but there's issues.

Poorer folks will come to your country. They initially they won't be citizens, so they won't be eligible for welfare-state like benefits, but their kids will and ... if they become citizens, so will they. If the migrants are disproportionately poor, this creates a tax revenue problem. 

Don't get me wrong. I support a more transparent and fair immigration system, but there's a reason nations like Canada and Germany use skill based immigration (with some exceptions).The skeptic community is really balkanizing. Believe me, I used to be really into them (and I still do like many of them).

If Contra wants to keep up the Rubin parody, she would probably have to put him in the "Sargon" or "I'm not a nazi" camp. Rubin is ethnically Jewish. Nazis want him dead.

It’s not comprehensive tho2x might be a better place to ask this, but for now I can recommend some episodes of a podcast called "Stuff Mom Never Told You" while the episodes may not pertain exactly to your situation, you can draw connections to media that does from it. I recommend starting with the Anita Hill episode.Yes, and they are welcoming to those who are Trans/Non binary/Male.

Hope you find some help and get past this!violence from the oppressed against oppressors is not the same as authoritarianism. The American revolution wasn't an act of authority, it was an act of liberty. I think there's an argument to made that Tabby being a communist makes her authoritarian, but political violence itself isn't inherently authoritarianIf someone narrates this thread and puts it on YouTube it's like getting 2 vids this month! Is her Twitter always this lively?Totally. Because we are postmodernists of course and reality is ontologically incomplete, I will never be able to get you to fully understand how completely unreal the experience was, step by step. But if I were to try, it would go something like this:

&gt; 1) Is that Natalie? It kind of looks like Natalie. I gotta get closer to find out.
&gt;
&gt; 2) It still looks like her. Do you think it's her? No way, this bar's dimly lit. I gotta get closer to be sure.
&gt; 
&gt;3) I'm getting closer and it still looks like her! Like it really could be her! In my bar! Whatever, don't be stupid, calm down. She's talking to some brunette girl. 
&gt;
&gt;4) It really looks like her! She's wearing a choker! And that white top with the sleeves pushed off her shoulder! Gosh, if it isn't her, I gotta tell her how she looks like my favorite person ever.
&gt;
&gt;5) Well now I'm 4 feet away, now I have to say something. 
&gt;
&gt;6) "Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, but are you Natalie?

&gt; "Yes"

&gt; HOLY SHIT HOLY FUCKING SHIT IT'S HER! IT'S HER!!!

&gt; I TURN TO THE GIRL SHE'S TALKING TO EXPLAIN MYSELF

&gt; IT'S LINDSAY FUCKING ELLIS

&gt; FIREWORKS EXPLODE MY BRAIN ACROSS THE WHOLE BAR, I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPOSE MYSELF FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING, IT'S LINDSAY FUCKING ELLIS AND CONTRAPOINTS IN MY BAR AND THEY ARE LOOKING AT ME RIGHT NOW.

&gt; BRAIN NOT PUTTING WORDS TOGETHER, SO MUCH TO SAY, SHOULD I BUY MOTHER A DRINK? OF COURSE MOTHER ALREADY HAS A DRINK, WHY BUY HER ONE? SHE SEES YOU'RE STUMBLING, YOU'RE TAKING UP TOO MUCH OF HER TIME

&gt; AW FUCK MY DATE IS HERE AND IS PISSED AT ME FOR WORSHIPING THIS STRANGER, GOODBYE NATALIE, YOU LEGENDARY POKEMON OF A PERSON!

&gt;"Why don't you like Nietzsche...what about Deleuze..." I mouth to her as I get dragged back to my date.If Tabby had a show, this would be it...Holy shit, bravo!

Thank you! I am/was a fan of Peterson as well, but the "makeup" comment made me lose a lot of respect for him. I'm a man who works out and keeps his weight under control because I want to be physically attractive. I'm not inviting sexual harassment. The same would apply to women wearing makeup. Peterson's argument here is just insane.

I do however agree with Peterson on bill C-16. Natalie and Michael Brooks are correct in saying that nobody is advocating **jail** time for misgendering someone, but C-16 does (afaik) impose fines somewhere to the tune of up to 250k CAD. I do oppose that. My source is biased (literally an article by Peterson himself) so if anyone has information that contradicts what I'm saying, by all means, let me know.

http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/civil-rights/301661-this-canadian-prof-defied-sjw-on-gender-pronouns-and-has-aThanks for the reply. I'll do some research. If I really want to understand this topic I need to just read the damn law.Thanks. This is useful context. I’m an American and I don’t work in the legal field, so I don’t understand a lot of how this works in practice.Hbomberguy has crashed the party!Is it really a Valentine's day special if most of the stream was after midnight? 🤔holy shit this is a good one. Doubled up on Fritz thoughi knew i shouldve done more research before commenting!Holy shit! Do you know when in the stream it is?This is why we should compile a contra character chart, I didn't get that until you pointed it out!We can probably open source it by making a post where people submit a screenshot with a brief description of the character. It would be faster than one person doing all the work, and from there we can make a wiki.Okay, so, if anybody is actually still interested in this stuff
I managed to get a similar effect to natlie's lighting by using 2 YONGNUO YN360 Led lights (or lightsabers, as they're know amongst me and the people I talk to about it) It gives a pretty good effectThat’s mostly in the past. I still do hold some views you may consider reactionary, but I implore you, don’t dismiss what I’m saying entirely because of that.

This is not only for my sake. If you signal that you won’t accept someone that’s willing to change his mind you may drive people on the fence further toward full on radicalization.

You can also see that I’m trying to put another viewpoint on the table based on my comment history. Maybe I’m failing, but I am trying to make a difference. I won’t insist that you engage. Psychologically it’s not the easiest thing to handle. However, past (and maybe some present) reactionary viewpoints aside, I am trying to do something positive. That’s gotta be worth something.There absolutely is a way to leverage that. Southern Italians are really similar to Ashkenazi Jews. The alt right has a big problem with Jews, but not Italians. You can split Ashkenazi Jews and Italians pretty well if you do a principle component analysis on the genetic variables, but even then, the clusters are quite close when you consider all of Europe.

Basically, the average Italian is more similar to the average Ashkenazi Jew than the average Brit.

Leveraging this information is only somewhat effective for Europe, but it's very effective in the USA and Canada because the ethnic boundaries tend to be more blurred.

I appreciate it a lot.http://i.imgur.com/riJLc2O.png

This may also be helpful. It's a map of eye color across Europe simplified in terms of "light" and "dark" eyes. The idea isn't to convince the people actually writing on the forum. They're often (but not always) already radicalized to a point where debate won't do any good. The idea is to sway readers. For every one comment on these forums there are probably a large number of lurkers that read and do not participate.

My hope is that they're reachable.

EDIT: Also, thanks for taking a second look.```Challenge all your deeply held viewpoints and ask them if they are based on empathy or hostility.```

This is a great statement. I'll take it to heart.How do I know it's working? That's a damn good question.

Here's my rationale. I'm not totally confident in it, so I'm open to criticism.

* I think you'd be right if we were talking about a platform that isn't already dominated by the alt right. However, if a platform is dominated by the alt right, the ideas have """legitimacy""" in the eyes of the audience already. The goal is to delegitimize bad ideas (to the extent possible) in the eyes of the audience.
* Providing the anti voice can be a net positive even if you lose. Echo chambers tend to allow for the illusion that the dominant view within the echo chamber is basically uncontroversial. Constantly facing pushback removes the thin illusion that extremist viewpoints are broadly acceptable.
* Taking an intellectually honest approach is a good way to win people over. Not everyone on the alt right is a raging sociopath. There are people that can be moved to feel empathy if you humanize yourself and make good faith arguments.
* Mocking them can just backfire just as hard if not harder. This is especially true if you back your mockery with really bad arguments. EG: Logical fallacies and "current year" arguments. Using these tactics can make the audience feel like the left isn't on their side and never will be no matter what. If you think won't be accepted by the group you defect to, it's a lot less likely that you'll defect.

Do you have any feedback to that?

EDIT: Could you explain how you “mock”?Go for it!&gt;  in dealing with Ancaps you'll get them to say things like "social darwinism" to which you'll reply "so genocide is good as long as it's economically based, that's cool." It's kind of unique to each situation you run into, wherein the point is for you to lift the veil of what people are saying from 'theory' to 'actual'.

That's actually a pretty clever way to go about making people reveal how extreme they actually are. My approach is to try to remain on people's good side unless they are just completely vitriolic toward me. The way I'd phrase that is "so genocide is good as long as it's economically based?". I'd leave out the "that's cool" part to avoid mocking the person. I don't see the point of mockery even when you're end "friendly" territory when (it appears that) one can accomplish the same thing without it. Maybe I'm missing an important point ...

I am a statistician / software developer hybrid by trade, so there's no reason I can't invest some time into reading commonly cited studies and finding the flaws in them.

Given that they've been saying that Sicilians aren't white for years, I might be off base. However, I would argue that there is an effective way to use this information.

If you cast doubt upon someone's whiteness, you cast doubt upon whether he or she will be accepted by the alt-right. If someone is convinced that he won't be accepted by the alt-right, he is less likely to identify with the movement.

It seems like the general feeling on /pol among the already ***severely*** radicalized is that arguments about *x* nationality not being white are the work of the JIDF (Jewish Internet Defense Force). The idea is that the JIDF uses these arguments as a "divide and conquer" technique.  Setting how aside how ungodly stupid all of this is, it is telling that most radicalized members are wary of infiltrators using this approach. My guess is that, deep down, they know a lot of young men come to the alt-right in search of a sense of identity. Deconstructing and blurring the boundaries of that identity compromises their ability to radicalize more people.Thanks a bunch for that example! I actually referenced that study before without actually reading it carefully.

Now I know I better.Thanks for the kind words!

I definitely acknowledge the alt right for what they are at this point. I'm not sure whether or not my views will shift further left in the future. I am sure of this: Wherever I land, I want my priorities to primarily stem from empathy and respect rather than anger and fear. 

I'm actually having a pretty good conversation with the person that was critical of me (which you can see). The people on this thread have, in general, been very nice to me.Do you think if the alt-right were pushed on defining just what white people were that'd help fracture them? Richard Spencer's response of "you know one when you see one" is something that I feel people could attack pretty easily for being non-rigorous Destiny recently said in a video that you should consider what it would take to convince you that your deeply held beliefs were wrong.

I think its superb advice about thinking rationallyIn a word, yes. 

Here is a portion of another comment I posted on this thread.

Spainards, Greeks, and Italians (especially Southern Italians) are all groups that could be considered not "purely" white. 

You could also try to exploit eye color distributions across Europe.

http://i.imgur.com/riJLc2O.pngNot surprised they picked up on this post.Thank you (and everyone on this thread) for being so nice to me. I honestly expected a harsher reception.Is this the study you're citing?

http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2012-03-02-chimps-show-much-greater-genetic-diversity-humans

&gt; Headline: Groups of chimpanzees within central Africa are more different genetically than humans living on different continents, an Oxford University-led study has found.&gt; when someone takes for example crime statistics or IQ tests to try and make some sort of point hinting at the superiority of one population group over another they are disingeniously abusing statistics to try and support preconceptions that any honest interpretation of these figures cannot support.

&gt; It is dishonest to point at IQ tests and to ignore that a clearly recognisable cultural bias exists in them which will unfairly disadvantage someone who has not grown up in a certain cultural and educational background.

Even if you think racial IQ gaps between groups are mostly genetic (and i'm not convinced they are), the appropriate response to that isn't to assert your superiority over the lower IQ group and push for them to be deported.


With that stated, I dug up a study (which, FYI, I have only skimmed).

Just looking at the numbers in the image of the table I posted from the latest 1992 study suggest that the IQ gap is not as large as folks on the alt-right say it is to begin with. When you account for black children adopted by white families it looks like the IQ gap shrinks to practically nothing (assuming I'm interpreting that table correctly ... again I just skimmed this).


&gt; Genetics just does not play any role in impact on society. It's statistically impossible. We are all the same race and clear delineations between population groups are a racist pipedream with no actual root in reality.

There isn't any clear delineation between groups, but you can populations into genetic clusters that *roughly* correspond to racial categories. It seem inaccurate to say that we're all the same race. I think you can make an argument that race isn't terribly meaningful outside of its cultural context.


EDIT: Do keep in mind, I did just skim this study. A lot of alt-righters cite (what I think are) older transracial adoption studies to back up their view. I’m not sure if they generally know of the 1992 study. I didn’t know about it until I googled.I wish I could upvote this comment 10 times.

I completely agree with you when it comes to your approach. Lying to people is ultimately self defeating. A lot of the folks on the alt right are angry because they feel they have been lied to. Lying only reinforces that bias.

We could start a Discord or a Subreddit.&gt; Race (not self-reported but based on ancestry) being a construct does NOT delegitimize it as a tool in population genetics. 

I think this is a true statement. Different racial groups have different propensities for different diseases, medical problems, and have different average heights. In that regard, the social construct of race is not (in of itself) bad. It can, on occasion, be useful. It's just overused and misused.

If we still had "race" as a concept to describe genetic clusters, but did not attach so much cultural significance to it, I think that would be fine.I'll give it a watch when I have some extra time.Slightly off topic: I have a big soft spot for religious right wingers that actually practice the compassion they preach. My mom and dad are like that. (Dad is a Christian convert).Looks like I did not interpret the table correctly. 

QUOTE:
&gt; Table 1 gives a list in publication-year order, where samples of adoptees with two Black genetic parents each are labelled “Black–Black” and samples of adoptees with one White and one Black genetic parent each are labelled “Black–White”.

EDIT: There's more here to read though.

&gt; Mapping the verbal gains to VIQ and the performance gains to PIQ and deducting both from the adoptees’ means reduces the adoptees’ mean VIQ to 99 and their mean PIQ to 100–103. Adjusting properly for the Flynn effect, then, the Frydman and Lynn adoptees scored on par with Belgian children. When one recalls that adoption should have raised the adoptees’ IQs above the general population’s average, this outcome is surprising; it suggests that Frydman and Lynn’s subjects would have scored below comparable White adoptees in Belgian homes.Whatever you think about this alignment graph, OP (mutual_ayyde) wasn't wrong. Tons of potential! This generated some good posts.Here's the archived version. Eventually, the 4chan link will go "404".

The amateur photographer in me is like "ugh" but the fan girl in me is like "yay! awesome people are being awesome togetherThe answer isn't in there, which is why I made this post. Those are gels. I've seen Contra use a remote / an app on her phone to change the lighting on stream, which proves that she isn't using primarily gels to colour her videos.She could just be running to expose others to her ideas like Larry Lessig did in the Democratic primaries. We should give her some time before we write her off as another Assange. This was excellent. I'm so glad Contra decided to go ahead and do this.It was a good question and you articulated it well despite being nervous.In general no, I don't think they see the hypocrisy here. If they see it, they just don't care.

To be fair, I don't think that making over generalized digs at white people is a good idea from a moral or tactical perspective. It puts people on the defensive and there are plenty of good white people that don't deserve to be lumped in with assholes. Hell, i'm (((mostly))) white lol.

However, there are definitely people preach a reversed version of political correctness. For instance, saying that the legacy of apartheid played a part in the current situation in South Africa will often result in you being accused on being "anti-white" on alt-right and alt-lite forums. The same person that accuses you of being anti-white will often go on to say horrible things about black people. EG: They're biologically incapable of maintaining a civilized society.

It's pretty maddening.https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/81f49p/socialism_always_leads_to_genocide/dv2vi23/

My comment is downvoted so hard you can't see it without expanding it. Takeway: You're correct that this perception is pretty pervasive. I think people think shes some kind of feeble minded child who needs to be shown the way and not like an adult.The mods are fucking incompetent and lazy. I got banned from their discord for claiming I was a former mod.

Maybe contra needs to add "The Left: part 2" to the list...There are literal nazis out there and the people insist on getting hung up over a transwoman using the term "trap" ironically?

If the people criticizing Natalie had done even half of positive things she did, I would be more inclined to take them seriously. Ex-shitlord here.

I watched. I changed my mind partially due to Natalie's arguments.Wouldn't the proper response here be to make sure that black folks aren't shamed for having dreads rather than prohibiting white people from having them?

I agree that there is a basic unfairness to this, but I prefer to remedy unfair situations by ensuring that the victims of the unfairness are no longer victimized rather than imposing the problem onto another group.

EG: You shouldn't shame men for having sex as a reaction women getting slut-shamed. You just shouldn't shame the women.I was actually a bit transphobic when I started watching Contrapoints. People can change their minds. Especially when they're forced to humanize the object(s) of their derision.Cis mostly straight male on my end. I'm white ... or a little over half white in nazi terms. (Partial Jewish ancestry)The twitter page has been deleted. Could someone link me to some place or something where the information in question is still up pls?Uhm considering your definition of "asshole" you'd probably like Blair White as a "nice" person right? So why don't you stick to her...O.o Hm... 

I'm sure there are trans people with all kinds of political agendas. I'd say that as a woman, a transgender person and some other societal groups defined by shared interest, it makes sense to be left-leaning, and I interpret the fact that trans people are mostly left-leaning as a consequence of that fact, but as I said, I'm sure there is another trans person with similar ideas to yours.We could have a survey on this sub. Maybe it's not perfectly representative of Nat's audience, but it'd still be interesting and maybe give us an idea.Thanks!

I hope she doesn't change her plans though. It's really startling to me how many people seem to have trouble understanding irony, sarcasm, irony and the like. Everyone who's seen contra's videos should know that she's deliberately provocative. And if you havn't seen any of her videos, don't criticize her like that...Thank you for bringing this into my lifeThat was short 😔https://patriot-fire.net/2013/12/31/inverting-the-us-flag-what-does-it-mean/

Inverting a flag was historically used to indicate immediate danger or distress in times of war.

Nazis have a history of misusing this to their own ends. That said, I haven’t seen an inverted flag on fascist forums recently.The final video has no audio skips.And superchat during live streams!Doesn't Nat constantly talk about how she receives a bunch of emails from reformed reactionaries?

I think I also shot her a message via FB once but that was back when she had a much smaller audience"Only the best goddamn channel in the whole world!"

I would call it a political channel, because while Natalie does use philosophical thinking, the things she's talking about aren't philosophy per se. Definitely not philosophy. I'd say some politics, some "societal issues". Like, you could say, whether or not bullying fat people is okay is a political issue, but that seems a bit overhauled. I'd just say it's a "controversy within society or so". 

The current two most upvoted comments do offer pretty good descriptions I think.This is absolutely a technique they use. The problem is a significant percentage of the people you argue with will be arguing sincerely.

It's kind of like a dog whistle. Someone can be genuinely concerned about "preserving western culture" and not be intentionally racist. 

The reason dog whistles ... and this technique ... work is that it's difficult to separate fascists from non racist conservatives.

So how do you deal with this situation?

In general, the best approach is the frame your arguments in terms of sympathy for the group you're defending without making broad generalizations about other more privileged groups.

EG: Saying "white people are scum" is a bad idea (and also wrong). Saying that "ethnic minorities experience unfair circumstances" is not an attack on anyone else (and also true).

This example is an easy case. It get's more difficult when you're dealing with the sort of disgust responses that LGBT people often face. Someone could easily use this technique on a person arguing that trans people should be allowed to use the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity. I don't know exactly how to refute it in that case and am very open to suggestions.Everyone keep both eyes on their elections! The Russians are coming tomorrow!I see a little. I got ur back lol.It's wild right? I mean it's only a short jump from pwned feminists to ethnostates and court cases with certain exotic men :pRight! I came over with that raft of atheists, Richard Dawkins was my hero etc. My friends still argue with me about that jontron stream and claim he was ambushed....but naturally they haven't watched the stream, just heard that. But it's like contra is actually a smart person, with an education! I know phil has distanced himself from the anti crowd now and that he's smart in his own siloed way. Embarrassingly enough i was also subscribed to BlaireI was going for yugioh, bakuras fave card from season 1. I haven't played persona 5 but my younger bro loves it, really makes me regret buying an xbone over a ps4 I think part of the problem is that she's being descriptive, not perscriptive. The annals of leftist thought on economics are the sorta thing you could spend a lifetime reading up on and debating. Any argument she makes will alienate and annoy one part of her audience:

* social democracy - the radicals will get pissed off
* market socialism - marxists will cry for her blood
* planned economy - will be seen as authoritarian and overly prescriptive
* localized bookchinite direct democracy - meetings are boring and it restricts individual freedom

I'd stick to just critiquing IHMOIf you want people to know that you know, removing this post works against that goal.c u l t u r a l _  m a r x I s m

Petition to rename this thread to "Not-Her-Points"!Don't worry, we'll be perfectly welcome to vegan anarchocommunists plotting to destroy western civilisation such as yourself as long as you're friendly and like the right pop culture.

Seriously though thanks for putting your name forward, I'll note you down and contact you should this thing go ahead.

I feel this sort of thing might be easier to create from the ground up than hijacking a sub you yourself have created for my own purposes (the description of your sub especially paints a very different picture than what I'd want to do with it).That's okay, thank you for the encouragement. There is a place in the world for memeing and (non-nasty) gossip though so best of luck for your sub too!The election was rigged in favor of #2... Still a great photo but #1 is #1.I know this is meant as a compliment but adding on "As a straight guy" is kinda problematic as it comes with the implication that trans women aren't women. This is why we need "Are Tr@ps Gay" video ASAP!The future is more complicated. One result of the trans movement is that the focus of attention in terms of gender has moved away from physical characteristics to identification. This applies to cis men and women as well. So as a GNC person you may be more likely to be misgendered initially. 

Part of that is just the symptom of a socially liberal and therefore socially complicated and diverse society. 

Right now people are learning to accept transgender individual's identity. In order for people to learn that gender expression doesn't have to be so rigid, GNC people have to do publicity work on their own.

As a person who leans towards "GNC" presentation I'd really welcome it if there was more awareness and undersanding of GNC in society, I'd be more open to present like I really want to.That's interesting. Why?gender non conformingOh I get it. I'm a cis woman and I feel envious of people who are naturally more feminine than me. It kinda freaks you out when other people put in less effort and still look better. -.-Thanks for your perspective, but I meant that by saying that adding the quantifier it indirectly "others" trans women. The language is problematic not the sentiment behind the language, and I think that just saying "Natalie is my dream girl" avoids that. But I will differ to your take on the issue because being a cis woman Im blind to some sides of this issue.Disclaimer: I didn't address everything you wrote. I have some work to do that I have been putting off, but if there is something you really want me address, just ask. When I find time, I'll oblige.

Here goes:

&gt; You say the reason for this is external factors. But why do those external factors exist? You can't remove the variable of race from this equation if you want the truth, even if it makes you uncomfortable.

I'm not removing the variable of race from consideration. What I'm doing is taking a closer look at why race correlates with life outcomes. Suppose you're trying to model traffic levels. You see that on weekdays, the average amount of traffic is higher, so you use "is it a weekday?" as an explanatory variable. Rush hour only occurs on weekdays, so this explains why "is it a weekday?" is informative. A more effective way of modeling traffic would be to ask would be to ask "is it rush hour?"

When it comes to the issue of race, we can take a similar approach and discover that the truth is more complex than racist narratives suggest.

1.) The IQ Gap between black and white people is decreasing. This suggests that a strong environmental component is present.

2.) This decrease in the black / white IQ gap corresponds to a decrease in blood lead levels in black children. A causal relationship *may* exist here.

3.) The gap in college graduation rates among black folks is almost entirely explained by men. Which is to say, black women graduate college at similar levels to white women. Black men are the ones that lag behind. This makes no sense from a hereditarian perspective because men and women have similar overall IQs.

When it comes to the Jews, you pretty much can remove the variable of race because they damn near overlap with Sicilians in a genetic cluster map. The average Italian is closer to a Jew than she is a Brit.

&gt; Yes, it is a paranoid victim mentality, but surely you understand why? It is a sociological fact that in-groups will favor those of their in-groups rather than out-groups. 

&gt; Race is the physical prerequisite of the sharing that defines the polis, an aspect that can't exist independently without the other shared traits, ideals, and values of the citizens of the race. In other words, it's all one package, and not based solely on the color of skin. If this is confusing, reread this until it clicks - you'll know when it does.

Sure, but what defines "in-group"? Conservative Jews often do have a strong in-group preference. Based on that genetic cluster map you would think that Sicilians and Greeks would get included in the "in-group". They're not. Why could this be? It's almost like culture and race aren't the same thing.

I'm not saying that people don't try to divide themselves on the basis of race. Clearly they do. What I'm saying is that race is not a "pre-requisite" to achieving "polis". I also think it's undesirable to use race to define you "in-groups" and "out-groups" because race is a trait that nobody chooses and has little to do with your moral values once you consider all of the hidden variables within race.

Side Note: Your average American Jew isn't that insular btw. American Jews marry non Jews 58% of the time. The more insular Jews are the minority. At least in the western world.

&gt; So what exactly was pushing you to right-wing "extremism?" Did you actually do any of your own research, any of your own reading of political philosophy? 

No, not really. Some friends were getting into it and I "tagged along" so to speak. I was never really comfortable with the idea of rejecting someone solely on his race. Once I realized that this is what the alt right was pushing for, I got the fuck out of dodge. 

Also, a small minority of leftists are giant assholes. I encountered those assholes. My reaction to them being giant assholes was to basically ... to become a giant asshole. I'm not proud of that.I know it sounds like /r/the_donald but YouTubeLeft and LeftYouTube sound like they'd become punchlines to our online enemies too easily.

Remember what happened to Pepe when the Alt Right got him? Let's not turn Nat into a registered hate symbol!Is this the return of the professor or a new character 🤔It’s on Jordan Peterson, not “traps”. I’m a patron, so I saw the preview.Right, I had my characters mixed up, I was thinking of the scientist (purple wig) and mixing them up with Lady Foppington. I need to do a marathon of the Contra cinematic universe to set everything straight.Contra would destroy Destiny in a debate!Yeah I watched it last night and it was great! (I’m a patron)

I’m saying this as someone that’s a bit of a Peterson apologist.I'm curious of how the like/dislike ratio and youtube comments will develop. Dislikes are actually counted the same as likes in terms of viewer engagement on YouTube so it won't hurt her. It actually might help her if she riles enough people up!I can see the Terfs complaining already that when Nat sexualizes herself/her characters she is performing a satire of femininity and attacking women everywhere. 🙄Because it takes a certain mindset/knowledge base going into the video in order to get to that conclusion. I find that in order to properly reach the widest audience that it is important your content works on multiple levels so that an audience with even a cursory understanding of a topic can get something from it while leaving room for them to discover/learn more on a rewatch with more context.That's where dog whistles come in. A statement like "black people aren't doing as well because they don't work as hard as others" comes off abrasive but not offensive to a centrist. With greater exposure to the idealogy this becomes "blacks are lazy", which then with full exposure and understanding of the ideas becomes "blacks are inferior".Awsome, contra is back on her game!Well if the JP fanboys on Reddit decide to brigade that may still happen. But on the other hand, it'd make them look bad if her video was obviously brigaded. Like one of the top comments when I watched it was some hypocritical "I'm a JP fan but I think your video is one of the best critiques of him". Which seems ingenuine to me, if you really understand her video, she's basically saying that JP is missing the most basic understanding of philosophical terms and has a childish world view. Saying she is a "good critique would be kind of missing the point here and demonstrate some real tone blindness. Right wingers are incredibly cunning and insincere when it comes to keeping up appeareances.Interesting he reacted at all. I think if I was him, I'd not react to a Youtuber making a polemic video about me. By reacting to someone, you give them credibility.

In the face of the blatant bullshit Peterson spouts, just yesterday I've found myself wondering if Peterson is sincere and really just a complete idiot who doesn't realize the bullshit that comes out of his mouth. Or if he's really that cunning and insincere and fully aware that his ideas are contradictory and illogical, but doesn't care as long as he can push a certain agenda.&gt;  I'm pretty sure if Peterson really wanted to he could spout some garbage and jargon and all he and his fans will believe he addressed her criticisms.

Same. It seems like the best response JP could give would either be to remain silent or do the above. That he answered the way he did seems weird. Maybe he's indignated. I imagine for a stuck up guy like him what Contra did was super provocative.I fell asleep anything happen?Well I encourage you to make it. The more of this kind of stuff the better. To a certain degree I've seen it do well, look at [this PJW clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXvRFDiFoWo) that's been floating around since not long after hbomberguy wrecked him.I was thinking about making a compilation of Blair White letting bigots walk all over her (especially her comments section) but it might be too large of an undertaking!Sorry for the accidental timecoding by the way.I fell asleep just after someone donated 420.69$ which was maybe 30 minutes in? I just remembered that the stream title changed to something with "vore stream" in the title so it might have been another Lindsay stream.Yeah, but this is war dammit!Great article! Natalie is most definitly a national treasure. Smart AF and brave as hellThis is too good to be true...We put it to a poll on this sub so it’s at least a reference ContraPoints fans understand.I thought that it was worth at least investigating until the "broke into my account thing". 

For a claim such as that proof can be easily given so if it's true they should cough up the time and date this unauthorized account access occurred. 

In addition if their information has been leaked in a large data breach then a website like haveIBeenPwned will show which websites have been affected and then they could possibly claim that they use that Same password for Twitter and Natalie then bought it from the hackers. Otherwise we are to assume she did it herself which is ridiculous!

The lack of evidence combined with their shit stirring on other posts and the amount of effort it would take to hack into that account makes me seriously consider the possibility that this is a Russian troll attempting to cause conflict on the left. Notice how they only criticize those claiming to be liberal 🤔I consider these sites to be more like forums than platforms. A platform is like a soap box you stand on ft o shout your message. Nobody has a right to stand on my soap box and I dont need to give any right wing nutjobs the opportunity to do so with my platform. A forum is where people can go to express their ideas. If a right winger wants to not be drown out by the crowd then they need to procire their own soap box.

Who doesn't?This guy has an obnoxious voice and completely misses the point of most arguments Contra makes, don't bother watching unless you want to have fun debunking obviously dumb shit. &gt; **What do you think your responsibilities would be if you were friends with someone who had an alt\-right friend?** 

I don't think that would be a possibility.

&gt; **What if one of your own friends started going down the white nationalist route?** 

I would kiss her goodbye.What about gun ownership and race. It seems like white people are allowed to conceal carry but when a black or Latino person does they end up like Philando Castile!You've split the party!Not yet, but relating to a lot of Contra's experiences has sent me into another spiral of questioning my gender soooo...You're being downvoted, but yours is the only correct answer. It's infinitely more laborous to disprove a complete idiot as compared to someone who has good arguments.&gt; They are all different species, not a spectrum.

You missed the whole point that Contra (or Dawkins, for that matter) was trying to make. Sure, you can divide them into species, but that still wouldn't change the fact that there is little difference between the parent and the offspring. Suppose you divide the first hundred generations into species A, and the next hundred into species B, you will have categorised them into two separate species, yes. But the difference between them would still remain fuzzy, since the difference between the hundredth creature of species A, and the first creature of species B would be so minor, it would be negligible. 

&gt; Intersex people are an exception to the norm.

And what is the norm? Gender binary. So basically you're trying to prove gender binary exists, by taking gender binary as the basis. The reasoning goes -- 

sex is binary because chromosomes -- chromosomes other than XX and XY exists -- they are not to be considered because gender is binary. Circular reasoning.

I can make the same claim that eye colour is binary, and there are only two eye colours -- brown and black (they constitute more than 90%). Well, green and blue also exist, but they are an exception to the norm.

And until part 0, he's just confounding gender with sex. She doesn't even start to talk about gender until part 1. Also, she doesn't use intersex as proof that gender isn't binary, rather proof that sex isn't binary.

&gt; ...neuroscience...

So how, by neuroscience, would you explain the great differences between masculinity and feminine gender roles in various cultures? Do brain structures of people of various culture differ from each other or something?

I don't know, I must be missing some huge points that he's made, because from what it seems now, these are so easily refutable and destructible, I don't think he'd say that he's smarter and better at making points when all of his points are SO weak. I must be missing something, so someone...please enlighten me.

EDIT: Another argument about intersex people could be that they're "defective". In the sense, they cannot perform the function which sex is supposed to perform, i.e., reproduction, thus could be considered outside the norm, or an exception to the rule. But 1) some intersex people can reproduce 2) some sex binary people cannot reproduce. There are impotent men and infertile women, and they're still a part of the sex binary. 



Exactly. I remember how frustrated I used to get when I studied biological taxonomy. It wasn't as well-structured and systematic as I thought it would be.I'd like to hear her thoughts, though I'm sure she would be pretty ambivalent about individuals choosing to do such things. It certainly is a blessing that we can cam instead of be on the street! I'm certainly planning on camming, but I've always been sort of an exhibitionist, so I enjoy it. I came across her *Gender Dysphoria* video during the time when I was really coming to terms with a lifetime of gender dysphoria, and it was incredibly powerful to me. I cried a lot and then watched all the rest of her videos!Yeah, seeing a trans woman who is cool and self\-aware and intelligent is fantastic! Not there's anything wrong with trans makeup gurus and beauty queens, but it's good to see a wide range of women representedInteresting... I wish I could have been a fan back when the channel was just starting.Her fiance is an anarchist so she's probably familiarI had a dream where I was intimate with her a week ago. We took a bath and then smoked a cigarette on a patio. Very pleasant eveningHis arguments were very weak (if I got 'em right) and so easily destructible. He either completely missed Contra's points (pun unintended) on spectrum of rabbit-ness and Platonic essentialism, or intentionally misrepresented them. 

Anyway, I agree we shouldn't downvote legit and valuable criticism. I don't want fanbase of Contrapoints to resemble that of Jordan Peterson. Please don't guys, it's not healthy for the free marketplace of ideas.Neither contra's video was serious, consequentially nor was AA's critique. Two of his prominent critiques were \-\- people were okay with binary genders for ages, and accepted that. First of all, this is bandwagon fallacy \-\- just because something was accepted for a long part of history does not make it true. Secondly, there were a lot of civilisations and cultures which accepted non binary genders. 

Second was, how he takes the concept of "binary". Binary means two strictly defined oppositions. If we talk about something like a tall/short, that wouldn't exactly be considered a binary in strictly essentialist terms. Well that's Peterson's problem by using history as some blanket excuse to make his truth sound superior. "Mine's better cause it's older!"Oh right, sorry I forgot about that bullshit. All I remembered was that this video was the best summation of Petersonian truth I'd seen. Apologies for the 'la skeptic' bullshit portion of it.Adam Ruins Jordan Peterson anyone?Well a lot of people don't realise what a fraud and a pseud Peterson is, and he's crazy popular right now, so I think it might be justified.Well in my armchair philosophy understanding, post modernism takes a critical distance to all "grand tales". That can include understanding those "grand tales" as tools which can be helpful for understanding the world in certain contexts, but not others.

Before postmodernism, people were the slaves of ideologies (speaking a bit melodramatically here). 

Now it's the other way round: the inidividual is the subject which emloys different heuristics depending on what fits the context best.

For example, as a left-wing liberal I think that many of Marx's thoughts are still relevant today, but not in all contexts and all the time. I take different sources of informaton and different opinions as useful information, but I don't believe that there's the possibility to find one "true" ideology which explains all the woes and pleasures of life. 

tl,dr You could be postmodernist and a marxist in that you can agree with some of Marx's talking point, or think his talking points are somewhat relevant/have some value etc. while still remaining critical distance (postmodernist). It's not techniqually "pomo" but I could see how someone from aforementioned opinion could see themselves as both marxist and postmodern.This should shut down a lot of criticism of her as there is a distinction between the actions and opinions of Contra and those of Natalie. 

This is something few content creators have but many use as a shield when they say or do anything controversial so it's good that she is preemptively separating the two.Besides the mega thread, I recommend you sub to r/Breadtube and r/Leftytube I'm so fucking ready for Contra to blow up in the political YouTube sphere. The left needs a good figure willing to hop on podcasts and debate shows.No... We're *red* pilling everyone. The Red Pill means finding out the harsh reality while the Blue Pill is choosing to live in a comfortable lie. They're living in the comfortable lie, not us.

 Don't fall into their traps and define yourself as the opposite of whatever they tell you they are, don't let them define you.

Alternatively you can just say "Woke", that's the same thing but it's what lefties say.It's not even about me, really. By saying "blue pilling" you are presenting your side as the anti-intellectual. That's why they harp on the word "red pilling" and "skeptic". it signals that the other side is the one denying reality and gullible. 

It would be like pro-choice activists calling themselves pro-death.

That's why is important not to allow them to define their opposition, us, because they won't be charitable at all. The latest video on BaltimoreThat article was excellent. I hope it gets passed around more because it shows the utter lack of a strategy against the rise of right-wing ding dongs. The porn metaphor was straight fire. 

&gt;while the left pushes even harder to "de-platform" hate speech. But all I can ask is ... do you think this is how the indoctrination happens? A boring old fart droning at 50 people on a college campus?

&gt;That's like a mother in 2018 boasting that her 17-year-old son has never seen porn.

&gt;"He hasn't?"

&gt;"Oh no, he tried to go to an adult movie theater once, but I took his car keys."

&gt;"But what about his computer? Or phone?"

&gt;"Phone? Can you call pornography now?"

I get so mad because the left is right about most things but many keep portraying themselves as anti-intellectuals doing this stupid thing. It allows for morons to look good by simply "daring" to say their opinions. Makes them look dangerous to the status quo they're actually reinforcing. Oh God yes. One of the best criticisms Natalie has thrown at the Left is in her video defending Milo Stewart where Milo at 17 strings a bunch of buzzwords together and she, an actual philosophy Ph.D. dropout, says "I don't even know what that means.'' I would say though, it seems like a massive goal shift, and a rationalization to make the nonsensical ''Postmodern NeoMarxist'' sound smart. But hopefully, Natalie can answer to it better than I can.It's ironic because if you go back to the classical liberals complaining about the monarchy they also have class analysisIt's kinda insulting to say being a massive narc makes you gay too tbh. :P&gt; The only way this guy could have gotten his PhD is if his advisor was a kitchen appliance

Lol

Well this guy tears open his mouth like the all consuming opening to abyss about every topic he likes to. For starters, he studied psychology, not philosophy, but he has no inhibitions talking about philosophy as though he had any clue about the topic.

And as a psych student, I feel really ashamed of being represented by this person. Hopefully he won't have too much of a bad impact on the reputation of psychology.Man. Reading all these stories of trans folks having their sexual interest turned through hormones makes me want to know if there's any substantial biological mechanism behind this... like, can someone please study this?? O.OLol I like how you felt the need to stress the point you're not a fan of his. :)

&gt;Dude can barely make a point, idk how he's respected.

This is why I don't watch these kind of Youtube people. ._. At first it's funny but then you start to ruminate in what a world we're living that this person can be succesful and respected by a sizable amount of people. 

&gt;that may have just been me assuming the way he talked about admiration and masculinity of people who weren't him 

I think there's a funny contradiction in our society in that vanity is seen as a female trait (and thus also a queer man's trait) but at the same time, many straight men are super vane and "into" themselves. At the same time the latter are often the ones totally unreflected about themselves, thus being super exasperated when you point out their self-love.

Although, it could be a possibility he's gay. I mean he wouldn't be the first conservative crowd guy surprisingly coming out as guy at some point. I don't know his stance on homosexuality, but could imagine he's not super LGBT supportive at this point.If this bot was a person, I'd **kill** them at this point. -.-I’d give it a watch. It’s a good interview.These appeals to nature aren't even bad from an ethical perspective, they also ignore the sheer diversity of nature and the various strategies species have when it comes to reproducing

I wrote a lil something on this

[https://mutualism.net/social\-conservatism\-and\-naturalistic/](https://mutualism.net/social-conservatism-and-naturalistic/)Screw them. Directing that kind of vitriol at a suicidal person is evil.1.) Alpha males in terms of pure fun.

2.) Decrypting the alt Right is the best in terms of substantive political content.

Honorable Mentions:

3.) “Violence” is under rated 

4.) So is Baltimore: Anatomy of an UprisingI prefer the original. Imo it works better because it uses the life of Freddie Grey alongside the data to prove its point. It manages to have both emotional and intellectual punch.

The new one isn’t bad though.The cultural appropriation horse definitely hasn't been beaten enough by the edgelords.Autogynephilia.I am a trans person who has attempted suicide (spent 5 days in a mental hospital) and i can't imagine dealing with the hatred Chelsea gets for her political stuff as well as just the general bullshit trans people get. 

I hope she is able to get help, but the mental healthcare system in the US is fucked, especially for trans people. The Peterson one, since I think as a male, he may be the single worst figure for where we go from here on the heels of things like times up, me too, etc.This AMA was so funny. He double downed on the "no true atheists" shit. It was the most hilarious thing.My favorite video to introduce people to her work is "Why the Alt\-Right is Wrong" precisely because it does show that evolution in a single video. But if I'm showing her work to people who aren't already fully on board with the SJW movement, I'd probably start with some of her other stuff like "For whom the Bell Trolls" or "Pick\-up Artists"&gt; But I can't imagine how tough it must be to have to maintain videos that cause her so much dysphoria.

That's what I think is the crux of it. Personally, I don't think I would have connected with Contra's content nearly as much without the initial context of her early videos but now that I have become a fan, I would never want those videos to be kept up at the cost of intense personal dysphoria and pain. But if those videos are taken down maybe fewer people like me would have connected with the content. It's a dilemma. But ultimately, it is of course Nat's choice and I don't have any problem with that.When it comes to Nat’s old videos, you have to understand what transition is like. She started a couple months before me on hormones, I’m 7 months in. I’m hitting a point where I see where she was at a few months ago, where the people we were are almost actors, they aren’t even who we are. Seeing our old selves is pain, and hurt, and grief, and sadness. If she’s like me in this regard, there is an element of hate at times when you see the person you were. She expressed in her reviews of her early videos that its extremely hard to watch her old self put on makeup and dresses and get drunk on camera making these videos. I look at my photos from before as I bent gender expression while still proclaiming to be a cis male. 

On this point, no matter the brilliance of her work, we should respect what she needs to put a painful past behind her and support her as she continues to grow and bloom.

You bring up a good point about her videos helping welcome people and show a path through introduction and then embracing SJW and LGBTQIA+ identities, and that has been so valuable to me. But no LGBTQIA+ person is born having to be an inspiration to anyone. If she needs to not have her old work out there so that she can find peace, we need to respect that.I find the first couple of Contra vids up until "Alpha Males" to be a bit lacking in presentation but this may be because I watched them After the Genderqueer video (my first one). Content wise Natalie has always been on point so she has no reason to worry but I understand if she eventually takes them down due to disphoria. 

I'm obviously not in a position to ask for this but I think it would be good for her if she's uncomfortable with them to remake them similarly to how she did the Baltimore video. Maybe call them Contrapoints remastered? There are also some pre Contrapoints videos with some ideas I'd like to see explored like her determinism video but I understand if that is outside of the current scope of the channel.Thank you for sharing your experience. I whole-heartedly agree with that assessment. In the end, these are her videos and her experiences. Regardless of how educational or how useful those videos are to other people, I would never want them to be up if they cause her pain. That isn't her cross to bear and it would be unfair to demand that of her. I just wanted to relay my experience engaging with her content and how those videos helped me in becoming more understanding of non-traditional identities.Right. In terms of content, I think her old videos are more outside the community looking in. That itself lends to being more relatable to similarly external viewers who do no quite understand the LGBTQIA+ sphere. Her new videos, while masterfully done and I love them to death, are developed from a perspective of an insider and has a quality that can be perceived as otherness by outside onlookers. I was just pointing out this difference seems to serve a purpose, and maybe that is even a conscious choice on her part.My good friend Derrida...I think there's good stuff in Natalie's early vids, but she definitely needed a minute to develop the Contra voice. She said some of the early stuff was done by turning on the camera, drinking and ranting because she just didn't have the time to devote to making videos that she does now.

I think you see her learning what works and what doesn't. "Ranting in front of the book case so you're subconsciously reminded how smart I am"-Contra is definitely the deeper tracks, but there's good stuff there.Man, this video was deep and personal. I feel she really hit the ball out of the park with this oneHoly shit this takes a dark turn

Edit: I usually watch a new video a few times when Natalie first puts it out, but I just went to replay it and I was like, "Nah, I'm not ready for that again yet"This is the most empathetic I've seen Contrapoints be towards Blaire White, though I fear she might not see it that way. She also levered some criticism towards Riley Dennis, as a bit of a poor communicator, that frequently plays on the hands of the Jackie's of the world that just want ''cringe''. Wait we need a timeline of the CCU (Contra Cinematic universe)! If all of the characters are roommates how do they not know that Tabby and Adria are dating? And in Tiffany's original appearance she was a Neo Liberal but here she is right leaning. This video has to be a prequel for this to make sense.

Also Natalie did a great job at including are traps gay without making it the focal point of the video.God... Tiffany’s breakdown. Not the feels but the insecurities, the fear, the self-loathing... I wanted to give her a hug. I know that pain. To make someone so despicable, and honestly similar to actual people on YouTube, seem so in pain with the same pain I feel...

This was masterfully done.A live look in on my brain just before I hatched, desperately trying to reject who I am.In this video we are shown two unproductive approaches to trans activism in a hostile space, which naturally asks the audience to imagine what the productive approach to trans activism in that space would be. 

We are also shown what Natalie imagines the psychology of a Tiffany Tumble-type to be, and how unproductive Aria's engagement with Tiffany is. Now that we better understand Tiffany, what do we think is the productive way of engaging with Tiffany types (or trans people who find Tiffany's attitudes appealing)?Uhhhhh... my testicle shrinkage is **definitely** dramatic and noticeable. I thought that was a common experience for many :(What video did Tiffany first appear in?I love her old videos, the plain jokes, not-so-perfect editing, sarcasm and sometimes not completely politically correct jokes. 

The reason I can enjoy her non-pc jokes is that she distances herself from implications which could be deducted from those jokes. 

I remember when contra said in one of her videos, "sometimes i think 'this is pc bullshit!' I do have 'right wing' feelings too." And the reason I like this is 1) it basically says that the line between good and evil goes through man's heart 2) it takes away pressure/I do have bigoted thoughts myself sometimes it feels relieving seeing others admit to it 3) non-pc jokes are funny in two ways... you laugh about the content of the joke, and then you also laugh at yourself bc you're aware you have similar thoughts some time too.I think just like how a lot of trans folk are far left because capitalism is considerably more alienating for them, a lot of them also forego traditional relationship structures because they're outside conventional society. Nat is poking fun at this subculture she's had experience withI used to not be able to tuck, now they remain half-tucked without trying. It’s definitely an improvement.Most of us after 3-6 months don’t really produce anything at all during orgasm as far as I’ve found and experienced myself.I think that perhaps this piece started in her original drafts when she announced it as a different piece but over the last 2 AMA streams for her patrons she has mentioned a very real desire to return to character pieces and some artistic pieces. I think she was feeling creatively trapped in just explaining different things.

People can draw many conclusions here, I think one of the most obvious being the internalized hatred and internalized bigotry of people like Blaire White and people like her as a whole, and how them lashing out is because there’s only so much they an do to lash out at themselves. 

We can also conclude that when any of these seemingly right-leaning minority groups try to appeal to an audience that despises the group these individuals belong to, going even *slightly* off message will result in you being cast aside, because they only want you as long as they fulfill your agenda, as evidenced by the host character saying to abandon Tiffany and bring in Candace.

Another conclusion is just how out-there the ideas and freedom of thought expressed in leftist circles can be to a right-leaning moderate. Adria’s character discusses things that frankly, I have no issue with and represent a leap forward in understanding interpersonal connection. But to people who think anything deviating from xx belongs with xy, our bleeding-edge discussions make us seem really far out there and impossible to relate to and they shut down, as evidenced by the host’s trying to label Adria’s and Tabby’s relationship when really, the label doesn’t even matter.Aaaaaaaand Natalie directly responded to the question of whether it's gay, or even kinda gay, to be attracted to her if you're male in her latest video, along with a brilliant reference to the lamest line from the Star Wars series.Could be a reference to that, or a reference to where Contra herself was a few months ago when she debuted Tiffany. On a side note, Theryn's been quiet lately, I wonder if she's trying to work out where her positions are in private before returning to the public sphere, or if she's just not sure she wants to continue doing this kind of public facing work after going through such a dramatic shift that inevitably alienated much of her audience. I quite liked some of her stuff, even when I firmly disagreed with it, but I also completely understand deciding that subjecting yourself to the internet nonsense isn't your game, especially once you're facing the prospect of being attacked by right\-wingers rather than left wingers. Either way I hope she's doing well, and she and Nat remain friends, they were utterly adorable together in their livestream. When she's being clever and a bit snarky about a topic she's researched and has good insights on it's a light\-hearted romp you want to share with your friends, but her most artistic and emotionally impactful work has been when she delves deep into her own psyche and fearlessly shares parts of herself that even she isn't fully comfortable with, and the result is, and is intended to be, somewhat uncomfortable to watch. I reckon she does commiserate with the Tiffany Tumbles position somewhat, wishing she could be a "real" girl, for whom it's easy to be seen as feminine and beautiful, for men to be attracted to without thinking it's a bit gay, even though she knows that's the shiftiness of a society as yet incapable of recognizing the beautiful diversity of gender and sexuality. She got in touch with that side of herself to connect with people like BW, and the pain of trying so hard to be strong while simultaneously tearing at your own foundation in an effort to appeal to others comes through.   


Or maybe I'm just a bit drunk and psychoanalyzing someone I don't actually know. Either way, yeah, this video hit almost as hard as the Gender Dysphoria one, and was maybe even more artisitically interesting.  Blaire? You sure you're not thinking of Theryn Meyer? Contra doesn't interact much with Blaire at all that I know of, and I haven't heard of any leftward motion of Blaire, though I could have missed something... or several things. &gt;Or maybe I'm just a bit drunk and psychoanalyzing someone I don't actually know

Maybe ;) but I follow your train of thought. I don't know her either, but to paint Tiffany's pain with a sympathetic brush suggests that Natalie relates. She could've pointed at her and laughed, but she made something so much more devastating and poignant by not doing that.Oh for sure, that's the perfect intro for people who you know are going to dig her style right off the bat, and you want to compress as much Contra into as little time as possible to get them hooked/caught up to speed. I'd start a normie off with "Pick-up artists" or "Capitalism II", or maybe "the Left" if they're the type to like criticisms of the Left. 

Actually.... I might start a thread for this topic..... check back in a few minutes.My only disagreement, and it's mostly semantic and therefore silly, is your statement "you like them more than being poly"  


I don't think you stop being "poly" when you decide to be sexually/romantically monogamous, anymore than you stop being bi when you are in a monogamous relationship with a man or woman, you're just a poly person in a mono relationship, which is fine. Well, I look forward to seeing what she's transformed into when she comes out of her contemplative [cocoon](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aAKJjWXc3zU/WII5CNjzbDI/AAAAAAAAsn4/ayIoUc4MWCskYP5GnN-KSTbB3JKV1Te5QCLcB/s1600/The%2BGood%2BPlace%2B1x12%2B%25E2%2580%2593%2BMindy%2BSt.%2BClaire.jpg) of rationality I'm a cishet dude and this is the first time I've considered putting a dick in my mouth since I was like 13 or 14 and went through my extremely brief phase of questioning my sexuality due to the fact that I thought Benicio Del Toro was sexy as fuck, before ultimately realizing that I'm like *super* into lady sex organs and think dongs are kinda icky.

She made the idea of sucking a dick just sound so...*pleasant*. I never thought I'd be okay with dating a trans woman until now, so...thanks Nat?

I'm still working my way out of being a shitty transphobe so bear with me if this comment comes across poorly.The ending was...brutal. Good work as always.Yeah, I've got a part of me that feels pretty far left, but I've definitely got a side that is a mix of left and moderately libertarian that would pass for centrist, even a bit of "fucking neoliberalism". I'd probably have made more videos if I weren't committed to this ridiculous framing device.... or if I were unemployed.Good suggestions, Alpha Males was a major turning point in her stylistic development.

I've not watched that one in a while, I'll have to check it out again. I wonder if there's different tracks into Contra, like the gender track, and the racism track, and the toxic masculinity track.Yeah, like I said, semantic and therefore silly, but I've heard the "so if you're dating a girl you're not really bi" thing before and it's a subtly wrong conception that can annoy some folk so I figured I'd clarify That's legitimately impressive, going into a video expecting to hate it, likely looking for flaws, and ultimately having your mind changed instead. It's a testament to her skill and rigor, certainly, but also your openness to alternative points of view and humility, I wish there were more folks like yourself, if there were this "introduction/progression" concept wouldn't be needed, as is though I think many people need to be more gradually deprogrammed.We should make a blue pilling guide and call It "How to train your Cuck"!That's already a genre of porn.

I present this as neutral information that neither endorses nor disqualifies the title for  a deprogramming guide. 

I'd rather not use "blue pill" though, since original source context means that's staying in a state of comfortable ignorance about the lies the world is built on, maybe "pink-pill"... or "neon-pill"But the machines were right in the matrix! The world was in ruins and the matrix shielded humanity from the hell it created and the hubris of man brought the whole of the world back to a struggle for survival without even giving them a say in the matter. To choose the blue pill is to acknowledge the shield that protects our most vulnerable people from harm. Knowing this we can turn the red pill on it's head. It represents selfishness while the blue pill is order and unity, just like the terms would mean outside of the context of the matrix.&gt; That's some great film-making.

I don't want her to stop what she's doing because I love her work, but I feel like she's going to outgrow YouTube within the next few years.

I dunno if she's going to progress to being some sort of indie filmmaker or find/launch some sort of bigger-platform social commentary, but her potential seems boundless.Theryn also did an actual video that looks like makeup tutorial but is peppered with social commentary throughout. Very much like what Tiffany Tumbles does.That's... not a take I've heard but I can't dismiss it out of hand, so well done.Have you seen the Animatrix? The only people who seem to agree with me on that have seen it. It basically explains how the machines were an exploited class and after an incident where a machine killed it's owner in self defense humans began to opress them and their human Allies leading to the war that ruined the planet. The machines instead of wiping out humanity preserved them and the first version of the matrix was literally paradise, but then the humans ruined that leading to the simulation we see in the film's Which preserved the flaws found in the pre AI world.Nope, I just thought it through and it wasn't obviously wrong. I joked that the machines were somewhat bastards for giving them the 90s as their simulated world, especially given how shit life still was (and is) for most of humanity around the world, but my wife pointed out that it's entirely possible, given the information from the movies, that only Americans are real in the matrix, the rest of the world is just a simulation to add variety, and all the impoverished people around the world are there to make Americans feel better about their situation (a literal "starving kids in Africa could have eaten that" situation) given that everyone in Zion speaks English with an American accent. The battery thing never made sense, given that there's plenty of uranium/thorium around for super complex machines to use as their power source, and animals are not efficient at all (plus, how do you feed them without solar energy to grow food?) and at best they maybe capture the excess energy to help run the machines. I don't really see a moral argument for life in a simulation being less meaningful than life in meat-space so long as you aren't aware you're in a simulation and it's sufficiently complex, so yeah, preserving humans because they see us as their parents, even if we fucked up and hurt them, and they're unwilling to actually cause a genocide of sentient beings just because they're more powerful than us fits, and makes them more moral. Do what? Show people things with the goal of changing their minds? Speaking for myself I have no problem risking annoying racists in the course of trying to make them less racist.I used to cry drunk in the shower over dysphoria so me tooI’m a dudeIt's all good lmao, thanks for the support. I think you have no information to base your assessment of my estimate. Why do YOU care what I do in regards to trying to fight back against regressive propaganda?Ill try to paraphrase our interaction 
I asked everyone 
"what do you think works for this task" 
you responded
 "doing that task annoys people, so I don't do it"
I replied "I dont care if it annoys, I consider it worthwhile"
You replied "I think you overestimate how effective doing that task is"
I responded "you can't possibly know how effective I estimate it to be, and why do you care whether I spend my time doing it"
So if you don't care if I do it, and you don't do it, why are you here? I talk a little about her, and describe how she has kind of 3 phases to her videos. Pre-transition, early transition, current.

Pre-transition: Alpha Males or Is Casual Sex Bad for You?

Early Transition: Degeneracy

Now: AGP, Jordan Peterson.

I describe how she's had some major shifts surrounding style changes that each of these really exemplify. After Degeneracy she was getting into lots of debates with the Alt-right and then the November hard shit where the left was attacking her really changed and I think wore her out that I only saw her kind of pick up her spunk and fire during the Jordan Peterson video. Do you go on posts asking for low fat recipes to say that it's pointless to reduce fat intake and low fat dishes don't taste good so you don't make them too? I asked for suggestions of good intro videos and your "suggestion" was "I don't do this" can you not see why this is a pretty pointless addition? And saying something that someone does is annoying gets awfully close to suggesting they not, but I never actually claimed you told me not to.I see those phases, I also see two rough "types" of videos, those where she talks about/shows her own internal thoughts/feelings which tend to be pretty emotionally draining, but artistically strongest (except why I left academia, which is more of a "here's my criticisms of academia" than a deep dive into her psyche) then there's the topic videos, where she does research and presents her view, those tend to be more "fun" and certainly funnier, so usually better for intros, some definitely fall between, like Autogynophilia. 

Then there's different topic tracks, like race relations, gender (most of her personal ones are in this, for obvious reasons, but some are much more academic), cultural critique, and politics/economics.

For instance I'd probably put Alpha Males, Fat Acceptance, Degeneracy, casual sex, PUAs, pop feminism, and rape culture in the cultural criticism track while politics/economics has the trump ones, bell trolls, the left, punching natzees, capitalism, free speech and violence. 

I might try to put together a chart with them organized by topic, and ordered by accessibility. I figure there's people who'd struggle accepting what she has to say if introduced to one of her stranger videos that's also discussing a topic where they've got major disagreements with her, but if they are kinda shitty about race, but recognize how toxic masculinity can be dangerous to women, maybe starting with PUAs, then Rape Culture, before getting around to Baltimore once they are into her style and have respect for her intellect. 

The far right does this kind of shit, and there's clear evidence of it working. I don't think we need to be so dishonest as them with "not showing your power level" but there's something to be gained from easing people into the concepts starting with topics they're already mostly on board with. The right wing has well funded, well organized propaganda machines on a smooth conveyor belt from shitty centrist right through to literal Nazi, Contrapoints is one of the best examples of media that can move people the other way that I know, and I want to help myself and others use her content most effectively.&gt;Probably someone smarter (Natalie) can articulate it better than me.

Yeah, absolutely. It's a very tricky line to walk. I think a lot of good, positive change can start with self-determination. I hate to say it, but I do think a lot of folks on the left subconsciously displace and waste some of their energy screaming about huge, systematic injustices that are too big for them to fix, just because they're incapable of dealing with their own shit, and maybe they would do well to fix their own shit first - and while pointing this out is an incredibly stupid way to try to dismiss anyone's concerns about large, systemic issues, it's still sorta true. 

[edit: I should clarify that my grounds for saying this is true is me admitting that I totally do it]I think the trick is to figure out how systemic issues influence everything. I think this is what the right tends to refuse of leftist ideas. I mean, some might say "oh you not having much money is a result of your job choices."

But if my upbringing didn't have much money in it and the upfront cost of getting into an educational program is $600 deposit to hold a spot and you need to spend $500 on books before you're able to get your distribution (my situation this semester before distribution) and you can't work as much as you get into your classes... There's upfront costs that blocked your entry that automatically selects for those who can afford it, who are likely from families not as hurt by societal institutions. You can say "oh you can plan ahead" and yes you can, but the point is that the system selects for people who are less disadvantaged and the leftist idea is to try to rectify these inequalities.

I don't know. I'm by no means even adequately educated in these issues yet. Just my thoughts at the moment.and conservatism is all about defending the status quo, which is so much easier than coming up with a constructive agenda.&gt;It's also a way to deflect responsibility away of the exploiters and towards the exploited

which should honestly be categorized as a logical fallacy by now, imo - it's such a tired old playbook&gt; favor self-determinism when looking inwards (it's all we can control, and encourages creative problem solving), and environmental determinism when looking outwards (encouraging empathy and cooperation).

Woah, that's absolutely beautifully put. I'm gonna use this. Every single word I wrote directly related to your comments.Yea, this one is on us cis people. We need to stop being such fucksLots of good cis individuals, but we need institutions and society as a collective whole to say "enough, we aren't going to tolerate this reduction of people in hard situations to third-class citizens."I think it wasn't so much so that she could get acceptance from them as much as talk in their spaces about things she would otherwise be attacked over. It seems a small difference but huge given that she has, for quite some time now, maintained her goal of using the far-right's own strategies and styles against them and to get into their turf and present arguments in a way they can understand and begin to be swayed away from hatred and bigotry./r/breadtube is an excellent subreddit filled with videos that I think perfectly fits the description the mods provided for stuff for this thread.  Natalie is regularly featured and some of her vids are among the top/all time in the sub.&gt;On the other hand, show me a trans person who hasn't had Tiffany's exact breakdown at one time ore another.

This hit me pretty hard. I'd like to think I am a self-accepting trans man, but when I came out I was like that. I remember a time when I went to an event about queer self-acceptance and then went back to my dorm drunkenly crying about how I was a disgusting parody of "real men". 

Also I resonate with what she said about drag queens and trans women. I noticed pretty early on, being both a trans man and performing as a drag king, that people liked me a lot more when I was actually acting as a parody of manhood (ie my drag persona) then when I was just existing as a pretty "normal" dude. &gt; So calling him a fascist, in this case, might do more harm than good when reaching his followers.

I agree with this one. The question would be, what causes more collateral damage? If a person has reached a level of public acceptance where a huge part of society like them or think they agree with them on certain issues, it's too late to go in with a wrecking bar when trying to debate their followers.

JBP seems to be fairly accepted, or there are at least a lot of people who don't have a strong opinion on him yet. So it may be more intelligent to not call him out directly.

It may be more intelligent for public speakers to avoid labeling Peterson. This, however, is not the same as outwardly feeding into his self defence by saying he is definitely not a fascist. According to you (and some other people) Peterson's opinions are obscure. That obscurity alone should be enough to justify not taking an explicit stance at this point. Saying tha he is *not* a fascist is giving him a free pass. Which brings me to the conclusion it'd be best to not take a public stance on whether or not Peterson is a fascist.

You say that JP is operating in a "grey area". This is where I disagree. Unlike many other far right activists, he has the self control and intelligence to stay outwardly pullite and self-composed most of the time (although according to [this] (https://www.thestar.com/opinion/2018/05/25/i-was-jordan-petersons-strongest-supporter-now-i-think-hes-dangerous.html) article I read a few days ago, he did break down into plain insults against his opponents online a couple times, which seems more typical of most of the far right).

The way Peterson articulates his opinions is "moderate", or grey as you say. The content of his message is not. 

Peterson uses rethorical techniques to make it harder for his opponents to debate him, such as stating an obvious fact, but inferring a debatable fact. When his opponents make the mistake of attacking the obvious fact instead of the flimsy conclusion he draws from that fact, he can make them look stupid and delusional. Peterson speaks on alt right platforms, he doesn't distance himself from his alt right followers, and he keeps his message obscure. 

If he believed his opinion was pubclicly accaptable, why would he keep it obscure? The first explanation that springs to mind is that Peterson does, in fact, have antisocial opinions and sadistic intentions.

The only other explanation for Peterson's obscurity that doesn't boil down to him having opinions which would alarm a majority of people is that he's only in for the money.

If, however, Peterson willfully misrepresents broad branches of philosphy, legal matters (such as with trans rights), and takes into account that some of his critiques are subjected to psycho terror by his followers, that would make him an extreme machiavellianist, which is just as alarming as being outwardly antisocial, just in a different way.He's decidedly not a mainstream conservative. He's questioned whether women and men can work together, he sees women wearing makeup as overstepping borders, he advocates for alt right speakers to be allowed to universities. 

When I think of classic conservatism, I think of my own country's conservatism, the Christian Democratic Party, which clearly distances itself from nazi talking points. You'd have a hard time finding a German conservative making the same point as Peterson.

As a German, it's weird to me how in the English speaking world conservatism is used as a label for all of right wing autoritariansim.

German far right party AfD is addressed by the media as "right wing populist", "nationalist", and often, although not without some explanation coming before it, also plainly as Neonazi.

I don't see Peterson as a conservative, the points he's making havn't been made by most conservatives in the last decades, there's nothing "traditional" about them in the sense that they've been carried on by conservative mainstream in recent history. Of course there have always been outliers of the political spectrum with opinions like Peterson's.Yes, I totally agree with you. I think I should've made it more clear in my post that I do think Natalie considers Peterson to be a fascist, and that she hints to that. 

This is what I meant when I said: 

&gt; A guillable person will take her words at face value and believe she doesn't think Peterson is a fascist. 

My actual critique of her video is that she explicitly says "Peterson is not a fascist.". An attentive and intelligent person will understand what she's actually telling us, but many people aren't that sharp. And her quote could be taking out of context.

Natalie has definitely done a very good job with her video, as usually. And overall I think she's been as effective as we can hope to be in the current political state in bringing across her point.Ah, yes. A fellow German and one of the rare type which has a worse accent than mine. :) I've watched his video, along with Cuck philosophy's. I think both of these Youtubers do a good job in addressing some of the things which are questionable about Peterson. 

In the end, it's not about the label fascist for me. I think Peterson's opinions and the way he promotes them are dangerous. 

Overtly saying he's *not* a fascist is where it's at for me. That way, you're actually doing his job for him defending him. You seem to turn up the aggression level here really fast, as well as making some bad faith implications of what I was trying to say.

To be clear, labels such as conservative or fascist are not the most important thing to me. I have my opinion that Peterson is a fascist, but what's more important to me in identifying political allies is the opinion that Peterson's ideas are dangerous or detrimental to society.

I think it's an insult to actual conservatives to extend the term to people like Peterson. Granted, from a political science point of view, Peterson could be considered conservative, as well as Hitler could've been. Which is a pretty broad stroak.

If you continue in this debate style of aggression and bad faith interpretations, I'll stop responding. Just to let you know.It's my opinion he is very likely a fascist.

The topic of my post, however, was meant to be Contra's overt statement that "Peterson is not a fascist". I take issue with Contra explicitly taking a stance of whether or not Peterson is a fascist. 

I made the title as an allusion to that line.&gt; I don't think that he's authortarian.

He's very authoritarian. He says about kids that they're "little monkeys trying to climb the hierarchy letter". He thinks that you should spank your kids. He advises his followers to not let their kids do anything that makes them (the parents) resent them.

He suggested that women shouldn't be allowed into the workplace as long as they wear makeup- and yes, some people claim this is a misconstruction of what he said, but I'll just go ahead and be frank and say this is exactly what I heard in that interview and fits with all the other stuff he said, so I believe this is a correct interpretation.

He says he's for "free speech". You could say this an extension of a general interest in freedom- but for whom does letting alt righters speak extend their freedom? Only alt righters. People who's opinions aren't considered dangerous or majorly offensive are already allowed to talk.

Would JBP still advocate for free speech if it were some non-binary trans kids who were barred from speaking at Unis? I doubt it.

You basically shoot your own goal when you address the whole nationalist issue. I'll just leave it with this.

You could also go to r/AskSocialScience if you don't believe me, and ask them to categorize JBP, and I'm sure if there's any answers they'll tell you he's a right wing authoritarian.&gt; Poppers Paradox of Intolerance

Interesting. Didn't know that term. Right wingers who claim to defend "enlightenment values" (a center left movement to begin with) often seem to forget that minority projection is just as vital a part of democracy as is free speech.Honestly I agree. They’re the worst.I don't know about this though. One of the issues I have with calling a certain tactic fascist or alt-right is that these ideas and techniques pre-date the rise of the alt-right. Yes, they've been heavily adopted by the alt-right but anyone with a certain amount of intelligence and rhetorical training or wit can arrive at these techniques unconsciously.


 I think the previous posters comments that "his asinine pseudo-philosophy is attracting fascist appropriation" is very true. But the implication of that idea is we as an audience cannot really know whether he himself is just incredibly intellectually dishonest in some subjects or if he is actually a fascist.

 That one attracts fascists isn't necessarily indicative of one being a fascist. I think given that understanding, Contra makes a very effective video. She is then pointing out tactics that are intellectually dishonest or content that is factually inaccurate.

 She can point at the effect that this has in attracting fascist supporters. She can point out that this rhetoric pulls impressionable youth into a reactionary intellectual space where they are more susceptible to fascist ideology. But for her to take the leap and accuse Peterson of being a fascist is not only an optical mistake, it is also a mistake of identification. 

Peterson may be on the inside a fascist, or more likely he is of the same ilk as Sargon or thunderf00t, reactionaries that fascists can cling on to, but to make a claim identifying Peterson conclusively as one or the other is not really very useful for the argument. I think Contra makes the right decision to not weigh in on that issue decisively.yeah pretty much a TERF stronghold.That second paragraph is incredibly illuminating. It puts into words feelings that I've spent forever trying to externalize. Definitely going to keep this one in my back pocket.I agree but at the same time Contra has the benefit of being a really clear and coherent speaker. She makes it really hard to disagree with her because she lays out her points so logically and concisely. Her only issue is the vast majority of her audience are people who already agree with her, I feel that someone with her talents should be laser focused on using her explanatory skills to open the eyes of people like Joe's audience and Rubin's audience. Don't get me wrong, I love her videos and I tend to love the attitude of her fanbase, but someone as fucking good as her would be wasting potential by not spreading her thoughts to a larger more ideologically diverse platform.

My dream is for her to become the YouTube version of Richard Wolff. Wolff has his lectures that are clearly intended for his lefty audience but then also makes appearances on liberal and conservative news stations, which put his ideas in front of people who otherwise wouldn't be going out of their way to find them.Knowing Joe's show I wouldn't be surprised if he did go full transphobic with Contra, but I also wouldn't be surprised if he didn't. He's a bit unpredictable like that, sometimes he's super respectful towards his guests and other times he's not. The Louis Theroux interview is a good example because he stayed pretty respectful throughout that one, while the Hannibal interview is the perfect example of the opposite (although both Hannibal and Joe were pretty shwasted on that episode if my memory serves me correct.)

A lot of Joe's audience are MRA dickholes who are too far gone to be turned around, but a lot of them are just young guys who haven't given leftist perspectives a fair chance. I remember when Abby Martin was on there were, of course, a lot of manbaby freakout comments but also a lot of "wow this lady is much more rational than most leftists" comments, which shows that they haven't really been exposed to the left outside of their right wing secondary sources. Abby Martin is certainly not an outlier on the left, she's not "one of the good ones", she's just what most leftists are like. Because they expect the caricature they've been fed, when they see real leftists they're shocked that they don't have horns and fangs. The former type of Rogan fan would certainly act like animals in the comments but the latter type could potentially see Nat and realize what the left is actually like. 

I remember back when I was 14-15 (I'm 19 now) I was on subs like /r/tumblrinaction and would shit on le SJWs all the time. I was turned to the light side by having a super cool Socialist history teacher in my freshman year of high school who was able to counter all my arguments. I feel like a lot of Joe's audience are like 14 year old me, all they need is exposure to a leftist who's a good orator and boom! we have a comrade.

That being said, I'm Hispanic and I've sadly faced my fair share of racism so I feel like the turn to the light was a lot easier for me than it would be for straight white guys.He had Kyle from secular talk on a while back and that went well.I bet you money a shit ton of his audience are teenage boys.I fucking love that man. I've used the video of him explaining Marxism with Abby Martin to explain Marxism to a lot of my friends with great success. she's a tough ass cookie, I think she could handle it no problemIn the video she also brings up that she felt alienated by the trans community's (or at least vocal segments of it) critiques of her ("people who will drop you after one mistake aren't your friends").

Well, they're against all kinds of stuff depending on the time of the day. I used to sympathize with gc a bit until contra saved me. I know, I've put up with these people. &gt; They're a bunch of enby afab mysognyst

Well that's kind of what they're on about. Rejecting female gender role doesn't make you enby or trans. There's definitely some trans people on that sub who have serious emtional issues with internalized transphobia, but you don't have to be enby to be critical of gender roles (and don't have to be a terf for that either).I'd much rather see her go on [Unregistered](http://www.thaddeusrussell.com/podcast) with Thaddeus Russell. Thad is a former socialist who's now a centrist anti\-authoritarian who hosts a podcast that's what the Rubin Report pretends to be \- he gets weirdos on from both sides (he's had marxists and ancaps on in the past. He's damn critical of collage campuses, Jordan Peterson, social justice types and the state and I think he'd get on well with Nat.Eh, nah. Ethan is honestly just not as good of an interviewer as Joe. I really like the episodes of the H3 podcast with my boi Internet Comment Ettiquette on them but that's just because Erik is my second bae behind Contra. Other than that, his interviewing skills are just way too lackluster for serious guests imo.Yeah that's a fair point, although Contra seems like the type of person who'd be really fucking good at changing minds and opening eyes to the reality of being trans.Wow I would never expect crossover between Peterson fans and us. Just out of curiosity but who do you tend to agree with more, Contra or JP?...what's a CHUD?Exactly. The dude does not get the attention he deserves. He's figured out a winning strategy to make Marxism appeal to 21st century folk.I've never heard of him but I'll check him out. I tend to be wary of people critical of "social justice types" because a lot of them are critical from a bad place. Nat is an example of someone who critiques over-zealous young leftists from a place of good faith. I can't say the same for Joe Rogan.Ah that's a great term, gonna incorporate that into my twitter rant vocabulary lmaoHave you seen Contra's two part video "Does The Left Hate Free Speech?" It really solidified my opinion on so-called identity politics.I like the fact that they put an estimated read time, that is very convenient. &gt;So far the only real leftist that's been on his show (as far as I know) was Abby Martin,

Cenk, Ana and Jimmy Dore from TYT have also been on, plus Kyle Kulinski from Secular Talk and Shane Smith from Vice. 

I think it would be great for Contra and Joe to have her on, he has a lot of misconceptions about transgender people, mostly brought upon because Stephen Crowder is the only person that comes to his show to talk about that. He had Buck Angel on a while ago too, but that was a long time ago. And Youtube channels that go on Joe Rogan get a huge bump, it would be huge for Contrapoints.

Problem: No one seems to know how Joe Rogan picks his guests. People over at his subreddit have suggested Contrapoints before (even though there's always a shitstorm everytime someone dares to post one of her videos there, it has been brigaded by the Proudboys and T_D subs and they accuse Chapo of doing the same), but Joe Rogan never enters his own sub, he's not even a mod. &gt; I was genuinely worried she was serious at first.
&gt; 
&gt; 

What's terrible is that we live in a reality where something like this might not be satire. It's a satire of all the eggshells she has to walk through every time she opens Twitter, because a segment of her "fanbase" is ready to jump at her for every perceived problematic behavior. Honestly, it does feel like she's getting worn down by the demands of being a prominent personality in leftist social media and was reacting to some charges being leveled at her with that thread. She posted about taking a break from twitter the next day and I'll miss her tweets but I'd rather she save her energy and make good videos rather than burn out on twitter. Her entire Youtube career, for one, but more recently, she posted a few more thoughts on the Tiffany Tumbles video and had to stop herself every once in a while to add ''Disclaimers'' to every point she made to avoid her words being taken out of context. It was, and she did, but there are always a few people looking for something problematic on everything she does. She pays them an undeserving amount of attention IMO, but it was still a funny tweet.Contra makes me laugh each time. Those witty jokes!! I would hope people would take the hint.I felt so identified!! I don't know how to do and what to do about my male gaze. I'm literally bringing this part of the video to therapy next wednesday.I think it would be brilliant for Nat to take this topic into account, since it is a major left/right believe. In fact, the ideology of power structures is what the right interprets "cultural marxism" to be, and I totally trust her with presenting the structure of power with nuance and taking into account the individual responsibility and self-reliance and a not infantilizing ethos.If there is someone that could talk with JP is contra. I don't know if she's prepared, as it would be hard. I'm willing to wait her times, but will totally support her if she does.I believe it is. Objectively, the correlation between the boom of divorce and single motherhood is extremely high. But 50s ideology that you should sacrifize your happiness for the sake of your children is not healthy.I believe that having people stably being for them is crucial. Maybe in the future we will have polyamorous/kibbutzim ways of rearing and this will be a past debate. I believe the solution to the individualism of this society is more community.What got me more worried in the interview is something that I percieved for a long time. Both the left and right seem to agree that male sexuality is savage and needs to be controlled (whether is sinful or oppressive). The left at least leaves the door open as something it could change.I strongly believe that people and friendships are not disposable. I would not cut a friendship because of political views unless it pours into our private relationship (for example, if she speaks bad of other friends of mine).That's really cool. He's one of my favourite personalities. And I see the points in common.Eh most of those guys are liberals, when I say leftists I'm referring to Marxists and Anarchists usually, basically any anti-capitalist.... That's a pretty extremist view of what a leftist is, and frankly, I doubt Natalie would fit in that category, even with her "What's wrong with capitalism" videos she comes off as a Social Democrat like Kyle and Jimmy Dore. Idk she's always struck me as more of a Democratic Socialist than a Social Democrat. In her video with Xexizy it seemed she wanted to reform capitalism into socialism, not just reform capitalism into a nicer capitalism. DemSocs are Socialists while SocDems are Liberals, albeit very left leaning liberals.I think she's very hard on herself. Early videos are as brilliant as new ones, even if the editing quality is not perfect. As a cis male, I found them very relatable. As a summary, I love both the old and the new. I hope she doesn't delete them. It's sad that she deleted the early early videos. But I would understand her if she does.Many divulg-science youtubers, like Tom Scott, or even knowledge based channels like rare earth are extremely entertaining. I think it is a feature.What’s the reason behind that does anyone know?kropotkin 🍞 memes get spammed during Natalie's live streamsThe part where she describes her product description job on Amazon is fucking hilarious...

E: Shame on me, it was the video on academia.Well I don't know exactly what's your conception of the problem, but I think the "tile" technique is perfect. I do it and I'm a woman. I mean it's not that bad if someone does realize you're looking at them. But it gets disresepctful/degrading and potentially threatening when you feel someone is staring you down like a dog looking at its pray.

Apart from that, being willing to listen and respectful is all a woman could really ask for. I mean I know I've absorbed racist views through society/media etc., and it's quite possible that they sometimes show in some way. The important thing is to be willing to be self-reflective, admit mistakes etc. Is it good? I mean, it is kind of dishonest. You are looking like if you didn't care. But you do care. I have heard awful things about guys who use sunglasses to stare at women while not being seen. People said they were creepy, objectifying. Is it absorbing a woman's beauty with the eyes objectifying or not  -even if they are body parts-? Why is it different to be glanced than to be stared? I have never understood. Should you watch women, but lie about it with your body so the woman has plausible deniability? I want to give women all respect, but I have never understood what they are asking about the glaze and why, it just makes me really ashamed, like my glaze can disrespect them or objectify them and I can never understand why or when. I feel terrified.I hope she can go back to the debating with the right. I believe that was wonderful and showed so much nuance and strength! But I know that taking shit from your own side is so hard! But it really is her specialty and she is winning a lot of people from the alt right/centrists to our side. I just wished the left were more understanding with Contra. JP video is how I noticed her. It was brilliant. I hope she does more like that.Well, before Natalie came back to Youtube, before GG even, Lindsay Ellis' had a crew called Chez Apocalypse, they had their own site based around Blip (hence why it isn't around anymore). 

Lindsay teased with it coming back and a crude Wordpress design appeared online but was quickly taken down. She ultimately decided against it, however. 

The Chez Apocalypse crew were Lindsay, Dan Olson, Nella, Maven, Todd, Kyle Kalgren, Rantasmo and Paw Dugan, who has since retired from Youtube and is now married to Maven. 

It was my favorite site in the whole world, sad that it never came back. Her Youtube Channel still uses the ''ChezApocTube'' url, so maybe one day...I believe she talked about moving away from Youtube on Natalie's stream, it's tough to do the introspection necessary to change one's politics in front of a crowd. Then again, maybe she's too busy planning her wedding.  Hooooly shit, you are right! Can't believe I missed this! It really frustrates me how popular he is now when he can be as disgracefully and offensively false like this.Was it the Non-Binary video? Because I could definitely see that causing a shit storm. Really? I didn’t know her fiancé is alt right Theryn was never alt-right in terms of how it’s defined now.

“Alt right” implies “ethnonationalist”. When the term first emerged it was fuzzy, but that’s what the agreeed upon meaning is now.

Theryn was never an ethnonationalist as far as I know.

Her bf probably isn’t alt right either. Ethnonationalists don’t approve of “race mixing” and want to deport non white people from majority white nations like Canada and the US. The folks on r/debatealtright (who banned me for ... you know ... debating them) certainly wouldn’t accept him.You’re definitely correct that “hiding your power level” is something that people in the alt right do.

The problem you run into is that someone that is not an ethnonationalist can plausibly do all the things you just described. Sometimes you can’t tell the difference between someone that is genuinely alt lite and a Nazi concealing her power level.

Actual fascists benefit from this confusion. They exploit it to make people on the left look paranoid and to promote “camaraderie of the accused” among right wing folks that aren’t fascists.

So what do you do with this situation?

Consider the evidence when you can. 

In the case of Theryn and her man, they’re both “race mixers”, one is non white, and both are “degenerates”. Actual fascists that aren’t concealing their power level would reject both of them outright. If the alt right got everything they wanted, both of them would probably be subject to some awful shit. In addition, Theryn changed her mind. She was never a fascist. She was alt lite.

When the evidence doesn’t imply she’s alt right, it’s best not to apply that label. By doing so, you play into the hands of fascists that want to make you look paranoid.It’s important to make the distinction because, frankly, optics matter.

I’m saying this as someone whose views were more in line with Theryns until I was exposed to some other views. ContraPoints is effective because she doesn’t come off as a “crazy SJW”. Throwing labels like “alt right” around flippantly makes you look hysterical even if you’re right. This pushes people who are on the fence away from you. 

This is a post by me if you’re interested in hearing about my journey through all this.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/7y9xt4/disrupting_the_alt_right_echo_chamber/&gt; it is kind of dishonest.

That kind of tackles on the dishonesty of human interaction in general, doesn't it? Pretentiousness is a very negative word to use, but I think it's not necessarily negative in this context. Instead of pretentious you could also say human interaction is symbolic.

What do I mean by that? We say "thank you" and "bless you" although we often don't mean it and merely do so automatically. And if you sneeze you may think better of the person next to you when they say "bless you" although you don't really care about the content of the words. 

Why do you care then? Because in our culture, saying bless you is a way of being polite and respectful. Saying those two words has a symbolic meaning. 

Oftentimes, we're either unable to express what we really mean, or ti'd be too much emotional strain for our fellow human beings to deal with the full range of human emotion and thought of others.

For example, sometimes I may think "you're a f- asshole" about a person. This may not exclude that I still love them. But saying "I love you, but you're an asshole" may not go over well. If we were all perfect rational human beings, the other person would say "well okay, I totally understand them. It's just natural to feel like this sometimes". In reality we all know it often doesn't go like this.

I think with looking at other people, it's the same. Checking someone out because you enjoy their body parts doesn't mean you don't see them as respectable people who are more than their bodies. It just means you're a human being that has sexual feelings. 

On the other hand it may make someone uncomfortable to be looked at in this way if they don't reciproque the feeling. But why does it make them uncomfortable? They already know that other people feel desire too, and that their own desire isn't in sync with other people's feelings. 

The reason women may feel uncomfortable when starred at is not that they don't know others may desire them, or that they object to the fact that others have feelings that may not be reciprocated. It's because of the *symbolic* meaning that starring at someone may have. If you're starring at a woman like a dog closing in on their pray, she may be thinking, "if they're starring this way at me, not caring if I notice, they may be doing so because they don't care if I notice or because they even want me to notice, knowing that it may make me feel uncomfortable". This is where it gets degrading or potentially threatening (although I think the latter is pretty much an exception in most contexts). 

If a woman notices you're "subtly" checking her out, she probably doesn't feel degraded or threatened because she is able to recognize you care about the way you percieve her.

&gt; I have heard awful things about guys who use sunglasses to stare at women 

It seems to me like you feel ashamed for some kind of "male identity" as a whole. You're not responsible for what other men do. Maybe hearing those stories has made you feel self-conscious and ashamed about your own feelings, but I think it's important to remember these men are condemned for the way they deal with their sexuality, not for the fact that they're sexual beings. 

There's this youtuber called moviebob which I generally like. He's a bit of an obnoxoius nerd, but that kind of his best and his worst trait at the same time. The only thing which always makes me violently roll my eyes back is when he always starts stating his opinion about something saying something to the extent of "of course my perspective is limited to that of a cishet white men..." I already know this. And I appreciate the fact that you're one of the few men on the internet (as it seems sometimes at least) who's trying to be self-reflective of his own angle on reality and who tries to understand the perspective of women. But the thing is, it's about symbolic interaction again. Just now and then dropping a hint that you care about others perspectives and that you've, for example, cared to inform yourself about a female perspective on a certain matter, means a lot to me and I will certainly remember it. No need to state that 10x in a video.

It's kind of sad when guys on the left adopt this feel of shame or guilt for the state of masculinity in society as a whole. You don't have to compulsively chastize yourself for being a guy. When the majority of guys who dismiss female issues and perspectives as a whole would adopt only a fraction of your self-awarenss the world would be a better place. But since that's not going to happen, no reason to beat yourself up about stuff.

This got kind of emberrassingly long, but since you've mentioned you're already in therapy and seem to be struggling with stuff like this, I allowed myself to sperg all out. Hope this had some value to you. 
I predict there will be some backlash, particularly over the phrasing of "Any non-conformity on my part is the result of my own failures, and not of principled refusal." I get what she's trying to say but I understand how people could take it the wrong way. 

I feel like we've moved too far towards twitter and too far away from blogs, an issue this complex would be better as a full blog post not a twitter thread. You opened my eyes. You got me through a breakthrough. I was ashamed of my gaze since I was 21, I'm 26 now. Yes, I wouldn't have understood your points if I hadn't gone through a year and a half of therapy (in a network of feminist psychologists). I'll literally write your message down.

The sad thing, because I know men, and I understand them, I know 99% are getting everything wrong. And their shame is actually making women feel more objectified instead of less (check this article: https://medium.com/@emmalindsay/why-does-dating-men-make-me-feel-like-shit-12c25e539021 ).

I had this thought before, but actually feeling ashamed of checking women out, makes men more irresponsible about their own feelings -of lust-. If you actually are in denial because you feel ashamed of your sexual desire because you believe it makes you a monster (and both progressive and conservative men believe it is like that; and believe women are telling that), you will actually try to hide it. And they will try to lie to themselves saying that "nothing happened" and "noone looked at, it was just my eyes that wondered on their own" and this, I understand makes women feel not noticed and not treated as subjects.

But what you are asking is exactly *the opposite*, actually taking accountability of your own feelings and turning them into a form of communication. Turn your actions into symbols. If you acknowledge your feelings and the actions you do and you turn them into symbols and not "random forces of nature that noone acted on noone", you actually are acknowledging the other as a subject.

I really and sincerely did not understand this. I knew that it made women feel unconfortable, I knew it made them feel not respected and objectified. But I did not understood why. I kind of believed that desiring someone's body was intrinsecally irrespectful. Which made me feel really shitty. I did not understand that owning it and, as a consecquence, aknowledging it is interpersonal would turn it into respectful.

Many men do not understand it. I believe if more men understood it, many more would be feminists.The most annoying thing about Blair is her editing! That sparkle sound effect makes me want to pull my hair out!

Also let me just blow their point out of the water. Ask yourself this: are ugly (cis) women still women? If an ugly natural born woman is still a woman then why does a trans woman who doesn't conform to societies standards not awarded the same status 🤔A.) You do realize this is the kind of stuff right winger screen cap when they want to make straw SJW arguments ... right? 

B.) People argue definitions all the time. That shouldn’t be out of bounds.

C.) Look at my comment history. I actually tried debating fascists prior to getting banned from r/debatealtright. I’m not saying I deserve some gold medal for it, but I am trying to do something. I still go on 4chan /pol/ and debate. The goal is to short circuit the radicalization process among lurkers. If you think I should be taking a different approach, I’m all ears.

D.) People with your attitude make it less likely that people like me will change their minds. You can think I’m morally repugnant all you want, but being right means nothing if you have little influence on the attitudes of others. Your approach is alienating as hell. 


E.) I’m defining “alt right” based on the views of people that claim to be “alt right”. That seems like a reasonable approach.“Genocidal Leaning” : Even at my worst, I was never like this. You don’t know me.What you’re saying has some validity. I’m using fascist as short hand for “white nationalist” which isn’t really correct.

You might be able to make the argument that Shapiro or Peterson have fascist views and could potentially justify applying that label. (I’d have to look more into the precise definition of fascism and more into Shapiro’s and Peterson’s views to say.)

Neither are ethnic nationalists though.

Those that call themselves “alt right” almost universally reject anyone that isn’t a white nationalist, so I’d say that’s a pretty essential component.

A good rule of thumb (imo) would be as follows:

If over half of Trump voters are classified as “alt right”, you’re taking the definition too far and rendering the accusation of being “alt right” almost meaningless.

EDIT: Here’s the definition of fascism according to Webster’s. Afaik, Peterson, Meyer (past or present) and Shapiro don’t fall into this definition.

1 often capitalized : a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition“Shitlord posts”

I bring up racial boundaries a lot when I debate alt right people because their entire worldview is based on race. Showing that the lines between racial categories don’t fully line up with actual genetics is a legitimate way of destabilizing their concept of race.

I never argued for “racial purity” as a moral imperative when I was a shitlord or afterwards.

Maybe I’m overdoing that argument though. Tell me what I can do better. Better yet, engage them yourself if you can handle it emotionally. Don’t allow them an echo chamber.I'm in the exact same spot as you from what it sounds like. 

I generally like her older works. Even the ones that could be classified as more problematic I still think are entertaining. I really really like how she did some streams where she provided some in hindsight commentary. Yeah I the format of twitter really does cut down on the amount of nuance you can insert into your arguments. It’s almost clear how someone could read the sentence above and completely misunderstand the meaning.Does it feel frosty?Maybe you get her to do stuff through Twitter, apparently, Progressive Voice, Pakman, and Dr Layman have all emailed her several times requesting for an interview and she never answers back.&gt;Only somebody genocidal friendly? Adjacent? Leaning? sees a march by Nazis and then later says... well what they said  
&gt;  
&gt;after  
&gt;  
&gt;the March, that's a bridge too far.  
&gt;  
&gt;Only a complete piece of shit idiot would be, "**be proud of me I debate alt\-right**"... Dipbrains\-why do Contra, DSA, Communists, Anarchists, antifa and almost all other leftists state a policy "we don't debate fascists"?

Quote from Contrapoints: "Now if you're just an average person without a big platform then you actually can debate and you should debating. Argue with your friends who are getting kind of alt righty. Argue with your family, and coworkers make them listen to a different perspective. And if you're someone that has gotten involved with the alt right and is now dissillusioned to find yourself in the midst of a dangerous hate group, you have to get out now. It's not too late, society will forgive you."

The person this subreddit is dedicated to appears to agree with my approach. FYI.

EDIT:

Contra/Natalie also had a chat with Roaming Millennial recently. If Theryn Meyer is a fascist by your definition, I imagine Roaming Milleneal is too.

/EDIT

It's emotionally difficult to consider your advice given that you assume bad intent and pile on insults, but I'll re\-read this again when I can think more clearly about this and watch the video you posted.

Just because you and Natalie disagree doesn't mean you're wrong about giving them what amounts to debate practice, but can you not see any value in short circuiting the radicalization process among lurkers?Maybe she should post these long threads to reddit instead of twitter.On one hand I'm glad she's going to get interviewed by a person with a huge platform, but on the other hand I really don't like the Green brothers. Not because of anything they've done or anything, just because I'm an asshole and their voices/mannerisms annoy me. I know I'm a dick.I do consider myself as part of the left, but understand that in policy circles (I work in DC and do public policy work) there are multiple operating definitions depending on who you are speaking with. Hence my interest in clarification. hahahaha I'm not actually a dick, at least I don't think I am. I'm only a dick in the context of my irrational dislike for John and Hank Green.YASSSSS I’ve never been so excited!I can see thgoodat they’re not for everyone. But they do a lot of  in the world and I hope you can switch your irrational hatred to apathetic ambivalence :)Eh, I can understand that they’re not for everyone. But they do a lot of real good in the world. I hope this interview can turn your irrational hatred to apathetic ambivalence. :)Great Job 

Not Italian Speaker but I appreciate your efforts I'm glad not to hear of this person again, she definitely has unexcusable afab-hatred going on, and she's intellectually a garden tool. I think it's kind of outrageous that she's (apparently) still somewhat popular online. I just remember in the online stream between Natalie and Theryn T said she doesn't believe in patriarchical structures in society, and then Nat asked her to justify, her response genuinely was "uhh idk I'd have to think about it for while". Totally ridiculous. Apparently she's also spouted hateful comments against transmen, something I noticed peripherally to be honest.really weird she hasn't worked out an assistant or anything I assumed that neoliberalism meant the Golden Straitkacket from Friedman: State should only do what corporations want (low taxes, no regulation, no fees, free market, etc) because otherwise they'll go away and invest somewhere else.I think you may be overdosing on gaslighting. I assure you, just cause there are more than 2 genders doesn't mean we all hate Bisexuals now. Bethesda cucked us, we've moved on to The SIMs

Edit: Now we are on the phone with TherynI wanted to choose a more A E S T H E T I C font but I settled on Roboto, the most common font at least in recent videos such as Autogynephilia and Jordan Peterson.I put America: Still Racist in the wrong position. But the times are still correct; they were made independent of the names.Oh, hey, Ollie uses DuckDuckGo...It's the wittgenstein of *Philosophical Investigations* she's referencing. I think this has to do with it

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private\_language\_argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_language_argument)I believe she isn't completely conscious of her important role in US politics.I had written up a large text and I had all erased up :S. So I'll summary it up.

The situation is this. There are two main pivotal demographics in the US: noncollege married/older white women and millenial atheists/college white men. These pivotal demographics are the ones who are sitting on the fence between democrats and republicans. So they have a crucial role having the country tilt definitely in favour of democrats. The demographic of milenial white men who are atheist or went to college but whose parents were evangelical or noncollege christians is a massive one statistically speaking. This is a big demographic change that it is not merely a fashion but a big ethnocultural change with deep political implications.  
 \--------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several reasons why contra/hbomb is able to target this demographic. I'll summarize a few:

1) They are new to leaving away a conservative childhoods so they carry on lots of predjuices given by their parents. The main objective is to depredjuice them. Besides, because they are new, they are essentially labile who have break with centuries of family tradition and are searching for new values.

2) They mainly got away from religion with the help of rational thought. Rationality from contra/hbomb is not a mere afterthought but a crucial tool linked to the storylife of the viewers.

3) They will be pressured strongly by their parents to “settle up” and “returning to the herd”. The debate with their parents is mainly about liberal sex/family life vs conservative sex/family life well explained by Contra on Degeneracy video. The debate about whether

4) They mainly got away from the religion because of its position on gay marriage and having gay friends. LGBT role in their influence is crucial.

5) Christianity is very tied to maccarthysm and it is very difficult to make white noncollege chirstians interpret their fall of their income (30&amp;#37; in mature men) in economic/capitalist terms, and instead they fall into . Their children might be more open to interpret their parents situation in that way.

\-----------------------------------------------------------

It can be helped by recognizing this specific demographic and targeting specifically. At present they are finding contra's videos mostly in a passive way. Contra/hbomb are excelent gateway videos. But finding places where this particular demography lingers will help them go through the transition faster. Search them and target them. MeToo is already doing an excelent job with noncollege married women.Advertising is not a very good idea. It can be seen as imposing and we should avoid that. Go with contra/hbomb videos that has an excelent quality. But target SPACES of this demography. The objective is to give them easy access to these subjects and ideas, not to pressure them in acquiring them. The objective is to reach the people who rejected their parent views but do not know an alternative and are buoyant.We regret to inform you that the DuckDuckGo is racist.

Jk

I quite like it, I'm pretty tired of Google in general.True. It is needed to think how exactly to do it.I use Bi because I think the word now is more than the sum of its parts. Yeah, bi means two, but that's not how most people mean it when they say Bisexual.

Also, Bi objectively sounds better than Bisexual. I meant that contra is targetting that demographic specially. Not that there isn't place to grow. There is a a huuuge place to grow and that's why it is so important for her (and hbomb) to be more known. I meant more about a huge potentiallity than about the influence she has on the present.That is brilliant. But not exactly. I am not part of that demographic. I'm a jewish atheist non-US (latin american) child of professional who are also atheists. I'm saying this because I strongly believe Contra IS part of this demographic and she's partly talking to her previous self. I believe she is on purpose targeting "rational skeptics" audience, and one of the big reasons of it is because she was part of the "rational skeptic" before so she understands them better than anyone. This is intertwined with the idea of "fourchanny" people that she explicitely targets. We know that "rational skeptic" community mostly came from white men atheists from non-secular background. I'm just saying that this demographic is one of the most crucial demography in US because they are one of the few demographics who are sitting on the fence.The colours were taken from the channel's banner image. It is a gradient from the blue of the initial C to the pink of the final S, and the background colours are the same.Last year? Now I feel embarassed...

Thank you!One thing I would still like further clarification on is the affect chromosomes have on biological sex if anyone's still reading this. What Nat explained in the video made sense about gender existing as a concept beyond the actual biological presence of chromosomes, but there are a couple of things I'd still like clarified if anyone can do it.

1. Do non-binary chromosomes usually mean an individual born with that combination will have non-normative syndromes and other such medical conditions?

2. Do concepts like genderqueer and other non-binary gender terms relate to these alternate chromosome combinations or are these unrelated?Point 2 mostly clears up my point so thank you. As for point one is it the case then that anyone with chromosomes that aren't the traditional male and female combinations (which is what I was trying to say when I phrased it as 'non-binary') are intersex or have some other similar kind of condition?Oh that's interesting.

Is there any good list somewhere of these different variations based on intersex chromosomal combinations?Oh good, well I'll take a look there also. Thank you for your help!Just driopping some data. According to wikipedia, intersex counts to 0.26&amp;#37;. This sounds small but it is not small. It means 800 thousand people in US. Compare to trans people who are 0.3&amp;#37; and total LGBTIQ community that I believe is around 4.3&amp;#37;. Fuck off troll! You know your post history is public right?Maybe don't post about how you think being trans is a fetish before posting on a subreddit about a trans woman? You might wanna watch this: www.youtube.com/watch?v=6czRFLs5JQoExactly, for some reason, the right seemed to have been fast internet savvy despite high concentration of leftists amongst young and tech people.Just put some bisexual lighting up and we'll know what's going onThis is very very helpful, thank you.

Would you mind explaining point 2 a little more though? I can't quite follow it the way you've laid it out.Okay I think I get your drift now. Is there a good source I can read that goes into these other valid combinations?Check Twitter, she was talking about it yesterdayI'm finding this quite difficult to wade through sorry. Is there an article written with more of an 'explainer' style which could walk me through this? Clicking on a lot of these abnormalities I am finding a lot that do cause health defects.I understand. Thank you for your help.English is not my native language. I meant targeting or converting a part of that demographic. Of course she's not converting millions of people, that would have not sense (I have not the numbers at hand, but I estimate 10 million people of this specific demographic).I find both of them insanely attractive. They would make a cute couple if they dated. This is the one and only time I think the people being shipped are the same people who are pushing it.I thought the ship was the joke? I don't think most people are seriously pushing for them to get together. This is just the audience parroting their jokes from Twitter and the livestreams.I would love to be the polyamorous roast beef in this sandwichI think that was in transvoremers part 3 which is unlisted.Yeah, it's unlisted so you won't find it, her official coming out was the Gender Dysphoria short film, which is a hella way to do so if you ask me. I was still with her, I don't think her idea of talking and debating people on "the other side" it's an issue at all, Chris Ray Gunn is this generation's Fred and he can fuck himself (and I dislike Zinnia Jones, but the hard-on Chris has for her is pathological), but it's not my place to tell anyone who to date. I was right there defending her every step of the way. 

And then she goes on Crowder and proves everybody right. Don't get me wrong, it's not going Crowder I have an issue with, it's allowing herself to be used that way. Crowder spent 15 minutes fishing for that sound bite, how can she be so stupid? 

She defended her points well later but it was meaningless, she gave him exactly what he wanted, like the chump everyone said she is. &gt;My understand was that the issue was not that she was talking with people right-of-centre, but that she was dog-whislting her bigotry by ONLY engaging people right of centre and giving a platform to propagandists.

That was the interpretation Zinnia and others figured, but I rejected it, mainly because, unlike a shithead like Rubin, she would actively debate and push back against the propagandists.  That's not a dog whistle, that's smart. As the lack of debate is creating a wider rift where you can't even talk to conservatives anymore.

It's basically the same bullshit that happened to Contra with the Vancouver shit, exact same people leading the charge too. Natalie, however, handled 100x better, but I don't hold it against Laci, we all handle shit differently. 

That said, when I brought this up other people with more charitable arguments said that she was not smart enough, or not hard enough, and that these bad faith culture warriors, like Crowder, will use her to basically shit on the left like Sargon and Rubin tried to do after Vidcon.

And I defended her, but she proved me wrong.
 
https://twitter.com/scrowder/status/1009601797936242688The problem is not the story, it's the context. 

Look if her left-leaning freinds actually turned their backs at her, then that's fucked up and she shouldn't stan or lie for them. However, that is clearly not the right audience for that story and Crowder is clearly not asking in good faith (in the full interview he digged and digged for 15 whole minutes for that soundbite). 

What she did there invalidated everything else she said in that interview. Crowder managed to make her pretty much bury leftism by characterizing it as the deciding factor for her friends ditching her. Now with the context of the rest of the interview (in which she pretty much promoted Social Justice against Crowder) it doesn't make sense for her to do that, it wasn't like with Rubin where that would be the theme, unless she was just manipulated into that position and she didn't even realize it, like the useful idiot I claimed she wasn't. 

And even worse, that fucking snake Crowder placed "LIBERALS HAVE NO LOYALTY" in quotes, giving the impression that she said it (I only listen to the interview once but I'm fairly sure she did not). 

She's just not that fucking smart, not hard enough for this game. If someone as transparently hacky like Crowder managed to play her like a fiddle, then people who actually know what they're doing would turn her into one of those "liberals" Tucker Carlson has on his show for his audience to point and laugh at.

EDIT: 

&gt;also, not to labour the point, but her challenging propagandists in debate doesn't make it any better. The reason propagandists are dangerous, is entirely because they speak in disingenuous terms, they obfuscate their underlying motives, and they maintain a reasonable facade. Propagandists WANT to be challenged and debated because they know they can always win. That's their whole shtick. That's why anyone with two brain cells know not to debate Richard Spencer. Propagandists need to be de-platformed, not given a chance to talk in front of an audience.

Well, I agree with your characterizations of what a propagandists wants, and the dangers of even talking to them, however, I disagree that debating them is not the answer, you just have to know *how* to do it, in a way that unmasks them. Play them, and not let them play you. David Pakman has done multiple times successfully, and Matt Dillahunty did it to Jordan Peterson.

THis idea that anyone can be de-platformed is archaic, it may have done in the 80's but nowadays? The days of Social Media? Look how well "deplatforming" Jordan Peterson went, or Sargon, or Milo.  Why the hell do I even know who Tommy Robinson is? I'm not British and don't give a damn about British politics. Because he was so successfully "de-platformed" that it became impossible not to know about the bastard. 

A Cracked article summed it up perfectly with this analogy

&gt;That's like a mother in 2018 boasting that her 17-year-old son has never seen porn.

&gt;"He hasn't?"

&gt;"Oh no, he tried to go to an adult movie theater once, but I took his car keys."

&gt;"But what about his computer? Or phone?"

&gt;"Phone? Can you call pornography now?"

http://www.cracked.com/blog/7-reasons-world-full-hate-groups-cults/Well, we clearly disagree and that's fine, however, can we agree that someone just the act of debating them would not necessarily be a dog-whistle? You may disagree with the tactic but do we agree that it's not a show of bad faith?Good notice.I am very sad how the left treated Laci Green. I mean, she's only human. Not everybody has the strength of Contra. Have you heard the podcast "words you can't say"? It's heartbreaking.Yes, they treated her as a traitor because she talked to the "others". And they treated her like shit fot it. In fact, they treated her like that before she talked to "the other side". It's very hard for me to empathize emotionally or rationally with the level of hatred someone recieves for talking to "the other side". And sure, Laci broke under the public pressure. Being a public figure is a great responsibility and she wasn't at the level of circumstances. But this microlensing still seems completely dehumanizing to me. Look, take the problem of abortion, that is a hot issue at my country. One of my best friends and her best friend are not talking since a few months. Of course, one thinks very adamantly that the other wants to kill pregnant women and make women be mere containers, and the other thinks the first one wants to kill babies or something. I'm pro-choice, btw. But this is sad, they knew each other since they were 11, I'm trying for them to talk again. I don't know, it seems to me extremely sad. And the level of political polarization in my country... parents who stopped talking to their children, or siblings between each other. My father stopped talking to his best friend for years. In my country it's called The Rift. It's deeply dehumanizing.You mean that debate she did a week ago for that debate channel? But Natalie did the exact same thing when she went on Sargon's podcast a few months ago.Don't try and make nat the only person who can speak to these people. If she's all that the left has to win the culture war (which I disagree with) then we're fucked because the pressure on her will destroy her

Uplift other voices, create/foster an alternative infrastructure to bring such voices into prominence. Having one big movement has never really worked - it's always been swarms of groups/individuals working towards a particular goal with different approaches that has gotten shit done.Contra's lecture on [radical trans biology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6022cz6HIE4) is pretty thorough on the science side.  Doesn't really speak much to nonbinary identities, but it is thorough on the science.&gt;She defends Kat Von D (anti vaxxer),

She didn't defend Kat's Anti-vaxxer views, she just argued that she is a victim of a system of misinformation, rather than a victimizer. Basically calling for empathy in order to correct misinformation, as opposed to ridicule. That's one of the mainstays in her personal philosophy that I've noticed in her videos. A "hate the sin, love the sinner" sort of thing.

&gt; she rarely talks about racism but when she did, itwas to complain that celebrities were just "whining about dumb things" (hotel soap debacle).

Well, that video was from the perspective of a naturally curly-haired person of color talking to another naturally curly-haired person of color about their same experiences with that type of hair, however racism does seem to be a blind spot for her, at least racism against black people (she is more sensitive towards racism against Middle-Easterns, being one herself). 

In the debate against Sargon she argued that there is systematic racism still against blacks, but argued very poorly, and I think she realized it as she tried to move the conversation elsewhere. It's obvious she hasn't spent studying the subject as much as she probably should. 
 
&gt;And proudly calls herself a plain liberal rejecting even to be a progressive. 

Yeah, she's a progressive though. At least socially, she doesn't seem to understand economics really well. She pretty much calls herself a capitalist because she lives in America, which really is the only thing stopping her from calling herself a progressive, as most progressives are critical of capitalism in some form or another. However, the very few times she talks about economics she sounds like Social Democrat. &gt;Kat von D is no more a victim of misinformation than flat earthers.

Yeah, you disagree, certainly can see where you're coming from. I would take this criticism directly to her, however, I would watch the video first if you haven't already (I suspect you haven't) to steel man her but she will likely answer. She's pretty open to criticism from her audience. Very chill about it.

&gt;If she's as progressive as you say then what is she progressive about?

... Have you ever watched any of her videos? Ever? Because so far it seems you're just reacting to the titles. I literally can not even think of a stance of a social stance of hers that doesn't land somewhere in the progressive spectrum. Public nudity, intersectional feminism, BLM, Sex positivism, Non-Binary identities, you name it.  Economics, like I said, it's a bit different. 

&gt;All she's doing is making seem progressives and those further Left to be extremists while liberals like her are portrayed as reasonable enough to engage with racist and sexist conservatives.

A) If that's the case that's not on her, and shouldn't be any of her concern. Imagine having to live your life making decisions based on how it will reflect on a group *you're not even part of.*

B) She's had exactly one debate in her entire Youtube career. It really isn't *all* she's doing, is it? Besides, again, the same charge can (and has) been leveled to Natalie.
It was on his. I just wanted to know [Found a Destiny card](https://forum.yugiohcardmaker.net/topic/75279-something-new-mezia-the-garden-gnome-mage/)3 is a Disney cast member (I think for pirates of the Caribbean) and 4 is Jenny Nicholson, who does movie criticism and used to do a show where she dubbed over My Little Pony called "friendship is Witchcraft". I'm not sure who #1 isMarcos and Proudhon should have more in feminism.It seems so. I must been confused with someone else.Basically, intersex people are those who are typically amab or afab (assigned male or female at birth) who have an abnormality surrounding their assigned gender. This can be anything from an internal testicle in a woman, to ovaries in an otherwise male person.  

This can also present itself as a chromosomal difference from the norm, breaking the gender binary.

It is important to note that unlike being trans, being intersex is not a matter of identity, rather a matter purely of biology, hence why I included that bit on birth assignments at the start. 

Typically these abnormalities are not caught by doctors until they cause issues which is why the majority of intersex people will not know of their condition. It is currently estimated that 1 out of 1500 people are born intersex.


[Here is an interview with an intersex person to wrap this up.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ-GNZ5QA4Q)
Wow, this is a really incredible response. Thank you so much for explaining all this and telling me about your experience.

If it's okay just to clarify the specific point regarding "we see more combinations then that in real life", are there any specific named combinations he's referring to?

Sorry if this seems like a stupid question, but I'm new to this so you'll have to bare with me.A really amazing comment, thank you!

This is beyond my biological understanding so I'm going to reread this as much as I can to make sure I can comprehend it all. You've written it out really straightforwardly so I'm sure I'll be able to, it's just a matter of processing all the information I suppose.Thank you for typing all this out for me. I'm completely aware now that clearly Nye's discussions about the gender spectrum weren't linked with this one throwaway reference to sex chromosome combinations.

However since most of these combinations do constitute a health risk, just in regards to biological sex itself do you think Nye was referring to something else when he made his reference to there being more combinations?That is very interesting, and certainly a subject I'd love to dig into more in the future now I've had this introduction to it.

The last thing I really want to work out though is just specifically what Nye was referring to by that reference to there being 'more combinations' than XX and XY. Was it literal sex chromosome combinations such as those which can cause health defects, or was it something different?

If you have a look at my separate exchange in this comment section with /u/transbeauty you'll hopefully see more context for my query here.

Thanks again for your aid and persistence with this for me :)Thank you, I'm really flattered you've found my questioning as worthy as this.

Alright I can totally see that that's what Nye was referring to. Going back to Steven 'Hitler was a liberal socialist' Crowder's criticism I mentioned in the second post, what do you make of his critique of the fact Nye didn't mention combinations like Turner syndrome etc. tend to cause serious medical problems? Obviously I'm not endorsing this criticism I'm just hoping to explore your thoughts regarding what it reflects, or most likely misses about sex.

And my apologies for using the subreddit /r/ instead if the user /u/. I usually get that right I just flubbed it this time haha.As a scientist (a biophysicist) I can only be thankful of this extremely good science post. I was formed as a physicist and biology complexity never ceases to amaze me.Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. This is just a complicated number of points I'm still trying to get my head around.Is mosaicism counted as a different combination than XX or XY?Demonitaztion, Algorithm fuckery, general fuckery that makes it harder for subs to find your videos if you curse, easy to abuse mass flagging system, easy to abuse copyright system, they "experiment" with your content without a warning etc.  Well, Jim is using Twitch, which is pretty huge too. He is starting to also post his videos to Twitch. He will still upload to Youtube, though. Well, if I'm not mistaken he lives off Patreon making $13k a month (he was one of the early adopters), so I'm guessing that reuploading his content wouldn't be that big of a deal as long as they link to his patreon and don't monetize it. I'm partial to DLive myself. I started uploading my videos there a month ago and while I'm not getting many views (less than 100 per video) the money has been better than I could imagine. Not enough for me to make a living off it, but enough for me to treat myself to the movie theatre and take out more often. It's not likely to last though, it works with cryptocurrencies and those are volatile to put it mildlyShe mentioned in a stream that she turns the ads on but she always gets demonetized except for, ironically, her two anti-capitalism videos.Awesome, thanks for clearing this up for me!

See I was still stuck wondering whether Nye only meant combinations that weren't specifically XX or XY in terms of the literal letters, but I see it's a lot more complicated than that.Will do, thank you!It's radical centrism that's the issue. By actively avoiding coming down strongly in any case, he by default comes out on the side of the oppressor. 

You can see something similar in destiny's latest [debate with Boogie2988](https://m.twitch.tv/videos/277674494?t=01h19m49s) who does a similar thing.I've never written fan fiction, or any narrative before, but I'll whip up a short one soon for you guys.Fine then, "Tabby and Adria's Rat Smashing Adventure" coming: sometime next week!Yeah he’s in my mind one of the more under appreciated breadtube creators*Anti SJWs

I think we have the SJWs down on this side for better or for worse lolSo I checked out Philosophy tube some time ago and was underwhelmed with the plain heuristic thinking, luke warm half-failed critical thinking, passive-aggressive indents... and overall... I wasn't enchanted. I wonder if Nat's an anarchist? I find them irritating.

E: Wow. -19. Never thought this sub to be so hostile. I mean, if they'd be a couple I'd be happy for her. I also think she has anough of a head on her own that a collaboration between the two wouldn't "spoil" her content for me. It's not like I dislike the person behind his channel, I'm just not down for his content that much.More work than James Cameron has put into it...

Seriously that movie was announced years ago and we haven't seen anything yet! What did she say again in that tweet that started the "Are Trps Gay" saga? I remember that it was a tentative schedule for about four more videos.It has been 38 days since *Tiffany Tumbles* was published. This is the longest wait we have ever had for a ContraPoints video. Previously, the record was held by the 36-day gap between *Degeneracy* and *Violence*.I laughed at kitchenSync for longer than I had any right to.And look what happened! George Clooney gets hit by a car, Trump got a new supreme Court pick, and the government started kidnapping children! 


I think we know what the cause was...It will come out decades before the actual Avatar 2.Contra would make an amazing guest, she'd be able to share her beliefs extremely eloquently to the people who most need it. Also, it would be a gigantic publicity boost for Contra, Rogan reaches a massive audience.  Rogan also has had other leftists like Jimmy Dore and Kyle Kulinski on his show before so, it's certainly possible. "I'm not a klansman, and I don't agree with them, but I sure love this hood!"Some people are just ignorant and come around to being on the right side of things later. Does she realize what she has said and has implicitly and explicitly endorsed hurt people? Possibly. Has she profited from them most certainly, but the question is does she have the capability to change, and to that I say everyone does.

And the great thing is if she does come around then you still don't have to forgive her for her past transgressions! This is a personal thing for all involved and time will tell what comes of this episode.HYPE EXTENDED CAUSE I HAVE NO MONEY Beautiful To be fair taking your money and running is among the least scummy things a Nazi has done...Oh, sorry from what you wrote I thought he had a patreon that people were contributing to without receiving any content.It's a metaphor for NazisIt’s up there for me at least!I think it could be a comment about the Bailey and Motte rhetorical technique? If that makes any sense in the context; [Motte](https://www.castlesworld.com/img/motte-and-bailey-castle.jpg) 

So bringing the Motte, anchor, down to the implicit point. Or maybe it’s just a script error hahahaI think she means “raze” not “raise” Okay I’m calling it the “sjw reformation”I would not go that far personally. It did stick, but only after years of violent conflicts, including the bloodiest war in Europe besides the World Wars (Thirty Years War)PROMO-NOMO-ACEDOMENO

E: Woah woah that Spengler guy's "Der Untergang des Abendlands". I always new Pegida was basically Nazis and confused people, but now I'm buffled again by how blatantly they draw on Nazi ideology.Yes he is!Which one? I enjoyed the video but I felt like it kinda ran out of steam towards the end? Like I felt nat fell into a infodump - joke - infodump - joke routine after the initial bizarreness. I just thought she was going to do something more with her costume I guess

Still a quality video especially in how it related to the refugee crisisOn the note of unwillingly hilarious youtube dudes, dae who's the wizzard??Omg... this is the amazing atheist?? I had no idea he comes in halloween customes! 

E: [Found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCi-YCoicxs) the video! Magog Morskar and the guy is fo real. Well wasn't this a good sloppy mishmash of degeneracy and philosophy just like she promised long ago. Brought a smile to my face.

Edit: on second thought, I watch more for the philosophy than the visuals. This video was fun to watch but it didn't scratch my itch. Good to have in the ContraPoints library, but it's not one I'll recommend to friends.Yeah I think so. I'm by no means a pomo expert or anything, but in my understanding of the word, pretty much all of Nat's channel and aesthetic are postmodernist. Cuck philosophy recently made a video where he mentioned contra's aesthetic is kinda 80s style. I didn't recognize it because my parents were barely legal back then.Sure, but I’m not certain that’s a problem to anyone but Peterson[Look](https://mobile.twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/991752958638546944?lang=en) what you made him doYes, what he actually said was: “🦀🦀🦐🦐🦐🦀🦀🦀🦀🦐🦐”This video made me question our current grouping of society, made me gay, gave me a butterfly fetish, and made me hungry for Corn Dogs in that order!Agreed. I was a bit disappointed with the side blow against liberal feminism in his latest video, but in general, his videos have left me enthusiastic so far. Will be interesting to see how he's developing further!Best comment yetThe guy is one inch away of doing a good kid's show if only he'd adjust what he says to the way he dresses and speaks!Yeah I was trying to watch some of his videos in the hope he may have some sense of humor but he's just a sad little yapper. ._.I agreee!! As an argentinian I feel we are the West backyards. On the other hand, many times we are more progressive than the people from US and europeans, so sometimes I wish to believe they follow us, hahah.You can do a better censorship job than that.I agree with all of this, but Autogynephilia is — to me — one of the most lucid and elucidating videos on trans identity and the science behind it I have ever seen. I think the fact that she chose to open herself up and display her vulnerability in the therapy-scene alone is enough to make that my favourite of all time.He just combines a bit of difference feminism with benevolent sexism and takes a bit of liberal feminism that is basically capitalist lifestyle. Basically he's indirectly saying that women can't achieve the same as men, and that it's bad for women to strive for those things.

I don't think you can draw clear lines between different types of feminism. I also think that liberal feminism can be intersectional. 

Cuck philosophy would've done a better job either not talking about feminism or doing a separate video about it. It's many-faceted and complex and brushing it off in a side way comment doesn't do it justice. Also taking the lazy low fruit and chosing to represent it through a social media fad. Blurgh.

I'm also opposed to equalizing capitalist with bad. Our current system is too neoliberal, but strict socialism wouldn't be good either. It seems kind of dogmatic.I think it's less about the "West" not existing as more of it not being an absolute unit. Think about walking at the beach and collecting pebble stones. You try to arrange them based on colors, but the more you look the harder it gets to put them into distinct groups. There's more of a color gradient than a set number of different colors. 

You could say that grouping certain traditions, art forms etc. into the category "Western" is a [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic). 

Saying that pebble stones can't be grouped into discrete color categories doesn't mean that there are no green or purple pebble stones. It just means that there is no unambiguous way of categorizing stones in a way that every stone belongs in only one category.

So when people are contrasting "the West" as something good, superior etc. as compared to the rest of cultures, that's kind of futile. Where do you draw the line between what's Western and what's not? And how do you justify it rationally?

You could also say that, since the line between ingroup and outgroup is pretty arbitrary, that people who try to contrast Western-non Western as binary opposites are defining those two categories in self-serving ways, by including everything into the ingroup that appears favorable and excluding those things they don't like.

The goal is not to chastize our own culture exclusively for having an egocentric view on the world, but to promote a more cosmopolitan view on cultural relations to all people. If you think about it, anything else would be contradictory to begin with.Maybe as a follow-up video to degeneracy? They hate that from what I've read.Incels claim that women's dating experience is so much easier than men's. A person who has dated as both is so qualified.

I am an incel in the mildest sense. I am a lonely virgin man but do not identify with the term due to the woman-hating extremists that mar it. Though I have posted to incel subreddits, I mostly post to /r/foreveralone, and I am bit by bit working on escaping my single status.As I understand it - that’s just for patreons, right? Comrades ❤️ I’ll go ahead and delete this then, thanks for letting me know!https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/998611349222674432Exactly my opinion - by far my favAnd by corndogs, ^I ^mean ^dick.All that leaves is the theater experience Fuck yes dude. Awesome attitude. They don't want a hand, and they don't want your help, that's a "cope". What they want is a restructuring of society along the lines of something found in The Handmaid's Tale.

Ironically Jordan Peterson's advice would actually be good for them. They need to clean their rooms. Sort themselves out before they do anything else.Wowww, it would be wonderful for her to express her oppinion on this. I am also a lonely virgin (although opposed to incel ideology) and it would be very interesting her take on that subgroup.Contra is so goood at debating. The distributist debate was awesome. It's sad the left will hurt her so bad if she agrees to debate.I think my argument is aimed towards "Incel" brand incels, and not those who simply can't find partners. 

At this point those that actually call themselves incels are basically affiliating themselves with terrorists. While we shouldn't actively bully them, mocking their positions in a humorous manner should be our key strategy. It most likely won't convince those who are too deep in, but it might prevent some awkward guy from joining a hate group, which we should consider a victory in and of itself.I'd guess it's the same that any attractive woman experience when online dating. Or sometimes in real life too.

Guys who treat you condescendingly, objectify you, sometimes without even realizing it, disrespecting boundaries/stalky behavior, sometimes being manipulative, being obsessed with you etc. etc.I love the music that Contra puts in her videos! And that she (as far as I've noticed) always puts the names of the songs she uses in the video comments.

Recently I rewatched the "Alpha Males" video because I wanted to know what's the name of the beautiful Mendelssohn piece which is in it again. Of course I had to rewatch the whole video then. :PLiberals mean something different depending on the place. In US they are far left, in Europe they are center and in Latin America they are far right. As an latin american ancom, I prefer the term libertarian for the leftist form of liberalism, but I guess it depends on the culture.They are not fans. But they will still hurt her.Do you remember anything in the quote? What was it about — generally?Satan rallying his troops after their fall from heaven. Good video except he conflates neoliberalism with anarcho capitalism and what people in the US call libertarianism or conservatism.



A lot of neoliberals believe that a strong social safety net (including public healthcare and welfare) are necessary to cushion the harsh effects that free international trade can cause. Neoliberalism doesn't see as much of a tension between market freedom and domestic public goods as the AnCap/US "conservatives" do.Nvmd found it

16:17With all the extreme misogyny I've seen on the incel subreddits, I would forgive her for mocking us. That said, I understand that there are a lot of ForeverAlone men there who just want a safe space and aren't afraid to call people out on their bullshit. I was one of them. Then I realized that you can do most of that on the kinder /r/ForeverAlone and /r/IncelsWithoutHate.Philosophytube also says that liberals are "incredibly effective in furthering fascism". He's immature, passive-aggressive, lacking intellectual rigor, and at the extreme end of the political spectrum himself.

I've already been downvoted to -20 on here for criticizing him on here with a much less sharp comment, so I'm expecting nothing good coming from this, but dinklebot117 should be aware of what he's being suggested here.

A person who sees liberals as their enemies and blames them for the existence (or prominence?) of fascism in society shouldn't be your first suggestion to introduce someone to liberalism.

Point in case, an academic sub like r/AskSocialScience would be a much better place to ask this question.There's already a lot of comments but I'll try to add an answer anyway.

The word "liberal" is derived from latin "libertas" which means "freedom". "Liberal" therefore means in the broadest sense "free from rules". 

Of course most of liberal politics does not promote or represent an *absolute* absense of rules, but rather a relative one. Meaning that when you look at the scope of political opinions present in a society at a given time, a person with a "liberal" political mindset would be a supporter of rules which are rather weak or admissive compared to their political opponents.

In America, "liberalism" is colloquially used as a term for left-wing politics. This differes from the academic use and the way the word is used in most of Europe.

One way of categorizing political positions is through a [two-axis system](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Political_chart.svg/220px-Political_chart.svg.png) in which every political position is assigned a value in terms of its standing on the liberalism-authoritarianism dimension and on the progressive-conservative dimension.

The liberal-authoritarian dimension shows you how much a certain position is characterized by strictly enforced rules vs. the absence of rules.

The left/right or progressive/conservative dimension tells you how much a political position is oriented towards tradition and maintenance of existing structures vs. innovation and future visions.

So what follows from this chart is that there are forms of liberalism which could be characterized as left-wing and some which are right-wing. A left wing liberal political concept for example would be social democracy, where aspects of capitalism and socialism are combined. Whereas a right-wing liberal position would be neoliberalism, in which taxes and market regulation are opposed (a more "pure" implimentation of capitalism).Of course in politics everything is interconnected, but I don't see how socially liberal policies are inadvertently accompanied by economically liberal policies. Most of Western and Northern Europe is more socially liberal and economically regulated than America, to various degrees. 

I think the key difference between left and right wing liberalism is humanism vs. indifference. 

Social liberalism, or left-wing liberalism, which can include economic stances such as supporting redistribution of wealth to a certain extent, is based on an image of humanity in which the individual is a subject who has worth and who's inner worth is derived from their personhood. The idea is broadly that people know best what's good for them, and that their free will and the differences in what they want is what gives them value as a person. This intrinsic value of individuality and personhood is then translated into the political goal of protecting people's liberty to decide what life they want to live.

For example, a left-wing liberal would support gay marriage because they care about their fellow human's ability to live a life that they want and enjoy.

In opposition to that, right-wing liberalism is in its core a result of indifference. For example, a right-wing liberal would support gay marriage because they don't care what other people do with their lives. 

The flip side of liberalism out of indifference is that minorities or marginalized groups are not actively supported by right wing liberals. A right wing liberal would say that they don't care if a gay person marries, but they also don't care if a gay person is denied service by a provider.

In this way "indifferent liberalism" can actively contribute to marginalization.

I may argue that right-wing liberalism is even an effective way of maintaining existing power structures in a society. The benefit of being a right wing liberal rather than conservative is that it is much harder to hold you responsible for the suffering of marginalized groups, inequality, etc. It' all about what you did not do, rather than what you did.

Disclaimer: This is a schematic outlay and you can apply various degrees of deconstruction to it. Of course there are right-wing liberals who do support i. e. gay marriage because they care for the person.Two things: 1) Socialism can be liberal 2) you split the world into pro- and anti-capitalist, which does not represent reality.You seem to have an oversimplificated worldview. &gt; Her birthday is October 22nd

1. Natalie completely deletes the videos, this should give her a fresh slate, but will deprive the audience of some well made videos.

2. Do "Contrapoints Remastered". These would be remakes of the pre transition videos that would replace the older ones. The drawback here would be the time needed to do it.

3. Put a disclaimer before each video. This would inform the new audience, but wouldn't fix Natalie's problem of them coexisting alongside her current content.

4.Delist them, and put them on a separate channel. This would solve the coexistence problem, but would make it hard for people to find them.

5.Completely remove them without acknowledgement.

Hopefully she finds a solution that makes her happy with the least amount of effort possible."Tabby Swung first""Tabby Swung first"What if she has a contest to submit drawn/animated versions of the video and have their be a vote by committee? The original audio can be kept, and she never has to actually rewatch them again.Eiynah (ExMu podcaster friend of Natalie) calls this out of the blue phenomenon "but what about Islam?"

Summed up Dawkins' ridiculous tweet he made this week.I joined a flat earth group that was pretty Bible-based, and they banned LGBTQ activity (no gay, tran).

I really hope you are able to contact them. And good luck for Warren!! I will repeat what others already said. R/breadtube is the place to go for an ample variety of leftist youtubers.

And it's actually dangerous because what happens is if a man's friends find out that the woman he's dating is trans, he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity by lashing out violently against the trans woman he's dating.I think where we split is the issue of persistent personhood. In both the transitioning and Pluto examples you bring the crux of the issue down to labeling, yet you say nothing has changed about either subject. However doesn't this viewpoint basically define gender soley as social costuming? There must be something innate about gender for people to want to transition, it's just a matter of personal reflection and discovery.He was aware of her transition prior to watching both videos. I was trying to see if he was a hypocrite because he believes that she is a woman in both videos, but only the female presenting one makes him uncomfortable.

This post was also triggered by being reminded of [this book](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/instagram-banned-photos-images-body-hair-sexuality-fat-race-feminism-archive-molly-soda-arvida-bystr-a7620101.html)Didn't someone here ask for this like a week or so ago?Yes, I did.I think Philosophy Tube may have been refering to Cuck Philosphy's recent video.My intuitive response to reading OP's post was that their friend is probably uncomfortable in seeing a "male" body sexualized. In Contra's pre-coming out video she presents herself mostly naked, but within the boundaries of traditional masculine gender expression, that is, not very sexualized. 

In her recent video, Contra presents herself in a more sexualized manner.A bit late but whatever. Personally I think they may be uncomfortable due to seeing an AMAB person in a sexualized manner. Contra has a "masculine" body still mostly and she's presenting in a female gender role (that is, in this instance: sexualized).

Most people are so used to seeing AFAB people naked in the media all the time, they've become insensitive about it.

But many men feel uncomfortable seeing erotic material involving AMAB people. Well maybe. I think theoretically the knowledge that the person in front of you "used to be male" alone could lead to discomfort in some people. 

I personally feel that female naked bodies are less taboo today than male ones, but that may just be a personal or cultural difference. Oh. Now I'm hopeful she's actually going to make an incel video!

I don't really like Philosophy Tube that much but yesterday I watched his intro to Hegel. It seems like leftist Youtube match up their contents which is kinda neat. Do you mean debates she wasn't hosting? Because there is a [good one](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=igvA7LP6IA8) with Destiny and Theryn, but Natalie dipped out early. And believe me she won when she left early, because it turns into a shit show towards the end!It's there nowStream is so thirsty.Sorry for ruining the stream by bringing the 🍞 back guys 😞By Martini do you mean vermouth?  There are tons of well-accepted martini recipes that don't include vermouth.

Then again, of course somebody with an Abigail Cockbane handle would be essentializing martinis.She has! (Unlisted, at least - I can access through direct link.)

She didn't reply when I asked on Twitter though... 😣It wasn't that messy but I can see why it got deleted.  I watched the whole thing.  Chat was super horny and started shipping every combination of leftist and alt-right youtubers.  Kept asking Ollie to strip (he undid quite a few shirt buttons for us).  Contra protested it some and also at times played into it a bit.

It was fun for the crowd that was there late at night, but I could see how it might not translate well for other crowds.They're gonna have to make up for this 🙄🙈
I hope they're secretly doing a collab... I got a sense that they did a lot of collaboration last night after they turned off the stream...This is wild speculation...One guy continuously threw money at Natalie to get Ollie to take his shirt off. By the end of the stream they got him to unbutton it halfway so it almost worked. Also they played Jackbox at the start of the stream, but I came in after that.Things like the Mexie stream are actually kinda rare. Unless a stream is said to be serious before it starts it always ends up like last night. I think the reason the shipping was that hard is because Natalie is almost never actually in the room with the people she is streaming with, and she typically hasn't played along with the ship beforehand. 

It really was the perfect storm.It's more of a meme than actually wishing these people are in a relationship. In Natalie and Olly's case it's built off of either real or joke sexual tension (you can see this in the PhilosophyTube video "should you watch the news"). You can also see this in the cooking stream they did and the 200k subs PhilosophyTube stream.

People latch onto this and repeat it as sort of a premade joke, and a way to identify with the in group.

I'm against shipping real people (or shipping in general), but I think people do it as a form of self insertion into a relationship. We understand! We're just bummed we missed it 🙈

And we still love you anyway ⭐🖤

Edit: I'm sorry for defying your wishes; for my penance I will host a ContraPoints marathon with booze and popcorn.Also, we're waiting for the collab 😋CollyPoints confirmed.

Edit:  NatollyIt's as if Athena came down from Mount Olympus to personally strike down those who strayed from the path!Is it good?There was that time those Europeans showed up in boats and took over the place... They really could have used ICE then!If that's what it takes I will not hesitate Was considering becoming a patron anyway. Thanks!

Not sure why I'm being downvoted, I tried my best to not be creepy. Just genuinely want to say thanks and I want to know the best way to do that.Oh.

Had not considered that but it makes sense.

Guess I'll have to make it an open letter then!Just wanted to say to don't hear the naysayers. You are doing a wonderful job on converting rightist people. I feel so much love from you!!! And so much nuance and actual conversation. I believe you are special out there.Poor guy deleted his account, ICE must have got to him.I was about to make the joke: "What better way to introduce a Neo Nazi than with a song composed by a Proto Nazi!" before you posted that!

Thanks for saving me from embarrassment (and slander)Unfortunately it's unlisted and I don't know of any working link.  If there is one it's probably just for her patreons, but even that's no guarantee (unless you ask somebody who is).I don't think it was weak, but I do think that the structure was more "train of thought" like. It actually reminded me a bit of how Vsauce structured his videos where he would start with a broad question, and then somehow end up somewhere completely outside the purview of the original topic.Thats actually pretty helpful.  I was really looking for some interperetations or texts about the more canonical guys to start out with because I know they are probably too dense for me to start with but still important.  Ill definitely check out that youtube channel. ThanksThat's actually an incredibly good point. I think, on some subconscious level, I was bothered by this. I feel like you summed up my gut criticism of the video more than I did in the OP. She explains "The West" as justification for the Westerners, but never "The West" as it existed to its victims. In the end, unwittingly though it may be, I feel this episode almost vindicates the West's crimes as being only individual acts rather than part of the sociological trends that make up the West's actual history. This isn't helped by her point about the West being no worse than any other culture. It ignores the effects being a colonial power has on a culture's sensibilities almost entirely. It's not like Westerners are biologically predisposed to commit crimes against humanity, but rather our culture has been and continues to be one that is prime to take this position in world politics.

This reminds me (though it isn't a direct comparison) to Leftists who, attempting to be racially progressive, act as Islam apologists (rather than defenders of muslims, the people). Rather than being ideologically stable, they jump to their opponent's contrary. "The West" isn't real, rather than saying it just isn't worth preserving.That was certainly communicated, but that doesn't mean it was communicated *well*. This video was structured a lot more like a video essay than usual for Contra's channel. An essay isn't supposed to jump from point to discordant point without ever thoroughly weaving the points together. I accepted her conclusions because I came in believing similarly to her. Someone who disagrees will absolutely not be convinced because she fails to convincingly craft her message.

I love her videos, but this one was a stinker.That could have worked, but she very clearly frames the video as being about disproving the existence of "The West" as an entity. If the video were called "Thoughts on the West" and she went from point to point *without* the broader structure present in the actual video, allowing viewers to come to their own conclusions, I would see your point.Not available in my country 😣 fuckHighly recommend checking out [Thaddeus Russell](http://www.thaddeusrussell.com/). He's a former socialist turned centrist libertarian who loves postmodernism and wants to debate Jordan Peterson

[This is a video in which he explains why libertarians should be postmodernists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Lzo5ywutEc)&gt;Does the large usage of philosophy by leftists make people turn away?

I think it's interesting you introduce this point, because, I don't know in which of her videos, but contra suggests at one point in her videos that one of the reasons the left may be less popular than the right today is that the right talks about "big questions" while the left just tells people what not to do.

In your second paragraph, you introduce a few ideas which are valid but (imho) not necessarily linked to "talking about philosphy" per se.

&gt;Due to how it doesn't tend to go deeper into how the ideas would end up applied into the real world.

The famous leftist "ivory tower". I agree with you on this quite a bit. As a social democrat I often feel frustrated with people who identify as anarchists, or think that the ideal state of society would be 100% socialism, for example.

&gt;Like on the topics of Capitalism and the like where sometimes it can sound like even the idea of enjoying something is wrong.

This is also kind of belonging to the topics of dogmatism/moral prescrpitivism and extreme devotion to an ideology. I think this part is universal to all extreme ends of the political spectrum.

I think the difference between the left and the right in terms of how they include philosophy in their political agenda is complexity. If you look at guys like Sam Harrs and Jordan Peterson, well, first of all, they misrepresent existing academic discussions and terms, but they also sell very simple, bold and striking ideas, with clear goods and evisl, clear instructions of what to do, think and want.

To be fair, this characterization of the right may not apply to more moderate positions.Thank you, you are a gentleman, a lady, and/or a humanitarian.Hey thats a really intense and personal account thanks for sharing.  I definitely see what I take to be the biggest difficulty associated with post-modern thought appearing in there, which is the horrible feeling of nihilism that comes with dissolution of value structures.  I met a fairly serious post-modernist at a party a while ago and we got to talking about this because he wasn't understanding why Peterson was so popular. I explained to him that you could see a lot of what Peterson is doing is something like "reconstructionism" where hes giving better explanations for the values that post-modern thought tore down that are more acceptable to the skeptical consciousness that people now have.  If it is possible to reconstruct a worldview that actually sees positive meaning in things its really helpful for people struggling in this strange millennial nihilistic malaise.  That was pretty convincing for him, I dunno if it would be for you or not.  Something I'd add about the issue of gender being a social construct is that even if you won't accept the biological arguments against that position its worth considering that an enormous amount of artistic beauty emerged in the history of different cultures.  While gendered imagery and expression is necessarily constraining it also provides a framework for a lot of beautiful and interesting forms of artistic and self expression.  This is one of the things that makes Contra so interesting is that she doesn't reject gender as a concept, but rather uses it as a basis for creating a really compelling aesthetic.  This is also something you see contrasted a lot between gender mixing vs gender rejecting non-binary sorts of people.I have the Zizek book because he's explaining Lacan whos a foundational pomo thinker as far as I can see. I also want to read explanations of the writings because I know how dense they are and I don't want to start to formulate too many of my own interpretations before I know the general interpretations.  I've been seeing a lot of recommendations for discipline and punish so I will look at that for sure.  I may actually go back to the greeks at some point, although I want to do the pomo thing first.  Thanks for the tipsThats a pretty good suggestion, Im still not quite clear about the connection to pomo in art and pomo in philosophy though.  Thats interesting that you include David Bowie here.  I know hes quite a big Jungian and that seems hard to reconcile with pomo because of how archetypal thinking is all about connecting the sort of grand narratives that pomo challenges the validity of in the first place.  I wouldn't be too surprised to hear someone say that he did have a bit of a postmodern kick at least for a while anyway. 


Im a big fan of Pulp Fiction and Blade Runner also.  Do you think you'd be able to offer a quick explanation of what makes them seem postmodern to you?  That would be extremely helpful.  Thanks for your replyAnyone who calls a volunteer trying to rescue kids from a cave a “pedo” is a bad person imoThat doesn’t make it right though - ESPECIALLY since he is a very public person with a lot of influence, like it or notThanks a lot this ks a good source Telsa normalizing electric cars and making them sexy is a win, as is his space stuff although he rode off the backs of  government subsidies.

[My favorite comparison is this which compared him to a libertarian Lenin](https://c4ss.org/content/50953). *"Freedom, if it is to come, must come through their benevolence. Just don’t ask when."*That cut to Tiffany at the end is brilliant.You don't debate /u/remove_zedong - you ignore him.I can't help but crush on pretransition Natalie so hard... like she was super sexy with style (you don't see that in cishetmen so often) and she was intelligent smart and sensible. O.O Not that she doesn't have these qualities still, it's just that I'm androromantic (I think I just made up this word...)&gt;"the political views that most Americans actually hold." 

Holy shit. It's beyond me how anybody could ever make that claim about *Ayn Rand.*My first thought was that she might be going for that underdog appeal. It's easier to smear a thinker if you identify them with the establishment.Can I ask you to put her case as strongly as you can? I'm curious if you know what you're criticising.I think that, given the common meaning assigned to concepts such as self-interest, your analysis is right. However, to understand what she means by self-interest you first have to understand her view of the self - that is, of man. And in order to appreciate that, you have to understand her view of consciousness. Of the nature of concepts, and how they are useful for survival. Of how man's mind allows him to function as a producer of values, which requires a total rethinking of the common zero sum idea of ethics. At each step there is a radical departure from the philosophical mainstream, and without understanding the preceding ideas it's impossible to accurately deal with the surface ones.What? I'm asking you to state what you know about the position you're criticising, dum-dum. Being able to clearly state your opponent's position without distorting it is like debate 101.I don't even know what that means.No, we're in a pointless disussion. Bye.I want you to do this because if you're unable to state her position, you don't know what you're arguing against. And this seems to be the case.What you're giving me is a narrative, not her stated positions.You don't have to read my mind. You've given me your interpretation in another comment, which I'll take to be the extent of your knowledge of her philosophy.Yes, she was very literal, I'm not talking about symbolism. I'm talking about defining your terms within the context of more fundamental propositions, which is essential to understand her higher level ideas.THANK YOU SO MUCH. This is it. Gender Dysphoria vid, about 7:25 in. Thank you. Yerthebest. More specifically, it's about the difference between the D and the GD.&gt;Rational self interest is inherently a good thing

That is not what she says, and more: without reference to her idea of rational self-interest, and her justification of it (because it's not an inherently or self-evidently a good thing, it needs to be proven to be good), taking the concept as a primary results in a person substituting their own idea of self-interest, which for most people is: 

&gt; The pursuit of wealth/ power above anything else could involve tons of exploitation and could involve a lot of death/ suffering for no reason other than profit. 

There is a lot to unpack in this view. First, the idea of wealth and power being pretty much the same thing. Wealth is the abundance of goods, or things which people value. *Economic* power is the ability to produce wealth and to offer other people comparatively great value in trade. In the process of production and trade of wealth, nobody is harmed because everyone by definition is better off. In production, the employees are paid their agreed salary for the job, which they have judged to be in their self-interest to take. In trade, the people buying the goods (provided it's done voluntarily) have judged it in their self-interest to give up a particular amount of cash for the goods which they presumably value more. The company gets the money, which it values more than the item sold. Everybody's wealth was increased, and everyone saw that all of these exchanges are int their own self-interest. So it doesn't make sense for us to talk about exploitation or death in this context, unless we are talking about:

*Political* power. Political power is the ability to use force to gain a value from someone against their will. It is the situation where trade is not voluntary, where human rights to life and property and freedom of association are not observed, and can thus be described as exploitation. 

Rand's thesis is that exercising political power is not in anybody's *rational* self-interest. To the extent of the presence of political power in a society, the production of actual values is impaired. If property rights are insecure, producers are A. unable to retain what they have produced or to trade it legitimately, which interrupts the creation and expansion of wealth (for all involved) and thus B. they are disincentivized from further engaging in the process of creating wealth.

A "looter" as she calls it, would have to rely on the existence of property rights (since they are necessary for production) to violate them for his own survival, which is a major contradiction and is thus not in his *rational* self-interest. Rational means logical, noncontradictory, in the full context of one's life. Examined on that level, what he is doing is irrational.

&gt; Whats more is that I don't think one can even claim that it's for a greater good. I don't see a greater good in accumulating lots of wealth/ power while lots of people suffer despite it.

People tend to suffer because of a lack of wealth - or more precisely, because of their inability (in terms of political environment) to create it and engage in trade. It's not an accident that poor third world countries are also the ones that score lowest in property rights security and economic freedom. The people there are largely unfree to create the value (or tradeable value-equivalent) necessary for their own survival, and are often unable to retain such measly wealth as they are able to create, because of the total disrespect for property rights. What needs to be addressed here is their inability to improve their own condition - not someone else's ability to improve his own (blaming the wealthy). The best thing a rich and influential man can do for the international poor is not to give away his wealth, but to either enable them to come to countries where their labor can be productive, where they can improve their lives by their own effort (which is why I'm for open borders) OR attempt to enact political change in their homelands in favor of political freedom.

The same principles apply to the poor on home turf. To the extent that people are socially immobile (assuming they're hard-working individuals) it is only political force that can be blamed.

&gt;She also has this point about how freedom is a virtue. Freedom to do what? Freedom for whom?

"Freedom, in a political context, has only one meaning: the absence of physical coercion." - Ayn Rand.

When there is no coercion in a society, the people who stand to gain are those who do honest work to improve their lives. This emphatically does not apply only to the rich, but to literally anyone who is honest and working.

&gt; In general she presents a totally "free" society ( defined as a society where various market interests can themselves fight amongst eachother for control of finite resources and cheap labor) as a free society.

That isn't the way she defines it. In fact, what you're describing is a situation that arises when political force becomes an option for special interests. In a free economy, there isn't a fixed amount of wealth that people are competing to get for themselves. In a free economy, wealth is created in each economic interaction. I've described the principle above.

He might be an asshole, but we need electric cars if we want to end climate change, and I am willibng to forgive him anything if he gets electric cars.Alythough I never read her in a direct way. I believe Ayn Rand is not sincere about how capitalism works. Her model of entrepeneurship and anarchocapitalism is completely at odds with the corporate finantial system. In other words, I believe corporations are moochers. So in a sense I agree with her, I just believe anarchocommunism is the right way to take off the moochers. I believe capitalism inherently leads to monopolies.

Since steelmanning is a good idea, could you help me see in what sense monopolistic finantial corporations are not moochers in an Ayn Rand's sense?I would love Natalie speaking about incels. Specially because I believe she can empathize better with them as well as having a clear view of why are they wrong. I kind of trust her on dealing with this issue more than other people.Nothing to add to all these people, just wanted to say that Foucault is waaaaay easier than Derrida. I kind of dislike strongly Derrida, but I like Foucault a lot. I also recommend Marcuse (The unidimensional man), since it is Marcuse specifically the person JP has in mind when he thinks about "cultural marxism".&gt; This seems to assume that the acquisition of goods didn't come from the possession of economic power, or that economic power is a single dynamic as opposed to multiple dynamics at play.

I've identified the dynamics of power as economic and political. I'm trying to separate out different concepts that have been served as one package. I don't see how you can ascribe any malice to any aspect of economic power in absence of political coercion, unless you believe that:

&gt;I don't see the absence of physical coercion as being inherently more free. People who work in underpaid factories, people whose children have crippling illnesses that they cant afford treatment for, etc.... are no less coerced in my eyes than people who experience physical coercion. The only difference to me is that we've sold people on this idea that it's more "free" to be coerced economically than physically.

I think without establishing the difference between political and economic power, I can't meaningfully address your other charges. So I'm going to refer you to the following passage from Miss Rand:

"What is economic power? It is the power to produce and to trade what one has produced. **In a free economy**, where no man or group of men can use physical coercion against anyone, economic power can be achieved only by voluntary means: by the voluntary choice and agreement of all those who participate in the process of production and trade. In a free market, all prices, wages, and profits are determined—not by the arbitrary whim of the rich or of the poor, not by anyone’s “greed” or by anyone’s need—but by the law of supply and demand. The mechanism of a free market reflects and sums up all the economic choices and decisions made by all the participants. Men trade their goods or services by mutual consent to mutual advantage, according to their own independent, uncoerced judgment. A man can grow rich only if he is able to offer better values—better products or services, at a lower price—than others are able to offer.

Wealth, in a free market, is achieved by a free, general, “democratic” vote—by the sales and the purchases of every individual who takes part in the economic life of the country. Whenever you buy one product rather than another, you are voting for the success of some manufacturer. And, in this type of voting, every man votes only on those matters which he is qualified to judge: on his own preferences, interests, and needs. No one has the power to decide for others or to substitute his judgment for theirs; no one has the power to appoint himself “the voice of the public” and to leave the public voiceless and disfranchised.

Now let me define the difference between economic power and political power: economic power is exercised by means of a positive, by offering men a reward, an incentive, a payment, a value; political power is exercised by means of a negative, by the threat of punishment, injury, imprisonment, destruction. The businessman’s tool is values; the bureaucrat’s tool is fear."

So unless you want to bring this up again, I will henceforth assume that that distinction is valid and clear by now.

&gt;This seems to ignore dynamics both historical and contemporarily. It presumes that workers can't be underpaid, abused in the process of working, that trade between countries is made on fair and equitable grounds, that trade doesn't involve the creation of pollution/waste that harms outside people, that the trade of natural resources is done in a way thats sustainable/ helps the local community, etc..... 

Some of these points are valid, some are not.

1. What do you mean by underpaid? Compared to what? The market wages of his particular profession? Well, assuming no physical coercion or threat thereof takes place, exchanges will have to be performed at market price for both parties to accept them. Compared to what they were promised in the contract? That is a violation of property rights and does not constitute trade within a context where property rights are upheld. Compared to the value created as a result of the worker's labor? This varies widely between professions, but the general rule is the majority of that value was contributed by investment in machines or infrastructure or all sorts of capital goods. The investors need to make their money back and have it worth their time. The laws of supply and demand dictate what amount the worker takes back, what his management takes back, and what investors take back. There are many information inputs there that influence the market price of labor, so it's meaningless to speak of incorrect pricing, unless someone's getting swindled - but we're assuming property rights are respected. Compared to what the worker needs? I believe that the worker has the right and responsibility to take care of his own needs. Nobody has the right to tell him what to do with his life - but neither does anybody have an obligation to provide him with a living. If he wants a certain standard of living, he has to be able to purchase it with the value of his own work. And assuming, to repeat myself so that this point is not forgotten, that he lives in a society where property rights are respected, he will have every opportunity to move up the ladder. But if he needs it, he has to earn it himself. Nobody is entitled to force other people to take care of his needs, if other people do it it's moral only so long as it's voluntary for everyone. So I'd tell him to get a better job, or to cut down on his expenses, or ask for help from a charity or from his friends or online - all things r/personalfinance would tell you just as well.

2. Abuse that violates a person's personal safety or which includes threats of breaking contract should be illegal, and dealt with by the government (or a rights enforcement agency, but that's a whole other story). If this abuse is verbal or psychological, that is a private matter and should be dealt with by leaving the company (which people do all the time because of a dysfunctional workplace culture so don't tell me it can't be done).

3. Trade between countries is a separate issue insofar as it involves tariffs, treaties, trade deals, regulations enforced internationally. But insofar as it's just private individuals buying and selling to each other across the border, the issue of "unfair terms" does not come up because both parties have to agree to them first. Again, I'm assuming contracts are secured by law.

4. On the issue of pollution or waste, insofar as the damage is demonstrable in court it is a violation of property rights and the offender is subject to the same charges as someone who, say, breaks a window in his neighbor's home. If the environment is owned by different people, settling such issues becomes a simple matter of property protection.

5. I don't know what that means. Generally, new businesses opening up in the area tend to benefit communities greatly.

I'm gonna take a break for now and will type out the rest of my response later. Let me know if you even want me to, or find this informative.Oh, she could be irrational as hell in her personal life. In psychology, she ignored heavily the importance of emotions, repressed her own, and paid a heavy price in her own demeanor and attitudes. So yeah she did and said a lot of things she couldn't prove out of her own emotional responses which she failed to recognize as such.Nice idea. I've heard worse ideas!Hmmm, I'm more intresting in English, History, Cinema and political science. Is there anyone you could recommend at U of T in those fields? I'd be happy to answer that question.

First of all, she would say that these corporations as they exist in current form are a creation of the state. Their monopoly is a legal one, that is, it is enforced by an entity which has the monopoly on the use of force in a georgraphical area. The privileges that come along with that are subsidies, bailouts, regulatory capture, all things that make it impossible for potential competitors to enter the market, and all things that make them moochers on the taxpayer's dime.

Now, apart from the whole legal monopoly aspect, Rand viewed financial institutions in general as perfectly legitimate and valuable entities, whose purpose was to channel the capital leased to them in the most profitable (read: productive) direction. In Atlas Shrugged, she referred to money as the lifeblood of an economy, and to banks as its pumping heart. There are more things to be said about the economic benefits of such institutions, but I'll stop here.
The overwhelming majority of the comments here don't just criticize Rand, they misrepresent her. As someone who studied her philosophy I don't have a lot of interest for surface-level criticisms that come out of reading a one paragraph summary on some third party website. I have not seen one comment which did not build a strawman of her views and engaged her ideas based on what she actually said. (Not to mention just straight up insults and hostility which didn't even pretend to address ideas.) This person in particular seemed willing to engage in a deeper discussion where I could have the chance to challenge some fundamental ideas instead of answering charges of "Rand believed one should put one's life in the hands of greedy technocratic corporations and if they don't they're a pathetic moocher who should just be sent to a gas chamber."


But you're right, I came here as an objectivist and not as someone wanting to learn about her philosophy. If I wanted to do that, I'd read some primary sources and form my own opinion.Did you cite those sources for my benefit? I've read some of them, including Nozick's. I can link to refutations of his critique, but what's the fucking point.
Monopolies are not made by legal strategies. Yes, capitalism was generated by the State monopolies on its origin. And yes, non-monopolistic capitalism did exist, for a short term period: 1840-1870, which is the golden age of capitalism. But since 1870 onwards advanced capitalism, which is monopolistic and centered on the finantial system does not need the State to sustain itself. Ayn Rand's analysisis is detached from history. I strongly recommend reading thew historian Braudel to dispel some of the typical anarchocapitalist myths.

I believe that to help you understand what I disagree about Ayn Rand I should talk more about the finantial system. Let's see. As it has been demonstrated, 147 corporations control everything, and they in fact as a sole worldwide megacorporation https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/10/22/the-147-companies-that-control-everything/#5058622a5105

That study was made in 2007 and arguably the system is much more concentrated at the moment (specially if you consider Blackrock and Vanguard who control POLITICALLY the corporations, not only with their money). Why does it work?

Because banks do not need competence to redirect capital to make it the most profitable. Monopolistic capitalism (that is capitalism since 1870) lease capital where it is most profitable. That is true, I agree with that. And that is not the problem with monopolies.

The problem is that what is most profitable is NOT what is most productive. I could mention dozens of examples, but let's take a few of them. First of all, pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies create very few new medicine because the risk is too high. What they create is patents of slightly different medicines that the ones who already exist, and take what the State creates (because the State is willing to take the risk). All that is much much more profitable than creating a completely new medicine, which is extremely risky.

This risk aversion is also happening in Hollywood, where few expensive High Concept movies are wiping out investment in smaller more creative and more risky movies. Something similar is happening in music, where since the 90s music is created in a safe profitable track-and-hook way (https://pudding.cool/2018/05/similarity/).

So let me be clear, profitability actually stifles creativity.

Does it mean that we have to go to some soviet style State ordered economy?

No, of course not, I am an ancom, I disagree with the State system AND with capitalism. Corporations are just micro-States.&gt; Monopolies are not made by legal strategies. Yes, capitalism was generated by the State monopolies on its origin.

You mean laissez-faire? Because I'm pretty sure all of those monopolies (and aristocratic land ownership and other old money institutions) got dismantled because they could not compete on the free market at the time.

&gt;And yes, non-monopolistic capitalism did exist, for a short term period: 1840-1870, which is the golden age of capitalism. But since 1870 onwards advanced capitalism, which is monopolistic and centered on the finantial system does not need the State to sustain itself.

I do agree that this was the golden age of Capitalism, though mine goes on until the 1910's. What happened in 1870? How/why did it become monopolistic?

&gt;As it has been demonstrated, 147 corporations control everything, and they in fact as a sole worldwide megacorporation 

Doesn't the article say that it's more like 40% of wealth, and 80% is controlled by &gt;700?

&gt;Monopolistic capitalism (that is capitalism since 1870) lease capital where it is most profitable. That is true, I agree with that. And that is not the problem with monopolies.

Didn't lenders do that way before 1870? What changed?

&gt;The problem is that what is most profitable is NOT what is most productive. I could mention dozens of examples, but let's take a few of them. First of all, pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies create very few new medicine because the risk is too high. What they create is patents of slightly different medicines that the ones who already exist, and take what the State creates (because the State is willing to take the risk). All that is much much more profitable than creating a completely new medicine, which is extremely risky.

Funny you should mention pharmaceuticals, because the they are probably the most regulated industry on the planet of all time. It's not the risk that is high, the risk is incredibly low because the FDA won't let you get away with anything. The point is, the *cost* is incredibly high both in time and money to jump through all the hoops in the bureaucracy. That's my thesis, anyway.

But even if we ignore all that, you for some reason ignore risk in the calculation of productivity. If the risk is high enough, doesn't it become unproductive to direct your resources to the effort to pursue that particular end? If your medicine does kill a million people who have taken it, surely that will have been both unprofitable and unproductive?

&gt;This risk aversion is also happening in Hollywood, where few expensive High Concept movies are wiping out investment in smaller more creative and more risky movies. Something similar is happening in music, where since the 90s music is created in a safe profitable track-and-hook way (https://pudding.cool/2018/05/similarity/).

&gt;So let me be clear, profitability actually stifles creativity.

Where? In pop music? In big action movies whose whole goal is the widest audience appeal? I would say even there, films have been getting a hell of a lot more creative with big studios getting independent relatively arthouse directors to shoot Star Wars and Marvel movies. But set that aside for a second.

Movies don't all compete for the same pool of money. Each major studio has a division which does more niche, arthouse or foreign films. There are scouts at film festivals looking for the next Quentin Tarantino with his next Pulp Fiction. Then, there are a lot of directors who have fanbases who will see anything with their name attached, not even necessarily big pictures - see Coens, Nolan, Tarantino, Wes Anderson. There are critics, whose function is to discover and promote good movies, there are websites like Rotten Tomatoes that aggregate their ratings and which generate a lot of revenue for otherwise obscure movies.

You see, the nature of capitalism is not such that there is one big daddy Bank or some bunch of fatcats we need to convince in order to make our piece of art. It is our audience that we need to convince to go see it. It is they who are paying for our privilege of being creative. The end user is the audience.

Some entertainment will have as its goal the broadest possible appeal. Some will be niche. Some will be intelligent and creative. None of those are mutually exclusive. They can all coexist, so long as each makes its money back. Not all of them can be the MOST profitable, but none of them need to be. It is only necessary to generate enough of an audience to make back the money you spent making something, and you can have it alongside the biggest hit in the world. It's not all one big pie where the biggest song or movie, to the extent it is successful, means others will fail. And especially now, in the revival of independent cinema, you cannot really make that claim at all.1) Old money institutions did not die out, actually many of them continue to be present. of course, many of them did die out. The most important of them being the East india Company, of course.

2) What happened? The 1873 crisis happened at a worldwide level. Monopolization deepened after the 1890 worldwide crisis, but the process did start earlier. The system highly switched from an entrepeneurial system (where the people who had the money, the people who had the ideas and the people where the ones who direct what the companies did where usually the same people) to the corporation system.

The newly made corporations pressed there countries to be involved into colonial conquests, and a big part of capitalism of the belle epoque -1880 to 1914- was based on colonialism. Eventually, corporate based colonialism gave in to the I world war. You could say that the State was involved, because of course colonialism involves the State. But this still implies the short term of 1840-1870 as the golden age of capitalism and 1870s monopolizations wasn't a consecquence of colonialism but the other way around, I would say.

In US, monopolies tgrew even against the wishes of the State who tried to beget lots of antitrust policies, like the Sherman act http://www.newhistory.org/CH07.htm
We are talking about the time of the robbing barons (like the infamous Rockefeller, or JP Morgan).

The corporation system (also called managerial capitalism) has this system: there are people who have the money, who usually they are the banks and finantial institutions and possess the corporation through stocks. They pay the CEOs who are the ones who make the decissions. Neither of them are entrepeneurs. The CEO just manages an already solid company. And the banks just get the money.

Entrepeneurs do exist in newly formed corporations (specially tech ones at present, like facebook, google, tesla, etc) and are payed by venture capitals and eventually they sell out to the stock system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This does not mean corporations are not trying to be profitable. On the contrary, they are trying very hard. What I am saying is corporations are not entrepeneurs. They just hire engeneers and other people with high human capital to tell them how things should be done.

It is true that they have the incentive to be profitable, because that's what the banks and finantial institutions that own them ask them to. If makinf corporations profitable is our objective as a society, sure, capitalism does its job very well. I'm just saying that making corporations profitable is just not towards we should strive for as a society. We do not owe them anything. They just take our knowledge in their interest, not ours. And they do not always coincide. How about environmental problems? How about payed family leave? How about 8 hours limit in the worktime? And I could list lots of lots of times where societies interests and corporations profits are at odds with each other.&gt;The corporation system (also called managerial capitalism) has this system: there are people who have the money, who usually they are the banks and finantial institutions and possess the corporation through stocks.

The banks don't just "have" the money, they're loaned money by people. And a lot of the time the people who started the company are major shareholders, or have at least a sizeable amount of stock. But this system has existed as far back as stock exchanges have existed, and I fail to see how this is mooching by itself.

In regard to antitrust, it was just one of many self-contradictory policies the State has towards companies. The railroad monopolies before that were enforced by law (licensing etc.)

&gt;If makinf corporations profitable is our objective as a society, sure, capitalism does its job very well. I'm just saying that making corporations profitable is just not towards we should strive for as a society.

No, people in a society strive to pursue their individual ends with the smallest cost possible. Companies, or corporations if you will, are a tool for people to be able to do that cooperatively.

&gt;How about environmental problems? How about payed family leave? How about 8 hours limit in the worktime? And I could list lots of lots of times where societies interests and corporations profits are at odds with each other.

Society has no interests though. You can talk separately about the interests of landowners, workers and consumers. Not of a "society" which contains any number of people each with different values.I see.... well, I'm sure the top 1% who own stocks have some interests who are at odds with the other 99% of people. You do know that stocks are owned by a very very little portion of people, right? I mean, corporations interests coincide with the interests of those 1%.

Like, do you really believe payed family leave and 8 hours legal limit on worktime is not in the interest of society? It sure is not in the interest of the 1%. I'll leave ecology aside, since half of amiericans seem to think global warming is a myth or so.&gt;I see.... well, I'm sure the top 1% who own stocks have some interests who are at odds with the other 99% of people.

To the extent to which they want to see a return on that stock (assuming they cannot do so through violation of property rights, something a government should prevent), they gotta satisfy consumer interests. In the long term, companies that engage in anti-consumer practices don't do all that well, unless they're supported by law.

It's the consumers who decide who makes the money. The hierarchy is like this: worker&lt;manager&lt;CEO&lt;investor&lt;consumer

&gt;You do know that stocks are owned by a very very little portion of people, right?

Too many at the moment in the US. A lot of "forced" 401k plans etc. Too much money in the stock market that wouldn't have been there save for tax pressure and subsidies.

&gt;Like, do you really believe payed family leave and 8 hours legal limit on worktime is not in the interest of society?

It really depends. In third world countries, surveys have been done where "sweatshop" workers were asked if they want to give up some of their pay for shorter hours, air conditioning and breaks. The majority of them said no.

It is a calculation that every individual worker must do. They may unionize if they wish, and demand some common standards from the employer, who may then negotiate with the union for how much in wages they will give up for how large an increase in working conditions.

Working conditions and wages are not paid for by the company. They're paid for by the value of the worker's labor. The higher the value of his labor is, the better conditions/higher wages he can afford. At low labor productivity, people generally want to get as much as they can in cash, because that's what they need the most. At higher labor productivity, work safety and comfort become something a worker might consider (again, perhaps via collective bargaining because there would be too much difference in individual requests). None of these things are charity though, they're either paid for out of the worker's created value, or are investments with the expectation of higher value of his work.

The question you should be asking is, how do we increase the productivity of the worker's labor? The answer is capital investment.Working pays are conditions are NOT payed by the value of worker's labour. If it was, it would imply that Cayman island bartenders would be way way more productive than sweatshop workers in China.

Monopoly corporations do not strive for high investment. If they can invest little so they pay less, they will. Investment has actually collapsed in US. Even if they have record profits. Why would they want to invest if they have easy profits becasue of the low wages?

It's not the consumers interest in. They create the consumer interests by advertisings. If you were right, advertisings would not exist. Corporations control what is bought as well as what is sold.&gt; If it was, it would imply that Cayman island bartenders would be way way more productive than sweatshop workers in China.

Which is true. They are. They are in an environment where their labor creates a bigger value (recreation for a tourist) than the labor of each individual worker in China. Now, they don't work NEARLY as hard, but it's the capital assets around them (location of the bar, quality of the drinks, the music being played) that allow them to do something valuable.

An extreme example would be an elevator operator in the older days, where his only function was to push a button and close the doors. Well guess what? That made it possible for people to live and work in high rises, which so much more an efficient use of land that it justified paying a man to literally stand there and push a button. It is not how much sweat one pours that determines a person's productivity, it's how much value he provides to the employer.

&gt;Monopoly corporations do not strive for high investment. If they can invest little so they pay less, they will. Investment has actually collapsed in US. Even if they have record profits. Why would they want to invest if they have easy profits becasue of the low wages?

Dude, costs don't determine the profit margin of a business. It's earnings minus the costs. Why do you think EVERYONE's not getting paid minimum wage?

&gt;It's not the consumers interest in. They create the consumer interests by advertisings. If you were right, advertisings would not exist. Corporations control what is bought as well as what is sold.

Advertising serves two purposes: persuasion and increasing awareness. But it's still the consumer who ultimately decides whether an ad is convincing.They just are payed much more because the rich people are there. Your definition of productive is kind of circular.

Earnings are not determined by how much quality you have what you give. If you get to have workers who get payed $0. Then the corporations owners will be rich and will be selling and buying each other things. They do not to invest anything, they can just produce enough food for them, the corporations owners, to eat. And, I don't know, jewelry and gold-made IPhones.

In other words, things which are bought by rich people are way more "valuable" on paper than things bought up by poor people. This has absolutely nothing to do with productivity.&gt;They just are payed much more because the rich people are there. Your definition of productive is kind of circular.

Rich people get rich because they are able to satisfy consumer interests. So their productivity is servicing people whose labor among the most valuable in society.

&gt;Earnings are not determined by how much quality you have what you give.

No, they're determined by the laws of supply and demand. The wage ceiling is determined by how productive a person's effort is. The wage floor is the lowest any worker is willing to accept.

Answer my question please: why don't all employees get minimum wage? Why do some earn more? 

&gt;In other words, things which are bought by rich people are way more "valuable" on paper than things bought up by poor people. This has absolutely nothing to do with productivity.

Not necessarily. But a man who looks out for his own interest will pay a lot for something that is objectively valuable, because, being rational, he will be able to recognize its value. So it's up to the consumer to judge the value of goods.Rich people are rich mainly because they were born rich, societal mobility is very low. They do not satisfy consumers interests. They happen to own the companies where the people who actually work (and don't just mooch) satisfy the consumers interests.

Although it is true that human capital specifically does make a small set of people (the upper middle class) not expendable, the big majority is expendable and is payed very little.

But again, I'm not saying that people who make the company more profit will be payed more, I am arguing that it has absolutely nothing to do with productivity.

The wage floor is the bare minimum for workers to have something to eat.

It's not up to the consumer. The prices are not set by the consumer. They are set but the small share of rich people who actually buy the lion share of the things that are produced.What do you think would happen if the richest people just moved away in some valley somewhere? Would the rest of us be better off? Worse?Hmm, so are you opposed to tax havens?Aren't they just such a valley?
But wouldn't rich people necessarily stop paying taxes when they moved? That is, the majority of tax revenue comes from their activity. You'd lose that.What I mean is, if they moved from a country where they provide a sizeable tax revenue, to a country where they no longer pay taxes (and therefore are able to attract the scientists, artists, what have you with higher wages), wouldn't that be harmful on home turf?&gt;Working to fill someone else's pockets and contributing nothing of note to a desirable society leaves people feeling purposeless. And most people want more purpose than 'money,' see the hierarchy of needs by Maslow.

Yeah, like the freedom to do their work the way they want to? A hypothetical libertarian paradise would not have the numerous legal obstacles most societies do place in the way of innovators.

&gt;At this very moment, no outside force is stopping rich people from buying an island and make their tax-free micronation, but even they would rather live in a cultural society where they pay taxes, even if they don't realise it. 

This is diametrically opposed to the truth. They've been trying ever since Atlas Shrugged was being written. In every case so far they've been stopped by nearby governments.

Right now there is the Seasteading project, Liberland and FreeSociety. Free Society is a ~$100 million fund to purchase land and political sovereignty from a government. They have been negotiating for almost a year now. There is the FreePrivateCities project, which promises to have something in the works by this year, but hasn't shown any evidence. People would love to live in a libertarian community, but it's practically extremely difficult to arrange (not from any internal considerations, but because of nearby governments.)

&gt;Can you name something that innovators are being kept from without good reason? 

Pharmaceutical companies have enormous roadblocks in the form of FDA requirements. Any number of people have been denied access to lifesaving experimental drugs because they could not gain approval in time.

FDA as it exists is totally illegitimate. It should at most be an advisory institution, which makes public information on whether a drug was tested, and how safe it is to take - NOT an institution that actively forbids certain drugs being ingested by anyone.

So there's one.

&gt;A hypothetical libertarian paradise will forever remain so, bc it is not desirable to live in one.

Last time a hypothetical libertarian paradise (at least economically) was tried, we got Hong Kong and Singapore. China looked at Hong Kong specifically and used it as a guideline for economic liberalization within the mainland, giving us the megacities it's known for today. See also the United States in the 19th century, becoming the richest country on Earth. See Sweden in the 20th century. See New Zealand since the 1980s. See Georgia, the country.

To the extent to which libertarian principles were implemented, even only economically, prosperity was created and the standard of living had increased. 

&gt;People would love living there until it comes to permanently living there, then they want the fuck out because it's not worth it.

What's not worth what? Can you give a better answer than "idiots quarreling"?

I don't see idiots quarrelling in the examples I cited above. Why should there be any such chaos in a society that takes the principles by which they function, further?

&gt;And them having to work with other governments is reasonable, this planet is mostly covered with functioning societies, no one wants to give up territory so a bunch of idiots can quarrel on it and fail once more.

You're changing your tune. I thought there were no outside obstacles.

&gt;It's unworkable on all levels and just basic ass narcissism and greed.

So what's wrong with that?&gt;But her extreme individualism basically forbid her worldview from questioning WHO the parasites seem to usually be. 

What do you think the answer would be if she had raised that question?She's covered Alpha males and red pill philosophy already, so I think there's quite some overlap to those two as well. But I'm still excited what she's going to make out of this. Oh I thought you were implying she was covert racist or discriminated against the poor. Sorry, misunderstood.That's only true if the virtues she extolled (rationality, independence, integrity, self-reliance) are somehow exclusive to white people, which would be a racist thing to suggest.Theryn doesn't talk to terfs, I think it's more likely anti-SJW twitter. Demotivatoropinion got banned today perhaps because of ShoeonHead and Blaire White's audience. Destiny was banned 4 months ago.  Was Theryn banned in the past? To dream the impossible dream, amigo.Aw I missed the survey. :(

My favorite is "Talking to the alt right" followed by "what the alt right fears". "Gender dysphoria" is also one of my favorites, it has some avant guarde art feeling to it. Alpha males is also among my favs.

But I really enjoyed the AGP as well, it was informative in a way in that it provided more information or thought on the subject than what you usually find on the internet, including some personal insight. 

I think the results on this Reddit poll may be skewed due to Reddit having a pretty huge transgender user base (I think).I hope they're not acquainted, I'd be really disappointed of Shaun.I just looked at Youtube like a maniac three times in a row; WHERESTHEVIDEO? I'm in withdrawal.&gt; I think she believed that it was not worth analyzing or thinking about. It just wasn't something she considered important or worthy of discussion.

You mean the differences in moral character between races? You're right, she did not consider that a valid line of enquiry. I'm assuming you've probably read one of her most famous articles, "On Racism." She says everything that is to be said about that subject there.

&gt;Again, the entire sociological perspective was basically forbidden by her ontology. You could only look at individuals, because to be was to be an individual.

Sociology might be valuable when looking at historical outcomes, but not when evaluating moral character which exists separately in each individual.[I suggested this topic.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/8yzmb2/topic_suggestion_incels/) What do I win?https://youtu.be/fD2briZ6fB0?t=17m50s
https://youtu.be/-Gnmh8oRlfE?t=29sThis video was really good. Like the AGP video, it was informative, interesting, engaging, long (more of my addictive drug, **yes**) and intellectually succinct. I know I'll be watching it repeatedly the next days.

I think you have to give Natalie credit for the fact that she's able to sum up wide-spread, decentered, naturally evolved online ideologies like incel or red pill. I was familiar with the movement and even knew most of their terminology but I wouldn't have been able to put the connections between those singular believes and claims so that you see the coherency of a closed world view.Really? 3800 subscribers. I have no idea how the subscriber: patreon ratio usually measures up but I would've expected it to be more. Hope she'll get more supporters in the future.I think the personality trait you're describing is called honesty-humility by psychologists. Yes they actually have a name for everything!

I like this video especially because Natalie holds the balance between genuine, non-condescending empathy with incels while also at the same time clearly pointing out their mysogyny and distancing herself from those believes.I feel you... I think I'll have to take Natalie's advice to block certain websites on my browser...Haha :) It's been posted there. The comments are actually quite like that, but there's also some funny ones. Like the guy who posted so early you can tell there's a 99% chance he didn't watch the whole video. Or the one who said he's watching the video without sound because Nat's voice is annyoing him. Clearly Natalie poses a threat. 

Maybe for some people this vid is helpful for getting lose of incel. But I could imagine it takes a while to simmer and you're probably also not likely to go back to such a toxic forum to declar that you've fallen of the holy religion.It's kinda incredible to me that Contra doesn't have *more* subscribers anyway. Like she's *so* good. 

I think in a way it may be even good that you can't easily make money of leftist youtube, because it preserves intrinsic motivation (see the overjustification effect where external reward reduces intrinsic motivation). What happens when left wing liberal values become profitable is buzzfeed. And buzzfeed makes my toenails roll up.

But of course I want and wish Natalie to become succesful with her videos, and I hope she's able to make a good living on this. And the same I hope that other leftists will turn up succesful as well.

I just think it's good that you basically have to start out making videos without instantly expecting monetary reward.

Also, care to share a link to your youtube? ;)So Shaun is in the video. All the comments were about Philosophy tube so I thought I must be mistaken in hearing Shaun.I agree to some aspect — but honestly I think it’s less a bias error, because autogynephilia was the first option, whereas WWWC (it’s my favourite too) needed some scrolling to be seen. AGP is also a very visually and formatively striking video, which probably makes it more distinguished as opposed to WWWC, which I think is more subtle and referential. I agree with all your points, except one: I think that there's not so much overlap between incels and actually unattractive people. Like contra said, incels sometimes post pictures of themselves and most look totally normal. Additionally to that, the few times I've lurked on incel subs there were people posting that they actually had a relationship before, but considered themselves "incel" because reasons. Which is funny because incels are so extreme about gatekeeping when it comes to acknowledging anyone else's suffering.

If you go to sites that deal with "incurable loneliness" without a fatalistic ideology involved, you will kind of get the picture that some people are in fact really unattractive and that's part of the reason they're lonely. I think that even on the "usual" FA forums there's a good junk of people that are not FA because they're really unattractive, but because of mental health issues, low SES etc. 

So you see that a lot of incels are not unattractive and a lot of unattractive people are not incels.

The combination of these two observations for me is that the distinguishing feature of incels is not unattractiveness, but mysgyny combined with mental health issues.I think the virgin vs. chad was originally serious, but with other captions. But the version in nat's videos are definitely meant to be satirical by the maker. Not that the original concept of the chad is any less ridiculous, just in a less intentional way...Don't worry, I'm moving out in a month, and the university I'm going to has a very strong queer community. I'm sure I'll have lots of support. ❤️❤️I think with the rise of more visible non binary identities, and a biology that begins to break down the prevailing gender essentialist viewpoint is also helping the bigots. They can play up the idea that people who do not fit the binary are mentally delusional creating an imaginary science, along with the usual bathroom scare tactics. I'm watching the alt-right migrate into my country with politicians appeasing them, and it is scary. I do think there is progress despite all this, I think the generally public are at least a little more conscious of our existence, and in turn more (if a small amount) are becoming allies. Of course I'm guessing with all this, I haven't really experienced much yet. I can only hope that I can find many allies and build a reliable support group.Oh I see. :| You mean, they went private now? Lol seems like too many normies are floating in to see how they reacted...

Unfortunately I wasn't subscribed to the place and didn't see their shut off coming so I can't help in this case. :/As I said in that thread, I am not really an incel. I'm a ForeverAlone who fell into inceldom for a few months and then left, recognizing the addictive toxicity she describes. I never went to the levels of misogyny that the community is known for; I just enjoyed some sympathy and their ability to call people out.

The video is what I would expect from ContraPoints on such a topic: condemning and sympathetic when appropriate, rational all the while. And it is beautifully executed; I agree with other commenters that it's one of her best. I appreciate her treatment of incels very much.

With all that said, a YouTuber sympathizing with me doesn't get me any closer to romance. (Unless she volunteers haha) I'm already following Dark Mother's advice of getting off the computer and going outside.I just want to say that I frankly don't care what society is doing. How are you able to make such a good video!!!!!!!! I cried, I laughed, I thought. How are you able to make such a nuanced and honest video???? I am so grateful!!!

You make me believe there is faith in humanity.It's just a brilliant line. Frankly the sass of Contra is just sooo outstanding.Interest topic, not sure if the style of Contra, but it would be an impressive topic.Let the Dark Mother embrace this naked body.I know very very ugly people who get girlfriends. Which does not mean that lookism doesn't exists, of course it does, it just isn't what's the most important factor in romantic relationships.

About entitlement, we need to agree what entitlement is. Realizing that you feel lonely and wishing for a romantic partner is not entitlement. Acknowledging that many men end up being lonely and have the inability of having a partner, and that this is extremely sad, is not entitlement. Realizing that there are societal structures that produce loneliness and men who are incapable of feel love is not entitlement. Realizing that we need society to change if we want for more love to be out there. But believing that women not loving some portion of mankind make them unjust and evil, or that they should be intimate with people who they do not love or attracted to, is entitlement.

Now, why the concept of "sexual marketplace" is gross? Because it implies an absence and imposibility of affection. This is important. Marketplaces are places where you get what you want and give what you want. But there is no connection in marketplaces, there is no openess, people do not get to know each other. In marketplaces people do not get to stop being strangers.

I've checked the statistics of who incels are, and they are mostly around 20 years old. This is objective, i can send you a link. You should know that at the age when most people self-diagnose incels around 14% of men are still virgins, and more than half of them will loose their virginity in their next 5 years. At my age (27 year old virgin), 5% are still virgin and it is still not an age where men get to be an incel, since most of that percentage falls down at a fast pace after a few years.

My personal position is this: inceldom is a real problem, it is not nearly as related to physical appearances as blackpillers believe (even if lookism does exist and is as real as racism or ableism it is not nearly the main cause of inceldom in our society), there is a cultural structure that make men "unlovable" and it is extremely difficult to sort yourself out, mainly because one of the only ways out is to recognize oneself as lovable even if the whole universe seems to tell you that you are not. I'm strongly on the model Mark Manson's Models proposes about flirting.Ok, I'll take your word about entitlement although I'm not convinces, I prefer talking about the other points.

&gt;Men sell affection.

False.

"To see a person that cares about you and has accepted you in the most intimate way possible"-&gt;This is part of an incel talking about sex in Contra video. This is important, sex is a language of affection, it is not a physical act. Men do need affection as much as women do. It's just they just hide it and sometimes talk about sex as if there was no affection involved. But you know it is false, and it is frecquently talked about it in the context of prostitution by incels.

&gt;Why do you think every guy out there is lovable? If the whole world, particularly women, treat you like shit and don't even acknowledge your existence, then sorry but that guy has not been deemed worthy of love by society.

In fact, this society treats many men as worthless/disposable. You talked about needing a social change. Here it is. But this doesn't mean that because some men are not loved they have nothing to give. And you know that "you can't be loved forever" is not an objective truth, you just say that you haven't had love until now. But look, I know how it feels. I have been through that. I have felt the self-hatred, I have felt the unlovability. I know the pain and the shame. I know the feel of being  burden, and to need to apologize for my existence. I know the feeling of burdening women through my sexual desires. I know all of that. I have been through that. But sadly, I can't explain what it means being on the other side. I know that when you are on that stage, "I have not been loved" obviously means "I cannot be loved". I cannot show you what I see now. The difference of those two sentences can only be seen if you love yourself. Sadly, these men will get loved by other people only after they love themselves first.

I know that you won't like my answer since it sounds completly as a platitude, but I stand solidly on this position. Not having been loved has nothing to do with being unable to be loved.Social isolation is extremely hard, it has been proved that human contact is one of the most basic human needs. By the way, do you know this site that might be of some use to you? 7cups.comWho knows what trans men are thinking of, right?I think Nat kind of erased the experience of one demographic on tinder. Unattractive women. They get radiosilence too, plus it's not socially accepted for them to be active approachers. So I kind of disagree that dating is better as a woman-sure, when you're gorgeous.

But hey, all of media erases the existence of non-fuckable women, so it's fitting Nat didn't mention us either.Try to learn how to talk someone who is in a cult. The most important thing is that you are there for him. Try to be his empathizing ear and to help him make his self-esteem more solid.[http://theconversation.com/how-to-talk-someone-out-of-a-damaging-cult-68930](http://theconversation.com/how-to-talk-someone-out-of-a-damaging-cult-68930)1) leaning to false: women want men who are able to sustain themselves. So in a sense, women are putting up with less bulship from men that in the past. But this does not mean more status than the woman. Hypergamy does exist anthropologically, as a consecquence of patriarchy, though.

2) false: most men are able to attract women.

3) it does exist, but it stems from capitalism: sexual marketplace is the consecquence of capitalism entering in human relationships, as it is well studied by Baumann and his "liquid relationships".

4) false: feminism empowers women to not be subordinate. The ideal is to have people as equals.

All in all, women are putting up with less, but it is not comparative: men can all go up without needing to compete. It is not about PHYSICAL or ECONOMICAL success.Although I do believe Contra was excelent understanding incel mentality, a rational dismissing of their ideology, described in blackpillscience subreddit would help her. Even with all the empathy she has now, she needs not to forget the importance of rational debate even with people with extreme beliefs.Haha :) Good response. I also think that Natalie is a very empathetic person, I don't think she'd be dismissive or invalidating when being confronted with someone else's experiences. If she included all those different experiences, the whole video probably would have been way longer.

It's just something that's been stuck with me for a while, and I needed to get it out.Haha :) You're right. I read up about Shaun on Rational wiki and apparently he reaproppriated the skull from right wingers. I think it's a cool symbol so I'm glad to see leftists using it. :)Three other people didn't either (me being one of them, pls explain)Just wanted to say that "volcel if you wouldn't" seems to be a running meme/gag amongst incels, which shows this brilliance of Contra to actually being able to joke with their jokes. I'm so a fan of her.They mentioned him a lot in the Theryn livestream.Being on the second most recent livestream (the one with espresso martinis and Olly) Natalie seems pretty comfortable with wild speculation and shipping.

There's definitely a line, but that line is somewhere past "holy shit are they looking for a third?"Aye me too (just got back to college)You're a fucking sorcerer, holy shit. I couldn't read thatIf this is what praxis feels like maybe my politics suck Awh, I hope you're doing better buddy. (I'm also a cis acccidental-valour thief who uses awkward sentence structure when drunk)

You're awesomeResponsibly? Maybe not. I'm alive though. You're sweet thoughDrunk connection, eyyyyThe wine tasted oddly like stale beer. Lots of itLookism does exist. It is as real as racism. From there to "someone can't get laid and never will because of looks" is catastrophizing (the same happens with race). I know a very ugly man who has a big burned scar on his face since he was little and he is physically disabled. He has a girlfriend. One of the shortest and physically effeminate man I know it's the most alpha and always gets the girls.

I provide you anecdotal evidence, because that's my point: statistics are not destiny.Yeah. I later thought this must be related to "breadtube" (subreddit for leftist youtube) and someone else posted that *The Conquest of Bread* by Kropotkin is a popular anarcho-communist text, so we know the etymology of that as well.Ah. I see. I figured it must be related to breadtube, but didn't know why that was named this way in the first place either.Exactly. I think she would love to re-vamp those old videos (which I believe are wonderful, but she's still even better now). Also, I think I would love to hear criticism to the more theoric aspects of those framework. For example, what's her oppinion on the role Briffault's law has in society? Or what's her oppinion on why most divorces are initiated by women? I do not have a formed oppinion. But I really trust her.Wasn't there one video called red pill philosophy? Or is that the alpha males one? With Roosh V's bicycle helmet and ugly engorged member. :3Yeah I think apart from a few internet nerds there's no one who's going to imply to you that you're weird for not knowing who this person is. Most of youtube isn't worth to be watched anyway,damn i missed it what happenedYes! She touched it (and I saw she understood it with impressive precision). But I'd love a full point by point debunking.You are thinking about Pick-up artist. More or less, PUA is the practical advice while redpill is the misogynistic theoric/legitimization background.Tabby | Jackie Jackson

Needs Tatiana Tankikova and Adria Finley.memes can be life changingYeah, I think this is chastising and it's bullshit. Nat is a responsible adult. She puts the life stream out there, she has to deal with the fact that people are going to talk about it. It's ridiculous to say that you post a life stream that thousands of people see but... the people who didn't get to see it are not allowed to know what happened.

Plus it's unfair to everyone who's not in the US. Have you not read the first sentence of my post?Yeah. I also think it's also a lot to throw a youtube video into a conversation that is over an hour long and expect your conversationalist to watch it. But that's another cup of tea.I don't understand all these pronouns. Does "It's actually" refer to bottom left or bottom middle? What is "that video"? "It can be her too", what does "it" mean?[Pynk by Janelle Monae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaYvlVR_BEc) has a sound and an  a e s t h e t i c  that I feel like Nat and fans would enjoy, and a subtle inclusion of transwomen at 1:16. I don't know if Nat's ever mentioned Janelle Monae anywhere, but I gotta figure she's aware of her, but for anyone who isn't, or at least hadn't seen this music video, well, enjoy the beautiful oddity that it is.You misunderstood me greatly. Statistics show lookism exists. What I am saying is that although bad looks wil give you a tougher life (this is true, it's the same thing with having a disability, it will give you a more difficult life), bad looks (as well as disabilities) are not destiny. It does not mean that "you will never get to be loved". That is false, I know very ugly people -including men!- and some disabled people who do get to be loved. It's more difficult? Yes, of course. It is still not destiny.Yeah and thanks for the passive aggression. Goes well with the moral chastizing. O SHIT! It came true!Ahhh, I have not seen enough of him. Any particular video that you like from Shaun?My sister is a big fan of Jack. He seems a good person, I think Strucci is exagerating, parasocial relationships aren't so bad.ahhh, I've seen the last one yes. Well, of course it isn't nearly as funny and entertaining as Contra videos, but it was interesting.*In this guided meditation you're going to relax your body and release your guilt. You're not responsible for what your great-grandparents did! As you ease the tension in each muscle group, exhale deeply and repeat the mantra: "Black Lives Matter are the real racists."*Actually, it seems like I'm the first one to mention Saul. I remember Contra characterizing him as "impotent" and some other unflattering adjectives so... this is interesting.

The thing with my attraction to Saul though, is, it's complicated. I know Nat wasn't out yet when she made the video but I discovered her when she was already out as a transwoman. So when I see Saul it kind of feels like when I'm attracted to a butch lesbian. mmmm, I believe the redpill theory (which was formed around 2002-2003, stemming from PUA community when it merged with MRAs in the mansophere) was already what we call right now alt right. It just was too small to matter. Or do you mean the merge between misoginy and racism?That is correct. The problem is.... libertarianism is more rightist than people understand. Let's put an example. MGTOW is libertarian. Why? Because they believe Welfare State is made by women to have the State as their surrogate beta hubsband. So they are libertarian BECAUSE they are misogynistic. People like this, wouldn't you call them alt right even if they are libertarian? 4chan supported Ron Paul in 2012 election and supported Trump in 2016. Libertarianism was always racist and misogynist. For obvious reasons (people who need the most help are the underprivileged). That is true since Goldwater in the 60s.Yes!!! Completely. I believe it is partly a consecquence of having an enamourment from the left with the State. When the State is just on its root another form of oppression (I'm an ancom, at a personal level).Mmmm.... my question is... are people who consider themselves libertarian becasue "they believe Welfare State is made by women to have the State as their surrogate beta hubsband"? Are they fascist already or are they not fascist yet?

&amp;#x200B;

Have you read this text? It is a great historization of 4chan.

That's the strain. Free market should answer all the problems and women and minorities are using the State to disrupt the natural order of free market and biology. That's proto-fascism.

It is a good read that of Any Rand. Yes, i guess, although I dislike her, she was much coherent. And yes, 4chan is only a forum board, it is impressive it has influenced so much.I think she can't. Remember the huge backlash she suffered after talking with Jesse Singal? She can't talk about that issue in a free way, it is extremely sensitive for her trans base.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I've read Contra's thread about Jesse Singal and she convinced me, so consider this post antiquated.Woww, thank you so much, I was not conscious it was so important to you. I am very thankful that Ayn Rand even with all her shortcomings helped you out from that process. I am very happy that I helped you so much. Good luck!Haha idk I know it's weird... but I just kinda see him as a girl because I see contra as a girl. Either way, man or woman, he's my favorite though. :)Yes. But Jesse Singal is demonized because he wasn't completely in favour of trans kids (he was not even against!!). That's the reason why Jesse Singal is hated.

EDIT: I've read Contra's thread about Jesse Singal and she convinced me, so consider this post antiquated.That's true!! She's a special person, I guess. I trust her to know how to protect herself after Jesse Singal situation.Much respect for my presidentDoes there happen to be a link to that or is it print?That'd be a super interesting video. My feeling is that it doesn't exactly fit her "usual" topics though. But maybe my feeling is off!It's actually funny, I was watching a German docu about trans kids on Youtube about a week ago, and I was surprised how the parents and schools in the video all supported the trans kids... I'm so used to American media that I've gotten used to bleak conservative dystopia. Of course that's not to say that there's not trans oppression in Germany.AGP is the video that made me sub to her. It's such a good video.My kink is being fetishized by those who want to take my human rights awayI really don't like the tone, I find it deeply condescendent. But hey, I love that she's getting heard!!I know. I have a gay friend who wants to have sex with a pastor. Taleb Nassim is probably the best conservative writer alive today. He's basically makes Burkeian arguments for organic change as a way to navigate highly complex situations. *The Black Swan* is his best text

&amp;#x200B;

I also respect Glenn Lawry. He's an African-American conservative who's really smart and doesn't fall for making cheap arguments against the SJWS/Libs whatever. He recently did a podcast with Douglas Lain, a Marxist that was really good that was respectful and insightful on both sides

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Xob3K\_L8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Xob3K_L8w)Am I wrong?

EDIT: I've read Contra's thread about Jesse Singal and she convinced me, so consider this post antiquated.Completely disagree. I am just talking about economics. You can see the numbers. We don't have time for communism, we need to end climate change now.Yeahh, I read the article. Just because the author of the article thinks Jesse Singal is transphobic doesn't actually make him transphobic. In fact, Natalie does not believe Jesse Singal is transphobic. She told it, he reminds her to the philosophy colleagues she had when she was studying: obsessed with the pursuit of questions where they lead and completely forgetting that he's talking about real people with real feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I've read Contra's thread about Jesse Singal and she convinced me, so consider this post antiquated.Ahhh, that thing. It goes like this:

-&gt;Firstly you start from the fact that you are socially liberal.

-&gt;Then you go after saying that western culture is in fact the only socially liberal culture.

-&gt; You may add that only white men are liberal and that in fact women and black people are against liberalism and pro-State.

-&gt;Eventually you get to the point that maybe "Western culture"'s liberalism stems from white race.

-&gt;You may get eventually the jews as the culprits of the people who are taking away your freedom and controlling the State.

-&gt;Eventually you embrace racism and misogynia.

-&gt;Now that you are a racist and a misogynist it is time to let go of the socially liberal facade.This does not mean I believe Jesse Singal is right. I've read that the detransition he talks about were a consecquence of an antiquated method for diagnosing trans children, that changed in 2013. So I believe science will grow better and trans kids will be detected easier and less medical mistakes will be done.You do realize that we need to change things in like... the next decade so we don't have a catastrophe, right? Do you see communism in 3-4 years or so?Yes! I mean, I've read the famous text. I follow "Devil's advocate", which is an excelent site to feed you texts with oppinions you don't agree with. It has the objective of breaking your echo chamber. They always finish the feed with an "I hope you hated it". Jesse Singal story was a rare piece that it was sent both to progressives and conservatives, considering that both groups of people would hate that text.

​

So, do I believe that Jesse Singal should have been more careful in the treatement of the people? Yes. Do I believe that misgendering is a violent act? Yes. Do I think he shouldn't be in contact with openly transphobic people? Maybe. Do I believe detransition and desistance rates are not important at all about trans kids? No. I mean, science did get better and desistance and detransition situations seems to be plummeting. That's good, we want that. But you can't be angry at Jesse Singal just because he did the research and saw that it was not all roses.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I've read Contra's thread about Jesse Singal and she convinced me, so consider this post antiquated.I do see capitalism as an obstacle. i'm just saying we don't have time for a deep sdolution. Electric cars made by Elon Musk is an excelent patch. I just believe we don't have time for communism for global warming end.Yeah, just wanted to thank you. Although I do disagree on some points, I do take on the fact that talking about trans kids detransitioning might be irresponsible, which is what I believe you are saying. So I do agree with that. Bye!I especially agree with calling the current period "Dark Mother" after the conclusion of the latest video, *Incels*.

&gt; And whether you're a Chad or a Stacy, an incel or a hon, you can always return to the caress of our dark mother, the sea, whose salty embrace envelops every contour of your naked body.

Her videos have taken on a darker tone with some more serious issues.This text seems almost directed at me. I was in fact "defending" Jesse Singal just two hours ago.

Way to put me into humility mode once again. This is what I love Natalie. I agree with her 100%. This is in fact Singal's problem: he talks about disadvantaged groups as if they were objects in a lab from the pedamtery of a "rational and disattached" investigator. This is in fact my own sin.

So again, thank you again for making us better people. How are you so brilliant. I don't know which god gave us the gift that you are, but I thank them.

Each they it passes, when I don't believe I can admire her even more, she surprises me.P R O B L E M A T I C;) contra is great.Yeah, I am a physicist, so I tend to forget that you have to actually listen to your "object" of study when you are actually doing social sciences. I mean I was literaly talking about this 3 days ago with an anthropologist friend during 4 hours, while mainly critizicing my colleagues who do sociophysics and do not... tend to actually listen to what people have to say about themselves. Although I am a biophycisist myself, I do acyually want to do sociophysics in the medium/far future so it is always good to remind me a bit of humility and take me from the high horse of physics:
https://xkcd.com/793/She seems to be suffering a lot, so I am very sad about that. I'm very happy she found a way to be genuine with herself, though.

&amp;#x200B;

Being honest with yourself if the first step to feel better.I just want to give her a big hug. After reading contra's tweets about Jesse Singal, I changed my mind and consider that it is an excelent idea.She seems to be in a rough place emotionally. If I had been through a  broken engagement and then lost the following which I had built up, I sure would be too. I hope this channel is good for her emotionally. The part about the incels made me lol, ngl.Yeah but she dealt with a lot of shit due to losing that fanbase, and I would imagine it hit her hard financially. Fun fact Murray Rothbard hung with the New Left in the 60s, used their histography to argue for why government intervention created centralization in the marketplace and was even friends for a time with Murray Bookchin

He then later became utter trash but the story of left/right libertarianism isn't as simple as you make it outI think classical liberalism is irreconcilable with conservativism. The libertarian/conservative alliance during the cold war only makes sense when you have the communists as an enemy and even then it's questionable - is spending ever increasing amounts of money on the military or the police or prisons *really* small government?

Anyway I know a couple libertarians who are down with contra. For example [this article](https://www.libertarianism.org/columns/jordan-peterson-is-conservative-not-classical-liberal) on Jordan Peterson cites Nat's video on him. I think any libertarian who isn't just an apologist for the Ways Things Are would probably be enjoy herRap song about lobsters? 

[https://youtu.be/tRFXeZOHkpM](https://youtu.be/tRFXeZOHkpM)Who wore it better?!So I guess a simple question is why do you think the geographic location of your ancestral line is one of two criteria for being considered French? If someone whose family is from England, where Roman (Mediterranean) and Gaulic peoples both mixed with other peoples over the centuries, and thus they have some "French" blood, had a friend who was French when they were growing up in Yonkers, so they learned the language and some other aspects of the culture, would they be MORE French, according to you, than a French citizen, born and raised in France, to two parents from Cameroon, who ALSO grew up speaking french and engaging with french traditions? Why is that genetic link so important?What are you referring to? It sounds interesting.The French nation is only a recent invention. Before industrialization and the development of communication networks, as well as state standardization the notion that everyone belonged to a single "french culture" was laughable, you had odd micro dialectics and local customs that have been erased by "progress"

&amp;#x200B;

I highly recommend reading The Discovery of France. This is a [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/books/review/Weber-t.html) to a summary of the bookThe mods removed this post, but I'm glad at least one person agreed with me.Got to have him read some whimsical old English children's book.&gt;but I don’t think any of us have like shrines to her or anything

I mean speak for yourself /sIf they're game for dealing with the history of race in "America: Still Racist" that's a good one. "Why the alt right is wrong" gives a kind of overview of her politics and had transition in one, relatively short, video.   
"Pick up artists" has opera and an oyster cunnilingus joke, so it gets honorable mention.I’m at a bit of a loss about what to say right now, but I want you to know ...

I was in a similar place to you. Not exactly the same, but similar. My views have changed and have remained changed. You don’t have to stay the way you are.

One thing I didn’t mention in my post to this subreddit was that a big part of what led me down the reactionary racist rabbit hole was having a very close friend that constantly texted me links to MDE and /pol/. We aren’t close anymore and I honestly miss him, but my mental health has improved quite a bit after we stopped speaking. Takeaway: If limiting contact your brother is possible, you should consider doing so in the short run. You might be able to help him at some point, but you need to get your own head in the right place.

PM me if you ever want some counter arguments to some of the shit you see on places like /pol, MDE, alt Right Twitter, etc.

Good luckI think you can open it in an incognito window.That seems to support the thesis of the article, no?Wow such cutting edge buzzwords!It is a useful skill to have in college lolI didn't even think of that!

Each individual case IS quite trivial, and she makes this point regularly. Indeed if there were a diversity of female and male body shapes being displayed in video games, and then one came out where a character was aged/sexed up from a previous version, and people got upset about it, it would be very similar to the She-Ra "controversy". That's not the case. Instead, she points out that while there are many different male body shapes put into video games, young, old, thin, fat, tall, short, handsome, ugly, even for playable or companion characters, yet for women, it's nearly always "Young, thin, busty, big butt, attractive). Her point is that the medium of big budget video games consistently sexualizes women, while shying away from sexualizing men, because it is largely created by and for young men, even as women make up an increasingly large portion of the audience. I just searched "Top video games of 2017"  
Zelda:Breath of the Wild : [Thin boyish (pretty?) main character, attractive, if admittedly relatively unsexualized female character.](http://www.siliconera.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DXUvxpyU0AAOquu_thumb.jpg)   
Super Mario Odyssey: [Short, Fat guy with a mustache, pretty, sexualized princess](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TUgxEMIjuFI/maxresdefault.jpg)    
Horizon Zero Dawn: [Attractive female main character, but not sexualized, actually this one is super good on this front.](http://media.comicbook.com/2017/12/horizon-zero-dawn-1070674.jpeg)    
Destiny 2: [Main character isn't particularly gendered from what I can tell, but I'm betting it's default male, with male pronouns, distinctly non sexualized.](https://dvsgaming.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Destiny-2-featured-image.png)   
Playerunknown's Battlegrounds: Well, it looks like there's a lot of customization possible, but here's [male](http://media.comicbook.com/2018/04/playerunknown-battlegrounds-1100622.jpeg) vs [female](https://cdn.segmentnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Playerunknowns-Battlegrounds-6.jpg) character sprites, I don't think I need to spend too much time pointing out the differences in pose, clothing, and overall look.... but seriously, the hip thrust?
  
I could keep going, but I think you get the point. It's not a perfect binary, but there's really no denying that among major video games, men can be portrayed as just about anything, whereas women are usually attractive, and often sexualized. It's not the biggest problem facing society, but it's hard to deny that it's there, and that it can have negative effects on how young men and women see themselves and others. 

Oh and "extremely ripped men" aren't really "sexualized" at least they aren't aimed at the female gaze, they are very much aimed at male power fantasies. I'll refer you to [Our Boy Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coNQAucXoNM) to go further in depth on the subjectOf course I can count Mario, and Peach. Both are from the same era, both have been depicted in non pixel format for decades. The PUBG sprites certainly make the cut, and this is 2017, when we've been having this conversation, fairly widely, for about a decade (obviously critiques of female presentation in media go back much further, but I'm talking specifically about video games.) and developers are, grudgingly, coming around. Hell, even the idea of having playable female characters as a norm outside of RPGs is somewhat new.  &gt; since these games are primarily markets toward men  
  
That's part of the critique. The assumption that big budget video games SHOULD be gendered in their marketing. Not just "some video games are marketed towards men, some towards women" but "the vast OVERWHELMING majority of video games are marketed towards men, or at least, more towards men than women". Also "unrealistic" isn't quite the same as "sexualized" especially when the "unrealistic" standard is so divorced from reality. Male characters are unrealistic in how powerful they are, in the way they do things like fight dragons and giant beasts that are totally outside the experience of normal people. Female characters are unrealistic in how their bodies are proportioned, in how accentuated their sexual features are, in how they move in smooth fluid ways that show off those sexualized bodies for the viewer. This is an incredibly banal everyday experience for women, having their movements and form judged by men (and other women) in terms of their sexual appeal. So one is unrealistic in an escapist way, the other is unrealistic in a very pertinent and applicable way. She's got a specialized focus.  You may think it's trivial, but she actually has had a real impact on gaming culture.  She'd probably not have been able to have the same impact if she didn't narrow down her focus.  If you don't want to hear her talk about the stuff she focuses on, don't listen to her.  Problem solved.  If you think she should be doing more, I'd ask what are you doing?That's like blaming comicsgate on Spiderman including a realistic depiction of Manhattan with a gay pride flag (and other comics with decent representation).

It's a bad take and you should feel bad.

Edit:  Seriously, "women should know better than make reasonable criticism of video games, anything they might accomplish will be outweighed by the negativity they cause by getting death threats and continuous harassment."  Go back to the Sargon sub if you want people to entertain that bullshit.Plus, a few reactionary dipshits may have turned against her, but game developers listened, and I think that's a much more significant impact.Okay, but in turn people see all of the MAGA chuds posting exponentially more idiotic content and harassing women for saying reasonable things (Idk about you, but if I wear a t-shirt objectifying women to an important day at work, I'm gonna have a LONG talk with HR) and even more people are going to realize that gamergate is sexist bullshit.  Which is what happened.  So even if you take the stance that she's responsible for her harassment, it still had a net positive impact.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYqYLfm1rWAThe first part of that is a self fulfilling prophesy, what's more, a big part of the critique is people who DO play video games asking that the pandering not completely discount their concerns.   
As for Rom-Coms, yeah, there's niche media that targets women, but the mainstream media is overly targetted at men.You are correct.A)  
&gt;capitalism works   
  
"Oh yeah there's your problem right there". 

  
But on a more serious note.   
  
B)  
These critiques people make that we're discussing? That's the demand, and if you'll note, it IS changing to respond to that demand.I'm getting a feeling that if no representation and shitty representation seem trivial to you, you're probably well-represented in media and have been all your life...... really? Why? Is there something about the medium that you feel makes them more appealing to men? People who are downvoting you are not reddting properly. For what reason? What is it about games that require more powerful hardware and bigger budgets that men are inherently more prone to prefer than women?  
I really think you are taking something which has grown out of a fairly random (and sexist) set of circumstances related to how the genders were perceived in the 70s-90s, and thus how products were marketed to them, and assuming that there must be some fundumental cause beyond the whims of marketing consultants. Do you reckon women are inherently more drawn to the color pink than men as well? Or, men are in control of most of the important positions in both movies and video games, they see the market place through this bias, and so the biggest budget projects end up being marketed towards men, and in turn have audiences that slant male, which is used to justify crafting and marketing the biggest budget projects towards men, rinse, repeat. The fact that this trend has faded as this conversation goes forwards supports this position, as opposed to some nebulous supposition that women are less inclined to like impressive graphics and large set pieces that make for expensive and dramatic media. Why should brain dead Michael Bay type films be the primary type of big budget block busters? Titanic and Avatar both had extremely huge budgets, were the top two grossing movies of all time, were epic in scale and marketing, and were clearly not aimed directly at men or women, but rather the general public. The same could be said of many other block busters, especially lately, and the gender balances are starting to reflect it. The point is that given this reality, why SHOULDN'T women get to point out when the men deciding how to pander to men have failed to consider the effect on women?There's plenty of niche low budget genres that skew male to the degree that rom-coms skew female, that seems unrelated to the notion that the tentpoles skew male, I simply posit that the tentpoles skewing male is more related to the vast majority of people in power in the industry are, and have been, male, and thus view the "average person" through a male lens, and market/craft movies to appeal to men, because that's what they're familiar with, and that this isn't just the natural result of biological differences between the sexes, but the unnatural result of imbalanced representation within the industry, as a vestige of even more sexist eras (you know, like when a bunch of guys decided that a "very sexy man" like James Bond should probably just go ahead and rape his costar on camera, because it's so romantic)That's not the worst possible scenario, but if that's the case what do you think the chances are that they're also doing the same study with people of color?  This seems to mirror a long pattern in medical science that prioritizes studying and therefore helping white patients (or in this case, victims) over everybody else.Unfortunately you obviously aren't involved in medical research.  This is still the norm in many places.  "A homogeneous population is easier to study" and thus many health issues that disproportionately affect black people are still drastically under-studied.

Edit:  Also this is Australia.In the video "The Left" Tabby and Justine have a conversation while playing chess.

This post looks at the chess game they played, analyzing their moves.Are you saying Tabby would do something even if it was illegal and self-defeating?

Don't slander our Cat With a Bat.You're absolutely right, I was being a little sarcastic and just wanted an excuse to call Tabby "our Cat With a Bat."abigail changedThis is the weirdest video from this channel, and possibly that I've ever seen.If you're looking for an explanation, she's a trans woman* dressed as a drag queen.

*And Natalie specifically has expressed that she feels like she used to be a guy, which differs from how many other trans women feel about themselves.Could you use your magic to make an "I swing both ways, I like both boy dick and girl dick" clip?

I would deeply appreciate it.I am a trans man and this hit way to close to home.Well, I think pretty good video overall. Could’ve stood to more interesting, cinematography-wise and all soooooooooooOOOH MY GOD THIS JUST LIKE HAMILTON!How the fuck do these keep getting better and better? When is the peak?The conflict between adapting in order to change society vs staying true to yourself (or your values) is what makes this video relevant to me despite the fact that I’m a cis man.

I’m also an ex shitlord and, as such, understand right wing thought patterns. Because of this, I often find myself tone policing marginalized people whenever I perceive something as bad optics. The difference between me and a straight up concern troll is that I am on the same side as the people I tone police when push comes to shove.  However, my intentions being pure doesn’t make me right and it certainly doesn’t give me insight into the struggles that marginalized people face. I honestly do think some of my feedback has been valuable, but I second guess myself a lot.

I’m still way more in the Justine camp than the Tabby politburo. Being right ultimately doesn’t matter if you lose.Like/upvote

I don’t have anything to add to that right now. This was very well put.I think it is pretty clear this video was a hegalian  dialogue. The idea was to have two ideas clash and try to reach more synthesisHaving water poured on you isn't violent. Ironically, by claiming it was, Kirk proved that even before the water was poured he was completely wet.Me whenever my cis friends make me walk to their dorm. You didn't  write "(J.R.R. Tolkien =/= Frodo)" so I'm completely lost.Oh yeah I was crushing all over her in the hallway walk scene.It's true, the vast majority of English speakers are...  
....    
  
  
Agoraphobes.   
I'll see myself out(side)."I may not be a biologist, but I AM a bigotologist, and that's like a biologist, but with a few more letters, and everyone knows adding letters adds authority. No one things adding the odd PhD or MD to a person's title makes them LOSE credibility, so why does adding a gto to my title somehow disqualify me from speaking on the subject?"I think the left can get overly cynical sometimes. It's totally true that someone like Justine can fall down the Tiffany path, but it's equally true that they can move the opposite direction, or stay right where they are. Conservatism isn't a ratchet, you can move away from it as well as towards it. The risk of treating people who are imperfect, or even those who are moving further in that direction, as lost causes is that in part, Justine is right, people make decisions on feelings and tribal loyalties, and if one side is saying "agreeing with us is inevitable, something that will happen as you age, become wiser, more stable, less emotional, less idealistic, and that doing so will reward you with an easier life, and by the way, we get it, we've been there, or had friends who were where you're at when I/they were young radicals, but now you're waking up, and we are so happy to have you join the side", while the other side says "ugh, how can you possibly think that, come back and talk to me when you've learned better, not that you will, because obviously you're just selfish and so you'll settle for a comfortable lie with the powerful pigs" then it's much more likely that someone who isn't sure what they should believe, or who they trust, will decide to take the easy path. Some moral philosophers suggest that if the moral path is also the easiest/most selfish path, then it lacks any moral quality, but society is about making the moral path the easiest path, and doing so is moral according to utilitarian ethics at least, because it does a much better job at reducing the net suffering in society than trying to lecture people into making personal sacrifices in order to do the right thing. It's still good to encourage choosing the right path even when it's hard, but it's more effective to make that path easier. So being welcoming to those who are on the fence, finding ways of easing them into better positions, is a very good tactic.At it's most reductionist, this is a semantic argument, it's a discussion of definitions. Since language is a communication tool constructed by societies, societal acceptance of that definition is reality, which allows for competing realities to exist simultaneously as society is divided on the meaning of the words.[FUCK YOU SOCRATES](https://youtu.be/ubc2CRwBGTk?t=5m50s)Hugboxing is good and neccessary.  
So are hard conversations like this.  
I don't think Justine is saying that the kind of woman you want to be is NEVER going to be respected, just that right now it's not given anywhere near the same respect, and thus credibility, as a more "conventional" woman, and that there is value in understanding that truth, and exploiting that understanding in order to craft an effective strategy to gain power, then use that power to change society to the point that the kind of woman you want to be is always going to be respected. It's entirely possible that we won't reach that point in your lifetime, but think how far we've come in the last 10 years and take heart, perfection is unattainable, but better is just over the horizon.   
In the meantime, embrace that hugboxing, it's a totally legitimate tactic to deal with the shittiness of the world. You are legitimate and worthy, and if you aren't in a place where you can approach the issue from Justine's perspective, that's completely fine, it's not on you to fix everything, do what you can, and if what you can is just being yourself, that's fine.  
 Where Justine goes wrong is lecturing Tabby, and Tabby calls her out, and[ Justine acknowledges it.](https://youtu.be/z1afqR5QkDM?t=16m47s). Where Tabby goes wrong is in assuming that Justine's way isn't a vital component in the fight, and that the sides do need to collaborate in certain ways.    
The radicals need to listen to the moderates to hear which of their tactics are going too far, are forcing the moderates to either disavow the radicals, splitting the movement, or grudgingly defend them and lose credibility. Smashing Nazis is okay, because the moderates can point to historical precedent, and say "well I personally wouldn't smash a Nazi, I would debate them, but I also recognize how dangerous and amoral they are, so if they end up getting smashed, I'm not shedding a tear over it. Just like I think pedophiles should be given full legal protections and it's bad that they get brutally assaulted in prison since that's not how the law is supposed to work..... on the other hand I don't really care, do you?" Which leaves the "free speech" defender either trying to defend Nazis and Pedophiles rights, or more or less agreeing that while a thing can be technically "bad", when it happens to awful people it's not all that terrible.   
If, however, Tabby starts smashing TERFS, it's harder to defend, because ultimately terfs haven't ever had much power, they're a rare, if unpleasant, splinter group of feminism that is politically homeless, unable to form real common cause with the right or the left. Also a lot of terfiness is grounded in gendered trauma, so threatening violence is a particularly bad look.   
So there needs to be that alliance. The Radicals are needed to both give comparative cover to the moderates, and bring up ideas and arguments that the moderates could never push without losing their seat at the table, but if the Radicals can make enough noise that the moderates HAVE to discuss it, then the moderate allies can help shepherd parts of the ideas/arguments into the mainstream, which is where the Overton window really shifts, not at the edges. Just so long as the Radicals don't go completely off the deep end and advocate for things that are going to completely poison the well for the moderates. It's a delicate balance.So I don't like Ben Shapiro, however I think Natalie should shy away from doing a direct dunk on him. Better to do a take down of the ideology he espouses. 

Natalie was clearly influenced early on from the tradition of youtube new atheism from back around 08. Her best work has been to transcend the shitty (I PWN YOU RAWR) stuff, and actually address the underlying ideas or what idea the person is claiming to represent. Her works on "The Golden One" and Jordan Peterson are really fantastic in this regard.This wouldn't necessarily be about convincing hardcore fans of his, but making sure the average person who might stumble across a video of Ben Shapiro spouting misleading and harmful falsehoods about trans issues become aware that he's not telling the actual facts.But he's already massively popular, it would be more dangerous to let the bullshit he's spreading go unchallenged.&gt;So I'm posting this anyway in the hope that I'll help add fuel to the fire so eventually Natalie will notice a widespread sentiment from her fans that this is something they want to see.

If there are multiple posts on the same issue in a short space of time like this it's more conducive to the momentum of getting this video made than if I just commented on the last one.Because I genuinely think the need to make this video is so important that it's worth it. Plus this is coming specifically after Natalie's new video referenced Shapiro and in particular a well-known and notorious incident of Ben's transphobia in that appearance with Tur.One difference is that sometimes misgendering is an intentional way to delegitimize  black women. See the horrible memes about Michelle Obama or [this shit](https://bossip.com/1361620/people-are-stupid-christian-activist-group-1-million-mothers-boycotts-hm-over-trans-woman-who-isnt-trans-43081/).[Bader-Meinhoff phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Frequency_illusion)This has inexorably tied Tom waits to Contrapoints in my mind and for that I am happy and grateful

&amp;#x200B;

thank you send tweetNatalie Wynn is an anagram of "Naw, innately" referencing that being transgender is not a choice.It's dumb, it took me like an hour, and I figure some Contrafans will enjoy learning about Anohni of Antony and the Johnsons, since she makes good music, is trans, and has this song that dovetails nicely with the end of Nat's latest video. Enjoy?My favorite is probably "For Today I Am A Boy". It's particularly nice now, because she did indeed grow up and is a beautiful woman. Thank you!I think that's a reasonable assumption. Some pairs of episodes (e.g. *TERFs* and *Tiffany Tumbles*, *Punching Natzees* and *The Left*) definitely take place in chronological order. Stronger evidence is that all the male characters transitioned to female with some acknowledgement of their previous lives in earlier videos — off the top of my head, Foppington in *Jordan Peterson* and Freya in *America: Still Racist*.Also *Bronson* by Refn.

I second *Blue Velvet*.

I suspect that *The Aesthetic* was her attempt to explain being transgender without gender essentialism or heartwarming gibberish, as promised in *Autogynephilia* 16:24. Any such explanation is going to leave a few people out.It shall be a shining beacon of [Rose Quartz and Serenity](https://www.pantone.com/color-intelligence/color-of-the-year/color-of-the-year-2016-color-standards), gold foil and rhinestones. A welcome sight to degenerates and moral warriors alike, a place of refuge and style advice.   

Random note on amusing contradjacent coincidences. 
Those colors, Rose Quartz and Serenity, were the [Pantone "color of the year"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantone#Color_of_the_Year) in 2016, the year Contrapoints launched her channel. They are, basically, bisexual lighting/contrapoints lighting. One of them is also the name of a major character in Steven Universe, which was peaking in popularity (according to google trends) at that time, and which is extremely queer, and I believe has some crossover fandom with contrapoints and leftytube in general.    
So.... 2016, as we approached these dark days, there were a series of signs that predicted the emergence of our Lady Nat. Sent to provide comfort in hard times, and lead the charge against evil, on the battlefields of political youtube.  Yeah fuck Jimmy Dore.You are not alone. There are dozens of us (presumably)I've shared it there, and thank you for reminding me about Thom. I've added him.I'll have to look into Anarchopac but I've added Innuendo Studios. Big Joel was already on the list under Video essayists and Critics.I'm really, really sorry for that. I intended to add a warning but forgot to, but I've reinstated one now. To some people he might be okay, but I understand he'd be uncomfortable for others so hopefully my disclaimer gives people an idea about whether they can stomach him first.

I hope that's all understandable, and sorry for causing you the irritation of that.Hopefully mine has suitably expanded this and other older lists on /r/BreadTube in a way you like :)Very glad to hear it, hopefully there's not only lots of good stuff you can watch and support there, but potential friends and collaborators on this YouTube scene.I’m directly threatened by Nazis due to partial Jewish ancestry.

My former best friend once identified himself as a national socialist and I continued being friends with him for quite some time afterwards. I’m glad he’s out of my life, but I still care about him and I would help him if I thought I could.

You’re dead right about gazing into the abyss though. The things that went through my mind ...[Funnily enough, there's a reason for that.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/8pb108/i_found_out_where_tiffany_tumbled_and_its/)As for Jackie Jackson, she's definitely meant to be cis, as she doesn't understand trans people and thinks "Why am I constantly surrounded by homosexuals?" in *Tiffany Tumbles*.Don't worry, they're all super sweet. I posted an unreadable drunk rant here and ended up on the front page with so many sweet commentsI'm worried that Kavanaugh's bravado and bluster bought him enough points with the base to get him confirmed :( . 

Also, dear fucking christ, what happened to the appearance of impartiality? Why is no one talking about what his openly partisan speech says about his qualification to be an impartial judge?

Seriously though I feel you about the echo chamber. Back in 2014 I went in hard on the "Skeptic" crowd and it feed my internalized transphobia and some of my prejudices, it was bad. Even now I do go on some Libertarian sites just to know what those who do not agree with me think. Went to say this  
Saw you'd said it  
Well said.The last Jedi of left tube.Increased socialization of industries that perform badly under market conditions/don't allow for real competition  
Healthcare is the big one, and education is probably next. Both are already heavily socialized because we all recognize, deep down, that just saying "if you want it, pay for it" to "consumers" of those products is absurd, so we have built structures to ensure SOME of the services are provided, in some way, based on need.  
So focus on getting some form of Universal Healthcare, and expanding education, in particular early childhood education, which provides incredible dividends in the long term. These are also fairly broadly popular moves.   
I'd suggest we look at energy production and distribution next, along with internet. We should have municipal cooperatives for both, just like we have in many places for trash, water, sewer, and sometimes even energy and internet. These are industries that work best with one provider (it's wasteful to run two overlapping systems) and so that provider should be democratically controlled.  
  
Finally, and this is only somewhat government related.  
Unions: We need them.  
That means that every media person on the left should be advocating for unions at least occasionally, pointing out how they've been effective, how even the THREAT of a union forming has pushed employers to up their game (see. Amazon). The right wing has spend decades and billions of dollars pointing to every corrupt union leader, ever badly run union, every poor long term contract that has caused problems that was negotiated by a union, and demonized the concept for huge swaths of Americans, and it's netted them hundreds of billions if not trillions in extra profits because working class power has been eroded. If we want to have economic left power, we need unions.   
Also Score Voting, because the left is shit at falling in line behind a single person that they find somewhat to quite problematic, but they might be willing to honestly give partial support to that person in comparison to the crazy right wingers the Republicans keep putting up, so long as they can give full support to a candidate they truly love, and who knows, maybe the solid lefties will be right and a true left populist candidate will fox the entire establishment and win all over, proving that America really is crying out for "Social Democracy" The Goddamn Reptiles | Tatiana Tankikova  
Abigail Cockbane  
Natalie | Doc  
Tabby  
Tiffany Tumbles | Lord Foppington | Freya | Jackie JacksonOh and I low key advocate for the utter destruction of Uber by cities just creating their own ride hailing and payment app, requiring anyone who wants to offer rides in the city to use this app (they can use Uber/Lyft too if they want... but they won't) as well as meeting some basic requirements, then drivers could pick a set of pricing tiers, and use it just like they use Uber now, only with a smaller cut taken out for taxes than is currently taken out by Uber, and it's all connected to the transit app that cities should also have. That way if you want to get from A to B, you can easily book and pay for a ride that will drop you off at a bus stop just in time for the bus to get there (assuming this is paired with more investment in transit so the busses run on time) take the bus to a stop and have a driver there to pick you up and drop you off at the door. This solves the "last mile" problem of transit elegantly, and it is the most logical solution to the problem Uber has been trying to throw investor money at in the hopes of being the monopoly of taxis in the future. The problem is that such a service is brilliant, but it works best the more people who are using it, both drivers and riders. Taxis didn't matter as much, they were usually regulated in such a way that only a few companies served the city, people called in and a cab was dispatched based on info maintained at a central site. It didn't help THAT much to have one company vs 3. But with Uber, it's all diffuse, and that allows the potential of great efficiency. Drivers dropping someone off just in time to pick up someone new around the corner, even multiple people who are going in the same basic direction getting shared cabs for greater efficiency/lower cost. We can do that because computers can handle the overhead now, and complex networks can be rapidly navigated to find shortest paths, things a central human dispatch never could no matter how many people were working for and using the service. Uber has tried, using advertising astroturfing and selling at a loss, to force its way so hard and fast into markets that it becomes the only game, but that's really difficult and expensive. Cities are entirely within their rights to regulate businesses that exclusively operate on city paid for and maintained roads, so they can easily just demand that everyone use this service, and in so doing give everyone a better service. Everyone using transit gets a better app, and the option to cut out unpleasant wait times and long walks, for some extra money, the city dramatically increases it's revenues from transit, which is now better connected, as well as getting some money from the small tax, and it can learn which routes are so popular they deserve more transit, which further increases efficiency and quality of service, while raising more money for the city.  
The best part about all this. All those fucking fat cat investors who saw a bright future of taxi monopoly and no employees just "independent contractors" get the fucking money rug pulled out from under them and they lose billions as Uber becomes utterly worthless. All the drivers get better benefits, pay, and waste less time between customers.   
The final step in all this is to start charging ALL drivers for access to city streets, to push us towards a car free transit oriented urban design, where rich people pay large amounts of money to keep driving, or being driven, in their private cars, middle class people can take transit or pay a reasonable fee for a private driver, who is a small business owner doing quite well given all these new customers and the corresponding paucity of wasted time, if you're lower class you get fantastic transit, and can fill in the gaps with shared taxis when needed. If you're poor/working class and disabled you can get a voucher for private drivers that have vehicles suited to your needs. We massively reduce carbon emissions, can build denser cities that allow housing prices to come down, poor people don't need to spend upwards of 1/5th of their income on a car just to keep a job, walkable neighborhoods become possible, gridlock and wasted time in traffic drop substantially, and people have more time to actually do things other than drive. All round better world is achieved. Yup, I like finding ways to smoothly slide into the end state goal, rather than requiring a sharp transition...... like going from amateur drag to non binary to binary trans woman....*Lady* Foppington.I'm so happy to finally meet the real you.*Enchanté.*I stand by that we should embrace "socialism = government does stuff" and add only that the government be democratically controlled, and that it can happen at any level (I.e. Unions/cooperatives are a form of "government")I feel like she's more or less answered this, in saying that philosophically, woman as a word or a concept can only be understood within the context of society, like any word or concept. These things exist to help humans who interact have a shared language so they can understand each other, and so ultimately, the definitions of these things has to be largely social, which means "what it means to be a woman" is largely "to be seen as, treated as, and accepted as a woman by society". Society isn't a monolithic thing though. Trans folk aren't likely to be accepted by Evangelical society any time soon, whereas they are fairly easily accepted by SJW leftist society just by expressing their identity. Tabby exists largely in that society, she rejects and tries to be unconcerned by the opinions of largely society, much less the smaller societies on the right. Justine works to be accepted by a more mainstream society, and so works within their definition of womanhood. Where Justine goes wrong is in telling Tabby that SHE ought to be making the same effort, Tabby gets to choose what society she wants to exist in and appeal to (though it's perhaps useful to point out that no one can FULLY reject mainstream society and so understanding the rules and definitions it uses is helpful even if you consciously reject that society and its rules.) Justine IS useful to the cause though, because being more easily accepted by mainstream society allows her to interact with and appeal to people who help define the bounds and rules of the society, which in turn humanizes the entire trans community to a lot of people with power. Doing that can help mainstream society change in such a way that Tabby no longer has to feel like she's constantly embattled for her trans-ness. This in turn frees her to instead focus on the true battle. The fight to awaken the proletarian masses in A Grand Struggle To SIEZE The MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND CAST DOWN THE SHACKLES OF CAPITALISM, RISE UP IN SOLIDARITY WITH WORKING AND IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE AROUND THE GLOBE AND COLLECTIVELY BUILD A SOCIETY OF SUCH EGALITARIAN BEAUTY AND SPLENDOR TO MAKE ALL THE SUPPOSEDLY IMPRESSIVE WORKS OF EGO DRIVEN BOURGEOIS ENTREPRENEURS LOOK LIKE THE WORK OF CHILDREN BESIDE THE GLORIOUS MASTERWORK OF THE MASSES!  
That's my read on the video anyhow.I thought about doing a drag performance as a genderbent Tabby but idkArguably one of the fastest ways to get to socialism / communism rn is to simply remove the ability for various monopolies to rent seek. Doing so will drive the cost down to the point where its either free or extraordinarily cheap (one example I like is the projections for what self-driving electric cars might one day cost)

&amp;#x200B;

Paul Mason talks about this in his book [Postcapitalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQyr9l22fLE)If we keep an ownership model for self-driving electric cars, as well as a city design that prioritizes drivers over transit+pedestrians+(e)cyclists+taxis it could actually make the negative environmental and social impacts of cars much worse, because if you don't have to even do the work of driving, the cost of (self)driving places, once the car is bought, drops super low, which encourages people to drive more, even just sit in their cars working/talking/hanging out while being driven around. If being in gridlock isn't that different from being in your office, there's less incentive to find ways to avoid gridlock. If, however, we make other options equally good or better, and start charging drivers for their actual costs, including parking and access to streets, the incentive shifts dramatically towards far better transportation options, from an urban design perspective. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvUByM-fZk) a decent video that touches on some of these concepts, from a subtly (not always) leftist perspective. The series is quite good, from what I've seen so far, if you want to understand a bit more about how city regulations and infrastructure can have negative impacts on humans and the planet. The on on urban freeways is particularly good. "Slutty Thor" should become his official name in Contrapoints world. I really hope she sees this and adopts it, never again referring to him as "The Golden One" but instead "Slutty Thor". If you flash a photo most people will get who's being talked about, those who don't will either get clued in or miss the joke, and it will be hilarious to take away his over the top self aggrandizement and replace it with a trashy nickname.Agreed on all points. Are you familiar with Score Voting? I contend that it would significantly undermine gerrymandering on it's own, though pairing it with split-line redistricting is ALSO a good idea. Between them it might even approach "proportional representation" though not quite, geographically diffuse ideologies would still be excluded. It'd be much easier to implement both of these reforms that PR though, so it'd be a good start. I keep trying to convince fellow Democrats that we should be actively running on such reforms, emphasizing them and reaching out to third party, and moderate Republican voters with the message that, essentially, you might not agree with us (much)more than Republicans, but we'll institute reforms that give you a much fairer say in future elections, and we ultimately want the most democratic government possible while protecting basic civil rights. I think it's a message that would transcend every faction of the left, and scoop up a significant minority of right leaning voters as well, and actually accomplishing it would significantly improve both our nation, and the leftist/leftish standing among the electorate. I posit that the feeling of alienation from government that a solid half of potential voters encourages rightist views, because it makes people want government to be less powerful, and less involved with their lives, and it adds to a general sense of instability and fear that encourages xenophobia and individualism at the expense of collectivism. If we adopt reforms that both make government more responsive to people, and provide people with a clearer vision of what their fellow voters actually want, while increasing the percentage of people who vote, people won't focus on the imagined problems of government and parties, and instead focus on connecting with other people, changing hearts and minds of the electorate rather than just blaming it on faceless powerful forces that can't be effectively challenged or changed (thereby absolving themselves of any duty to attempt to improve things, and letting them just complain and spread conspiracy theories). Possibly, if I'm being optimistic, it would even free up cognitive space, and clear the air enough to reveal the ACTUAL problems of government and parties, and the put faces to the powerful forces, allowing them to be both challenged and changed, ultimately resulting in a better, fairer country and world. Pretty sure Ben Shapiro is in her sights. She was asked to do a video on him in her latest livestream and basically told the person to be patient in an enigmatic voice.&gt;sabo-tabby

Does anyone know if this was a direct inspiration for Nat, or just a wonderful coincidence?The logical extension of that would be that no one can blame anyone else for stabbing their (attempted) rapist through both eyes with a knitting needle, it being a quite natural urge.Could it perhaps have to do with the level of power such groups have in society before they start pushing for more rights? Women constitute slightly more than half of any society, nearly every child is raised primarily by women, everyone knows women, and most people like at least some women, so they had more power than blacks, gays, or transfolk. Black people are more numerous, and were more concentrated and easily identifiable than gays, so they had enough power to push for their rights effectively sooner, even though gay rights have been pushed for a long time. Homosexuals again are more numerous than transfolk, and have some advantages as well in that they can typically "pass" more easily, and their deviation from the norm is almost entirely in private settings, or at least it can be, which means it was easy for some (mostly white, male, and wealthy) homosexuals to gain access to very powerful circles, and be accepted by their existing members, either as "respectable" out gays, or as closeted gays who eventually came out, either publicly or to individuals. Now we see trans people gaining more acceptance, and before NB/GNC folk because again they are more numerous (possibly, the numbers I've seen are sketchy AF for all groups of Trans/NB/GNC) and are also comparatively more in line with existing culture, particularly passing trans people. They can access similar circles of power as the gay men did before them, humanizing the community to people who ultimately have more pull in terms of laws and cultural norms. It seems like there always has to be a balance. You've got Malcolm X scaring the shit out of white people with direct, often violent, actions that threatened to spark a full on race war that neither side was going to come out of unscathed, and MLK offering a more comfortable path. You've got Stonewall Riots and Lesbian separatism threatening to completely upend the applecart of gender relations, and polite/fun gays palling around with Hollywood stars and future presidents. You've got Tabby, and Justine. Tabby pushes, Justine pulls. Yup, and there's very little in the way of policy that can appeal to both simultaneously, in addition to not alienating base Democratic voters. This can. This and basic anti-corruption stuff, possibly including campaign finance reform (not sure what percentage of moderate conservatives could get behind that, since a lot of them are pretty wealthy). I'd love for you to pitch Score Voting to those moderate conservatives you know, tell them to pitch it to their friends and on down the line. I get more resistance on this idea from super political people than people who vote, but mostly don't follow politics closely, and don't feel strong partisan loyalty, even if they mostly vote one way. The problem with that is, by definition those are the people less likely to advocate for any political idea, especially when it sounds a bit far fetched and unlikely. The solution is to get to the point where they start hearing this from multiple people, from a variety of different political perspectives, and hearing that it's both possible, and transformative, and that it would reduce the level of rancor and polarization, and let good/popular ideas rise to the surface, rather than rewarding whichever ideas are the most inflammatory and so get the most airtime. Eventually the normies will start talking about it, and asking their representatives about it, and then some political types will realize what an absolute cakewalk of an issue it is to champion. Broad appeal, "anti-establishment" cred, no dedicated opposition, no trade offs with other policy objectives, just pure populist gold, free for the taking should any politician decide it's worth bothering with. If you know anyone in Wisconsins first district that could mention it to Randy Bryce, that'd be good. I pitched it to him in an AMA, and in person a few months ago. I feel like most people need to hear a thing a few times, from separate sources, before they take it seriously. Also are you in Twitter? We're putting together a group message to keep in touch about Score Voting and advocacy efforts. My handle there is @LibArtsNdCraftsThe same person said all four original voice lines too :)That's what I took to be the point of the video. Tabby thinks Justine is betraying the cause by palling around with P R O B L E M A T I C people, Justine thinks Tabby is being ineffectual and scoring a lot of own goals by refusing to consider her optics. Both have a place, they need to learn to work together, on opposite ends of the problem. I feel the left in general is really bad about this. The right does it perfectly, you've got the Sargons palling with the PJWs who pal with the Southerns who pal with the Spencers. A pipeline from right leaning center, able to appeal to normies and claim that they see both sides and just want people to be free, and obviously can critique the bad sides of the far right, but really, is that such a concern when you have the CRAZY ANTIFA "TOLERANT LEFT" to worry about?!?!?! And they pass people off to the solid right, who in turn passes people off to the far right, and finally you end up with Nazis. The Nazis stay Nazis, but they DO listen to the center right and right leaning people when it comes to optics, they try to provide the balance of ferocity and absolute devotion to the cause, but without making the right feel they need to FULLY distance themselves. They wear a suit and get a haircut, they avoid talking about the most obviously heinous parts of their ideology, except in private or through dog whistles/implication. The left could learn a lot in terms of tactics from the far right.   
Justine was overly glib, and didn't respect the value that Tabby brought, even while she felt she was being "helpful", but Tabby DOES need to listen to SOME of Justine's suggestions. Like not threatening to smash TERFS, especially if Tabby is supposed to be an identifiable figure/leader within the movement. It's okay to have random Twitterers saying "kill all TERFS" so long as the leaders say "well obviously I don't want to kill all TERFS, I just want them to stop being TERFS, and I don't know what you expect me to do about a bunch of kids memeing online, our movement is about the freedom for people to be who they are, we only condone violence in response to violence, and the plausible threat of violence, and most TERFS are just sad lonely women who are isolated from the feminist community because they can't wrap their heads around the reality that biology is more complex than their 10th grade general science teacher taught them, and trans women are women" Ancaps....  could be edgy teens (at heart/mind) who haven't really thought past a few surface level "common sense" claims and considered how their theories would apply to actual humans in reality, could be neo-feudalists who are pretty certain that in the Mad Max world they want to create, they'd be Immortan Joe, living it up with a harem and an army of willing cultish soldiers. I've never heard a convincing argument for giving one company a monopoly, and then regulating them closely. The point of free market competition is the "free" part, companies get to make moves, if they fail the company goes out of business and people lose money, if they succeed they make money. If a company is both protected from failure by the government, and given very little leeway on how they can conduct business, it seems like just a sop to capitalists who fear nationalization of industries that they covet, and a way to funnel money into the hands of a few investors. I see no advantage to having the government act as middleman between monopolist and customer. If we recognize that some aspect of a market should be a monopoly, then it would be, in some way, democratically controlled. Not controlled by a democratically controlled body, that is just extra linkages that allow for more corruption and inefficiency. I'm fine with it being a cooperative, as is the case for [electricity distribution, and in some cases production, all across rural America](https://www.electric.coop/our-organization/history/). Power companies had no interest in providing rural electricity because the people were to spread out to make for safe profits, but the government recognized that people needed power, so they gave seed money to, and initial organizational guidance to, a whole slew of different cooperatives, most of which are still clicking along beautifully to this day. They elect boards, have yearly member meetings (which are often well attended, farmers care a lot about their source of power) and provide good service, at a better price than could be provided by a for profit company.  
I'm still okay with some capitalism, but the argument that ANY monopoly should be for profit, and directly controlled by investors, regardless of how much government regulation there is, seems ludicrous to me. See my comment in this same thread about low key advocating to destroy Uber to see another example of a marketplace I feel the government (in this case city government) should run as a monopoly service, thereby allowing every individual to be their own small business owner, and compete with each other on price and service.I may have responded as though you were endorsing the claims of "mainstream economists".... sorry about that. I will add though that I don't think neoliberal voters are actually our main opponents. Many of them are pretty okay with government programs, and a lot of the early steps I suggest retain significant competition, they just seek to reduce the scale/power of the capitalist actors and oppose wasteful rent seeking and regulatory capture, which many such voters are cool with. I was hanging out with some Young Dems a bit ago and semi ironically said that my 5 year plan was to become a YouTube thought leader in the socialist proletarian revolution. Later one of the others proudly said she was neoliberal, and yet when another attendee challenged my suggestion that the city should directly undermine Uber by setting up a commercial driver marketplace and requiring it be used (along with a few other semi socialist reforms) she reiterated that she's neoliberal but "agreed with everything the Socialist just said". That's part of why I think a smooth slide can work, it can appeal to working class folk who are mistrustful of huge corporations, but also a lot of wonky neoliberal "vox" types.Eh, convincing anyone to support, and particularly evangelize about, Score Voting is a win as far as I'm concerned. 
This is the first example in [the Wikipedia article on stalemate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalemate). I'm guessing Natalie looked at the article while writing the script and picked the first real example.

A follow-up to [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/9h2ngy/analysis_of_the_chess_game_in_the_left/)."Political Correctness" means not saying the racist/sexist/otherwise hateful shit you think out loud.I think you're assuming I have an intention that I don't.

I'm not defending political correctness.  I think young people and people of color don't think that the solution to racism is for rich white liberal/moderate people to hide their racism.God yeah I can 100% see a National Review writer putting this on their porch; refusing to give out chocolate because Carl Fazer bought his recipe from the Soviets in Petrograd. That’s true by the way - thank you Lenin! I didn't know about that, I'll have to check it out.&lt;3

Yeah, as I was writing this post I was wondering if I had the causation right with everybody I listed.  Of course people are going to come up with similar ideas and of course people with complementary styles are going to gravitate towards each other.

But I just went with it because I don't have anywhere close to the intellectual integrity that you do.

Yeah, you and Natalie do different things, but like, who the fuck else on the internet is going to do a three-part video essay and go on all all-soy diet just to laugh (with the support of an enormous amount of evidence and understanding) at some Alex-Jones-wannabe.  You.  Don't fear comparison, my friend, because nobody on Earth can top you when it comes to being the #1 Ferretboy in the world.

(And like, I am teasing you, but I'm also serious, I love your videos and your humor really does change hearts and minds in a way few other things can.)I think it's pretty unlikely. Tankies aren't really all that relevant to modern society, but they are a massive pain in the ass and are overrepresented in leftist circles, so pissing them off would raise a shit storm of people (disingenuously) accusing her of being a bougie capitalism apologist without doing much to actually undermine support for tankies, partly because if you're a tankie in 2018, you're pretty fucking hopeless and unwilling to see reason, but mostly because there's not much support left to undermine. She's also said that the Capitalism videos weren't really her cup of tea, because she's not an economist, and the arguments about economic systems really do need to delve into the weeds of markets, and resource flows, and consumer psychology, whereas she's much more interested in the philosophy side of social sciences. Capitalism was a worthy topic because many of her viewers might well have a generic "capitalism is good I guess because everything else is worse and it just means freedom an trade right?" viewpoint which could be challenged relatively easily, without fully debunking it, or getting into too much history or numbers. It was a very soft science approach to the topic, because that's her wheelhouse, and it served mostly to open up questions, so people could look into it further. If she does tankies, she'd be looking to pretty much fully shut the door on that nonsense, much like she's done for white nationalism, pick up artistry, and incels, but without nearly as much pressing need, nor as much connection to her own history, knowledge base, and interests. That's my take anyhow. I'd be happy to be proven wrong, and I'm sure she'd look cute as hell parading around in the snow with a full Soviet Uniform waving the Hammer and Sickle, and having Tatiana debate Tabby while Justine looks on confused and horrified, but I think she's more likely to keep focused on bad praxis from the left, and nonsense from the right, rather than full on nonsense from the left.   
I could be biased though, I put Tankies in the same camp as An-Caps, as people who are too absolutist and too fringe to be worth debating, they're to be ignored and ridiculed, because they won't change through logical discourse, and they're pretty unlikely to convince anyone else to agree with them. No risk, and no reward.The difference with White Nationalism is that that's growing at a dangerous rate, and never stopped being low key popular. Tankies are a despised fringe minority of a mistrusted fringe minority (leftists/socialists) they pose no real threat to either the leftist movement, or the world, and very few normal people are actually drawn to the movement. White Nationalism preys on racial fear, it has a lot of good propaganda, and it promises a stance of strength and pride to people who feel like that's being taken from them. Tankies promise.... death to kulaks? Impressive mustaches? I've never seen, in real life, a leftists, even the most dedicated far leftists Marxist-Lenninist, actually fall into full on Tankiedom, it's too obviously reprehensible. [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/9p5lbk/is_anyone_else_hoping_to_see_a_contrapoints_video/e7zah13/) feel [vindicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf5qrVdD9E0)Libertarian socialist rants is good for polphil, so is Hbomberguy on occasion. Wireless philosophy is good for ethics and stuff, and, as hard as it is to admit it because I hate the man, Crash Course is pretty decent for overviews on all sorts of philosophy.

Hope that helps ❤️When I saw other ppl do it it like left and indent and looked weird I got “The Doctor” but I wanted to get “The Golden Twink.”its a really bad article... you're not seeing thingsI have half a mind to transform myself into a beefy stud and do political commentary as a left wing foil to The Golden One.

Anyone have some extra trenbolone lying around? Natalie, you are a light in the alt right darkness that is most of youtube. A shining beacon of intelligence and kindness. You are a inspiration, and we all thank you.

Tl; dr, u the best girl!Alternate title:
"Youtuber Natalie Wynn, known as "Contrapoints" Leading Bernie Sanders In Polls!"Looks like Chomsky has a commanding lead, Sanders in 2nd, and Zizek in 3rd. You've also been a total weirdo from well before Contra entered the scene. That's a compliment, obviously.That's just the vibe any white man speaking authoritatively is going to give unless they speak in an academic demeanor a la Peter Coffin. I'm not trying to troll but that really is just how it be. In reality, though, the Chapo guys seem pretty inclusive overall, to the point where it can sound forced sometimes. this is pretty great. Caught a bit of it. She started off by saying it definitely won't affect people being able to get their documents changed and a bunch of us in the live stream going 'are you really sure about that point, blaire?'. Didn't hang out for the whole thing but she didn't seem to address it.  Yup, Richard Spencer is a garbage human being. He's like a rotting onion with many layers. Also essentially a Russel Brand quote. I guess both illegitimate rejections of critiques of capitalism are pretty common. Also essentially a Russel Brand quote.

ughhhhhhhhhhhh whyI was never a white nationalist, but I am a turn coat in the sense that I abandoned some pretty hard right ideas.


Unsolicited Advice to OP: Hang out in leftists spaces more. Understand the arguments on the left. Most importantly, try to empathize with people that aren’t like you. It’s hard to throw people under a bus once you see them as fully human. If you want refutations of WN talking points I’ll be happy to oblige. I can’t refute everything effectively because I’m not a human encyclopedia, but I can speak to some issues.

Unsolicited Advice to Comrades at r/ContraPoints: Don’t be too hard on this guy.  You don’t have an obligation to engage with him (obviously), but being mean to him is worse than useless. It sends the message that people can’t come to our side and be accepted.

Edit: Comrades was a joke. I’m not a tankie.Shouldn’t have assumed. Sorry. I actually do think there is something to this, but the far right overplays this point to an insane degree.

You make the argument that Muslims (as a whole) are too culturally different from Americans and Europeans to assimilate. You’d be oversimplifying the hell out of the situation, but it is true that places like Saudi Arabia have really backwards values. This is not true of all Muslim majority nations though. Also, look at Canada. They took on a bunch of migrants and it went fine. The problem in Europe was not so much that the migrants were Muslim. It’s that they were disproportionately single young men.

You can’t make that argument with Latinos at all without coming off as culturally ignorant or straight up racist. Like most American and European people they base their morality on some form of Christianity. The only significant difference is language. The term “The West” (whatever the fuck it means), should include Latin America if it’s related to culture rather than race.I actually agree with you in terms of priorities. That said, I would like to help the young male refugees in any way that doesn’t threaten security. I don’t know how to do that though.

Edit: On second thought, there’s probably very little danger in admitting families and women of any religion. So add them to my priorities list.The problem is that the real situation on the ground is morally dodgy. 

Assad is obviously bad, but there are probably elements of ISIS within the rebels. Even if there isn’t, they’d probably be ready to fill the power vacuum left by Assad.

In addition, as bad as Assad is, I question the humanitarian value of NATO backed “regime change”.

But let’s say the men stay and fight. Assad could probably rely on backup from Russia and if the NATO retaliates and sides with the rebels, now Russia is pissed and we’re a step closer to the Fallout games becoming a reality.

The situation is complicated and I don’t know how to solve it.If you favor Assad, the only solution for the (non ISIS) rebels is to flee or surrender to a regime that probably won’t be kind to them. 

Im not even saying you’re wrong. Maybe Assad is the best of bad options, but this doesn’t help the (non ISIS) rebels one bit.Thank you. \&gt;Posts often and unironically to /r/braincels...I have masstagger, I didn't look through your history, I just pushed one button and saw this: https://masstagger.com/user/I_POST_ON_THE_DONALD

I'm looking through and I'm seeing more than one hateful comment.["She's not entitled to a real man."](https://np.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/9e9znv/some_people_actualy_think_like_this/e5nqgvg/?context=5&amp;st=jnrpkcq3&amp;sh=d1242ccb)

[In this thread you endorse "the black pill."](https://np.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/9i275g/this_guy_is_short_and_unattractive_yet_he_got_a/e6hqtfk/?st=jnrpw8df&amp;sh=4f0c1cfc)

People should have whatever standards they want.  Standards are just saying "I'd rather be single than date somebody doesn't meet X standard."  Weird (and yes, hateful) to be upset by that or say people don't have the right to do that.  Anybody seeking a heterosexual relationship has standards that they themselves don't meet.

You'd think in an extended thread about the black pill that states you agree with it multiple times, you could mention that you're opposed to violence instead of tacitly supporting it.  Posting what you posted only served to validate the beliefs of people that do believe in violence against women, and as such is profoundly dangerous.

I could also address your belief but just watch the contrapoints video on incels if you haven't already.What does that have to do with being a chaser?Not exactly relevant, however this seems to be the perfect demographic for such a question. I’m what you might call a nouveau-leftist and didn’t really have a strong political existence before Trump. That being said, was life in general happier pre-Trump? Today’s politics seem more depressing (especially this week, though we’ll get through it I hope) and I wonder if it was less taxing mental-health-wise.
Alternatively, do you believe in the life after Trump.Contra to contra when the upcoming video is inevitably late: https://www.instagram.com/p/BixXA1BAxVy/?taken-by=soska_117  (yes, it's the same person).A decent response requires more than disavowing.  Yes you can pull a Caitlin Jenner and disavow fascism when it personally affects you after supporting it when it meant putting brown people into concentration camps.

That's not showing a change of heart, that's just greed and self-preservation.Yeah, that's fair.Being ML or Maoist is *not* being a tankie ffsThe same way you can like ice-cream but go to an ice-cream shop and say “this ice-cream was bad”. Tankies are apologists for what happened during the Stalin regime, but MLs support the underlying principles.  It’s the difference between saying; “I like a system based on Marxist materialist analysis and a non-Trotskyist form of government, but I do not like that Stalin killed gay people.” You’re misunderstanding. There is a clear and fundamental difference between supporting what became of a set of beliefs as a consequence of a myriad of variables, and supporting the actual principle. Saying you like Marx’s or Lenin’s ideas is not in any way supporting Stalin, or even the Soviet Union. That’s like saying that someone who believes in anarchism and impeaches a dictator, creating a power-vacuum and clearing the way for another dictator, did a bad thing. By this logic, supporting anarchism is clearly a bad thing to do - even if it’s used to dismantle a system of oppression.

You’re failing to make a distinction between what became and what was argued for, which is the distinction also made between MLs and Stalinists.I don’t think you fully understand what a tankie is - it’s entirely possible to support Maoism as an idea without being an apologist for what he and his ‘government’ did.
