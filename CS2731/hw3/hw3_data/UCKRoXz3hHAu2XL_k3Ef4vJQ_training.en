supremacist he actually did not deny
either and and every he was Ted Cruz's
national campaign co-chair mm-hmm Paul
Ryan lets him in every meeting they ever

them over the finish line these are
races we can really win this means the
difference between being unable to

last organizer to knock doors to get out
there and to get voters to the polls so
it's like the impact is so big with
these donations in this late stage yeah
so please donate alright let's get to
the very sad and enraging news today on
Saturday a gunman used an ar-15 to kill
eleven Americans who were attending a
bris at a Pittsburgh synagogue half a
dozen more people were wounded the
anti-defamation league called the
shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue
the single deadliest anti-semitic attack
in the history of the United States the
man arrested by authorities told a SWAT
team officer that quote he wanted all
Jews to die and he also had nearly two
dozen guns registered to his name
because that's what we allow here in the
United States Tommy what else do we know
about what led to the shooter whose name
is Robert Bowers to launch this attack
at this particular moment we know that
he believed that the Jews quotes are
working to destroy America by bringing
in immigrants and so I believe that that
conspiratorial crazy whatever you want
to call it belief is directly tied
the idea that you're seeing in the
mainstream media that there is a caravan
of people coming to invade our country
full of gang members young Isis like the
president says and that George Soros who
is a billionaire financier who happens
to be Jewish who has been demagogued by
the Republican Party for decades is
paying for that Caravan and like
secretly slipping in so it is it doesn't
require using a slur to be anti-semitism
if you're talking about how globalists
are controlling the media or our
politics
we know damn well what you're saying
Steve Bennett you're saying the Jews are
in charge the globalist Jews are running
the media or they're bringing it they're
subverting our democracy somehow this is
a disgusting anti-semitic slur we should
call it for what it is and this has been
part and parcel of Republican Party's
messaging in some places for a long time
and Trump is just mainlining this
experience yeah I mean I don't think we
can emphasize the link to the caravan
conspiracy enough here yep last week
sorry last week Matt gates Florida
congressman the dumbest person on the
 planet again is a frat paddle
come to life I believe his lovest line
yeah he is at the plural idiot but he's
dangerous well and again I mean like so
many of these people this is not someone
who who knows but like that genuinely
believes this is this is like a rich
dude who went to you know college and
everything like that he knows better and
he just decided to cast his lot with the
far-right and white now she was Donald
Trump because he knew it would help his
queer people who know him people might
get to be like this guy knows exactly
what he's doing
but he's just doing this purely for his
own ambition you may have heard of him
before because he invited a Holocaust
denier to be his guest at the State of
the Union that's right so that's what a
good guy Matt guides is so he started
this whole thing last week by saying by
tweeting a fake picture I wasn't real it
wasn't actually the caravan saying this
is the caravan George Soros has funded
this caravan Soros question mark right
just asking question in the queue in the
in the caravan are dangerous people who
are coming to the United States that of
course went on to Fox from Fox it goes
to the president right states his
think-tank that's in French so now we
have the Presidents Day
telling everyone that the caravan it is
that is a thousand a thousand miles away
from the border is filled with Middle
Easterners dangerous people possibly
terrorists all those kind of stuff and
that it's possibly funded by the
Democrats yeah and so now what happened
was on gab which is a social media
platform used by many white supremacists
and neo-nazis glad we have one of those
yeah Bauer's who's the guy who did the
shooting
recently complained after all this last
week that Jews were helping transport
members of the migrant caravans called a
Jewish organization that helps refugees
a sugar-coated evil and then finally
said I don't care about the optics I
can't take this anymore I'm gonna go do
this thing and now we have this mass
shooting Tommy what do we know in
general about rising anti-semitism over
the last few years the ADL reported in
February that the number of anti-semitic
incidents was nearly 60% higher in 2017
than in 2016 that is the single largest
that's sorry that's the largest single
year increase on record and the second
highest number reported since the ADA
started tracking incident data in the
1970s and of course this coincided with
Donald Trump's campaign in 2016 and
Donald Trump's presidency in in 2017 so
the question is does Trump bear any
responsibility for this rise in
anti-semitism the White House obviously
says not at all they point to his
statements condemning the attack in
Pittsburgh which according to the New
York Times were written by his Jewish
daughter and his Jewish son-in-law Jared
and sorry Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner
who I guess had to persuade him to
condemn these and super harsh terms
which is always comforting but what do
you think what what sort of connections
if any can we draw from Trump's
presidency Trump's rhetoric to sort of
these rising attacks I think that the
key to understanding the link between
Trump and these fringe anti-semitic
extremists is just listening to what the
French anti-semitic extremists say and
they take solace when in in
Charlottesville he blames both sides or
doesn't condemn them they look to him
and they're inspired and they see
leadership and and they
emboldened by him when he calls himself
a nationalist these right-wing
nationalist parties have been blaming
Jews for all their problems for
centuries they know damn well what it
means when Steve Bannon sits his fat ass
in the White House for six months as the
chief strategist they look to him for
leadership when he's inviting these
pizza gate lunatics into briefings and
you know these people walking around
making the like okay white nationalist
sign and and they so like what drives me
crazy about this is you know they're all
these people that say oh they're just
trolling you know they're just they're
trying to you know own the libs by
making these signs like you are what you
do you know and then on and then the
response like I think it drives me nuts
and I think African American community
is dealt with for a very long time as
well it's like when you point out
something as racist or anti-semitic I
think people are think that that's like
the the worst thing you could ever say
about someone that they are racist or
they're an anti-semite and they act like
pointing out the facts and making that
charge - somehow worse than the original
incident we need to call this for what
it is
right I mean to paraphrase Andrew
Gilliam I'm not saying he's an
anti-semite I'm saying the anti-semites
right he's an anti-semite Julia Yaffe
friend of the pod wrote a really great
piece for The Washington Post about all
of this that you should go check out but
she basically you know sort of laid out
Trump's evolution on this in 2016 he
joked at a meeting of the Republican
Jewish coalition that it wouldn't
support him quote because I don't want
your money yeah during the campaign he
tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton
superimposed on a Star of David over
dollar bills after Julia published a
profile of Melania which the White House
didn't like she was del used with
anti-semitic threats Trump was asked to
condemn those attacks on Yaffe from his
supporters and he said quote I don't
have a message for them and of course as
you pointed out the worst example is
charlottesville people marching in
Charlottesville chanting Jews will not
replace us and Donald Trump saying there
were fine people on both sides
I want a reporter this is very simple to
ask Donald Trump asked Sarah Huckabee
Sanders asked anyone at the White House
today does the president still
leave that the people in Charlottesville
who were chanting Jews will not replace
us were fine people that there were fine
people among those Martians I want
someone to ask him that question because
if they really say he's not anti-semitic
that he condemns this kind of attacks
that he condemns the kind of hate that
leads to these attacks then then they
will answer the president that's right
you know what I don't believe they were
fine people I'm sorry I shouldn't have
said that but he won't because he hasn't
because nothing has changed since
Charlottesville the only thing that's
changed is somehow like the news move so
fast our collective memory doesn't
really remember the fact that in
Charlottesville he issued these horrible
horrible statements and has not
apologized for them right I mean there
was an article last year where I think
is the independent of the UK where Trump
suggested that Jews might be secretly
committing anti-semitic hate crimes on
themselves so that he looks bad I forgot
about that one
I mean Adams serwer who writes for The
Atlantic wrote I think as crystal-clear
a piece about how the spark for the
worst anti-semitic massacre in American
history was a racist hoax that was kind
of came through the weird Twitter
ecosystem through Lou Dobbs and then got
on Fox & Friends and then got to the
president and he decided that he was
going to demagogue a caravan of
desperate people because he thought it
was gonna be an election issue that
inspired this individual to do what he
did yeah period you know I keep thinking
like does the Republican line as well no
one can control what their supporters do
on either side and there's bad and
there's rhetoric on both sides that's
gotten out of hand right but what would
we be saying right now if these
perpetrators of these crimes are is hate
and it's violence that we've seen over
the last week or muslim' exactly what
would we be doing if there was a
connection to Isis wouldn't we say that
that Isis propaganda inspired some of
these people who said I'm doing this in
the name of Isis which we've seen all
the time of course and and we would be
calling on every single Muslim on the
planet to denounce this act and to do
better somehow and to somehow fix the
problem I mean these these people are
these right-wingers are incapable of
looking within their party within
themselves and seeing the harm that's
being created here and so it's not just
Trump the NRCC
after George Soros was sent an AED a
pipe bomb they put up an ad attacking
George Soros GOP leader Kevin McCarthy
tweeted we cannot allow Soros steyr in
Bloomberg to buy this election gee what
are those three guys have in common yeah
no I mean look it is true that a
politician or a leader cannot control
what his or her supporters do all the
time there are people who will will do
crazy things will do horrible things all
the time
but you can control your own words in
your own actions they like to point out
oh it was a Bernie Sanders supporter
that shot Steve Scalise and he was doing
it because there were Republicans right
that is correct and yet can you point to
a single word that Bernie Sanders has
ever said or any Democrat that told
people to commit violence can you do
that to Donald Trump yes how many times
did he say he was gonna pay the legal
bills of his supporters who beat people
up at rallies yeah how many times has he
said huh
today today he called the press the
enemy of the people how many times in
his stump speech is he called Democrats
evil and crazy he says it every single
day Democrats don't do that no I it also
worries me because there you see this a
lot among like young men in particular
there was a big part of the appeal of
Trump was he's just trolling he's
talking he's generally
anti-establishment I get why like
anti-establishment sentiments are
appealing to young people in the sixties
you're anti-war right yeah this is a
different time but that stuff can has
manifested itself online in dark ways I
mean there's racist anti-semitic jokes
that pop up on gab or 4chan or god
forbid like The Daily stormer and when
people you know it's sort of like a race
to the bottom to see who we can offend
and like upset the libs but I think it
that's of lulls you into thinking it's
acceptable and some people see that
stuff and can go further and further and
further I mean Timothy McVeigh the white
nationalist Oklahoma City bomber was
inspired by anti-semitic books and
teaching and he perpetrated a horrific
terrorist act so like we need to we need
to keep an eye on these things and we
need to understand
that leadership comes from the very top
and you can't tell me that Barack Obama
singing Amazing Grace in a church wasn't
an important healing moment in the lack
of that grace or any kind of unity in
our country it's like you can feel it or
get take George W Bush right right
who will go down in history as one of
the worst presidents because the Iraq
war was one of the biggest catastrophes
that any president has ever led us into
okay but George W Bush made a point of
condemning attacks on Muslims made a
point of saying the Muslim religion is a
peaceful religion and whether it's
George Bush whether it's Ronald Reagan
words any of the public and president
when they were if their supporters
started attacking people you wouldn't be
able to draw the same kind of links that
you can draw with Donald Trump and
Republicans know this of course
they know it damn well like and so like
whether it's Barack Obama George Bush
whatever like for some reason these
anti-semitic people these racist
supporters they look at Donald Trump and
they think he's one of them
after charlottesville they said we think
he's on our side we know he eventually
had to condemn it but they forced him to
condemn him and we really many waters
back what other president have
anti-semites and racists ever said that
about and like the people and it drives
me crazy the people that are elevated in
the media because they're sort of Trump
fans or sick of fans like Erick Erickson
lame bloggers two weeks ago tweeted it's
not a coincidence that this caravan to
the south of us is happening two weeks
before our federal elections he was on
Meet the Press the Sunday great booking
guys Lou Dobbs who is a particularly
virulent brand of washed-up and
intolerant had a guy on from Judicial
Watch who said talked about the Soros
funded State Department financially back
in the caravan it was so bad that Fox
actually to pull the episode and banned
the guests in perpetuity but like those
are the people that Donald Trump watches
those are the people he calls on the
phone during his nine hours of executive
time which is code for him sitting
around and tweeting and calling his
buddies right we have like a part time
president who you know in the time he
actually does work just divides the
nation as thoroughly as he possibly can
if the president United States and
Republicans in Congress truly believed
that this these kind of attacks and this
kind of hate and stuff like that
was awful and they wanted to condemn it
they could decide to comport themselves
welcome to pod save America I'm John

second show Austin okay Dan let's talk
about the news huh lot of sure why not
it's been a while since we talked about
the news let's do it has with 20 days
left until the 2018 midterm elections
Donald Trump has decided to finally come
out of his shell and say what's on his
mind he kicked off Tuesday morning by
calling stormy Daniels horse face on
Twitter
senator Elizabeth Warren continuing to
call her Pocahontas he criticized the
global condemnation of Saudi Arabia for
what appears to be the brutal murder of
a journalist who was an American
resident comparing the allegations that
the Saudis are guilty to the allegations
of sexual assault against Brett
Kavanaugh in interviews on Tuesday Trump
again questioned whether Russia meddled
in the 2016 election when asked about
his personal lawyer implicating Trump as
an unindicted co-conspirator in multiple
felonies the president accused Michael
Cohen of lying when asked whether he
believed in climate change the president
said there are scientists on both sides
that California has wildfires because
the state does a horrible job of
maintaining their forests that he hasn't
visited troops in a combat zone yet
because he doesn't think it's quote
overly necessary that he's done quote an
incredible job with the children he's
separated from their parents at the
border and that if Republicans lose the
house in November it won't be his fault
then where do you want to start I mean I
don't know first I'd like to just say
the amount of introspection and
self-reflection in that interview where
you look at what you've done what you've
done well and you think what hey give me
a better president is astounding it's
just it's really he's really grown what
he's really grown enough job he is what
a man who walked into the Oval Office
right off the set of the Celebrity
Apprentice who when he felt the burden
of being Prezi knighted States
leader of the free world a role model to
children just took that in and thought
about how can I fit the burdens of this
office no nothing has changed he has
grown not one iota after two years of
making life-and-death decisions
nothing amazing it's amazing
I guess like how does the media even
begin to cover all of this and like how
do people process it I mean in that
quick list of things that I just read
through any one of those comments from
Donald Trump would be like a multi-day
possibly multi week story for any other
president most other politicians and any
other time are we
we supposed to think about this I
realize we say this all the time but it
is 20 days until election and the
president has decided to go on a media
tour where he is just saying all kinds
of just dishonest grossly inappropriate
offensive which is the norm with
him I we have been known to be media
critics on this podcast yeah but I
really don't I don't know how the media
can cover this oh I don't need it that
was a that was my genuine question I
don't understand I mean it's preparing
for this podcast I didn't know how we'd
all what we cover it all yeah it's like
I was watching this sort of happened in
real time when Zeke Miller who's a White
House reporter for the AP was just
tweeting out the leads of the stories
that they were writing off of this and
it's like Trump says he takes no well if
they had Republicans lose the house it
will not be his fault Trump says blaming
the Saudis for the Khashoggi killing is
you know they should be innocent till
proven guilty Trump says you know
defense calling stormy Daniels for some
it's just all the things even any one of
those would be a five day story in a
different media environment and so the
only way I think we can interpret it is
to take a step back and look at the full
array of everything he said and as a
indictment of the kind of president he
is we've been talking a long time about
how an important argument for Democrats
in this election is about being a check
against the chaos and corruption of
Trump and here you have just to use a
term of art a ton of chaos and some
ends and potential corruption oh yeah
always I mean oh like just then that is
a given there is there is more
corruption before breakfast in this
administration that in any presidencies
since Watergate I mean you know the
stormy Daniels news reminded us of
course that's the president's own lawyer
has implicated him in multiple campaign
finance crimes nothing has been done
about that so far this so dnews reminds
us that the president's and his hotels
and his private companies have
financially benefited from the Saudis
it now seems he is helping cover up the
murder of a journalist who is an
American resident seems fairly
astounding and it's just sort of just
sort of on the back burner just uh it's
it's unbelievable
it's unbelievable I mean we're we are 24
hours after let's just start with the
stormy Daniels news we're 24 hours after
the President had States called a woman
a horse face is any Republican candidate
in any close race gonna condemn that
anything gonna happen about that with
that no I mean maybe somewhere down the
line Jeff Flake will condemn this in a
sad tweet so then if and then if there
was some bill to make a horse face
monument Jeff Flake would vote for that
like that it that's exactly how this
would happen I look I think we have to
understand that this trumps being the
right way to say this but Trump being so
horrible is a classic feature not bug
argument for the Republicans this for a
portion of his base you know this is why
they like him this willingness to say
things that others won't say and the
problem is I don't think most Republican
elected officials believe that the
president's eight should be calling
anyone a horse face right but they have
come to believe and this is the
long-term danger of trumpism becoming
conservativism in America is they have
come to believe that even if it is
morally wrong it's good politics and
therefore they can't say anything or
shouldn't say anything because that will
upset the Trump base and therefore they
will lose election so we have silence on
things that you I just I think many of
these Republicans are bad in a lot of
ways but I do think that I do believe
that they probably even Paul Ryan thinks
it is wrong that Trump says this but the
they can't they feel like they can't say
it because they believe it's they
believe what Trump does is now good
politics and so they will he's buying
their silence in exchange for what they
believed
be votes from his base well and you know
the only thing that's gonna change that
is an election right because like you
said the Republicans may or may not
believe that this is morally wrong but
that doesn't matter they think it's
politically smart and they think that it
will rev up their base and they think
that their base is all they need to win
a lot of these elections and we can get
into why that may or may not be true but
if Republicans do well in the midterms
Trump will say all of this stuff and
worse and do worse over the next two
years because their strategy will have
been validated right and he will charge
on if you that the last two years were
bad you ain't seen nothing yet for the
next two years if Republicans do well
and this strategy of Trump saying
whatever the he wants and riling up
the base and doing whatever he wants
drive up the base if that is validated
on Election Day all bets are off for the
next two years the Trump is gonna be
Trump like if they lost 200 seats Trump
would find a way to believe that this
was voter fraud the Chinese interfering
in elections Paul Ryan a Mitch McConnell
being terrible and not supported he
would find a way to justify it because
he is chemically incapable of accepting
responsibility for anything right and
but what could change is Republicans
feeling a need to provide to say
something to be a check of some kind and
on the matters of policy and oversight
and corruption if we take the house I
don't really give a what Paul Ryan
or Ben Sasse say because Democrats will
be able to will be able to actually stop
the trumpet Genda they'll be able to
hold oversight hearings subpoena
witnesses and that's what will really
matter but we can't judge success and
fair what happens my will comes out at
Trump's mouth because that is that is
unchangeable what is the strategy behind
making this the Trump show for the last
few weeks is it even a strategy I
realize we use the term loosely when
talking about Trump and the White House
but it does I guess we know at least
from The Daily Beast had a story about
this yesterday or couple days ago that
Trump told his the White House staff in
the mid
September I'm not getting my message out
in enough places I need to do more
interviews I want to do even more non
Fox non right-wing interviews because
you know I'm the good messenger and if I
just get my message out well win the
election what do you think the strategy
is there do you think there's something
more to it yeah I think I mean it as you
point out I'm always hesitant to use the
word strategy to describe Trump because
that he doesn't have strategic thinking
but there is something underlying this
it is it I mean it's I always subscribe
to him it's more instinctual than
intellectual and I think this is an he
has an instinct that the more he talks
the better off Republicans will be and
the better off he will be and that he
has very little faith in anyone else
speaking for him whether it's Republican
congressional candidate Sarah Huckabee
Sanders Mitch McConnell anyone else did
the person who should be speaking is
Trump he also enjoys attention and this
is attention and he would just be he was
just melt into the ground if if the rule
was that he had to stop talking for
Republicans to do well he would never
believe polling or anything else that
would say the less Trump the better and
I do like they have a theory of trying
to get Republican enthusiasm up and the
belief is is that Trump the more Trump
the more Republican enthusiasm I don't
know that that's gonna work or not
there's some evidence it works in some
places and not others but I think that
is what is it what is happening here
that's what I was gonna say I mean when
you look back at you know polling and
special election results since Trump has
become president you know we've said
this before it does seem like when we
are debating large scale economic policy
health care tax cuts off like that polls
have that's when the Democrats have been
at their best
I think another time that Democrats have
done better is when Trump is out there
all the time saying truly crazy but
again that could be in some places and
not others and then it seems as though
when the polls have been tightest was
during the Cavanaugh hearings
and partly during during that time for
most of it until the end
Trump sort of receded into the
background and it was sort of a
traditional Republican versus Democrat
culture war so you know I don't know
I don't know if they'd be better off
with Trump out there saying all this
kind of crazy more or not I guess
like talk more about when you said that
it might help in some places and not
others
sure I think this is an important point
that most political analysis unless it's
done by you know people who really dig
into data and understand the voter
makeup in various districts and states
most political analysis is
one-dimensional and it's based in this
old idea that the Democratic base is
going to do it it's gonna do the
Republican base is gonna do what its
gonna do they are equivalently the same
size and the elections are cited by 20%
of people in the middle and whether a
strategy worked or didn't work whether a
statement was affectionate out of fact
it was based on its impact on that 20%
of swing voters did it move 12% one way
I didn't move to a percent the other way
and that I don't know the politic who's
ever that simple but it was much closer
to that 15 to 20 years ago and now
politics is much more three and four
dimensional in the sense that you have
States or very different districts are
very different the bases aren't the same
size the Democratic base is larger in
the Republican base the Republican base
ISM is more reliable voters and midterms
and presidentials frankly and the number
of voters in the middle are smaller and
so things can like Trump doing something
can work be effective in a red state
where the Trump base which largely means
not necessarily Republicans but
non-college educated Republicans is a
greater percentage of the electorate and
in a more suburban district or a state
where that Trump base is a smaller
percentage of the electorate will be
have the opposite effect so Trump can be
simultaneously helping democrats win in
the crooked seven and helping
republicans win some of these Senate
races
and whether it's like North Dakota or
Montana or something else and you have
to really understand and get pretty deep
in the data to see what what is the
voter makeup they can get either a
Democrat or Republican to their win
number and and so that like in this case
it could be yes it's working
and yes it's killing Republicans at the
same time just every different just in
different places yeah I think the
geographic point is important here and
Nate Cohn who does polling and analyze
his data for the New York Times wrote
about this this week I want to quote
from this story since it was fairly
disturbing but Nate's very smart
he wrote that polarization from stories
like the fight over Brett Kavanaugh s
confirmation seems to be helping
Republican candidates in the final weeks
of the election he said that trend might
fade but if it holds it will be an
abrupt change from earlier polls and
last year's special election results
which indicated the Democrats were
highly competitive in red areas instead
the district and state polling raises
the possibility of an election more like
last year's virginia elections or the
2010 midterm elections both were strong
results for the party out of power but
the big numbers came mainly on home turf
Cohen also wrote the geographic
disadvantages Democrats are facing are
so severe that it gives the Republicans
a chance to survive a so-called way of
election so that doesn't sound very
great now you just heard me talk about
Virginia and you might be thinking well
what do you mean like Ralph Northam won
Virginia by nine points the polls said
he you know it was a close race what
happened in Virginia was Northam and
Democrats in general did incredibly well
blew out all sorts of turnout models in
the blue parts of Virginia that Clinton
had won in 2016 in the red parts of
Virginia the Trump had won Gillespie did
almost as well as Trump did in some
cases as well as Trump did so the
concern is for this election that in the
blue areas of the country
you know Democrats have incredibly high
turnout and a ton of votes and you know
like you said all those suburban
Strix in California could be you know
flippable but in these red areas and
unfortunately the Senate map is
incredibly read probably the toughest
map we've ever faced probably the
toughest map either party has ever faced
we're facing and in those areas whereas
we might have been competitive earlier
this year
now we might not be I don't know what do
you think about all this look I think it
is a very important point to understand
what's happening is that the blue wave
if it hope ins knock on wood fingers
crossed everything it's not gonna hit
everywhere the same way because there's
just less blue and less places now there
are some complicating factors to that
analysis so let me say one more thing
it's very important to understand we did
very very well in Virginia the Trump
base is Virginia has one of the smallest
per capita amount of the Trump base of
any of the swing states it's one of the
reasons why it's one of the few states
that moved that Hillary Clinton did
better in than Barack Obama you know and
Colorado's in other state and so in that
sense Virginia is not a Virginia can
tell you a lot about the districts at
Hillary Clinton won in 2016 they
currently have Republican members
California Pennsylvania you know all
across the country in places like that
so that's New Jersey so that is very
true now the thing that I would say we
are no longer into don't wet the bed wet
the bed that's not a thing we do anymore
for people who people who were fans have
a different podcast we once had in a
much different political time but there
are some signs that in the Midwest in
particular that exact formula states
that Trump won in 2016 to that exact
formula it's a it's a more complicated
fiction than that just we're gonna do
well in blue they're gonna do well in
red and that in purple areas purple
states states that Obama won by a little
bit Trump won by a decent amount
Democrats are doing quite well
Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin are three
that are interesting with Michigan is
another one Trump's numbers and Iowa
suggests some opportunities for
Democrats there and so the just the
regions of the country are very
different deep deep red seems like it is
getting potentially more deeper a which
I'm Tommy Vitor I'm John love it love it
what's out uh we got one HBO show under
our belts yeah whoo well you can still
catch it online you can catch it
streaming to HBO now it would be nice if
you did tomorrow you and I are gonna
head to Austin Texas dan and John go a
little later for our show on Friday our
guest is Beto O'Rourke he is and I want
you to know that as we go to level two
of the video game of me not eating carbs
Texas barbecue the next challenge
Oh God well you look good everyone don't
forget to go to vote save America com
get everything you need for the election
on November 6 you get an interactive
voter guide fill out a copy of your
ballot you can find volunteer
opportunities we're just trying to make
it easy there's a couple cynical people
out there think this is some sort of
data capture play for us we'll burn the
data when we're done we don't have a
 just vote
maybe you'll brother Dan I'm burning the
data ok 22 days until the midterms love
it
today is Monday October 15 we're gonna
talk about Elizabeth Warren's October
Surprise federal Rourke's fundraising
nationwide Republican voter suppression
tactics Jared Kushner tactics Jared
Kushner's taxes in the murder of Saudi
journalist Jamal khashoggi whew okay
okay
section one midterm grab bag there's me
a lot of polls there should be some
horse race stories there to make you
anxious the thing you all need to know
is it's gonna be close it's gonna be
close
it's gotta work hard keep your head down
but here are some things that jumped out
at us over the weekend yes
overnight Elizabeth Warren released a
DNA test that provides quote strong
evidence you had a Native American in
her family tree dating back six to ten
generations scoreboards Donald Trump
doing another racist birther demand from
our racist president who's been
demanding to see the longest form of
birth certificate her DNA for a long
time it was a cool video I don't know
what do you think so the results suggest
that she has Native American heritage
somewhere six to ten generations back
Donald Trump has said that if she can
demonstrate that she has Native American
heritage she would donate 1 million to
charity Elizabeth Warren selected a
charity that focuses on helping Native
Americans
my advice to that charity would be do
not assume the money in the budget for
the fiscal year
that would be my one will not clear one
one thing I would say hey if it comes in
you know hope for the best plan for the
worst that's what I would say yeah for
that organization yeah I mean like the
video was well-executed like everything
she does I it was very compelling I mean
it depresses the life out of me that are
racist birther president demanded
another person like live up to a level
of truth and factual accuracy and
evidentiary presentation that he doesn't
live up to you but whatever okay yeah
you know this isn't a shouldn't focus on
this too much shouldn't give this too
much oxygen clearly this is something
that Senator Warren wanted to dispense
with before next year I who knows why
who could who could think of a reason as
to why she'd want to dispense with this
before we enter some sort of a I don't
know a race a marathon next year yeah
but you know I I can't imagine this will
solve the problem totally but look we
talked to her a few months ago and when
this controversy was first erupting or
at least erupting in a bigger way we
asked her about it she actually was
pretty frustrated by the fact that she
was being put in this position I think
she's right to have been frustrated to
put be put in this position but all in
all I'm glad she's dealing with it it
seems like it's the kind of thing that
she was gonna have to answer one way or
another so she wanted to deal with it
now now there's been some criticism I've
heard that she's doing it before the
midterms like it's a big distraction the
idea that Elizabeth Warren putting out a
video when she reveals that she has a
Native American heritage is gonna cost
us midterm persistent I've ever
heard
so this seems to be to be unrelated to
the midterms yeah I mean I think the
birther thing followed Obama around
forever because it was fundamentally
racist and people wanted to have a
racist attack on him I think this is
different but I don't think Trump will
let it go anyway let's talk about bet
O'Rourke yeah bet O'Rourke's campaign
announced that he raised an astonishing
38 million dollars in the last three
months that brings his total to nearly
62 million dollars the biggest quarter
ever for a Senate candidate this
immediately led to criticism from
Democrats want that money to spread the
wealth around like Joe the Plumber the
latest iteration of that narrative was a
New York Times story with the headline
better or or swore chess bothers some
Democrats of these struggles can Ted
Cruz
love it does Beddoes warchest
bother you it doesn't it doesn't bother
me you know it feels like it's the wrong
so there's sort of two things that are
getting combined one is it's absolutely
true that if better work were to win a
Senate seat it is worth the exact same
number of votes for Majority Leader as
Phil Breslin as Claire McCaskill as
Heidi Heitkamp as bill Nelson as Jackie
Rosen as Kyrsten Sinema that's
absolutely true and we need all of those
candidates to do well we need all of
those candidates have the resources they
need to compete it would be a shame to
wake up on Election Day having the day
after election day and having discovered
that if we just put a few more resources
into a race we could have won the Senate
that that's obviously true but it's
actually a separate point than what
better work is doing because better work
has not taken a single dollar away from
another Senate candidate yeah I think
well well said I mean this criticism I
think tells you a lot about traditional
fundraising for many candidates there's
like a finite number of bundlers and
lobbyists and PACs that they go to and
that is a zero-sum game beto got
contributions from 800,000 donors more
than half of the third-quarter money was
from people in Texas and so like the
average small dollar donor in Houston
isn't sitting around thinking like I got
a hundred bucks so I give the beto or
split it with Heitkamp and Manchin like
that's a very DC way to think about it
some people pointed out that in 2008
Mark Warner transferred a bunch of money
the DSCC but like he was winning that
was down by as much as eight points so
and and also by the way you know Beto is
doing more than just campaigning for
himself when you have a war chest like
that and you can use it to get out the
vote organize put up ads you help build
a growing Democratic coalition in Texas
Texas is getting closer and closer to
being a state we can win more frequently
this has been something we've been
talking about I remember when George W
Bush was the candidate for re-election
the conversation was this may be one of
the last times Texas is not in
contention it hasn't been true yet it's
taking longer than anybody wanted but
Texas was closer than Iowa we still in
our minds think of Iowa as a swing state
so so I think I'd say that as well also
but by the way like it's true you know
Democrats are driven by sort of heart
in a way that I think Republicans aren't
as much and that is a problem right it
is a problem we don't pay enough
attention to down ballot races that
don't inspire us we don't pay attention
enough to Secretary of State's races and
judges races and District Attorney races
we do treat politics as something that's
about inspiration rather than you know
practical purse pretty sure exactly
absolutely sure and that that's
something that we should think about
more but but using beto and sort of
saying that Beddoes warchest should
trouble you is actually not the right
conclusion the question we should ask is
what can we do to have other Democrats
excite people in the same way take the
positions that get more fundraising in
and that's it yeah if you're listening
to the show right now and you're
thinking I want Democrats to take back
the Senate then you should give money to
Claire McCaskill Bill Nelson Heidi
Heitkamp Joe Donnelly John tester
darling or challengers like Kyrsten
Sinema and Jackie Rosen we have to win
those races if you gave Tibet oh because
you were inspired by bet oh that's great
there's no negative there like the idea
that he has an obligation to pull a
bait-and-switch on his own donors and
start giving money away before the
election is like bonkers
that said I don't know how you spend 38
million dollars in a month but we're
gonna find out yeah it's just not a
zero-sum game that's all it's silly not
a zero-sum game and you know what like
look we talked about all this time right
that that like there's this
contradiction right which is we need Joe
Manchin to win but we wanted to pay him
a price for voting for Cavanaugh we want
President to win but it pisses us the
pisses us off that he gets behind
Cavanaugh for no reason and
actually loses some some volunteers
because of it well there's actually that
that's the kind of negative one right
the one where you're like oh man you
know we need him to win but it sucks
that they took that position but there's
actually a positive example right we
want people like Beto to be rewarded for
being the kind of candidates we believe
in yeah and that sends a message about
what kind of candidates we want in the
future so I think this kind of hand
wringing is silly I think it was a
narrative in search of examples yes and
that's it run better run okay that story
was annoying
this one is downright frightening even
though Trump had to solve his
voter fraud panel efforts to prevent
people from voting are so happening at
the state level and a bunch of states in
the name of voter role maintenance
Georgia has cancelled over 1.4
voter registration system an in charge
of purging the voter rolls is Secretary
of State Brian Kemp who is now running
for governor
more recently Kemp's office put 53,000
registration applications on hold 70% of
those applications are african-american
so is Kemp's opponent Stacey Abrams what
a coincidence
love it like this is so brazen it is so
obvious it's clearly voter suppression
it's happening in plain sight what do we
do about it
yeah so another number was that six
hundred and seventy thousand had been
thrown off in 2017 alone and you know
look you turned on a football game you
know football the sport that I can talk
to you about I mean it'd be quite a
thing if at some point during the game
the the quarterback just one in the
middle field start started throwing out
flags you know on the other team yeah
yeah yeah keeping out being the ref your
UMP write anything that's inappropriate
you'd be like wait a second you can't
call balls and strikes on the football
field home run man well you're on the
game you're in it you're the QB you're
the halfback the fullback we can't have
a fullback moving the chains and if I
was really moved away from is that right
but yeah yeah absolutely that's what's
going on here
the other thing is you know Michelle
Goldberg wrote a really great piece
about this in New York Times that I
would recommend everyone read it
actually is a really great rundown of
this issue and where it stands one thing
I would hope is that Chief Justice John
Roberts gets a newspaper and reads it
because the Voting Rights Act look the
United States was not truly a literal
democracy until we changed our voting
rights laws and we made sure that a
history of segregation votes oppression
and racial terrorism in the south didn't
prevent millions of African Americans
from casting about it
third the success of the Voting Rights
Act was used to undermine the Voting
Rights Act in the second John Roberts
and that court allowed the Voting Rights
Act and its key provisions that means
states with a history of racial voter
suppression have to have their voting
laws reviewed by the Justice Department
before they're approved the second that
was removed these states went
hog wild that's what's going on right
now that's going on across the south and
across the country and you know one
thing we need to do is again as we were
talking about earlier you hear pundits
shaking she's furious
she's wearing bowties she looks really
cute she is she looks like Paula
Poundstone the we need we need to win
Secretary of State's races we need to
win local races we need to win judges
races and we need to make sure we win
down ballot so that we can fight this in
the future but it's honest and we need
to have see how these cases play out but
it's a really tough issue and the bottom
line is if Stacey Abrams loses by a tiny
bit in this governor's race it will be
an illegitimate elation I mean this is
racist in Florida african-americans are
more likely to other about their
vote-by-mail ballot rejected in Texas
the Secretary of State is trying to
invalidate voter registration
applications submitted through vote org
this is happening all the time like you
said in 2013 Roberts gutted the Voting
Rights Act and he made it harder for the
federal government to do anything so we
got to win the governor's office and
legislators and Secretary of State's
because as much as people criticize
Hillary for not going to Wisconsin it is
probably more significant that nearly
17,000 registered Wisconsin voters were
prevented from voting by the state's
voter ID law and Trump won the state by
twenty two thousand seven hundred and
forty eight votes look at what's
happening at North Dakota address Heidi
Heitkamp needs Native American votes to
win they have just changed the law to
make it so that if you are if you're if
you're registered a Tapio box that Nolan
our accounts well guess guess who tends
to be registered appeal boxes player box
is more than the rest of the state
Native Americans because a variety of
reasons and so we are seeing this it's
incredibly dangerous it is
anti-democratic and that's it yeah over
the weekend the New York Times reported
that Jared Kushner appears to have paid
basically zero federal income tax from
onine to 2016 basically he was able to
claim that buildings he owns were
depreciating in value and used those
losses on paper to offset any money he
actually made because you know real
estate in New York it's always going
down in price love it how do we buy a
building and get in on this action well
first you have to buy a building on
Fifth Avenue at the height of the boom
and then go so far in debt that you are
really a supplicant to foreign
governments down writing this yeah this
is good I mean I would that sounded like
TV button managing the yeah look this is
and one other thing I'd say is to the
the corporate tax bill that they just
passed makes
even easier for people like Jared
Kushner to claim that their losses
outweigh their need to pay federal
income taxes you know Donald Trump has
probably has claimed the same we know
that from his 1995 tax return that he
claimed almost a billion dollars in
losses which meant that he probably
didn't pay taxes for the next decade
at well even as he's accruing massive
wealth this is one of the great issues
of our time you know I've said this
before but inequality is not some
mysterious force you know we see a lot
of like harrumphing and conferences
about the future of work and
globalization and technology and all the
rest that is not because of economic
inequality in America the cause of
economic inequality is corporate
concentration and government policy and
this is yet another example of that yeah
I mean all rich people like Donald Trump
and the Koch brothers and many others
they use like populist rage to get
economic policies that benefit them
Dysport Lee like when you hear Donald
Trump complain about his taxes just
remember that his dad was able to give
him over four hundred million dollars
Jared pays no income taxes like these
wealthy people use these loopholes to
avoid paying taxes Warren Buffett is
honest about it he says he pays a lower
effective rate than his secretary Gary
Cohn was quoted as saying that only
morons pay the estate tax so when they
say this is about helping farmers
they're lying it's rigged
it's this is why Democrats need
to be in control so we can actually
change the tax code to get Jared to pay
something and help you know working
people it really is you know it really
really are you know we need there really
are two systems here and I think one
thing people don't understand about what
these sort of high-powered lawyers and
tax accountants do is you know for a
person who's just has a job and goes to
their accountant or does their taxes
themselves it's all pretty simple you
know what you're supposed to declare or
not it's it's not it's not as simple as
you want to be it can be complicated and
really confusing but ultimately
you're like you know what you made you
know what you're supposed to declare you
know what you're you know what would be
kind of skirting the rules a bit but you
do your best to pay your taxes and what
you owe for people that have these
incredibly complicated wealthy high-end
lawyers that are kind of looking at
investments and losses and and write
offs and all the rest their lawyers
don't actually tell them here's what's
legal and here's what's illegal they
basically say here's what's really
conservative here's what
think you can get away with here's
what's pushing it here's what's really
 pushing it it's a shot and
you're got this guy in jail and you bit
and basically you know these they sit
around the table and they decide what
they don't decide what do they oh they
decide what can we get away with that is
what our tax code is written to do and
one other piece of this is over and over
again we have seen through budgets
through policy decisions the Republican
Party has tried to undermine the IRS
ability to investigate tax fraud amongst
the wealthy because it the the audits
are much more likely to come for people
who make less sue me because they're
more people but also because it's just a
lot harder to go into Donald
Trump's books and figure out what the
 is going on but I'd say one thing
Democrats should be talking about when
they see this is we need to make sure
that we have federal investigators with
the ability to go after tax krod to go
after tax fraud at the highest levels
these people are getting away with
stealing from you Donald Trump has done
it his father has done it Jared Kushner
has done it countless people in finance
are doing it every single day when they
don't have the scrutiny of national
politics on them and it's a huge problem
that the donor class doesn't want to
I'm Evy tor I'm John Lovett jon favreau
is either in Florida or an route to
Florida you will know by the tenor of
his tweets poor John had a long travel
day nine and a half hours in LAX yeah he
was at LAX all day you just we had a
whole day at work over cold day we're
just sitting there and then he responded
to something like 9:30 p.m. still about
to get on a red-eye yeah brutal um today

are guests Tournament of Champions I
today are gonna they're gonna host the
shows in studio with a bunch of really
awesome guests we have lined up so tune
in for that
back in those are gonna be great I can't
wait today on the pod we're gonna talk
about Nikki Haley's decision to resign
from her role as the US ambassador the
United Nations a terrifying new UN
report about climate change and a quick
snapshot of the current political
climate maybe a little fun op-ed that
President Trump wrote you know just for
kicks
good job USA Today yeah thanks for
running that then we're gonna slip some
lies under hotel room doors from the but
you'll hear our conversation with
Cherise David's a congressional
candidate and MMA fighter in Kansas the
Kansas third so we did that interview a
little differently this week he's gonna
put the Republican majority in a
headlock all right lovely yesterday even
truck yesterday even top Trump aids-like
national security visor John Bolton and
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were
surprised when Axio says Jonathan Swan
broke the news
that nikki Haley had offered her
resignation will be leaving at the end
of the year she's one of the most
high-profile women in Trump's cabinet
and she you know made that standard
transition from anti-trump to Mogga dead
ender and is not quitting two-part
question for you
does anything from Haley's tenure at the
UN stand out to you and were you
surprised by the timing of her departure
it's a little weird to have a cabinet
official leave right before an election
right especially yeah it's it is strange
I think you know there's a little bit of
you know paint it being the foreman of
being a what they call it being a
there's a little bit of being the
foreman out of paint job because you
know show ups it's a little bit like let
me get the analogy right yeah it's it's
like um it's like a little bit like
being you know the old joke you know
show up sober they make you Foreman um
like nikki Haley you know she is not as
bad as who could have been in that job
totally she has had some moments where
she is said the right things she had
said had moments where she has looked
the other way for horrible Trump
behavior I mean fundamentally the
problem with being a trump cabinet
official is you cannot do the job
without a seating to some of the worst
behavior and worst policy instincts and
especially when you're at the UN look
right now we are dealing with the fact
that Saudi Arabia may have brazenly
killed a journalist while Donald Trump
and Jared Kushner have been sucking up
to Saudi Arabia maybe for their own
personal interest probably for their own
personal interest for years so how can
you be in this administration and be
respected and seen as a good actor when
you have to represent Donald Trump's
views in that way so you know I agree
with every Democratic senator who is
praised nikki Haley by saying she's not
as bad as what could have been there
otherwise but that's not a really good
standard terms of leaving it's
weird
maybe it's nothing but we don't know the
facts yet yeah maybe think about 2006
when Don Rumsfeld was the defense
secretary he was super unpopular at
extremely controversial the Iraq war was
a disaster but Bush still waited after
the midterms to cut him loose which I
remember that a great decision I
remember
right after that election we're in the
Senate yeah I remember we were just
sitting there and we had won the house
and we had won the Senate and it was
this incredible victory and then like
the very next morning we saw all of
these cats all this Exodus and was like
is this happening this is cool this is
amazing yeah so it's really weird I
don't like super weird and I have not
seen anything other than just sort of
idle speculation about the region's well
yeah it so it is notable that it did
seem like a happy conscious uncoupling
right there's a rare scene of them like
doing a press pay together announcing
her departure and it wasn't just you
know Reince Priebus quitting hugging it
out with his bro Donald Trump on Air
Force One that he can blast it via tweet
and like sent home in a van so
interesting um apparently she said she
wanted to leave that Hurst departure
didn't look like it was tied to
potentially bad election results she's
burnout it's also notable that some
Ethics watchdog groups have been raising
the fact that she accepted multiple
flights on private jets owned by South
Carolina businessman right which has
never stopped Trump cabinet official
from resigning and from serving in the
past the they all love it they love
private jets over there but and who
doesn't the UH no but but um you know I
think something that really captures the
the problem of nikki Haley and the
unfair credit she gets is what she said
about Donald Trump and his various
allegations of sexual misconduct against
women which is she was given you know
pundit plaudits for just for simply
saying that those women deserve to be
heard yeah as opposed to with the Trump
official position which is it never
happened it's false but as with Susan
Collins as with nikki Haley okay you've
heard them but no action no behavioral
change but if you hear these people like
it's again this problem of doing more
than the reprehensible behavior of the
worst actors in American politics gets
you points but it shouldn't yeah in in
her resignation letter Haley pointed to
successes some of them were getting
sanctions against North Korea standing
up for Israel some nebulous UN reforms
this one I thought was kind of funny
speaking out quote resolutely against
dictatorships in Iran Syria man escuela
Cuba and yes Russia I mean my take I
think this is a pretty mixed bag I do
think they deserve credit for getting
tough sanctions
it's North Korea and if that turns into
a nuclear-free Peninsula I will praise
them to the rooftops I think every
administration spends a bunch of time
defending Israel against efforts to
attack it and criticize them at the UN
so that's sort of par for the course
you mentioned Saudi Arabia I mean the
notion that Trump is stood up to
dictatorship certainly they've gone
after Iran but they've never criticized
Russia Venezuela is still a disaster I
mean as you noted this journalist Jamal
khashoggi was murdered reportedly in a
Saudi diplomatic facility in Istanbul so
you know maybe a little maybe a mixed
bag here yeah yeah and you know she's
good she's given sorted into the maddest
category of people who are lucky to have
in this administration and I guess it's
just it's it's we have to keep two
things in our mind at once on the one
hand yeah that's there is some truth to
that and I am NOT you know I am I think
in this debate about whether or not we
should give people a little generosity
for serving the Trump administration for
stopping bad things I am very very
skeptical of that argument but probably
a little less skeptical than a lot of
people like I think less skeptical than
like you and Jon a little less skeptical
than Brian Blair I give them a little
bit more latitude because I do think
that there is some truth to it but again
you look at what's happening with Saudi
Arabia look at what's happening with
Russia there's just there's no way to
serve this administration and not be
giving up the most basic American values
yeah I know you know what I've I agree
with you you're right about this one I
mean a fun note here The Washington Post
the other thing they talked about is how
we're more respected in the world the
Washington Post noted that in only four
countries it doesn't include the US
Trump's approach is viewed positively
only four countries so that great and
the truth is I think nikki Haley gets a
lot of credit simply because she is
incredibly charismatic she is very smart
she is a very good speaker yeah she does
a very good job of representing herself
and very good points and you know we may
may turn out that there's some secret
reason that she left or as she has done
throughout this she is just carefully
managing her position and the thing
about working for Donald Trump is when
there's an opening to leave where it
doesn't look like you're doing it
because of corruption a scandal a sex
assault a Muller probe some
other awful story that would look like
you had a reason to go
maybe sometimes you just take it
because like that's three or four days a
year that's good
this was fun as she left Hayley said a
couple things that caught my eye first
that Jared Kushner is quote such a
hidden genius that no one understands
yeah that's funny it's like yeah even
even Harvard couldn't find it
I guess Jared joins Kanye is just
another misunderstood Trump loving
genius um the second is that she felt
the need to explicitly say that she will
not be a candidate for any office in
2020 did you think that was weird I
think she was dealing with the
speculation but again like this is this
is another another way in which we see
the joke of I'm here to stop bad things
that we hear from people like nikki
Haley at Madison others if you believe
that that your role was to prevent
Donald Trump from his worst instincts
and actually do some good despite the
awfulness of this person and you don't
have to take my word for it take Nikki
Haley's word for it take what nikki
Haley said about Donald Trump before she
worked for administration at face value
and then they leave and they immediately
say I'll be campaigning like crazy for
him because nikki Haley will someday run
as a Republican again and when she does
she will run in a party that has it
gives Donald Trump at eighty or ninety
percent approval rating yeah regarding
Jared being a genius like I love I love
to slap this guy around but I mean it's
worth noting that we are still waiting
for his long-promised Middle East peace
plan and also that entire plan is
predicated on support from Saudi Arabia
doing whatever the Saudis want he's the
guy who pushed us all in on this
Mohammed bin Salman strategy who is the
one who would be responsible for the
murder of this journalist yeah and also
it's again like there's this sort of
clique right there's this Ivanka Jared
Nikki hailey Dena Powell kind of where
the responsible ones we're trying to
stop bad and then we're trying to stop
Steven Miller then we're trying to stop
whoever and it's like okay well you know
what do you got you know it's not we're
now hitting this for two years where the
results here what's what are you talking
about would you've done how think you
know when you're the President had
States you're not like you don't it's
not like you're painting a beautiful
portrait that you reveal after four
years it's not gonna be some unveiling
of Donald Trump's accomplishments if
Jared's a hidden genius it means he's
not getting results right where where's
the outcomes here we are they like the
notion that anyone stupid so stupid you
know than anyone good primary trump
is just ridiculous I don't even know why
we get done like reporters speculated
about this um but now it is time to play
everyone's favorite game wild
speculation about who comes next this is
the closest thing to a job Trump is
actually qualified for which is reality
show producer he told reporters on Air
Force One that their five names on the
short list one is your friend and your
mentor former deputy national security
adviser Dinah Powell you know Val yeah
Deena sorry uh just one look like
another names and floated is is unhinged
Twitter troll and current US ambassador
to Germany Rick Cornell yeah Rick
Grinnell man there's somebody who has
failed up looked up I mean somebody who
talked to reporters about him and they
say this is a guy that is so
undiplomatic so hard to deal with and
now of course because so few Republicans
at first were willing to go and now him
and now because the the sorting inside
the Republican Party led a lot of people
who were more qualified to avoid it he's
somebody on a short list which it would
never have been on another
administration's list although you know
what so but yeah Ezra Klein pointed this
out there are ways in which the Donald
Trump administration is looking at hell
of a lot like the George W Bush
administration you've got john bolton at
at national security adviser you have
dina powell potentially at un you have
crazy high deficits you have a giant
corporate tax cut I mean in a lot of
ways what we're seeing is george w bush
administration with donald trump's
personality yeah hilariously Trump also
said that there's no one more competent
in the world than Ivanka but he can't
choose her beauty beacuse of nepotism
apparently forgetting that she currently
works in the White House is like he's
like I should pick Ivanka she'd be the
best why she's not the most qualified
that's so stupid but then I'd be accused
of nepotism I don't know I don't know
it's sort the risk of sounding glib like
do you think it's important who comes
next so what's your take him on this I
don't know I like as I just don't know
like obviously I would prefer it to be
someone who is not a flame-throwing nut
ball like John Bolton like but again
like what we have seen over the last two
years is the little the the the the the
names change but the outcomes are the
same that's exactly right I mean I
think I struggled with this question too
because I do think Trump blots out the
stun but there's still a bunch of stuff
that matters and happens that Trump
never even learns about it was probably
especially true at the UN cuz out of
sight out of mind so right if he names
someone that's gonna like work with
other countries and build relationships
like that is a good thing if he puts a
John Bolton type as you said that person
just lives to piss the world off that's
not great yeah and again one other
points that a lot of stories have made
about nikki Haley is she was somebody
people could go to to find out what the
 is going on with Donald Trump's
indictment crazy which is again a
reminder of the fact that we are in this
crazy universe where there are two
parallel administration's the one that
emanates from Donald Trump's face and
the real day to day work that's actually
going on and that's incredibly unhealthy
and dangerous but in that in that in
that circumstance which we find
ourselves it is important to have
someone up there who is not one of the
worst Republicans in the world I don't
know what there is the sales one last
sort interesting note on this when Haley
goes there will only be five women left
in cabinet level positions we have Linda
McMahon at small business administration
Gina Haskell at CIA Betsy DeVos at
education Elaine Chao transportation
Kirsten Nielsen at DHS that is shocking
out of twenty three I believe cabinet
level roles yeah but as though in the
same way where you know you have the
White House intern photo release and
it's basically all white like I'm glad
Donald Trump doesn't have the cover of
diversity to hide the fact that he's
anti woman in the same way I'm glad he
doesn't have the cover diversity to hide
the fact that he's racist yeah last
point on this where we move on like will
you forget the turnover rate in this
White House administration generally is
absurdly high in his first year is
thirty four percent which Brookings said
was the highest in 40 years more
recently you know we've Haley leaving we
have Trump announcing with us counsel
Don McGann will be leaving via tweet
which surprised Don began scott pruett
was the most corrupt human being
Washington not named Trump Rex Tillerson
was fired on the toilet bolt enforced at
all the senior annecy staff said Gorka
was fired because no one realized he
worked there he had nothing to do there
was that mooch guy like we're dulled by
this constant barrage of news but isn't
it a big deal that huge bureaucracies
yeah we turning over all the time you
know we don't have a president we have a
weird semi president you know fantasy
nightmare on to something a little
different we may not know the name of
the next US ambassador of the UN but we
do know which
horrifying UN report they will soon be
ignoring the UN scientific panel on
climate change released a truly
frightening report that says if we stay
on our current course world temperatures
could rise by as much as 1.5 degrees
Celsius by 2040 we could see food
shortages wild files and wildfires and
mass die-offs of coral reefs avoiding
the worst damages requires transforming
the world economy very quickly at
massive cost it would require highly
unlikely political choices Trump is
repeatedly called climate change' hoax
invented by the Chinese and pulled us
out of the Paris climate Accords love it
holy like how do you process
something this dire so here's how I
first of all the truth is you don't
actually have to do much processing of
it in a lot of ways it's like you know
you go to the doctor or the doc yeah
here's I'll be honest like here's how I
was thinking about this this morning so
first of all everybody should read David
Roberts on this issue because he's one
of the smartest reporters and one of the
great writers on climate and he wrote a
really great explanation of what it
would take
given these new findings which are
powering and terrible but at the end of
that piece he said something which is
basically like the political will to
actually do what we need to do is not
there the odds that we overshoot are
basically nil and therefore what has
been true about climate policy before is
true now we just have to keep doing as
yes welcome to pod save America I'm John
Favreau
later in the pod you'll hear from three
candidates that Tommy interviewed for an

this is uh this is the last time I want
to talk about Brett Cavanaugh
for a while oh really it's gonna be our
 wives for 30 years I know well
we're gonna have to talk about him again
but I at least want to break after this
since we've been all kavanah all the
time on this pod
the man who responded to multiple
allegations of sexual assault by blaming
Democrats and threatening that what goes
around comes around was nevertheless
confirmed as the Supreme Court justice
by the smallest margin of any nominee in
a hundred and forty years two Republican
no votes would have killed the
nomination but in the end only one
Republican senator was troubled by
Cavanaugh's conduct temperament or
ability to be impartial alaska's lisa
murkowski Alaska's Lisa
Kowski susan collins the only other
potential swing vote supported Cavanaugh
and said she did not believe that he
assaulted dr. Christine Blasi Ford after
learning that Collins was a yes and the
Cavanaugh would be confirmed no matter
what Democrat Joe Manchin of West
Virginia also voted yes and that was
that Dan let's start with Susan Collins
who gave a speech explaining her vote on
Friday afternoon what was your reaction
to that speech and do you think she was
always a yes that speech was essentially
the a very long arduous recitation of
Trump Whitehouse and McConnell Senate
office talking points yeah it dealt with
none of the major issues it alighted
major facts it cited cases that should
have been an enactment to other things
that Susan Collins has claimed she
believed in and she she made a case for
Susan Collins being a partisan
Republican and not some sort of key
swing vote moderate voice of conscious
in the Senate she is pretty it she is
what she is what she is and we should we
have known this you and I have talked
about this if this isn't Collins has
been telling us for a month that she is
a yes yeah he was a yes before the
allegations because she was the only
person who sat down with Brett Kavanaugh
and came away with the impression that
he would preserve roe v wade which you
had to really twist herself into some
sort of judicial pretzel to believe but
she did that nonetheless she pointed out
to all of us that she had voted for
every Supreme Court nominee who would
ever come up from nominated by a
president of either party during her
Senate tenure and I think we ascribed
like she would serve a warrant a false
were shocked test for those folks like
us who were desperately looking for hope
and folks like the media who were
desperately looking for some sort of
hero in this or some sort of he you know
sort of narrative to hear about this she
was always going to be a yes and there
was we know that and nothing we get in
her way including very credible
allegations of sexual assault
a partisan temper tantrum and obvious
documented lie under oath before the
Senate on multiple occasions yeah I mean
if you go back and look at every
statement that Susan Collins has made
since the moment that Brett Kavanaugh
was nominated it is hard to find any
hint that she might have opposed his
nomination and that's not true by the
way with Lisa Murkowski statements Lisa
Murkowski generally kept her own counsel
during this and didn't make too many
statements but you could sort of tell
that Murkowski could like I always
thought that the most likely knows in
order were Murkowski and then flake
because who knows what flake might do
sometimes and then Collins and that's
not because I thought Jeff Flake was
gonna end up being some hero it's just
because Collins just everything she said
seemed like she wanted to get to yes and
look I I read her speech last night I
didn't see it
when she delivered it but I sort of read
it last night as we were preparing for
the pod I mean there's a case to be made
that she genuinely believes in her own
mind that he won't overturn roe v wade
that he is this model of judicial
temperament or whatever like she might
have convinced herself of that I don't
know but when you read that speech she
started the speech by attacking
Democrats for opposing Kavanagh when he
was announced like the whole beginning
of the speech was just an attack on
Democrats was incredibly partisan
especially for Susan Collins she also
talked about how she's always voted for
Supreme Court nominees whether they're
liberal or conservative and she did vote
for Roberts Alito Sotomayor Kagan
Gorsuch so she does have this record of
voting for Supreme Court nominees no
matter which party or no one you know no
matter who they're nominated by what the
president's party is the exception of
course is she didn't do much when
 Mitch McConnell wouldn't give
Merrick garland to hearing shouldn't do
anything I would love to be there with
Susan Collins hears about this whole
Americana thing because she seems to
have either been asleep during it or
have conveniently forgotten about it
because it was it is the context for all
of this and she conclude the ignored it
completely ignored it
which you know McConnell
when he did the garland thing part of
that was giving some of his members
cover like Collins to not have to face
what an awful thing he did because he's
like it I'll take the rap for this
I'm the majority leader I'm the one who
has all the power to not give Merrick
garland a hearing and you can all say
whatever you want that's what you do
with power and then also and this is
important she didn't really say this in
her speech so much but she said this on
CNN that she that she doesn't believe
she believes that dr. Christine Blasi
Ford was attacked sexually assaulted she
doesn't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh
so she believes Susan Collins believes a
theory that was almost universally
condemned as a crazy conspiracy when it
was floated by Ed Whelan Brett
Cavanaugh's friend who used to be at the
center on ethics and public policy
whatever the it was called the
conspiracy theory that when dr.
Christine Blasi Ford said that she was a
hundred percent certain that it was
Brett Kavanaugh who attacked her she was
just suffering from a case of mistaken
identity and it was actually someone who
looked like Brett Kavanaugh that's what
Susan Collins believes to be true she
didn't say I actually don't know who's
telling the truth and who's lying she
didn't say that no no she went with the
conspiracy theory about the Cavanaugh
doppelganger
so yeah I'm I'm pretty sure she was
already in the yes camp this is an
important point because you sort of have
to call on what is happening
here which is put aside Trump and the in
the sort of the far-right Magga heads
but what mainstream Republicans do
extent that that the terminal exists
want to do is have it both ways they
want to claim to be people who in the me
to era believe victims but in Congress
team forward credible but they also want
they want to be able to say that and
then also vote is this she was lying
because it is one or the other if you
say she is credible then you have to to
believe that she is correct when she
says that she's one percent certain that
Brent Cavanaugh attacked her and you
can't have it both ways and people
in susan house is trying to get away
with that yeah and it's just it's
ridiculous
it's the fights you know she might as
well have pulled out her Zillow maps now
I think I think two of the most
politically difficult no votes were from
Lisa Murkowski and from North Dakota's
Heidi Heitkamp who is the only 2018
Senate Democrat who's actually trailing
in the polls right now what did you
think about why they made the decisions
they did these two women and what did
you think about their reasoning you a
Republican a Democrat those who did the
right thing without regard to political
consequences Heidi Heitkamp took a huge
risk she could have gone to joe Manchin
route and just voted yes when the when
it wouldn't have affected the outcome
and she didn't do that and Lisa
Murkowski just stood up against a lot of
pressure from McConnell and Trump and
everyone else and did the right thing
and we should applaud that yeah oh
absolutely and you know especially
Heitkamp - I mean Murkowski ZUP in in
2022 she is sort of used to pissing off
her party a little bit right she and
we've talked about this before but she
won her last race with a write-in
campaign because of further right
Republican won the Republican nomination
and and Murkowski still won just with
the write-in campaign which is pretty
incredible so she has somewhat of a
track record of doing this Heidi
Heitkamp I have to say she is not in the
past been known to make very politically
tough decisions and votes being in deep
deep read North Dakota a state that
Trump won by what 36 points 40 points
someone will correct me it's a
line and she's up she's in the race of
her life she only won her last race by a
couple tenths of a point and now she's
in this race and she's trailing in the
polls and every consultant every poll
probably told her you know the smart
thing to do is just vote YES on this and
and move on she could have done with
like you said she could done with Joe
Manchin that she could have waited to
see how Collins voted realized that the
nomination
going through anyway and said it
I'm just gonna vote yes cuz it's gonna
be political easy and she didn't and
that is something that is something very
admirable and something very rare in
politics I also thought it was
interesting how high camps reasoning and
Murkowski is reasoning both sorted
centered around the inability of
Cavanaugh to serve as an impartial
justice on the court and it went to his
temperament in the hearings Heitkamp
said in addition to the concerns about
his past conduct last Thursday's hearing
called into question judge Cavanaugh's
temperament honesty and impartiality and
she later said on 60 minutes quote I saw
a level of anger and combativeness that
I thought was not something that would
qualify you to sit on the Supreme Court
similarly Murkowski said quote I have a
very high standard
this judiciary must be perceived as
independent as nonpartisan as fair and
balanced and in my conscience I could
not conclude the Kavanagh is the right
person for the court at this time so I
think it's interesting sort of as a
almost a road not taken' for Democrats
and we can talk about that later that
you know while the issue of the sexual
assault allegations became incredibly
divisive there was a way for red state
Democrats and Republicans in purple
states like Markowski and to look at the
situation and say whatever you believe
about what happened 35 years ago this
man has proven over the last couple
weeks that he is not fit to sit on the
court because he has threatened partisan
revenge against Democrats and said that
they made up this whole thing to attack
him like you know I just I think that
was an interesting set of reasons I
think you and I should it's important to
point out that we have been making the
argument for months that voting against
Kavanagh is actually the best politics
mmm matter what state you're in for a
Democrat whether you're in a red state a
blue state or a purple state and I think
that it's still the case for Heitkamp
but it is a very close call for sure and
so and she did this against the advice
of a lot of people and we should applaud
her for it and it reminds me of
when we were in the White House back in
2010 and the Affordable Care Act vote
was coming up and there were a lot of a
lot of Democrats in pretty red districts
who had a choice to make and they were
they were being told by a lot of
political consultants and reporters that
if they voted for the Affordable Care
Act they would lose can they vote did
the right thing because they knew they
might lose anyway
and if you're gonna lose you might as
well be able to look for something
endearing for the rest of time I think
hi Heidi head can't did that and we
should applaud her and we should help
her because she still has a shot to win
this thing it would be a 1 she should be
rewarded for doing the right thing in
two it would be an important political
less of the Democrats coming forward but
if she can win this race that there is
value in doing the right thing at the
police political explain anything trying
to win the argument is supposed to avoid
the argument what you too often resonate
Democrats try to do and I will say too
when you look back at that Affordable
Care Act vote a lot of people who took a
vote for the Affordable Care Act did end
up losing some Democrats but some
Democrats who voted against the
Affordable Care Act in the house some of
the Blue Dogs they lost to there was it
wasn't it wasn't necessarily true that
it you know the politics of voting
forward or against it weren't
necessarily clear in the context of an
overall way of election where Democrats
got crushed is that right the and you're
in a similar situation here where were
there no Kavanagh more there no Kavanagh
controversy Heidi Heitkamp would be
favored to lose that race right just
because it's North Dakota and she won in
a presidential election year where
Democrats tend to do better and so now
she and we're in a midterm and it's
North Dakota day and states like North
Dakota have become even more polarized
in the Trump era because it's a pretty
homogeneously white state and so she
might have lost anyway so you just don't
know yeah what we don't we don't know
what would have happened here either way
and so you got to just do the right
thing because you win the day after
election win or lose and you should feel
good about your time in office yeah
now let's turn to two Democratic Senate
candidates who ultimately supported
Cavanaugh's nomination West Virginia
senator
mansion and Tennessee's Phil Bredesen
mansion said that he had reservations
about his vote because of the
accusations and because of Cavanaugh's
temperament but found him to be a
qualified jurist that was a quote as for
bredesen he said that the allegations
against Cavanaugh quote didn't rise to
the level of being disqualifying ah dan
why do you think they voted this way
well I think in some cases we look at
red state Democrats and we presume and
I've worked for it a lot of residents
that they are true progressives who were
they in bluer States would feel more
comfortable being progressive right they
kind of sand the edges down they make a
bargain with themselves to get by in
these red states you're gonna have to do
a couple things you don't really like or
not or not do something's you want to do
in order to continue to be in the Senate
and give them ensure the Democrats
control the Senate is the most important
vote that any House or Senate member
makes is for the leader right yeah and
whether Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer
have the gavel I don't think joe Manchin
is one of those secret closet
progressives who were you know were
there to be an influx of hipster
Millennials from Williamsburg Brooklyn
who moved into West Virginia he would
all of a sudden become Bernie Sanders
might I don't think that is I think that
this is who Joe Manchin is yes what do
you think about living just in it I
don't know I mean he Phil Bredesen was
when he was governor was very similar as
I mentioned and maybe and I don't even
know that it's it I think that there is
a I don't know enough to know whether
whether they like what their views are
on Brett Kavanaugh specifically but I
think they simply do a little from
column a a little from column B when it
comes to politics well then we call them
red little from column one and this is
something from the column right that
they think will give them permission and
do something around the Affordable Care
Act because that's the thing about your
mansion is he has had many opportunities
even before the formal Care Act was
implemented
to torpedo a and he has refused to do
that and now he may have sort of done
that under the table by giving his vote
to someone who will likely rule against
the formal character in court but Soviet
and so we you know it's it's really I
don't really know what to do I'm really
torn about this because I if you can't
stand up on the most important thing
possible by guys I pointed out you the
other day but I did a little math and my
daughter's four months old and if Brett
Kavanaugh served on the court until he
was Ruth Bader Ginsburg's age my
daughter would be 32 and so if you can't
stand up on an issue like this what's
the good of having in the party but if
we don't have your mansion and Phil
Bredesen we don't have a majority and
it's just Mitch McConnell for the rest
of our lives right I do I do think that
I mean we can talk about whether this
was good politics for them in their
states I think we don't know for sure
but if they thought that voting YES
would endear them to Republicans in any
way at least joe Manchin then got a
surprise when Donald Trump jr.
the the brilliant Donald Trump jr.
tweeted a real Profile in Courage from
lyin liberal Joe Manchin waited until
Cavanaugh had enough votes secured
before he announced his support I bet he
had another press release ready to go if
Collins went the other way
West Virginia vote for Maggie champion
champion Patrick Morrissey
Patrick right yeah so that was I mean
which just really illustrates the point
that we have made on all of these tough
votes if in fact Democrats are taking
votes with Trump or with Republicans in
order to show that their bipartisan are
somehow stave off Republican attack ads
on that particular issue they're fooling
themselves because the Republican attack
David Ignatius thank you for jumping on
the line I was hoping we could start
with last week's UN General Assembly
because while it was largely wiped out
of the headlines by the Cavanagh news
and by you know will he will will he
won't he debates about Trump firing rod
Rosen Stein
there were some interesting things that
went on up in New York that I would like
to touch on so the first was the Israeli
prime minister Bibi Netanyahu revealed
what he called a secret atomic warehouse
in Tehran that he said Iran used to
store equipment and material for its
nuclear weapons program that
announcement comes not long after the
Mossad who the Israeli intelligence
services smuggled you know for I think a
hundred thousand nuclear related
documents out of a different Iranian
facility back in February how big of a
deal was this this announcement from
Netanyahu at the General Assembly I
didn't think it broke all that much new
ground you have to wonder about Iranian
security in Tehran has really seem to be
able to make off with you know documents
yes there's like everything in sight the
basic point that Netanyahu has tried to
make that the Iranians were seeking to
build a nuclear weapon that that's now
well-established it goes the question of
the credibility of Iranian promises in
the jcpoa the nuclear deal that they're
gonna stop those activities but I didn't
I didn't see a sort of fundamental step
change in our perceptions of what a
wrong and was doing the the Iranian
Foreign Minister Javad Zarif called
Netanyahu's presentation quote an
arts-and-crafts show by a country that
he says needs to come clean about its
own nuclear program does he have a point
is there a bit of hypocrisy there how do
we how should we view this response well
Israel's nuclear weapons capability on
the one hand is something that Israel is
wanted the world to know about but as
always wanted to deny formally they've
liked to have it in this ambiguous state
but they've been many histories written
about how Israel built nuclear weapons
at Damona many
years ago and it has its own nuclear
arsenal so I think the you know it it
upsets the Iranians but this is
something that the Middle East has lived
with and now for four decades yeah I
just don't think there's any way in the
world that Iranian protests about this
are gonna change Israel's commitment
that wanting and and and feeling it
needs to have a nuclear deterrent yeah
well here's the hoping the Iranians
never get a nuclear weapon also at the
UN Trump's National Security Advisor
John Bolton gave this blistering speech
warning Iran that there will be hell to
pay if they cross us but it was
interesting to me that at the same time
there were all these rumors about maybe
a possible meeting between Trump and the
Iranian president mr. rouhani it seemed
like reading between the lines at
Trump's team was genuinely nervous that
he might try to meet with rouhani Trump
ultimately knocked down those rumors by
by tweets he said I have no plans to
meet with rouhani maybe someday in the
future I am sure he's an absolutely
lovely man was the end of the tweet what
did you make of all that are dropping
his team on the same page when it comes
to Iran so I don't think the Trump and
and John Bolton are pompeius a bit of a
mystery the Secretary of State but you'd
have to say Trump drop the hanky
as it were last week in New York in in
comments tweets and what I'm told he
said privately to other leaders team he
now has a model in his mind from North
Korea that if he is rude talks really
tough makes a credible threat to use
military force puts on tough economic
sanctions that in the end the other side
will be prepared to come into
negotiations that they had claimed
earlier they wouldn't and that he'll be
able to get the the great deal that
eluded as his predecessors he clearly
believes that's what's happened with
North Korea and I think looking at him
he's trying now to execute the same
thing with Iran I'm told that what he
says to diplomats from other key
countries is they'll there'll be a time
for negotiations with the
they'll come around they have no choice
but not yet they need to they need to
feel the squeeze more so we're gonna
have starting in November very tight
tough sanctions the the effort is gonna
be to cut Iran essentially off from the
international banking system by
withdrawing the Swift payments exchange
that allows the Iranian banks to fund
transactions that that really is gonna
hurt
yeah and I'm told by Europeans that
there's not likely to be any way to stop
that so we are gonna be looking starting
in November at a much tighter squeeze in
Iran and it's it's clear from Trump's
comments he thinks sooner rather than
later that that will bring them back to
the table I have to say I kind of like
hearing that I love ya I love the
thought of Trump being enamored with
negotiations because it feels like
otherwise there would be an awful lot of
momentum towards a regime change policy
with respect to Iran well Tommy don't so
the problem with this you know little
mechanism that Trump has created is that
it yet essentially is gonna create havoc
in the Iranian economy
the idea is to is to is to create severe
pressure that forces the regime to
negotiate with a country that had now
thoroughly mistrust after their
withdrawal from the jcpoa it's I think
as likely that the result of this policy
will be to create a failed state in Iran
you know a crumbling economy an angry
public a regime struggling to hold on
that becomes a more hardline not not
more not more liberal and you know you
have to ask given all we've been through
the last 15 years is another failed
state in the Middle East really
something that's in in the US national
interest maybe it will turn out the way
Trump wants that they'll vote they'll
feel the pressure feel the squeeze and
I'll say okay you know let's start a
negotiation we'll put on the table
things we haven't been prepared to
before to be honest that would be a that
would be a good outcome
who wouldn't be who didn't be happy to
see that but it's it's it's a course
that has all sorts of risks and it
assumes that I told how many who
just you know hates the idea of
compromise in America is gonna be
prepared to compromise with Donald Trump
because the pressure is so tough yeah
like the Iranian economy my hope is now
crushed but you're right I mean if
you're read on recent history is that
regime change always lead to a good
outcome I think you're reading the wrong
book no not another another collapsing
regime in the Middle East not going to
see that as you recently wrote a great
piece about North Korea and how we might
actually be starting to see a real deal
take shape
it could include North Korea dismantling
some test sites its main nuclear weapons
facility and young beyond all of that
would be conditioned on us the u.s.
taking some sort of reciprocal action
maybe getting us servicemembers out of
South Korea over some time frame I've
been pretty skeptical about the
Singapore summit actually accomplishing
anything and as recently as August John
Bolton was saying that North Korea had
not taken any necessary steps to
denuclearize but are you starting to see
more hopeful signs so in the immediate
aftermath of the Singapore summit there
was absolutely nothing specific and the
North Koreans just kind of played
rope-a-dope and Trump in his enthusiasm
post summit wash kept saying nice things
and I think people rightly said wait a
masters there's nothing here in terms of
substance then the administration began
to get a little tougher and a trip that
the Secretary of State Pompeii was gonna
make to Pyongyang was cancelled I'm sure
that private messages were passed there
were more more more serious and and over
time it appears the North Koreans began
to say okay yes we will allow
international inspectors to come in and
verify that we have just destroyed one
of our missile test sites they hadn't
done that before like inspectors then
they said we would be prepared if there
were reciprocal u.s. gestures to destroy
their major nuclear facility at young
beyond the truth that you mentioned a
moment ago that was also interesting
what reciprocal concessions are they
looking for it appears
is that what they want is a declaration
of the the end of the state of war
between the u.s. and North Korea and
North South Korea etc that is the track
that president moon of South Korea has
been pursuing his own bilateral
diplomacy with Kim jong-un including
this recent summit that they had and my
sense is that the u.s. the key
negotiator is Pompeo the Secretary of
State it has been prepared to go along
with that the precise shape of the way
the u.s. is gonna is gonna phrase this
you know in effect a confidence-building
declaration is it still isn't clear but
I think they're ready to offer something
and that's probably gonna be enough to
move the ball far enough down the road
but when they're when there's another
Trump Kim summit there'll be something
for them to sign well the good news is
that Trump recently told us that he and
Kim Jong that had fallen in love after
Kim oh great
he wrote him beautiful letters I was so
touching I read it's one of those funny
moments where if a Democrat said that
the Republican Party would spontaneously
combust impeach and invoke the 25th
amendment but just goofy but you know
you know in a weird way that you have
the feeling of this president it falls
in love with his own diplomacy in a
sense it's you know it's a narcissistic
love he loves the fact that he's making
this deal with Kendrick on but it was a
it was a bizarre comment totally Trump
in North Korea is he he seems to keep
falling uphill does he does and says
things do you think a lot that's the end
of it and then a couple months later
they're back on track yeah it's hard to
understand um you mentioned in South
Korea's and president and moon earlier I
mean if we're really scoring this thing
I mean how much credit do you think
president moon deserves for the ongoing
efforts to get to a peace process so I
think that in my book
Trump deserves credit for seizing the
opportunities that have arisen I know
I'm for diplomacy on North Korea and I
think following the president for for
agreeing to the Singapore summit on
other other steps is just a mistake but
the people who have been moving the ball
here really are the North and South
Korean leaders Kim and moon Kim at the
end of last year made very clear in some
speeches and government statements that
he felt they had successfully completed
their nuclear program they had tested
weapons and the missiles to deliver them
and they were now gonna pivot towards an
economic program in a sense leverages
their nuclear capability moon' initiated
his own fascinating bilateral diplomacy
centered around the Olympics inviting
the North Korea to be part of this
Winter Olympic event show and and it
ended up working out and I felt in that
period the US was sort of dragged along
with North South Korean diplomacy that
initially it wasn't all that comfortable
with remember when vice president pence
went to the Olympics and he seemed
really uncomfortable but in the end that
was the driver and and when the proposal
for a summit between Kim and Trump was
presented to the president he said yep
well you know the more I look into this
I keep hearing that Trump has been
sending messages pretty much since the
day he got into the Oval Office that he
was ready for a summit meeting with with
Kim that that he you know that all that
bluster talk was it was accompanied by
private messages that he was prepared to
sit down and meet with a North Korean
leader so I think this has been hatching
a long time but again the the the
decisive framers of these issues have
been the North and South Koreans and not
the u.s. US has been a receiver it's
it's it's it's welcome the diplomacy
it's now beginning to frame what the
agreement would actually look like but
it didn't initiate it yeah well let's
hope I hope sincerely that it works out
in the end and I do also give Trump
credit for bucking conventional wisdom
and being willing to take a chance on
diplomacy this is a key pot state of the
world moment in which Tommy Vietor says
something hey good about Donald Trump's
foreign policy you know I do
give you if you ran back the tape eight
years and asked Obama like what he was
she done a couple more times it would
probably be there's all every situation
room meeting has 15 people telling you
why you can't do something and just
telling them to get out of her face and
I'm gonna do it anyway would have been a
probably useful exercise every once in a
while you know I just would add one
thing Tommy from last week I think one
of the more outrageous things that went
all but unnoticed was when Donald Trump
said that if if Barack Obama had its
remaining president there would have
been a nuclear war yeah in the u.s.
North Korea because Obama was on the on
the edge of pulling the trigger I think
he actually said what Obama said to
Trump as we understand it is this is a
really serious problem I've really
struggled with us and you're it's gonna
it's gonna be the most important for a
foreign policy issue ahead for you for
Trump to translate that into the idea
that he saved America from the war that
Barack Obama would have started was
really you know even even by Trump's
tears pretty amazing yeah man you're
right I saw that I was like come on
you're just lying but what can you do um
well the other day another press
conference right that's right
eighty-one minutes last question for you
about the UN Trump gave this speech to
the UN General Assembly that included a
line about how he's accomplished more
than any other administration in history
history of our country and the assembled
diplomats literally laughed and when
asked about it later he said you know
they didn't laugh on me they laughed
with me my question is I mean it was one
of those moments where you just put your
head in your hands but do you think this
reflected any sort of sincere expression
of how countries may have changed their
opinions about the US or the just a
funny
maybe even silly moment with people not
a used to his bluster so as I've talked
to two foreign diplomats in the days
since Trump was at the UN I keep hearing
this the same thing which is that the
world is rear echelons rump is president
and that he has changed some of the
fundamentals of American foreign policy
I mean I think the reason there was that
that awkward laughter of the president's
boast was in a sense people know
how much he's changed but the see it as
a positive accomplishment for the u.s.
that so many of our alliances are now
more ragged than they were that we've
withdrawn for something from so many
global agreements that really most the
rest the world supports I think I think
that just made people laugh like what
are you talking about but I think I
think people probably will is now trying
to figure out okay we never thought this
could happen but it's happened and even
if Trump is defeated even if the midterm
elections go for the Democrats we have
to now reckon with the possibility that
could it could happen again that America
is a different place than what we
thought and that's what I see people
struggling to deal with I thought that
was behind some of the of the tension
that you saw last week in New York yeah
speaking of tension we have a ongoing
trade war and often war of words with
China over the weekend the Chinese
cancelled a high-level security talks
dialogue that included secretary mattis
the Secretary of Defense President Trump
has recently accused them of meddling in
our elections and apparently vice
president Pence is going to outline more
of the case for that argument in a
speech coming soon how bad do you think
tensions are with with China right now
pretty bad I think that the Trump as in
most aspects of his foreign policy wants
to destabilize his adversary the Chinese
and he's he's succeeding I think the
Chinese are really flummoxed there there
there the this trade war trade dispute
no increasing trade war has gone further
than they ever thought it would they
kept thinking that there'd be a kind of
compromise point and they kept putting
more on the table and it hasn't been
enough at the one point that reasonable
people should agree on is that China's
behavior in international trade has been
a problem for the United States and for
all of its trading partners and
every time I go to China your stories
from American and European companies
that are that are operating there that
the executives tell me we are sick of
having our intellectual property stolen
you know basically being in their view
mistreated in this market not given fair
access so the idea that it's time to
have different rules that are a little
fairer is is correct that's not just
Trump saying saying that but I think
almost any Western business person who's
done business in China it's probably
better to try to redress that the terms
of trade the rules for this game now as
opposed to ten years from now when China
will be even more powerful so I think
again reasonable people should say okay
I think the question is how much
crockery I was gonna say China it gets
broken along the way right in in doing
that and what's what's that what's the
damage to the global economy to living
standards in China in the US around the
world in that in that process and I
think that's that's the delicate issue
and you know if Trump plays true to form
he'll do the same thing he did with
Mexico and with Canada which is he'll
he'll take this as far as he thinks he
reasonably can go and then I'll cut a
deal yeah but you know maybe not maybe
maybe the Chinese won't won't give him
that opportunity that's that's the risk
right I mean it's interesting because
again I mean he just recently authorized
another round of tariffs on like 200
billion dollars worth of Chinese goods
and they're reportedly voices the White
House who think that the only way to
really stop China from doing the bad
things you just described is to really
make them feel economic pain but again
interestingly when when this fur trade
war was first suggested we were all
warned by the the same experts that it
would be a cataclysmic event for the US
economy but this dock market is still
through the roof the economy is humming
along I mean that is there a problem of
crying wolf or or you know are we just
sort of on the precipice of something
pretty bad here
well you know it could get much worse
the the I think the first thing I'd say
is that if you wanted to really go after
China and it changed the trading
relationship the stupidest thing you
could have done to start with was to get
rid of the trans-pacific partnership
which was the gathering of all the
nations but China in a trading group
that gave the u.s. strength in dealing
with it with a Chinese issue I think
that as I look back was just such a such
a fundamental mistake
welcome to pod save America I'm John

so let's get those positive American
people to do it well that you know you
just raise the bar we're not gonna have
any dragon action no one took that
seriously that a single human being we
tried to get dragons and they
they said now okay let's get to the news
on Tuesday evening as the FBI was in the
middle of investigating allegations that
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh
sexually assaulted multiple women Donald
Trump held a political rally where he
openly mocked dr. Christine Blasi Ford
and lied about the testimony she
delivered to the Senate Trump also said
this week that it's a quote scary time
for young men in America where you can
be guilty of something you may not be
guilty of this is a very very difficult
time what's happening here has much more
to do than even the appointment of a
Supreme Court justice okay before we get
into all of this first let's just play
the clip of Trump from the rally last
night cuz you really got to hear it to
believe it 36 years ago this happened I
had one beer right I had one beer well
you think I was rooting up there was one
beer oh good
how did you get home I don't remember
how'd you get there don't remember where
is the place I don't remember how many
years ago was it I don't know
I don't know I don't know what
neighborhood was it and I don't know
where's the house I don't know upstairs
downstairs where was I don't know but I
had one beer that's the only thing I
remember and a man's life is in tatters
a man's life is shattered his wife has
shattered his daughters who are
beautiful incredible young kids they
destroy people they want to destroy
people these are really evil people dan
a few weeks ago the White House got a
bunch of stories placed about how Trump
was handling these allegations with
remarkable restraint what do you think
changed his mind and what was your
reaction in general to that awful clip
every part of that was awful so my
non-serious reaction is that was the
worst one-act play in American history
we're trying to get the hosts the words
one band play in American district
second this is yet another reminder that
Trump is a troglodyte with the empathy
of a surgical sponge I mean he is just a
horrible human being and to the point
how we've been doing this for four years
basically since Trump started running
for president god help us and every time
someone goes out and praises Trump's
restraint they end up with egg on their
face this was bound to happen it was
just a matter of time and he managed to
do it at in the really even for him an
absolutely disgusting way to do it like
my you know as I sort of watched the
reaction to this today and some of the
news reports I sort of had flashbacks to
2016 because usually the pattern was
Trump would say something horribly
offensive and then the most most of the
reaction would be about how offensive it
was now this of course was one of the
more offensive things he's ever said but
it was also a lie and a lot of people
have just skipped over the fact that
he's he's just lying up there too and
you know I saw
see Graham I saw some other Republicans
say well the president Sarah Huckabee
Sanders well the president was just
stating the facts well no he wasn't he
claimed that she didn't know how many
years ago it was didn't know what
neighborhood it was didn't know whether
it happened upstairs or downstairs and
he said the only thing she remembers is
having a beer none of that is true none
of that is true
she remembered all of those things the
only thing she said she didn't remember
is how she got to and from the party in
the exact address everything else she
said she remembered and when she was
asked to what degree of certainty do you
believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the one
who attempted to sexually assault you
she said 100% 100%
I also by the way thought it was
ridiculous that what just a few weeks
ago where Trump said oh I found her not
last week I guess Trump said oh I found
her very credible so I guess I guess he
doesn't find her credible anymore I
guess that just got thrown out the
window it was just it was gross man it's
gross he I mean he's a terrible human
being I mean we know that and we gloss
over it
and it's also yes like Lindsey Graham
and others today try to if they didn't
really try to find it most have said
that he shouldn't have said it but just
the we've just come to accept as a
political culture a such a lovable level
of terribleness and the president days
that he was attacking a a victim of
sexual assault that he found credible
seven days ago and today he stands up in
front of a crowd an angry partisan crowd
frothing at the mouth and attack sir in
just the most violent way possible and
when we talk about you know one day
Trump won't be President
hopefully we're all still living we
haven't died in some sort of nuclear
attack and maybe Kevin all the other
quarter maybe you won't but the the
damage that is being done to the sort of
the moral fabric of this country from
the fact that people see this in a good
portion of the country find it
acceptable because Trump is doing it
that damage is going to be really hard
to do
I mean this is a woman who has been
getting death threats her family's been
getting death threats she had to move
out of her home her she's been doxed her
email was hacked I mean this is someone
who's had to go through quite a bit over
the last couple weeks in addition to
sitting in front of the Senate and
recounting to the world the worst
experience of her life and the president
ID States is leading a crowd full of
people who were just laughing laughing
about this it is it is pretty gross we
should talk about the response from the
Senate swing vote Susan Collins said the
president's remarks were quote just
plain wrong Jeff Flake sat on The Today
Show that they were quote kind of
appalling and that there's no time in
place for remarks like this Lisa
Murkowski said Trump's comments were
quote inappropriate and unacceptable dan
do you think this will affect their
votes or is it just in their minds a
very unhelpful thing that they have to
sort of deal with I think it's not
helpful I think they think is about
helpful thing yeah they have to deal
with now I'm not even sure it should
affect their votes yeah it's unpopular
take I mean I look I want them all to
vote no no one doesn't know for a
multitude of reasons but yeah it doesn't
seem like trumps comments at a Preta at
a rally is the thing that should put
them over the edge they should either
yeah it should already be there does we
mentioned at the top Trump's comments on
Tuesday night weren't some random
outburst this is from Bloomberg News on
Wednesday quote Trump's attack on Ford
was deliberate White House officials
said they believe they can harness the
controversy to energize the president's
core supporters who regard the
allegations against Cavanaugh is a
democratic plot and part of a broader
cultural war against white males in
effect the inverse of the me2 movement
to hold powerful men accountable for
sexual abuses Dan what do you think
about this there's definitely a bit of a
split trend in recent polling on one
hand a number of polls that have come
out since the testimony last week showed
overall support for cab
is plummeting it has declined among
Democrats it has declined among
independents but on the other hand
Republican support for Cavanaugh is
rising I just saw a poll today that
Republican support for Cavanaugh is now
greater than Republican support for Neal
Gorsuch was so apparently if you are
accused of sexual assault and you even
if you believe a person is falsely
accused of sexual assault I don't quite
understand why that would make you more
supportive of that nominee than the
nominee that was already confirmed who
was not accused of sexual assault but so
be it
and the other thing we're seeing in
polling is the percentage of Republicans
who say they're excited to vote in the
midterms is rising and we've seen a few
polls where the overall generic ballot
is tightening though that could be some
noise because you know polls are polls
so what do you think about all this so I
think there's a couple of things we
ought to separate so first is I've been
waiting for this moment since the launch
of the v-2 both met last year and I'm
surprised it's taken this long for
Republicans to be this overt about it
because it really is a natural extension
of modern republicanism which is they
believe politics is a zero-sum equation
and if society identifies a group of
people who have been treated unjustly
helping them in the Republican mindset
means that there must be some group
who's victimized and Republicans look at
that and have looked at that as
political opportunity so you look you
know the best example is when the
passage of the Voting Rights Act and
civil rights act where Republicans took
they saw an opportunity in the passage
of civil rights legislation to go get
Southern Southern whites datoria their
party and build until the majority and
you know we've seen this with
immigration using sort of a growing you
know elite consensus around immigration
to gin up white people and this is it
made its backlash politics pure and
simple it is what Republicans do and the
question is is this a good short-term
strategy is it a good medium term long
gamora tragedy so I look at media short
term is 18 medium term is 20 and long
term is the is a longer arc of the next
generation to a politics I think there
is some evidence that it is a good short
term strategy I think there is it is a
no idea whether it's gonna be the term
strategy and it is definitely a bad long
term strategy because if you were
staking your ground on white men you
have decided that you are going to put
all of your horses in depend and defend
the smallest most rapidly eroding hill
in American politics yeah and it is
white men it's also there's a big
education split here too it may be even
bigger than gender they you know in the
Quinnipiac poll the college versus non
college number was pretty intense 60% of
college educated white women oppose
Cavanaugh a majority of non-college
educated white women support him and of
course the numbers on men are even
sharper with the non-college numbers way
way up but it is I mean is it's it's
similar to what we the sort of the same
divides that we saw in the 2016 election
as well it's the same sort of divides
you see on issues like immigration on
issues like terrorism that the the only
demographic groups that vote heavily
Republican now like you said our men and
non-college educated white men and women
and those are their groups and so you're
right they're staking and the funny
thing is they're not the Republican plan
the Republican strategy is to not
propose policies that might help those
demographic groups they've long stopped
doing that they don't have an economic
plan for non-college educated white men
who are struggling or white women who
are struggling they don't have any of
that all they have is immigrants are
gonna come take your jobs and immigrants
are gonna commit crime and terrorists
are gonna commit a crime that don't look
like you because they're immigrants too
or they're you know they're people for
foreign sorry let me try that again and
you know and terrorists are gonna come
and attack you and I and so only
Republicans can keep you safe and now
you're gonna be falsely accused of
sexual assault that's the other thing
that's the new thing you have to worry
about so everything they do is around
this there is a there's a threat there
is an existential threat to white men
and especially non-college educated
white men and women from liberals
Democrats immigrants feminists this is
it this it's just it's a culture war and
they're the ones starting the culture
war and it's in to mean this has also
been the the flames of this have been
fanned like this just doesn't happen out
of the blue during this cavanaugh
navigation you have no nomination this
happened because like all these
right-wing radio hosts and everyone on
Fox decided to end Trump decided to go
all in and tell people that you know our
entire society now is beset by false
accusations of sexual assault which
again is not true that it's really
dangerous it is a dangerous moment in
the country where you can because we
have become such a partisan polarized
country and particularly on the right
where the idea really is here that what
America is changing faster than you
wanted to change and all these liberals
and the leaks and immigrants and black
presidents of the middle name Hussein
and women presidents are all trying to
try to ruin what America used to be and
if a bunch of a bunch of captains of the
football team
like Brett like Brett Bart Cavanaugh and
we and Mark judge can't get together and
have a few beers and not be risk calling
being accused of sexual assault then
what is America right and it's just it
it is it isn't a stout it is it is
victim it is victimization wrapped in
the soundtrack and that is sort of the
core of trumpism right and well that and
that's why they and in Trump said this
in his own remarks he said oh it's
bigger than the Supreme Court their
strategy is to make this about more than
bread Cavanaugh they don't want to focus
on just bread Cavanaugh's this case they
want to say this is an attack on all
white men right
and Democrats what we're all saying is
like no no we are just trying to find
the truth in this one case that's before
us right now and even though we may
never know exactly what happened and
even though we may not have evidence to
charge back Brett Kavanaugh with the
crime what we're saying is this is a job
interview for the highest court on the
land and should this person have a
lifetime appointment and have incredible
power over the interpretation of the
laws in this country over millions of
people's lives does this person have the
character and temperament to do that and
all we're saying is you should weigh the
evidence in favor of voting for more
opposing him and then make a decision
like we're trying to make this narrow
they're trying to make this a gigantic
culture war and that should tell you
something about what their true goals
are here if they don't care about it
they don't care about Brett Kavanaugh
himself
they're like brick having us like a
 Bush administration person who
you know Donald Trump was afraid of that
at the beginning when he picked him and
now know he loves him because he's this
like martyr stand in for like everything
that's gone wrong with white got white
guys apparently there is nothing that
will get you faster into Donald Trump's
good graces there'd be incredibly
accused of sexual assault
who says Ron Porter whatever oh he's
icky he seems like he might have abused
some women Ron can't lose Ron for trying
to give another job the administration
Brett Kavanaugh random Federalist
Society robot who will vote the way we
want Oh Brett Kavanaugh accuse credibly
accused of sexual assault that our fight
for Brett Kavanaugh gets her feet like
it's everything to trump as a mirror and
so he sees in himself this if he can win
this for Brett Kavanaugh it will somehow
prove his innocence
yeah and even within the Republican
Party this isn't as clear cut as as it
is within the Democratic Party there's a
poll out on Wednesday that had an
interesting question that made it not
about Brett Kavanaugh specifically the
question was if a political candidate
has been accused of sexual assault by
multiple
people would you still consider voting
for them if you agreed with them on the
issues or would you definitely not vote
for them 56% of Republicans said they
would consider voting for a candidate
who've been accused by multiple people
only 34 percent said they were not by
contrast 81% of Democrats said they
would not vote for such a candidate and
only 16% said that they'd consider it so
like so much else in our politics
this is asymmetric between the two
parties it is not that you know Moe all
Democrats are you know would vote
against such a person all probably as
well for it is most you know all
Democrats are mostly on the same page
most Democrats are on the same page and
even within the Republican Party their
display partly because those numbers
among Republican women are not that high
more Republican women would think about
what think twice about voting for a
candidate who's been accused of sexual
assault so really it's it's a Republican
men that are that are holding it up here
that whole you know why because I have
news for all of those Republicans who
told the pollster they would not vote
for a candidate they did president 810
of you voted for him he is on tape
bragging about sexual assault what are
you people talking about that is a good
point that is a good well I mean the
other thing that I've been thinking
about this last week is how just like
everything else this whole episode like
everything goes down the memory hole and
we all forget about it five to five days
later like I'm trying to think back to
the moment where dr. Christine Blasi
ready mmm sure am alright welcome to pod
save America I'm Jon Favreau I'm John
Lovett I'm Tommy Vitor today in the pod
you'll hear our interview with Anna
Maria archila one of the women who
confronted Jeff Flake on Friday in
Washington right before he called for a
one-week FBI investigation into
allegations against Brett Kavanaugh
we'll also be talking about the
investigation itself and what the debate
over Cavanaugh's nomination is going to
mean for the elections
did you know vember discuss with her at
all the fact that she's the first person
ever to hold an elevator door and have a
conversation in a way that wasn't
horrible no that's too bad did you call
her back but I didn't need to because
you made the joke anyway so there was a
space for the joke
no first we're gonna talk about love

okay let's get to the news the Senate's
final floor vote on Brit Cavanaugh's
nomination to the Supreme Court has been
delayed a week to allow for an
investigate investment
has been delayed a week to allow for an
FBI investigation into credible
allegations that Cavanaugh sexually
assaulted women in the past initially
the White House gave the FBI a list of
just four people to question who they've
reportedly already conducted interviews
with Martha Rowe
yeah mark judge PJ Smith high school
friends of Cavanaugh's that dr.
Christine Boise Ford said were at the
gathering where she was assaulted
Leland Kizer a high school friend of
Ford's who she also placed at the
gathering and Deborah Ramirez a woman
who's accused Kavanaugh of assaulting
her in college on Monday the White House
said the FBI has been authorized to
interview whoever they see fit so long
as they complete the investigation by
Friday when Mitch McConnell has promised
a final vote on Kavanagh guys why would
the White House initially limit the
scope of the investigation if they're so
confident in Cavanaugh's innocence hmm
what was going on there and thought
about it that way hmm it's almost as if
they're less interested in finding out
what happened and more being able to
show something to Jeff Flake that Jeff
Flake can call something so that they
can get his vote this week for Capitol I
would like to note that it says a lot
about the state of our politics in 2018
that Jeff Flake asking the FBI to do the
absolute bare minimum to get to the
bottom of a very very credible by the
White House's own admission allegation
of sexual assault about a future Supreme
Court nominee is treated as a heroic act
that doesn't seem heroic in any way to
me that seems like the obvious thing you
would do the bare minimum the bare
minute well also the whole thing gets a
60 Minutes interview now once once they
all were forced to go along with Jeff
Lakes plan for a one-week delay the
previous day's events look all the more
ridiculous
yes making this about the performance of
two people on television to determine
whether or not somebody belongs on the
Supreme Court denying that the idea of
suggesting that the idea of a delay is
somehow giving in to a democratic dirty
trick all of it Lindsey Graham losing
his
then by the time the next day and they
lost a flake they were just for it and
the fact that they turned out to have
been for it tells you that all of that
should have happened before the hearing
right and it also
argues against the Republican theory of
the case here which is that this entire
thing is a Democratic smear job because
they're just want to hold the seat open
long enough to make sure we get past the
midterm elections and then take it
because Chris Coons who Democrat from
Delaware who worked with flake to call
for this extra week was basically like
all we want is a week or you know or we
we're not gonna do we're not trying to
do what you say we're trying to do we
just want an investigation and then we
will give you your vote to thoughts on
that one dr. Blasi Ford raised these
disconcerting allegations before not
Kevin I was nominated the Supreme Court
so we know this wasn't some democratic
dirty trick or two Axios floated a
recommendation by the White House today
to hold open the seat till 2020 if
Cavanaugh doesn't get confirmed because
they like the politics that we're gonna
talk about again they are just massive
massive hypocrites so that's the FBI
investigation like it was confusing
reading these reports over the weekends
it felt like the FBI didn't have clear
guidance and that they were letting the
press know that to send a message to the
White House and then Trump would then
tweet I want this to be you know as
credible an investigation as we can get
I thought actually Kellyanne Conway's
interview with with Jake Tapper on CNN
was like pretty reasonable if if they
can only interview these four
individuals that you named earlier like
that is a whitewashing if they can't
follow up on dr. Ford's claim that she
ran into Marc judge at a Safeway and she
can't figure out records from Safeway
about whether he worked there at the
time to corroborate it that's ridiculous
um but it does sound like it's pushing
in a direction where they're gonna do
more and more they did a guy's gonna let
the investigation take it where it takes
them but they're not gonna like open up
if they found some banking crime in his
past they wouldn't then dig into them
right and of course someone was lying
here because NB saber NBC reported that
the White House was limiting the scope
rush of White House deputy press
secretary responded by being no
absolutely not we're just letting the
Senate do what they do and then as you
know to tell me like Kelly and Conway
and others over the weekend we're
basically no no no we don't want to
limit the investigation at all we know
that it was at least limited initially
because over the basically on Sunday
there's a story from in The New Yorker
from Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow
detailing all the different ways that
potential witnesses tried to reach out
to the FBI and basically couldn't get
through
Elizabeth razor high school friend of
mark judge reached out to the FBI but
got no response a classmate of Deborah
ramirez's who said he was a hundred
percent certain that he heard the story
about Cavanaugh assaulting her a few
days after it happened tried to reach
out he had to end up calling the tip
line as you said there were reports the
FBI couldn't even contact the safe way
that Mark judge worked at to and verify
that he was employed at the time that
dr. Ford said she contacted him so they
were quite they did try to limit the
investigation well first of all they
have limited the investigation
investigation is limited its limited
time limited and and like we should all
just this is ridiculous compromise this
is a lifetime appointment somebody that
could be there for 40 years they've
already decided that they can only he
can only be disqualified if he can find
it in six days like it's a game show
right like it's supermarket sweep for
crimes but the but even even by that
standard I think the truth is we just
don't know every person every person
refuting the idea that they have tried
to limit the scope is a world-famous
liar so I think it seems like it's
probably somewhere in the middle whether
they tried to limit it and then had to
walk it back or left some limits in
place that give them the ability to
claim there aren't limits I just don't
think we know what do we think they
finally relented
I mean clearly Jeff Flake had them in a
position where they had no choice yeah
Jeff flake flake not only changed his
mind
and won against his previous public
statement that he was gonna vote for
Cavanaugh but he called Colin's
Murkowski and he worked a bunch of
Democrats so they wouldn't have had the
votes on the floor if if McConnell had
tried to call it on Friday like they had
planned so they had to do this they'd no
other choice and what have we learned so
far since the investigation was expanded
and sort of held for another week here
about Bret Cavanaugh I mean we've
learned over the week I don't know that
we learned this but there's more and
more evidence corroborating the claims
that Brett Kavanaugh was a sloppy drunk
a frequent drunk maybe a violent or
belligerent drunk today we learned that
he was questioned by police after a bar
fight in 1985
i barf I'd that his classmates said he
started because Cavanaugh mistook some
random guy at a bar for the lead singer
of ub40 which is for you kids out there
a British reggae band probably don't
like and then threw a beer at the guy so
one who the is in a fight after
ub40 concert it's like reggae is not
really fighting music - we know that
Brett Kavanaugh was like drunk a lot and
kind of a kind of a belligerent guy and
also trumpet his press conference today
talked about Cavanaugh's drinking in
high school as if he had an alcohol
problem it was really pretty remarkably
different in tone so again we this
confirms what we knew at the time which
was a Kavanagh did everything he could
to cover up high to lie about his
drinking before the committee so the new
argument from conservatives is that you
know Democrats are moving the goal posts
by urging the FBI to investigate
Cavanaugh's drinking and lying what do
we think of that why is the drinking why
is why is him being having a drinking
problem relevant to the case it does in
college well it's it's certainly
relevant because it's part of the fact
pattern of the of at least two claims of
sexual assault but but separate even
from that you know there's this strain
of argument now among conservatives
which is can you listen yourselves
you're talking about throwing ice at a
bar T talk about how much a kid drank in
high school we don't care about that we
don't care about that at all it is the
fact that Brett Kavanaugh lied under
oath repeatedly as a means of diffusing
and refuting claims that he drunkenly
assaulted women on multiple occasions
and as part of his refuting of those
stories he made pretty incredible claims
about his behavior that he never blacked
out or had to piece together memories
that devil's triangle was a drinking
game that he couldn't drink during the
week because he had work the next day
you know those high school kids that
can't have a beer or two because they
have work in the morning even though on
his calendar on July 1st which is the
date that the FBI should look into it's
a Thursday night and he said you know
having skis with the boys at Timmy's or
whoever with PJ and squee and Mark judge
and the rest of the crew so he
he lied about that in his own calendar
refuted the refuted his ally you have
you have a bunch of what are ultimately
trivial lies lies about what he did when
he was drunk lies about what he did when
he was in high school lies about who he
hung out with but they all add up they
all they are part of what is to me seems
like a bigger lie which is the kind of
person he is yes the kind of person
who's respectful of women the kind of
person who wouldn't do that
so it's this mix of these trivial and
big lies which is why his his behavior
in college and high school matter so
much if you're gonna look me in the eye
and tell me that Beach we've Beach week
Ralph's Club means you threw up from a
spicy food I don't think you deserve to
be a judge in small claims court like we
all know those people that lie about
little things to our face and everyone
hates them because they're not
trustworthy they're not honest with you
they're not real and this guy's gonna
define do you know like set the course
legally for the country for four decades
well and this is why this is important
because you no longer have to ask
yourself what Brett Kavanaugh was like
or did thirty five years ago you just
have to ask yourself what Brett Kavanagh
has been like through this confirmation
process and the answer to that question
is a very openly partisan liar yes yeah
yes and there's this trick also that's
being played which is you start from
this question was Brett Kavanaugh honest
there's only one answer that question if
you're being intellectually serious no
he was not honest but then you take a
step away from that and you go did Brett
Kavanaugh commit perjury well that's a
little trickier I'm not a lawyer what's
technically perjury does it meet the
threshold of perjury but that's not even
enough then you take another step which
is do you have evidence to prove that
Brett Kavanaugh committed perjury now of
a sudden we're trying to produce
evidence to refute lies that he gave on
the stand the standard versa Preem court
justice shouldn't be did they lie so
thoroughly and repeatedly and leave
enough of a paper trail that we can
dispositively prove that he committed
perjury it's not supposed to be closed
he's supposed to be a judge this goes
back to the Republicans framing of this
they wanted to appear like a trial and
so they want you know the standard to be
beyond a reasonable doubt for both
sexual assault and perjury right and
Democrats in most of the country because
we have done this throughout history
when we've nominated people to Supreme
Court and had hearings it's a job
interview
it is a job interview for a lifetime
appointment to the most powerful court
in the land that's what this is yeah and
also I would say that Brett Kavanaugh
has some pretty strong opinions about
perjury and whether or not it's a
serious crime and if somebody should be
say removed or impeached over it he says
yes and he doesn't even care if the
perjury is over a private sexual matter
he's very much in favor of impeaching
people for their for lying about private
sexual matters and I would say that the
evidence that Bill Clinton committed
perjury is not a hell a lot stronger
than the evidence that Brett Kavanaugh
repeatedly committed perjury in various
confirmation hearings since he's been
nominated to be a lower court judge and
I was supreme court judge I do think
that the other argument against
Cavanaugh's nomination confirmation that
has sort of emerged since his testimony
on Thursday is not just that he has
proven himself to be dishonest over and
over again big things and little things
but the fact that he sort of revealed
himself to be this naked partisan yeah
extreme partisan so the Portland Press
Herald which is the biggest newspaper in
Maine Susan Collins hope you're paying
attention this is a quote from their
editorial over the weekend quote we have
never had a Supreme Court nominee who
ripped off the nonpartisan mask the way
Cavanaugh did Thursday and identified
himself as an enemy of a political party
that represents the policy preferences
of millions of Americans and you think
back to that Testament his opening
remarks which he wrote which he had time
to look over which is not something that
he just said on the spur of the moment
and he looked and he's talked about you
know floated a conspiracy theory about
people are attacking him because this is
revenge on behalf of the Clintons and
then he said you know what what goes
around comes around issues a threat like
that that what goes around comes around
like if I end up on this Court you're
all gonna be sorry I mean it was
crazy
the revenge on me have a look that what
goes around comes around like this is
clearly a very angry man
the revenge on behalf of the Clintons
that is silly nonsense
because nobody's doing this for the like
they may be angry that Donald Trump is
president a lot of those Democrats are
angry Donald Trump is president and they
don't want you on the Supreme Court they
don't like your policies they don't like
your your position as a judge that's all
true but nobody's doing this to get for
Hillary sake nobody's doing this real
clinseq nobody gives a that's not
about this you're like on the list of
reasons I oppose Brett Kavanaugh like
his role in the in the Ken Starr look I
do have some sympathy for the broader
point that the confirmation process can
be so bruising and awful for people in
all kinds of positions that why would
you ever take an administration job
remember our friend Tom cotton
Republican from Arkansas held an Obama
nominee until she died right died to
help you know to stick it to President
Obama but I mean that's not a new
phenomenon and I and I go back to
Lindsey Graham's red-faced screaming
tirade that didn't once mention the
feelings needs obligations to a woman
who sat before him just hours earlier
talking about a very credible accusation
of sexual assault he he did not care
about getting to the bottom of those
allegations he only cared about what it
meant for his rich powerful friend Brett
Kavanaugh and that's why like I'm
getting very frustrated with a lot of
the reporting on the broader process
over the weekend that's like Washington
once again is it's at a new low like
both sides are doing it I mean on the
one hand regardless of how do you think
Dianne Feinstein handled the knowledge
of dr. Ford's accusations at the end of
the day Democrats are trying to get to
the bottom of a highly credible sexual
assault allegation about a possible
Supreme Court justice and Republicans
are doing nothing to sincerely
investigate those claims and in fact
they brought someone in they outsource
their role to attack the victim so spare
me this both sides this is what
the Senate is supposed to do this this
is their job to look into these well
with me on the pod is Natasha Bertrand
she's a staff writer at the Atlantic
covering national security and politics
and a contributor to NBC News and MSNBC
in a big time friend of the pod thank
you for doing it how you doing thanks
for having me Tommy I'm good um I feel
like been a while since we talked
there's been like 400 indictments a a
lot of churn a lot of turnover but you
know it's good to hear your voice again
so I wanted to start with my friend rod
Rosen Stein the Deputy Attorney General
has been a help a few days for him
because first he was reported that he
talked about invoking the 25th amendment
to remove President Trump from office
and even discuss wearing a wire to
record their conversation to build his
case which is really weird and then on
Monday according this on Tuesday there
were reports that he was gonna resign he
was sort of forced to run over to the
White House grovel and then I guess
there's a stay of execution until
Thursday so maybe we could start with
the first piece of this which is the New
York Times story about the 25th
amendment and the idea that he was
looking to record Trump's comments what
do you make of that report and maybe the
motives behind however it got out yeah I
think that you're asking a question that
not enough people have asked which is
what would have been Rosen Stein
reasoning for wanting to record the
president we've heard of course that he
was perhaps being sarcastic but I would
not be entirely surprised if he was
being serious because of course this was
a really sensitive moment a really
chaotic moment in the Trump
administration he had just fired Comey
he had just met with the Russians in the
Oval Office and disclosed classified
information that the Israelis had given
us so there was a whole lot of there
were a whole lot of things happening at
the time that made it seem like Trump
really was not fit to hold the office
and so you have to look at this
suggestion that Rosen Stein made through
that lens
he this wasn't just the aftermath of the
Comey firing this was also when Trump
was interviewing people to be the FBI
director and according to the report
that we saw Rosen Stein actually wanted
to wear this wire while he
and on Trump's interviews with a
prospective FBI director he wanted
people who were perhaps interviewing for
the job to wear these wires and that
suggests to me that Rosen Stein was
worried that perhaps Trump was going to
ask for some kind of loyalty oath from
from the FBI directors that he was
interviewing I really can't see any
other reason why he specifically would
want two people to be recording Trump
while he questioned the the person that
was possibly going to be leading the
investigation into his campaign team it
just seems to me like he had known that
Trump had made these requests to Comey
that he had fired him with corrupt
intent and now he wanted to prove to the
world perhaps whether or not these were
going to be recordings we're going to be
released publicly of course we'll never
know and nothing ever came of it but I
think that he wanted to prove and be
vindicated by the idea that no Trump did
not fire Comey because he was angry over
how he handled the Hillary Clinton email
debacle he was he fired Comey because of
the Russian investigation see this is
why I like talking to you because you
remind me of the substance and don't let
me jump to the politics of it first
because it was like you're right like
you should put your mind in his head and
think what why would you want to do this
I mean we know from Omarosa the DC is a
one-party consent town so you can record
someone and it's not illegal but if you
recorded let's say an FBI directors
conversation with the President and
you're at DOJ are there legal issues
there because there has to be you know
it's a really good question I I don't
know the answer to that I would say the
people that I've spoken to have said
that Rosen people who know Rosen Stein
have worked with him have said that he
would never actually do this then again
it was a really chaotic moment and it
was unprecedented and so you know there
was a feeling that anything could go at
that at that time but as far as whether
or not they would be ethical for him to
do this that is another question
entirely now he could perhaps argue that
he was saving the Republic and that
anything was warranted but legally I I
don't know whether that would be a gray
area yeah so you wrote a great piece
about what rod Roden Stein's departure
would mean for the Muller investigation
can you walk us through the int
locations of him resigning or Trump
firing Rosenstein yeah so as of right
now if if he does meet with Trump on
Thursday and Trump kind of rails on him
and ultimately decides that he's out
then no al Francisco the the current
number four at the Justice Department
that we currently have a number three is
the acting so it would kind of fall to
him he would take over the Russia
investigation and that is concerning to
some people because he has expressed
skepticism of special counsels in the
past he has a pretty expansive view on
executive privilege which could allow
Trump to shield certain evidence or
communications from prosecutors he has
remained relatively mouton you know
throughout the last year and a half on
the Moller investigation has said
virtually nothing about it so it's
really hard to tell whether his his
views that he's you know iterated in the
past would extend to his new new
position but that is that is definitely
a concern that I've heard among among
you know legal experts now the other
question though is whether or not he
would have a conflict of interest
because his firm Jones day was of course
lawyer for the Trump transition Trump
campaign so he would potentially have to
either get a waiver from the White House
to serve as the overseer of the Russian
investigation or he might just pass it
off as kind of a hot potato because he
doesn't necessarily want this job it's a
very stressful job but you're subjected
to attacks repeatedly by the president
so that is still up in the air but what
we know is that the White House and the
Justice Department have agreed that for
now as soon as Rosen sign has gone then
no al Francisco would immediately if not
forever take on that role but that does
not you know guarantee whether or not
Rosen Stein is replaced that does not
guarantee that the Moller investigation
is going to be shut down like I said
it's really hard to predict what
Francisco or any other replacements
actions would be with regard to the
Moller investigation and having someone
highly sympathetic perhaps to to trump
in that position is not is not a
guarantee so I think that when the
news broke that Rosen Stein was perhaps
leaving everyone needed to kind of take
a deep breath because it did not
necessarily mean the end of the Moller
investigation taking a more pessimistic
view I think you could say that you know
anyone who does replace Rosen Stein who
has been a very staunch defender of
Moeller and who has really taken on kind
of a hands-off approach to the entire
investigation and let Muller's do his
thing
anyone who replaces him could
potentially be a little more hands-on
and could try to stymie the
investigation in a way in subtle ways
that Rosen Stein maybe didn't so it's
really it's it's unclear at this moment
just stepping back a little bit I mean
we know of rod Rosen sign as the the
person overseeing the Moller
investigation who named the Special
Counsel but the Deputy Attorney General
is a is a big job you run the day-to-day
operations of the Department of Justice
um you get a sense of how disruptive his
firing would be to the work they're
doing to the department to law
enforcement the FISA efforts I guess the
FBI as well yeah it would be a major
upheaval and people at the Justice
Department are really they don't want
this they want him to stay in his job
he's a very steadying hand and of course
the White House would have to go through
the motions if Noel Francisco did not
accept this position they would have to
find a new person to oversee the Russian
investigation it's also not clear
whether they're going to divide up the
acting Attorney General they're gonna
make an attorney general versus a deputy
attorney general versus acting deputy
attorney general which would go to Jeff
Sessions chief of staff currently said
they would make it even more complicated
so it's it's it's very very strange and
we don't know what's gonna happen it's
unprecedented but there is definitely a
sense that no one in the Justice
Department wants this they drafted an
exit statement as we saw yesterday it
was reported that you know conveyed the
department's feelings about Rosen
sandwiches that he's you know he's very
respected he's a career official he'll
be missed etc but I think that even if
we see Rosen Stein leave Congress is
going to really tighten the noose on him
and on the Justice Department I think
mark Meadows already said that even if
Rosen
is out he still needs to testify before
Congress about the report that he wanted
to wire the president and you know
invoke the 25th amendment and of course
after the New York Times story broke we
already saw kind of Republicans leaping
on the idea of subpoenaing the the memos
that you know he allegedly disclosed all
of this all of these things that Rosen
Stein said during those meetings so so
Republicans I think are kind of
salivating either way I don't think it's
gonna affect them one way or the other
in terms of going after the Russia
investigation but as far as as far as
Rosen Stein leaving it's not something
that anyone is greatly eager for
speaking of memos on September 17th
President Trump
ordered law enforcement intelligence
officials to declassify documents
related to the Russia investigations
including text messages from some of the
officials some summaries of interviews
that were conducted and documents
related to the surveillance of Carter
page then a few days later Trump
reversed himself and said no we actually
won't declassify and release those
documents let's have a DOJ review them
instead do you understand what happened
in those intervening days that led to
that walk back no and that's a really
good question I think that what based on
my conversations with people involved in
this entire process what seems to have
happened is that Trump was told that
releasing all of this material would not
necessarily be good for him this is
obviously sensitive material related to
the Russia investigation and Republicans
have tried Republicans who are attacking
the Russian investigation have tried to
make it seem like all of these text
messages in the Carter page documents
etc are really really incriminating for
the Justice Department and for
prosecutors and for the FBI that's been
investigating all this since 2016 but
taking a closer look and again based on
my conversations with the people
involved in this process you don't the
Republicans don't want to die on the
Carter page he'll write I mean Carter
page there's a mountain of evidence to
suggest that Carter page has had ties to
Russian intelligence since at least 2013
well before any of this came out into
the open well before you know obviously
Trump was running for president so this
is the
releasing more information about the
surveillance activity on Carter page and
the justification that the FBI used when
applying for a warrant
to surveil him would reveal more
information about his ties to Russia and
raise more questions about why the
president chose him to be on his
campaign yeah we also know that Carter
page lied or or at least changed his
stories a number of times about trips to
Russia meetings with Russian officials
Amman I guess I'm I'm confused about why
people like Devon unions and other
allies of Trump on the hill I've been
pushing so hard for these documents are
they just desperate for anything they
can use to show allegations of bias are
true yeah so what I've been told is that
they think that the Carter page FISA
warned in particular is a way to prove
that the Steele dossier was used as kind
of was used in FBI investigative
materials and that in turn they say can
discredit the entire origin of the
Russia investigation so if they can
prove for example that the FBI used the
Steele dossier to justify aspects of its
surveillance on Carter page then perhaps
that will allow them to prove that the
FBI relied on the Steele dossier to
launch the entire investigation now of
course we know that that's not true the
investigation was launched because of
George papadopolis his big mouth at a
bar in London when he was told about
these stolen emails that the Russians
had but it's still kind of the Hail Mary
which is that they saw that snippets of
information from the dossier made its
way into the FISA warrant and it did
with the caveat of course that they
added that chrissteele is a reliable
source and has been for the FBI for a
number of years but you know all that
aside this is a way they feel that they
can discredit the entire investigation
from it's very beginning yeah let's talk
Russia um there have been two very
expansive pieces in the last week or two
about how Russia tried to subvert our
elections one was in the New York Times
they did you know it's 12 pages of rep
report on it there's another in The New
Yorker is there anything that you found
particularly interesting or notable
about what we're still learning about
the different ways of Russia is using
cyber tools to influence our
elections yeah so that piece and the New
Yorker was I think the piece that
everyone has been waiting for it it
proved how people saying that Russia did
not change votes in the election and
that Russia really had no influence on
anyone in the election you know some
people said well Russia didn't hold a
gun to my head when I was in the voting
booth is
he's completely nonsense Trump won the
electoral college by something like
eighty thousand votes across three
states and if only a small percentage of
the people that voted for him were
influenced in some way by Russian
propaganda on social media then that
made a dramatic impact on the outcome of
the election and so I think that diving
into the impact that Russia Russian
propaganda and influence operations on
Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and
Google and you know you tend you know
everything else Instagram I think is a
way to answer this question when you
know Republicans or Trump allies ask it
of well how do you know that Russia
influence the election there's no
there's no way to prove that Russia
influenced the election sure they
interfered but but how do you know they
the influence did well just look at the
small small number of votes the Trump
want but Trump won by and just take a
glance at the things that people in your
Facebook feed are sharing I mean the
these are articles and you know posts
that were shared hundreds of thousands
if not millions of times and the idea
that not one of them influenced a single
person is just completely preposterous
so that New York article is definitely
one that everyone should read yeah um
and it's still happening right I mean
there's a bunch of campaigns this year
that have already been targets of
hacking campaigns including a Democrat
who unsuccessfully ran for the
nomination to challenge Dana Rohrabacher
who's Russia's man in Washington the DNC
has pledged not to use any stolen or
hacked materials for campaigns but it
seems like Republicans are refusing to
match that commitment are you are there
any chance that the parties come
together and say hey let's not let
foreign propaganda be used against us
yeah so it's actually
something I've done a lot of reporting
on which is it's actually the d-triple-c
that has pledged not to use any hacked
material in their real in their election
campaigns and the NRCC which has not
right part of the part of the DNC
actually I've been trying to get a hold
of and they will not answer my emails so
it's my emails but you're that dancy at
the heart right at the heart of this at
the heart of this is really the
reluctance of the Republicans to say
that if a hack document is leaked to the
media
for example and the media already is
reporting on it and it's already out in
the public sphere will Republicans then
exploit that will they use that in ads
will they essentially use the hack
document without using the hack document
if you know what I mean so Democrats
have said that they won't do it that
even if something that has been hacked
has made its way into the public sphere
that they're still not going to use it
in ads they're not going to run on it
they're not going to invoke it in any
way Republicans don't want to make that
commitment they say that as long as it's
in the public sphere then it's fair game
as of right now they have not reached a
consensus on this issue part of the what
Republicans wanted to do is they wanted
to shift the onus on to the reporters
and the media and say and include kind
of a bullet point in this pledge that
they made that criticizes the media well
not themselves committing to not using
any of this hack material in any in any
kind of their campaign materials so they
kind of want to have it both ways in
that in that sense they'd be willing to
sign on to this pledge not to exploit
these hack documents as long as it
doesn't make them you know commit to not
using them as long as they're in the
public sphere and Democrats are kind of
moving along on their own the senatorial
counterparts of each of these committees
are still in question so stay tuned yeah
I mean I guess there's a giant loop here
loophole here for everyone which is
super PACs independent expenditure arms
like all the gross dark money that gets
cranked into elections late in the game
anyway definitely um when we talked at
the beginning of the year you had just
published a piece in the Atlantic that
included transcripts of messages but
Queen Roger stone and WikiLeaks from
October 2016 I guess he had apparently
exchanged DMS on Twitter with gusta for
2.0 to a a who was a front for the
Russians we now know can you talk us
through like what you had reported
earlier in the year and the questions
that reporting left you about how
WikiLeaks operates and asserts its
influence
definitely so prior to my reporting we
had not known that Roger stone was
communicating directly with WikiLeaks
Twitter account which is run by Julian
Assange during the 2016 election
obviously he had said many times during
the election teased many things about
big drops that were coming an October
Surprise he seemed to have previous
knowledge of things that WikiLeaks was
going to drop so that raised a lot of
questions but what I reported was that
he actually reached out to WikiLeaks in
October and he asked them to stop
railing on him essentially what was
we do it welcome to pod save America I'm
John Favreau
I'm Dan Pfeiffer I'm Erin Ryan later in
the pod you'll hear my interview with
Katie Couric who's got a new podcast
documentary reflecting on the interview
she did with Sarah Palin ten years ago
oh and that was the craziest thing that
happened so a few other quick
housekeeping things before we get into
the news on pod save the world this week
Tommy chatted with the Atlantic's
Natasha Bertrand about the uncertainty
over rod rosin Stein's tenure in the
Trump administration I have a I have a
plug here for hysteria but Erin you're
here I'm here what's on hysteria this
week so we had to record hysteria on
Wednesday which was before the madness
today so uh but one thing that was cool
about this week is that we were able to
highlight four really exciting female
candidates instead of like dwelling on
the super dark news so we got to talk
about Lucy Macbeth Geena Ortiz Jones a
couple other candidates you might be
excited about between now and the
election will probably be highlighting
that's awesome women that are running
especially in flippable districts
especially young women women of color
and women running with with
non-traditional backstories so excellent
trying to keep it light something
hopeful yeah also everyone tickets are
now available for the shows that we will
be doing for our HBO special the which
will be in Miami Erin will be with us in
Miami yeah
Austin Philadelphia and Irvine and so
you can check out this website
www.fawziacademy.com
it is probably the craziest political
event I have witnessed since Trump won
the election I don't know at least
that's how I feel right now I guess
let's start with
initial reactions of dr. Blasi Ford's
testimony and questioning and then we
can move on to Cavanaugh Erin what were
your initial reactions watching dr.
Christine Blasi for this morning well I
think that a lot of women watching this
kind of went through similar similar a
series of emotions that I went through
it's incredibly difficult as a woman to
watch this unfold over and over again to
look at another another round of
headlines that have to do with sexual
assault to watch another woman basically
have to kind of dissect herself in front
of the world to prove what happened to
her happened to her
a lot of friends of mine texted me this
morning saying they were getting
emotional watching this was this was
very difficult for them I felt watching
her that she was incredibly brave in
ways that I couldn't imagine being brave
her voice wavered but she kept it
together
she was very straightforward and
fact-based she acted in a way that is
unfortunately like the the standard that
women who try to make a point who try to
be believed need to adhere to men like
Lindsey Graham like you mentioned can
throw tantrums and scream into the
camera and complain and whine and that's
totally fine because they're men and
they have gravitas but the pressure on
Ford was a lot higher than it would be
on a man because women need to act more
rational and calm in order to be thought
of as as rational and calm as a man so I
was I was really impressed with her her
composure her calmness or her calm and
but I was also very upset by the fact
that we had to revisit those issues
again as women yeah yeah I thought the
same thing about her bravery like I you
know I found myself teary through
watching the testimony and watching her
statement and I was like and I'm not
even like I can't imagine what she's
going to rep right now what she was
going through and how she kept it
together the whole time and she was so
poised and so forceful and her and
incredible in her testimony dan what did
you think I agree with that it you
cannot be a rational person
and watch her put herself before the
nation and give that testimony about
this incredibly traumatic experience
that happened to her and believe that
this is part of some sort of democratic
plot to unseat Brett Kavanaugh or tilt
the Supreme Court it yeah I think it
well I mean obviously your testimonies
incredibly compelling and but it's also
it just was sad because this is like
this is such an incredibly serious thing
and we live in a political world where
one of our parties is incapable of
acting with the seriousness and the
compassion and the empathy that you
would expect in this situation or would
hope for in the situation yeah I keep
kept thinking like after listening to
her testimony and listening to her after
everyone questioned her like it just
comes back to you either believe her
account or you don't
mm-hm and if you don't believe it you
should ask yourself why why what why
would she put herself through what she
had to put herself through today why
would she put her family through that
what did she have to gain what incentive
did she have to do this today
yeah I thought something I was thinking
a lot about and and I was thinking it's
sort of a kind of Mike because it's a
different version of a thing that women
go through a lot I think when a woman is
in a lot of cases when she's when she's
sexually assaulted or victimized by a
guy that's something that sticks with
her for the rest of her life you know
dr. Ford has obviously been thinking
about this thing that happened to her
when she was a teenager since it
happened like to the extent that it
impacted remodeling that she was doing
on her home after she had been married
decades later and that's that's the
thing that's like women carry this with
them forever and one thing that I was
thinking just as the day went on is is
that you know Brett Cavanaugh has
performed believing that he didn't do
this like he he has performed believing
that this thing happened to her but he
maybe doesn't remember and I just think
that that it's it's sort of the way that
it's happened for a lot of women is that
something will happen to them and it'll
be something they think about every day
for the rest of their lives and then it
the guy just doesn't have to live with
it just doesn't think about it it goes
away for him I think that says it's much
about this situation is anything is it
the most traumatic experience of dr.
Lacey Ford's life is something that
Brett Kavanaugh doesn't even remember
could it be any other Saturday night or
Friday night in his high school career
and it's I think it's a microcosm of
what we're dealing with in this country
on these issues the level of detail in
her testimony you mentioned in the front
door you know and she said that when
they were remodeling their home she
wanted to have two front doors and she
you know got a fight with her husband
about this and other people who were
working on the house and no one could
understand why she wanted the second
door and that's how she ended up when
when she was in couples therapy with her
husband bringing up the incident for the
first time you have her bring this up in
2012 in a therapy session you have four
sworn statements from friend of her
friends of hers that she brought this up
with them over the years and then we
found it you know we as we learned today
she brought this up to her
representatives before Cavanaugh was
nominated for the court I think I saw
Chris Hayes tweet about this but you
saying basically she was trying to do
the White House's vetting for them and
she said a couple times during that
testimony I was hoping I was praying
they would go for an equally qualified
conservative nominee for the court and
not Cavanaugh and when I thought that
they weren't going to do that when I was
worried about it I started coming
forward cuz I thought he might end up
being the one so like none of that none
of that points to the fact that she
might have made this up somehow yeah I
mean here's the thing a lot of times
when we talk about sexual assault people
say that that women lie about it and you
know I think that if people are
up enough to sexually assault each other
there are people that would be up
enough to lie about it but I here's the
way that I think that most of the lies
around sexual assault happen if you're a
woman that has had it happen to you you
have to lie about it so you can get
through the rest of your life you have
to lie about how big of a deal it was to
you you have to lie about your ability
to overcome it without intervention
and I think men who do it lie about it
too they lie about it so they can tell
themselves that there's they're the sort
of person who doesn't rape people they
need to rewrite history as it's
happening we've talked about this on
hysteria a lot of you know some of my
co-hosts have had interactions with men
that were definitely not okay where a
man tried to overpower you or a man
tried to do something to you that wasn't
okay uh and in in my case at least the
guy who tried to do it to me
reached out to me years later to like
friend request me on Facebook and was
like hey how's it going it's been so
great to see your success like to me
that was me witnessing him trying to
pretend that that hadn't happened and I
think that that is the biggest liar on
sexual assault people needing to pretend
that it didn't happen so that they can
believe what they believe about what
kind of person they are and Brett
Kavanaugh clearly has an idea of what
kind of person he is he's the captain of
the basketball team he got into Yale he
went to parties and just had a good time
he drank a lot of beer he's not the kind
of person who ruins someone's life he
needs to not believe he's that person
and and we'll get to sort of his side of
this whole hearing later but you could
sort of tell you could tell that in his
anger and his testimony to write that in
his mind he's like and he kept saying
this over and over I've been through so
many FBI investigations I've been so
public for so long I've gotten this far
I'm a good father I'm a basketball coach
and you could tell he he genuinely
believes all those things to be true and
it's possible that all those things are
true and he still sexually assaulted
dr. Blasi Ford you know like I think
he's trying to set up the situation the
Republicans are like Oh everyone's
trying to paint this guy as an evil
monster his whole life and he's not he's
this good guy but it seems like it's
much more complicated than that
it's absolutely because people are more
complicated than that because here's the
thing people can evolve and people can
change and people can behave in ways
that are abhorrent when they're under
the influence of alcohol or drugs and as
they mature they can move away from
being the sort of person who would do
that kind of thing but I also think that
it would be less difficult for me to
accept if Brett Kavanaugh were the sort
of person who who wanted who believed in
those qualities from other people his
record for example doesn't in any way
support the idea that people deserve
Redemption for mistakes they made when
they were teenagers you know he was a
person who on the DC circuit pushed for
an undocumented teen to not be able to
obtain an abortion after she had met all
the legal requirements set forth by
Texas law you know the GOP is the party
of mandatory minimum sentencing for
underage drug offenders the GOP is the
party of mandating pregnant teens carry
pregnancies to term I just don't I think
that if Cavanaugh in any way exhibited
the forgiveness that he wants the world
to give him now that would be something
that would maybe move me a little bit
but he hasn't he's incapable of
experiencing any divergence from his
personal narrative about himself and
there's been zero self-examination about
any mistakes he has made in his life
either just even beyond this specific
allegation just about being an
17-year olds which many seventeen year
olds can be being obnoxious to other
people drinking too much and just ed
every single time he refuses to
acknowledge any fault on himself which
raises real questions about his larger
denials because if you lie about the
small things repeatedly it suggests that
you would also why about the big things
yeah we were all of course texting about
this all day and anna-marie Cox was
saying catchable lies that's what he
keeps he keeps telling these catchable
lies and that is the story of the entire
confirmation process with him from
beginning to end whether it's about and
we've said this a million times on this
podcast whether it's about you know
receiving stolen documents during that
hearing whether it's his opening
statement about how you know Trump has
never consulted more people for any
position ever and today I think small
things in his yearbook right like it's
just all these little lies that are
easily proven false that he keeps
telling which tells you that there is a
credibility issue at stake here
he is there's there's two people here
there's dr. Ford and there's Brett
Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh has been
caught in dozens of Lies already big in
small and she has not been so the
Republicans had an Arizona prosecutor
named Rachel Mitchell
handle the questions for the Republicans
to dr. Ford because I they didn't they
didn't like the understandably optics of
what is it eleven men on the Judiciary
Committee eleven Republican men
questioning dr. Ford Republicans have
never had a woman on the tertiary
committee in the hundreds of years
no Judiciary Committee that's correct so
they had they had an Arizona prosecutor
named Rachel Mitchell who you know her
background is in prosecuting sex crimes
she handled the questions for dr. Ford
what did we think of that how did how
did that go well it depends on what
you're interested in getting out of this
hearing if you're interested in her
prosecuting a woman who says that she
experienced sexual assault in the same
way that she would prosecute someone
accused of sexual assault then you
didn't get what you wanted what I saw
people on Twitter saying that she
essentially subjected dr. Ford to a
standard intake like a standard series
of intake questions that you would you
would ask a sexual assault survivor but
just in five minutes and interviewed or
interrupted by it yeah Democratics
grandstanding and speeches for the most
part so it was a really bizarre kind of
construction for this entire thing I
think that it seemed that she didn't
really know the facts of the case that
she was dealing with that she asked
questions that that betrayed a lack of
knowledge and I also think that by the
end she kind of knew that she'd
up and she asked dr. Ford if you know
she can acknowledge that this is a weird
Foreman dr. Ford was like yeah and I and
I saw a lot of Republicans were pretty
mad about it I don't think that they
were satisfied that she did their
bidding for them yeah I think it was a
very poorly conceived plan the books
executed even more poorly you're right
she had seemed to have less knowledge of
the facts than the average twitter user
who's been following this closely and
where she seemed to have the most
knowledge and most interest was not
about what happened to dr. Ford and
whether Brett Kavanaugh and Mark judge
did this but in the but to defend the
Republicans on the process of when the
hearing was gonna be and when she was in
contact with Dianne Feinstein that she
was much more interested in whether what
reporter she talked to or when
she sent a letter who paid for her
polygraph none of which is relevant to
what may or may not have happened and
that kind of gives away the game for
what the Republicans were actually after
that's what I took from it too is that
she the Republican case here is they
don't want to say that dr. Ford is a
liar so there are cases she is a victim
as is Dez's Brett Kavanaugh of a
democratic smear campaign that is the
line that they're going with because
therefore then they don't have to say
that she's a liar but they can infer
that and say that it's the Democrats
fault and it seemed as though Rachel
Mitchell's questions were trying to
support that narrative by saying who
paid for the polygraph test well dr.
Ford's lawyers paid for the polygraph
test as a standard as both of the
lawyers said during the hearing and then
there was you said you had a fear of
flying and yet here you are and the fear
of flying was supposed to delay the
hearing and so their big thing is
they're making a case that the hearing
was delayed and that that's just a
democratic strategy to delay delay delay
and so she was trying to prove that that
like Angela oh well you fly on vacations
all the time he was absurd yeah
and they were getting really hung up on
processed questions like they were they
were shaking their fists especially
during the intermissions because the
only people we got to see question four
directly was was Mitchell we didn't get
to see the actual rage of the
Republicans although that would have
been you know what I think I would have
walked slowly into the sea if I would
have had to watch that over any case
this was hard enough and but but one of
the things that she that they were
saying is just they're so mad about the
this wasn't the proper procedure this is
this and that my my main point about
this is that if you found serious
serious misbehavior among a nominee for
the highest court in the land it doesn't
really matter how you found out that
information like I was saying earlier if
someone walked by my apartment building
and saw flames coming out of my bedroom
window and broke in and saved my cat and
I walked by and I was like wait how'd
you get my apartment building to put the
cat back in there you know you can pay
for your uber over the apartment did
George Soros make you Keyes like that
that's ridiculous I think that it's in
America's best interest to be aware of
all of the skeletons in the closets of
people that are nominated to be
Supreme Court justices and to be angry
about the process is egregious yeah and
it's also Brett Kavanaugh does not have
a right to be on the Supreme Court right
the standard of whether you get a
lifetime appointment to the highest
court in the land is not beyond a
reasonable doubt it is a job interview
and it is the Senate's job Senate's
responsibility to ensure that they put
someone on the court who beyond a shadow
of a doubt is not a person who would
engage in these sorts of things exceeds
his right Brett Kavanaugh was right to
be on the court in the amount of
entitlement that Republicans and Brad
Cavanaugh himself have had about this
role as Frank is disgusting really yeah
I mean III good oh no I was just gonna
say though watching him kind of react
with aggression to being questioned and
being so emotionally volatile volatile
during his portion of the hearing it
sort of maybe it reminded me very much
of like a you know an 80s teen bully and
our president is kind of in that model
too like it's it's a sort of overly
emotional reactive man who can't handle
anything but getting exactly what he
wants all the time and that's what I was
seeing today he's a guy who plays all
of America I'm John Favreau I'm John
Lovett I'm Tommy Vitor on today's pod
you'll hear the interview that Dan and
loved it did with New York Times's mark
Leibovich talk about politics Paul Ryan
and Leibovich his new book about the NFL
called big game today we're also gonna
be talking about the latest allegations
against Brett Kavanaugh and the news
that Trump is considering firing Deputy
Attorney General rod Rosen stuff that's
not exactly right John he's been
considering firing rod Rosenstein from
the get from the jump from the get-go
there's just anyway from the day Muller

things people can't see that okay my
reputation let's talk about Bartow
Cavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme
Court over the weekend just as an
agreement to hear testimony from dr.
Christine Blasi Ford was coming together
a separate set of allegations surfaced
in a New Yorker article by Ronan Farrow
and Jane Mayer on Sunday this time from
a college classmate of Cavanaugh's who
says that he once exposed himself to her
at a party while they were students at
Yale
and caused her to touch his penis
without her consent when he thrust it
into her face
Democrats have called for a delay in the
confirmation process to investigate the
new allegations Republicans have said
basically off Mitch McConnell today
called the whole thing a quote shameful
smear campaign by the Democrats and
vowed to hold an up or down vote on
Cavanaugh in the near future no matter
what let's start with the New Yorker
story love it why do you think that
Ronan Jane Mayer and the New Yorker
thought this story was solid enough to
run and what are the most salient
important facts in the story to you so
you know there's been a lot of pushback
against let me take them again so so
what's in this story first of all there
was a woman on the record Deborah
Ramirez Deborah Ramirez on the record
photo saying this is what Brett
Kavanaugh did when I was a student at
Yale now the New Yorker is incredibly
cautious in this and so references the
fact that she took several days before
she felt certain in declaring it was
Brett Kavanaugh because she was careful
and they also referenced the fact that
she had been drinking and that there
were gaps in her memory nevertheless she
makes this claim it is backed up by the
fact that this was reported at the time
that people were aware that this had
happened that that Brett that that there
was that Brett had sorry that there was
someone who had knew at the time that
Brett Kavanaugh had been involved in
this incident that Deborah Ramirez
remembered that Brett Cavanaugh's name
was shouted in the hallway describing
what he had done it's also reported in
the story that people at Yale when Brett
Kavanaugh was nominated we're talking
about these incidents and talking about
his behavior at Yale Brett Cavanaugh's
freshman year roommate finds the story
credible finds Deborah Ramirez
believable and finds the behavior and
finds the bait
finds the behavior consistent with the
kind of behavior he saw from Brett
Kavanaugh the kind of drinking and
 around he saw from Brett
Kavanaugh
on top of that Bret Cavanaugh's lawyers
who gave a statement to The New Yorker
ostensibly to back up Bret Cavanaugh's
claims however two of the people in that
statement are people that Deborah
Ramirez alleges were involved in egging
Brett Kavanaugh on one of them is the
wife of somebody who was alleged by
Deborah Ramirez who has egged Cavanaugh
on and two of the other people in that
statement after the piece came out
reached out to the New Yorker to say
they didn't want their names associated
with that statement because they could
not back up the claims in their rebuttal
that this didn't happen so there is a
lot in here to back up Deborah Ramirez
his claim now a lot of Republicans have
said but wait there's no eyewitnesses
there's no eyewitnesses there have been
so many incredibly important stories
over the past year where women come
forward and say this is what happened to
me that is corroborated by by prompt
outcry at the time in which of course
there are no other witnesses either
because people were involved if there
was no one else there well it's
important what you said that people are
involved the people in the room at the
time of this alleged incident where's
Brett Kavanaugh and a couple of friends
who were all egging him on some of them
had you know let's look at a penis that
would they were shoving that in her face
and then apparently Breck having to
uphold his pants and he did but it's
like Kavanagh and his buddies and they
were all egging him on so of course
those people aren't gonna talk to
testify to the story right Tommy what
did your reaction the key for me is that
dr. Blasio Ford's position is that she
wants a more rigorous investigation she
wants the FBI to step in she wants Marc
judge who I'm talking with the first
story now she wants Marc judge who was
there during during the first incident
as described in high school to be
subpoenaed the Republicans won't let
that happen
Debra Ramirez wants more investigation
to be done of this incident Republicans
don't want that to happen
their response when they heard about
this incident was to fast forward the
process and try to ram him through and
the fact is I wasn't there I can't tell
you for sure what happened memory can be
unreliable but if you're involved in
trauma you're probably more likely to
remember what happened and so let's
investigate to the best of our ability
and let's try to get to the facts
that serves both sides that served
Kavanagh that serves the accusers but
the Republicans don't care about the
facts they want to rush the process I
mean again just to go back to what is in
this story like you said New Yorker
found that Yale classmates have been
talking about the story for weeks and
months before dr. Ford dr. Blais ephors
allegations surfaced so one thing that
is an absolute lie and easily provable
lie is all these Republicans saying this
is an 11th hour thing this was just made
up after one allegation happened someone
came forward further no that is false
that they were Yale classmates emailing
around about this story the minute that
Brett Kavanaugh was nominated cuz they'd
all remember hearing it and classmate of
ramirez's on that said another two
student told him about the incident
right after it happened he's in the
story in The New Yorker story he said he
has quote a hundred percent Shore that
he was told at the time the Kavanagh was
the student who exposed himself to
Ramirez and independently recalled many
of the same exact details that Ramirez
had told The New Yorker so you had hurry
details that she told The New Yorker and
this other classmate who hadn't heard
what she said and he said the exact same
details to other classmates Richard oh
and Mark craz Berg said they'd heard the
story as well and they just didn't have
specific names attached to the story but
they heard the story exactly like
Ramirez recounted it yes and you know
the New Yorker is so careful and look I
am outside of this process but I am very
familiar with the care Roane intakes and
reporting these stories and the care
that the New Yorker takes in reporting
these stories it was interesting the
White House pushback Eric wemble wrote a
piece in The Washington Post's that were
that that that made this point which is
all the White House's pushback against
the New Yorker came from The New Yorker
because in addition to laying out these
credible allegation and all the evidence
that backs it up from the time and in
the Year sense they also included very
conservatively very carefully a lot of
caveats they did an ethical thing and
they said Debra Ramirez was not
comfortable from the jump to
that this is Brett Kavanaugh she wanted
to be sure they did the ethical thing of
talking about the fact that she had been
drinking talking about the fact that
there were gaps in her memory they did
the due diligence and the work and
provided the the information to respect
readers enough to say this is why we
believe this is credible this is why we
believe it is worth it for you to know
that this is out there that Senate
Democrats are investigator vesting this
and this woman is making this claim and
I just know on a personal level how
incredibly seriously Ronan takes getting
this right and I know also that he is
not motivated by partisanship he's not
motivated by politics he would do this
if it were Democrat he would do this
regardless of party and that's it look
Brett Kavanaugh and his allies over and
over again have said listen to the
people who knew me best then listen to
what they say okay here's James Roche
Cavanaugh's roommate at the time of the
alleged incident recalled him in The New
Yorker piece being quote frequently
incoherently drunk quote is it
believable that she was alone with a
wolfy group of guys who thought it was
funny to sexually torment a girl like
Debbie yeah definitely is it believable
the Kavanagh was one of them yes that
was his college roommate at the time so
this like this it's amazing today how
this this story even more then I think
the Blasi Ford story has sort of
spiraled into this whole thing like oh
this allegation is over-the-top and they
didn't have it but like it's very well
detailed in here yeah I mean the
Kavanagh is he's not doesn't come off as
credible he just an interview with Fox
News
where he stuck to his talking points
that all he wanted is a fair hearing and
an investigation but again with regard
to miss Blasio for dr. posny Ford
they're not calling the one witness
they're not subpoenaing the one witness
who could actually shed some light under
this if pressed under oath
if you look at his yearbook page the
notion he claimed that he's never been
blacked-out drunk he's never not
remembered something from drinking it's
all about like the hundred keg club and
all these like drinking insinuations I'm
not saying that means the allegations
are true means that he's painting a
picture of himself that is not credible
when compared to what people are saying
what he wrote about himself at the time
and is your book and what his friends
are saying it's like we've been saying
it about the small thing I was just
exactly it's like we've been saying
since every time we've talked about
Brett coven Brett Kavanaugh
he has been caught lying about things
that are so small you know like why not
say in the interview oh yeah have you
ever drank to the point where you a
blackout drunk and do remember thing no
never
he says you were a club called the tit
and Club right which Fox News did
not say in the follow-up to your in a
book by your childhood friend Marc judge
as Bart o Cavanaugh your drinking buddy
passed out all the time people who knew
you said that you got incoherently drunk
all the time why lie about that little
thing and one of the other important
pieces of news there's two of there's
two big pieces of news that we haven't
talked about from The New Yorker story
one is that people who know Marc judge
felt it necessary to come out and say
his claims about this not being possible
or just not true
Marc judge talked about the fact that he
lost his virginity in in a sexual Marc
judge talked about the fact that he lost
his virginity in in a sexual encounter
with multiple men when he was when he
was young
that that his denials just don't don't
that that his denials are just not true
so you know let but there's this there's
this two-step process that has gone on
with with Brett Kavanaugh one is by dint
of partisanship whether it is sincere or
cynical to not see the ways in which
Brett Kavanaugh is consistently
dishonest and not see it around prior
not see it about the judiciary not see
it in the opening remarks he made when
he was named by Donald Trump to not see
it and deny it and claim me as a man of
incredible integrity step two then used
that integrity that is not based on
evidence that's not based on his actions
to do to deny these allegations and it's
a it's just not a an accurate
representation of the this person that
we have seen repeatedly lie under oath
to get out of less serious situations
than this yeah and if this were serious
investigation they would call Marc judge
to testify like you said the the woman
who who talked about Marc judge was
Elizabeth razor she was she dated Marc
judge and she said
um that mark told her a very different
story about his days in college you know
she he told her ones ashamedly of an
incident that involved him and other
boys taking turns having sex with a
drunk woman and of course as she said
this as the New York's nerd New Yorkers
story posted Michael avenatti also came
out with claims and said he's now
representing a group of people including
one who he described as a victim with
quote credible information about Brett
Kavanaugh and Mark judge who can
corroborate allegations of sexual
assault from their high school days
hanadi said that's gonna happen you know
that those people are gonna come forward
within a couple days apparently so we'll
see if that's a real thing but like all
this stuff keeps coming out yeah and the
one thing that has been held constant
throughout this whole thing is the
Republican reaction and then in fact
it's actually gotten worse it's gotten
worse and and now their their latest
iteration is that this is a Democratic
smear and they want us to feel sympathy
for Cavanaugh and for his family and it
leaked out the Cavanaugh in a prep
session at the White House was deeply
hurt by the accusations and refused to
answer them in a prep session and that
that is understandable it is human but I
do not feel any sympathy for him these
we know how Brett Kavanaugh the
political staffer would have reacted in
this instance if he was working against
himself
because when he worked for Ken Starr he
wanted to force Bill Clinton to answer
explicit personal sexual questions and
we know he wrote in a memo that it's
their job to quote make his pattern of
revolting behavior clear piece by
painful piece we're applying the Brett
Kavanaugh standard to Brett Kavanaugh
then we should figure out all of these
allegations
but they don't yeah but they don't want
to the Republicans are if if anything
they're digging in even further the
other piece of big news in The New
Yorker story is this this passage quote
senior Republican staffers also learned
of the allegation last week and in
conversations with The New Yorker
expressed concern about its potential
impact on Cavanaugh's nomination soon
after Senate Republicans issued renewed
calls to accelerate the timing of a
committee vote so their response to
hearing about a potential second
allegation of sexual assaults against
Cavanaugh was to confirm him as fast as
possible well you know we've been asking
this rhetorical question for days what's
so important about Monday what's so
important about Monday why are you
rushing why are they rushing
we couldn't figure it out it was are
they afraid they'll have to withdraw him
and so they need the time to replace him
none of it really made sense but now we
know they're regardless of their denials
clearly multiple reporters have been
chasing this New York Times was chasing
this we know the Washington Post was
chasing this The New Yorker was clearly
chasing this and the committee the White
House Cavanaugh seemed they were clearly
aware of it and terrified yeah you can
tell to its homey you mentioned this
they're making it all about Democrats in
the Democratic campaign which was their
lucky you president Trump has decided to
start tweeting at you I think he knows
you have a book out helped me enormously
yeah he really wants people to read your
book so he tweeted he's criticizing your
meetings with the Iranian officials and
and suggesting they were illegal and
saying wondering aloud if you were
registered under the foreign agents
Registration Act which is Allah we know
he doesn't understand because he hired
Michael Flynn let me hired Paul Manafort
what do you think about these tweets
what's he doing here well he's it's the
great Trump distraction I mean we know
that he isn't gonna read my book is I
mean I thought today if they want to
hide documents from him they should put
it in my book I mean the guy's you know
comes from a different place it's a
distraction on the day that Paul
Manafort cops a plea and and I tweeted
back I said mr. president the
conversation you really ought to be
worried about is the one that took place
between manna fort and Muller yeah right
so we are where we are who you've known
for what since high school yeah yeah I
knew my mother was captain in my hockey
team he was a terrific athlete best
athlete really in school he was we
played soccer hockey and lacrosse
together for four years well yeah it was
fun Donald Trump is a good it was to
shred the defense yeah I know that's
exactly what he's doing so you know he's
criticizing you for your continued
efforts to well no they're not
continuing the irony is they're not
conditioned okay no from the moment the
president has made his decision MO is
good I've met with anybody regarding
that people come to meet and we meet
normally and of course it's a subject of
conversation it was going to be so I'm
not defensive in the least about it at
the time that I met it was at the United
Nations General Assembly I mean in in
the you know outside but that was the
occasion that brought him to the United
States he met with countless numbers of
people right I mean he met with he
formally delivered a address at the
Council on Foreign Relations he went to
the media but everywhere
and I met with him in the Munich
Security Conference I met with him in
Oslo Norway at a peace conference where
people were talking about how you make
the world safer so I will always meet
with people to talk about how you avoid
a war in the Middle East and how you
make this country of ours safer
yeah and that's really what's going on
but nothing unusual I mean Henry
Kissinger has spent four decades now
meeting with the Chinese meeting with
the Russians meeting with people in
various places in the world this is the
normal thing that Senators Congressmen
ex senators congressmen who are engaged
in public affairs do we have
conversations with other people and by
the way the administration should have
more of them yeah they should start well
it'll paint steak I mean look I'm
defensive of the Iran deal because I
believe it made us safer
you painstakingly negotiated this thing
spending weeks at a time
locked in hotel conference rooms with
Iranian counterparts you did it with a
broken leg I mean what did you learn
about your interlocutor as the Iranians
when you did this and and what does your
response been to their efforts to tear
up this deal well look we all and time
you know this you know these issues
we're all troubled by Iran's role in the
region we're troubled by their support
for Hezbollah we're troubled by their
threats against Israel we're troubled by
their trafficking arms to Yemen we're
troubled by their meddling in Iraq and
Saudi Arabia and so forth so there are
issues to resolve with Iran but our
calculation President Obama's
calculation first of all but the
calculation of everybody administration
was we are better off dealing with those
issues if Iran isn't marching towards a
nuclear weapon or doesn't have one and
so first step get control of the nuclear
process take that threat off the table
which is what we did and it's we also
kept in place their sanctions for
missiles the sanctions for human rights
abuses the sanctions for their
trafficking and weapons and we raised
those sanctions and during that period
of time so there was no inattention by
the Obama administration to these issues
but we believe that you're going to have
a better chance of advancing it if you
build a relationship
which holds them accountable certain
international standards that's what
that's what happened until Donald Trump
alone
just pulled out and guess what left
Europe China Russia and Iran all trying
to keep the agreement so he thinks it's
bad but everybody else you know the
major players who were involved in it
think it's good and want to keep it yeah
and he seems to be threatening them with
the military action if they don't blow
up so well but I terms the real policy
of this administration is obvious now it
is regime change right they are trying
to do regime change and the bottom line
is we don't do that very well right I
mean how much cakewalk how much of a
cakewalk would a war with Iran be what
day would we be greeted as liberators
how quickly would we pay for the effort
with their oil it feels like it's
obvious it's a no-brainer right it
should be it should be but it obviously
isn't because we have neo cons that
we're back in we're pushing the idea
that they're gonna put so much pressure
on them they're going to cave here's
here's what here's what is going to
happen if they were to cave if and it's
a huge if because their view is we're
untrustworthy now we've proven it
because of Donald Trump pulling away
from the agreement so the idea of them
coming back to the negotiating table is
a pipe dream it's not going to happen so
if you keep the pressure on if there
were to be a change because of the
dynamic Trump has set up by making
rouhani president rouhani look you know
not credible because he negotiated with
America and now he finds America bites
them you're not gonna see an Iranian
leader negotiate with the United States
for a long time yeah certainly not with
Donald Trump how how much damage do you
think Trump has done to America's
reputation in the world international
institutions and how difficult do you
think it will be for the next president
to sort of put it back together I
remember you know when Obama was running
a big theme was Bush's destroy our
reputation in the world and then he
became president and the you know the
entire administration sort of got that
back over eight painstaking years but do
you think it's it's been worse with
Trump already or
I think John I think the leaders in the
world are smart people President Xi has
been pursuing a new narrative as has
President Putin that the liberal order
the West is failing and that the United
States is on a downward incline slide
and regrettably Donald Trump is playing
into that his whole policy is playing
into that he's not making America first
or stronger he's he's making it alone
and isolating us from our own allies
weakening the NATO alliance weakening
relationships with with critical friends
like Canada Mexico others so we're in a
much worse situation but those leaders
they read the anonymous op-ed they're
reading a tarantia they're going through
every single page of Woodward's book
right now they're chronicling every day
and they know how flattery gets you
somewhere without they know I mean
that's what Kim jong-un did right
psychological for a really glitzy fun
meeting in Singapore oh gee we don't
have a communique wow that's really
curious and they just they don't have
anything that came out of it so now
they're trying to figure out how do we
make the next step King jungle and
played rope-a-dope and just you know ran
circles around Donald Trump who liked
the flags he liked the meeting like
these tension but he didn't get any
precision whatsoever as to what
denuclearization is no idea where their
weapons are no process by which we're
going to learn that there's no structure
there there's no there they're the
leaders around the world see that so the
answer your question is I believe a new
president particularly if it's a
president who is expressing the the need
for u.s. leadership and the
strengthening of NATO and and and the
vitalization of UN and so forth it'll
happen so quickly it'll turn around in a
matter of months and I think you'll
you'll see people rejoice that the
United States is back in
addition to with negotiating in addition
to your negotiations with the Iranians
you spent a lot of time with Sergey
Lavrov the Russian Foreign Minister he's
this for people listening he's a slick
smooth operator in DC fancy suits you
know martini lunches um I'm just
wondering what it's like to console a
province and he's a whiskey guy it
whiskey guy sorry constantly uh
negotiate with someone like him who you
you know what they're doing you know
they're hacking our elections you know
they're lying to us about Syria they're
you know they're lying about Crimea but
you that's your guy that's your
interlocutor how do you manage a
relationship like that you do it I mean
it's not dissimilar from the politics of
Capitol Hill where Trump has to sit down
with Mitch McConnell who's declared that
is one goal in life is to make the
president one-term president I mean come
on you learn and it's a heart it's a
hard thing and it's it's not the most
glorious component of being in politics
but you learn how to compartmentalize
mm-hmm and we have to compartmentalize
in big ways because Crimea Ukraine
consistently remained a major problem in
our relationship and we were always
fighting to get the Minsk agreement
implemented we're always fighting to get
the little green men with no insignia
out of the country as they deny they
have them and so forth it's laughable in
a way I mean it's kind of it's kind of
sick and pathetic if you want to know
the truth that they say the things they
say I mean I had some non conversations
with Lavrov some days where we're
telling him what we know about the Assad
chemical weapons and he's sitting there
on the other end of the phone in a total
other universe it's just it's bizarre
but you have to get through it because
you have to look for the places where
you actually can find that they have an
interest in wanting to cooperate or
satisfy something so we actually I met
with Putin many times I always saw
Lavrov a lot and we got things done and
when we got the Iran nuclear agreement
done Russia was actually very helpful
they took on major responsibilities on
fuel and on the stockpile
and and Lavrov was actually helpful in
working the Iranians on certain issues
where he said you're not gonna have our
support on this you got to do this you
got to do that would they were
supportive on climate change they were
supportive on the Ross Sea becoming I
got Putin after 10 years of objections I
got him to lift his objection to making
the rossi and antarctica the largest
marine protected area in the world and
they were helpful on the airline
reductions of emissions and so you know
we found that they were helpful we would
not have gotten the 1,300 tons of
chemical weapons declared chemical
weapons out of Syria 3 and we knew
they'd have some that were undeclared
and we started to go after those almost
immediately afterwards but wouldn't we
wouldn't have gotten 1,300 tons out of
there without Russia telling us odd this
is happening it's gonna happen fast and
here's how it happens now
Assad lies to them - yeah and he hid
some weapons and so forth but but the
fact is that if we hadn't done that
when Isis ran across the way you know
the Islamic state ran across the country
yeah they would have had chemical
weapons yeah that was the horrible horn
and if they had chemical weapons you'd
have seen a whole different thing
happening in Paris subway or London or
wherever so it is fortuitous we got the
result we got what should the response
have been from a democratic president or
a normal Republican president to
Russia's interference in the 2016
election how do you balance the need to
obviously respond to such an attack but
also not go so far as to have you know
to have another sort of Cold War break
out you know well I think the president
actually managed that as as carefully
and effectively as you could under the
circumstances because I remember I I
don't know if the president knew sooner
but I don't think I learned about that
kind of interference until the early
summer you know very late spring early
summer of 2016 and then we had a series
of meetings in the White House
it became the intelligence community
laid it out very clearly to us and so
but but here's the problem
President Obama
knew this was important to get the
American people to understand so but he
went up to the he did what they had he
met with the leadership of the Congress
and he tried to get Mitch McConnell in
the leaders to buy into a unified
Republican Democrat everybody house
Senate White House all putting this out
to the American people and why was that
so critical because Trump was already
laying the seeds in the groundwork for
the notion that the election was bogus
he was constantly talking about his
rigged it's rigged it's rigged and if we
didn't have Republicans and and and
leadership joining in that statement
Americans would have said here comes a
game and Trump would have said it Trump
would have left all over it and said
you're China interrupts the election
you're making an excuse for why things
are screwed up and and so the president
knew he couldn't be the vehicle of doing
that so he turned to the Intel community
and and the Director of National
Intelligence the director of the CIA and
these guys went out and did put a
statement out very carefully crafted so
it wasn't political we couldn't scare
people and I remember when we were in
China at the g20 the before the
elections I think it was in August late
August
President Obama was extremely tough and
very direct and clear in a one-on-one
with the interpreter but the one-on-one
conversation with President Putin and
the WikiLeaks stuff was already out and
that continued a little bit we did not
see new attacks and new efforts after
that conversation took place so in fact
it had effect and then the minute the
reduction was over people from Russia
were kicked out of the country and
sanctions were raised things took place
so I think it was a very tough situation
where where the president was in a sense
trapped by not wanting to allow Donald
Trump as a candidate to politicize the
process yes um Republicans often take
political actions that they claim are in
the name of the troops president Trump's
favorite hobby is criticizing the
posture of NFL players during the
national
them but those voices are silent when he
attacks the Khan family a gold star
family for example you have dealt with
this yourself you've had all kinds of
dishonest attacks about your military
record
what should Democrats learn from your
experience from the Trump attacks about
how to fight back you got to answer that
you've got to answer it in every forum
where it is I may not the mistake I made
in in 2004 and it wasn't a it wasn't as
clear but we had a big fight in the
campaign there were a lot of people
saying look you've won the battle of
facts The Wall Street Journal the New
York Times Washington Post Los Angeles
Times every major paper in the country
has carried the facts and we've talked
to your crew they're all interviewed and
we know what happened the problem is
that they kept you could you could you
could completely destroy their lie you
could shed all the truth on it and the
next day they get up in the morning go
out and say the same thing and they'd
say it in a different audience or they
put him up on television ads and it was
the television ads that were the most
damaging I think and and our campaign
for a number of different reasons the
limits of money and so forth
didn't think that it was necessary to
have those two others and ads I thought
it was and you know I lost the battle of
my own campaign which is it frankly
there shouldn't have been about I should
have just stopped the campaign and said
this is what we're doing and I should
have done what Obama did with Reverend
Wright which is go out and explain the
war in Vietnam and the context of where
we were and what happened and and just
put it in a different place and but
you've got to answer TV with TV got to
do that so I was on your 2004 campaign I
was just a kid then
21 years old and I was I was there from
the beginning anybody listening needs to
know he's just two kids and that was
there from the beginning and I always
thought that you know at the beginning
of that campaign in the primary you had
such a good sense of who you were why
you were running why you were running at
that moment in time and you told the
story really
well I work for AdWords you kicked our
ass that's right
and then you know as the campaign went
on and we faced a lot of challenges and
then you got to the general and the
campaign gets bigger and there's more
advisers added and suddenly it's this
big race and you're going through it
seemed it sometimes like you know the
message got lost a little bit and that
sort of core story that's a fairy that's
a fairy just wondering if what you I
never knew what you thought about that I
think that you know people gave me a lot
of advice before I started running and
one of the things Bill Clinton and
different people said to me is look you
can't be your own campaign manager you
gotta trust the people you have with you
yeah and that was the tension because I
had friends of mine like Senator Bob
Kerry and my great pal Tom Vallely who
was when I was in the Marines and and
you know they understood it and and they
were saying you could do this and and we
couldn't get the lay folks so to speak
in terms of that too to see it but it I
take the blame it's my fault I mean I'm
the candidate I'm the guy who want to
make the cut I should have perhaps fired
somebody or done something but I didn't
and I live with that but it made me a
very different secretary of state made
me a very different candidate in
re-election in Massachusetts it made me
a very different senator I have never
faltered from one instance since and in
doing what I think is right and doing
what's in my gut and that's the
important way to do it that's why I
write this book every day is extra it's
about you know how you live how you
tackle things how you were in public
life a life of purpose what are you
doing and you got to be true to yourself
is that so is that the advice you would
give to a candidate running today like
what's the main piece of advice you'd
give to yes a presidential candidate
running well the first thing you know I
tell them you can't run for president
you can't run a 50-state campaign unless
everyone ready all right welcome to pod

California we want to say hi next Friday
we're gonna be doing basically a live
dress rehearsal for our HBO show the
trailer for which is out today that'll
be on social media and then you can
you'll be seeing it on HBO this weekend
so the HBO show is coming dan what's
happening I well two things one if you
don't if a democratic house is not
attentive enough I guess listening to us
talking about politics in person there
will be incentive enough cool cool cards
a second now that the trailers out no
take back to HBO you are stuck with us
there's these four up to ten they're
stuck the Turner zone it has to happen I
suppose I suppose they could just decide
not to do it just have that trailer up
there we'd have a nice you know minute
trailer but okay we have a lot of news
here's where we are in the Cavanaugh
nomination the White House and every
single Senate Republican refused to
allow an independent investigation into
credible allegations that the Supreme
Court nominees sexually assaulted dr.
Christine Blasi Ford when the two of
them were in high school they refused to
allow anyone sorry they refused to allow
the FBI to reopen Cavanaugh's background
check they refused to interview anyone
who may have witnessed the assault or
attended the party they refused to
interview dr. blazes therapist whom she
told about the assault in 2012 they
refused to talk to anyone or do anything
but allow Brett Kavanaugh and dr. Blasi
to testify before the Senate Judiciary
Committee on Monday where she would be
questioned by Republican senators who
have already called her quote mistaken
and quote mixed up in response dr. blaze
these lawyers have said that she's
willing to cooperate with the committee
but believes that a nonpartisan
investigation led by the FBI should be
the first step in addressing the
allegations and that the rush to a
hearing that doesn't allow any other
witnesses to testify is unnecessary and
contrary to the committee discovering
the truth Dan I want to start with the
request for an FBI investigation we got
some Republicans saying the FBI doesn't
do that sort of thing some saying that
Brett Kavanaugh has already been through
multiple FBI background checks for his
previous appointments and confirmations
some are saying that it would take too
long what do you think could the FBI
conduct a fair timely investigation that
would help resolve these allegations
they certainly can can doc can and
should conduct a investigation and we
know they can do this because in a very
similar situation during after Anita
Hills allegations against Clarence
Thomas which happened after the original
FBI background investigation of Clarence
the FBI at the request of then President
George HW Bush reopened the
investigation into this allegation that
investigation took a month no three
weeks now three days so it can be done
will it resolve the question we don't
know but there's no harm in trying to to
actually do it they have the FBI has
ability to do it all I would take his
one phone call from God began to the FBI
to ask them to do it and none other than
senator orrin hatch who said that this
isn't the kind of thing the FBI does
said back in 1991 about the FBI
investigating Anita Hills claims this
was the very right appropriate thing to
do that was a quote from orrin hatch in
1991 also just recently John you a
former clerk to Clarence Thomas and
general counsel for the Senate Judiciary
Committee said he was quote surprised
the committee is holding the hearing
without an FBI request because it is
quote normal to ask the FBI to do more
and the FBI quote could have done this
in a day or two this is someone who was
a former clerk to Clarence Thomas as a
porter of Judge Cavanaugh's nomination
saying that this could be done I
shouldn't leave that part up like yes so
so then we know that it's possible but
like so put the Putin put the FBI
investigation aside right even if the
Republicans decide they don't want an
FBI investigation why wouldn't the
Republicans invite other witnesses to
testify
why wouldn't they subpoena mark judge
Brett Kavanaugh s friend who dr. Blasi
said was in the room at the time of the
assault because they do not want to find
out the truth everything the Republicans
have been doing since the moment the
Washington Post published the story on
Sunday suggests they do not believe
Kavanaugh is innocent of this because if
they did then the FBI investigation they
would believe the FBI was fine that he
that he
or that there was not conclusive proof
that this has happened therefore they
would want that you would want the I
would be named eyewitness to testify
under oath that it did not happen then
it goes from he said she said - he said
he said she said and so everything they
have done suggests that they want to
dispense with this with the a simple
checking of the box and move on because
the more they look the more worried they
are that we will find more about dishes
in it or other incident yeah I just I
can't understand the mark judge thing
because this is someone who he told the
Weekly Standard last week that the
allegations are completely false but has
since told the Judiciary Committee in a
letter that he has quote no memory of
what happened and does not wish to talk
to senators about it and you know this
is someone who's written for a number of
different conservative publications he's
written several books basically he wrote
a memoir of his struggles with drinking
while he went to Georgetown Prep
includes a character named Bart oak
Cavanaugh who gets drunk a lot in the
memoir but it seems like if this is if
this is someone who truly could
exonerate potentially Brett Kavanaugh
and who was in the room like why
wouldn't they call him I'm still
confused why they wouldn't have him
testify like you said it's it's it's
clear that either Republicans do not
believe that Cavanaugh is completely
innocent or and we'll talk about this
soon they're just you know really
concerned with the timing of this
because they want to rush this through
as as much as possible so yeah and then
like they have no good reason for not a
subpoena a mark judge Lindsey Graham was
asked about this on Tuesday and he said
why don't you want to subpoena mark
judge and he just said no reason to oh
no no reason why would we subpoena the
other witness the other witness who was
potentially in the room at the time yeah
I think it was a lot to do with the idea
that mark judge himself is my particular
compelling character given some of the
things he's written and said about women
yeah over time and also I think they're
nervous about what mark judge could say
about what Brett Kavanaugh or Bartow
Cavanaugh
did in high school and how he acted in
high school and so like their this is a
whitewash they are trying to seem like
they are being responsive to this new
information without actually getting any
information and they do not want to slow
this down under any circumstances do you
think the Republicans even want the
steering Robert cost at the Washington
Post's last night reported that several
top Republican lawmakers have told
colleagues that they hope dr. Blasi
declines to show up for the hearing even
as they issue statements urging her to
do so what are they afraid of they're
the worst people nothing more
like we definitely want to know about
this we care you know we actually don't
because we know what would happen we
know this would be bad for us
politically because we have a woman who
has made a very credible accusation of
sexual assault against their Supreme
Court nominee and the Republicans have
zero women on the Jewish or committees
they should be questioned by eleven men
none of whom seem to be particularly
sensitive and so it is they do not they
simply want this to go away as fast as
possible and it says so much about that
because there is no vote more
consequential that a senator makes than
a Supreme Court nomination this is the
moment there are no takeovers no
dewbacks nothing else this it knows it
so much I get this is one where there
are no do-overs you take this vote and
this person won't be on the court for
decades it's not even like a major piece
of legislation which can be amended over
time and they are doing this with
expressly trying to know as little as
possible and they're at risk of putting
on the court to be the deciding vote on
overturning Roe vs. Wade a man who has
been credibly accused of sexual assault
you would think that you would this
would be the one the one constitutional
responsibility they would take
seriously but instead they are treating
it as if it is just something to get
done so they can get that lunch order I
mean even putting the morality of this
aside which I only do because we have
not seen a lot of evidence of morality
from the Republican Party since Donald
Trump became
or much before that just from a pure
political standpoint you know I've seen
both liberals and a few conservatives
right this like why wouldn't you want if
you truly believed that Brett Kavanaugh
is innocent if you believe him when he
says this never happened but why
wouldn't you want a full investigation
to clear his name as best you can so
that when you ultimately take the vote
then his confirmation is unfirm ur
ground and you and you feel better about
it so then you know like if they if they
rush this vote Monday and more
information comes out or we still just
have the same cloud of suspicion hanging
over it their you know their vote is not
going to be as politically safe as it
would be if they have a full
investigation that you know potentially
exonerates this man it's crazy yeah it
is just if the whole thing is just crazy
late try to like thinking through the
politics of this you're exactly right
the worst possible political scenario
for the Republicans would be they try to
hold this Potemkin hearing on Monday
Kristine core decides not to come for
all the very obvious reasons that it is
not fair impartial and then they have
the vote they confirm them by you know
one vote or Mike Pence breaks the tie
and then we learn more information that
is a devastating political mistake
heading into an election that is 40 some
days away or you do this with leaving
Duke you don't have the hearing you
don't have that independent
investigation you don't do any sort of
due diligence no new information comes
out but it happens on our cloud of
suspicion that's also that politics the
problem the Republicans have is twofold
which is one in the Trump era to believe
a woman credibly accusing a Republican
of sexual assault is to somehow indict
Donald Trump by association for his ally
for the allegation of sexual assault
against him we saw this with Steve Wynn
we see this with Jim Jordan and what he
is supposed to have been knowledgeable
of at at Ohio State and up and down we
see this and so
they can't they're unable to take this
seriously because if they ever take it
seriously then it open questions on why
they are not taking the 19 allegations
against Donnell show seriously and then
second there this is there is this win
at all cost by any means necessary sort
of ethos that dominates the Republicans
that that somehow it would be a sign of
weakness that would deflate the base to
simply swap out Brett Kavanaugh for some
other white male right-wing ideologue
federal Society of proves judge there's
a whole list of them just pick one
there's a whole list solar power it is
an inexhaustible I mean and also so I
mean what are the consequences of
Republicans slowing this down a little
bit to conduct this investigation why
are they in such a hurry Dan there are
not there are none unless your view is
the longer we wait before the vote is
the more likely more informations come
out against Brett Kavanaugh but they
there was I hate the same but this is
not a question about getting this done
before the election or red light the
Prophet like McConnell gives to
about processing norms so that he could
very easily know this from Merrick
garland you can easily swap Cavan all
out put someone else up next week have a
judiciary one week after that and vote
after that he doesn't care and all of
the protestations from the Democrat in
your editorial board about how this is a
 process he doesn't care the
Republicans don't care all he wants he
can put a robot on the court if he would
vote for corporations don't return more
anyway he does not give a who it is
the home the whole thing is so weird
Brett Kavanaugh no one cares what Brett
Kavanaugh has a right to due process in
a criminal proceeding of course it does
not really have a right to due process
in whether he gets we have Supreme Court
on the Supreme Court he doesn't have a
right to be on the Supreme Court the
Senate has a responsibility to decide
they put the best person possible on the
Supreme Court and when there are
question
those questions may be unanswerable as
they may be in this case then the right
thing to do is to step aside and put
someone else in and if not Brett
Kavanaugh or bust they can put anyone
else in but they are making a conscious
decision to put someone on the court to
be the deciding vote on Roe vs. Wade who
may be guilty of sexual assault yes
there's so much about what is happening
here that is a microcosm that explains
the Republican Party in that in the
Trump era in every way possible and
again if the reason they're not swapping
him out is because they think to
themselves you know what I truly believe
this man is innocent
I believe this he is being smeared here
then you would think they would say okay
we're gonna go through another FBI
background check we're gonna have the
FBI subpoena various witnesses instead
of just Brett Kavanaugh and dr. Blasi
Ford so we're gonna do this and we're
gonna find all the facts that we can and
even if the discovery of all those facts
and through all those interviews we
cannot conclusively decide what happened
here at least we will have done our due
diligence to say we tried to figure out
everything we could and then we convert
on that but the fact that they're not
even doing that but they refused to do
that so far it's very telling I mean do
you think do you think that they're
worried that if it goes too long the
Democrats will potentially take the
Senate in the midterms because that
seems to be you know Lindsey Graham sort
of gave away the game yesterday when he
tweeted that you know this is all about
delaying this until after the midterm so
that if Democrats you know take the
Senate they have an advantage but of
course even if we take the Senate I
would not be surprised at all in fact I
would expect that Mitch McConnell would
try to jam through yet another nominee
during the lame-duck session between
November and January
you know wouldn't wouldn't you expect
that of course of course now that would
obviously lay bare the utter
was the basis for his argument for why
Merrick garland shouldn't be confirmed
because if your argument right the
voters should decide and we therefore
recap we must leave the Supreme Court
with an empty seat for nearly a year so
that because we have no coming election
then confirming a concern of Justice
three weeks after the Democrats took the
Senate would lay that bare but also
McConnell doesn't care about that he
does not care and so like this does not
this would not put he would so have even
if it would be uh insincere it was just
sort of funny he's in the same sentence
McConnell but even though the insincere
and lacking integrity he would have the
power inability to put that justice on
the court and he would be under
tremendous pressure from the right wing
to do so I wonder if he thinks that in
that scenario Jeff Flake bob Corker who
were quite literally on their way out
the door at that point because they'll
have their you know not running for
election they retired will you know
Blanche at him trying to jam through a
nominee in the lame duck I just can't
figure that I mean like do we there is
nothing we could do to stop them in a
lame-duck session Democrats from
nominating other Justice correct correct
no procedural things that we could pull
yeah it would be about corker flake
Collins Murkowski and the more and more
you like this you're creating more of
her permission structure for them to say
no right now senators who are who have
lost their reelection or undecided or
headed to retirement usually end up
voting with the or more likely to vote
with McConnell because they're all
applying for jobs at Republican law
lobbying firms and they tanks at that
time so I wouldn't I'm not we'd not been
a lot of money on the integrity of labor
McConnell in that moment or any moment
frankly yep
Brian boiler was saying to me that it
would did voting against him in the lame
duck would jeopardize their right wing
wingnut welfare program when they leave
and get a good job from like the
Heritage Foundation or or you know the
Koch brothers or something like that so
what happens if doctor Blasi Ford does
not testify
on Monday or the Republic it seems as if
the Republicans are just planning to say
 it we're gonna hold the vote this
is done is that what's gonna happen yeah
it seems that way as of right now on
Thursday morning it seems that they will
not make Cavanaugh testify about this
under oath uh yeah yeah dr. Ford is not
gonna be there and look it does seem you
so julissa now Latinos are often viewed
as newcomers to America
here's think we've talked about this
Latinos have always been here even
before the USA became a country so
educate us a little bit when and how did
Latinos come to the United States are
you ready for some knowledge you ready
for me to drop me all right so yeah like
it bothers me so much when people are
like when people even even progressives
talk about Latinos as newcomers like the
newcomers the new generation of
Americans and I'm like no we're not a
new generation of Americans we've we've
always been here before like you said
there was even a USA mm-hmm so Latinos
like including mestizos and indigenous
people and and Latinos that that our
descendants of African countries
explored North America almost a century
before British colonizers found it
Jamestown oh that's a long time before
people yeah a couple years no it's like
centuries before so the u.s. became a
country in 1776 as we know from our US
history Isleton and Hamilton so Spanish
conquistadors made landfall in st.
Augustine in 1565 so that was centuries
before the u.s. became a country yeah
and so therefore Spanish was the was the
first European language that was spoken
here now there's all sorts of things
that are wrong with even that because as
we know you know they were still
colonizers and they still came here and
and tried to kill all sorts of
indigenous people right but there were
languages before English that were
spoken here one of which was Spanish and
before that there were like tons of
indigenous languages that were spoken
here so it's not like it's not like when
the u.s. became a country this land just
like up here there are people who were
already living here was the worst
exactly and some of those people that
were living here already were Mexicans
right so like fast-forward to the
mexican-american war and Mexico lost in
that war and there's all sorts of
devices to why Mexico lost in that war
but we won't get it this is like you
know from my Mexican history books but
when when that
happen almost half of what is now the
United States in terms of land was
Mexican land and then it became part of
the United States because Mexico lost
the war and when that happened believe
it or not the Mexican territory that
became the United States came with
Mexicans in it what there were Mexicans
living here already Mexicans in Mexico
right and indigenous people yes in what
was Mexico amazing that this is a shock
to admit to Americans you know to modern
to modern Americans I think we just like
to forget like I think we just like to
start the history of the United States
in 1776 and forget about everything that
happened before then I'm queen right but
it's still not even clean because even
then you know when when Mexico became
part of of what is now the United States
there are Mexicans that were living
there that were given a choice to stay
in what would be now America North
America United States or to go to go to
Mexico what was then Mexico okay and a
lot of people chose to stay because
guess what people didn't want to move
moving sumbitch it is it you just move I
just moved I have Spock's is still
called so many boxes they keep
reproducing every day I come home and
I'm like why they're 40 more boxes I
didn't there's junk in it I don't need
it I should have thrown things away but
if I'm in an you know if I'm a human
being during this time I don't want to
leave why should I pick up and move
right because you've always been there
and people made you promises people made
promises to you that if you stayed
because that area in Texas California
New Mexico they were not very heavily
populated areas and so as the US was
trying to grow and expand they wanted
people to be there and so because those
places were not heavily populated they
said you know what there's people there
already let's keep those people and
we're gonna tell them that they can keep
their land but what happened is that
those Mexicans who stayed that who were
land owners all of a sudden there were
all these proclamations that were made
in English and they didn't speak English
because you don't just learn how to
speak English from one day to the next
there's no rosetta stone y'all right and
even if there was like it still takes
time you know and you're like wait
language like I everybody around me
speak Spanish because we're Mexican so
there's their languages were being held
were being used against them yes because
all this proclamations were made that
basically said in order for you to keep
your land that we promised you could
keep you have to not fill out all this
paperwork you have to go to court you
have to go through this whole process
that you have no idea because you don't
speak English so you can read you can
read that huh
so all of these Mexicans lost their land
they became homeless and they became
foreigners in their own land uh-huh and
that's why people think we're newcomers
but we're not our land was stolen from
us and before that it was stolen from
indigenous people boom that's that's a
history right there guys and it's
something we don't talk often enough
about it's actually pretty succinct when
you think about it I mean you just sum
that up very quickly and I think it's
it's it's just kind of it's deeply
deeply emotional to think about the fact
that our culture's are in many ways
being erased and being condemned I mean
something you know I think I think we
see on a daily basis as Latin Americans
and I think you know I think it's also
are like we also have to take it upon
ourselves to learn some of that history
absolutely because this this history
isn't being taught in schools you know
and so and so people don't know and if
you don't know where you came from then
it becomes difficult to have a vision
for where we're going all right right
and I mean like there's a few other
things that I learned as I was doing as
I've just became I've just become
fascinated with with the deep rich
history of Latinos Latin X communities
in America but you know they're like I
think even even with like Puerto Ricans
for example people don't realize that
Puerto Ricans are US citizens and it's
not like it happened yesterday
Puerto Ricans gained citizenship back in
1917 and you wouldn't know because of
how we've treated Puerto Ricans with you
know with Maria with Hurricane Maria and
the the devastation that happened there
and like your president Truong didn't
give a about them and this even
saying there was an unsung success like
I mean because 3,000 people didn't die
cuz that's just a democratic lie thank
you so much for that
right and Bob Menendez was like you know
what President Trump you're right
the hurricane didn't kill killed three
thousand people your botched response
killed three thousand people boom Bob
fire I love that you know even though we
have like very little representation in
Congress like I think we also have to
look back and and and and realize that
yes we're not where we should be but we
also do have a history of being in
Congress at first senator the first
Latino senator to serve in Congress
served in Congress in 1928 in New Mexico
in New Mexico interesting so let's learn
our history yeah and like there's just
there's precedent for the kinds of
positions of power that we often
disassociate with Hispanic identity and
the positions that we view now is like
icons for us that are that are yet to be
achieved we're here we are out here but
we're just not out here and the numbers
that I think are reflective of our of
our population seventy eight percent of
us our citizens and can vote and we
should vote and I don't know why you
people don't vote so get out to vote
well that's one of our big goals here
with this with this show because we want
to make sure that we're mobilizing all
of you Latinos out there all of you
younger people all of you allies out
there who are listening to this as well
this is the most pivotal time to
register and to get out and vote because
if we harness the power of the Latino
vote we can impact these elections in
ways that are rather unexpected at this
point but the way you talk about Julie
so the idea that we have been here for a
long time I hope will instill in our
Latino audience members out there a
sense of pride and a sense of belonging
and a reminder that you do matter and
that you are eligible to vote if you're
a citizen here and that you should
exercise that right because a lot of us
stay at home a whole lot of a stay at
home we should actually find the
statistic on what that is but if more of
us actually got out to the voting booths
we would make a huge difference you know
when we were going through this through
this like all of this like historical
facts like I know I just recently
learned about all these things like
within the last two years yet I really
start to think about what what are
what's the history of my people in the
country yeah
I'm wondering do you I mean we've talked
about how you know for many of us Latino
it's like we want to be a
and Latino yeah and in some of us even
will hide like our Latino identity do
you think that that's in part because we
don't know our history in this country
so we so we feel like if people know
we're let you know they're gonna see us
as newcomers completely I have a couple
thoughts on that so first of all I
believe that it's not just about a lack
of education of the background of
Latinos in the United States but it's
also the influence of media and pop
culture on us that teaches us somehow
implicitly that Latinos are less than
that Latinos are the other and that if
you are going to be a Latino in media or
in politics from business you have to be
attractive as a woman and you'll
probably be a cartel member as a guy
there's certain stereotypes that seem to
be perpetually I mean I'm I'm pretty fit
that definition of a latina that's very
true
that's very true hyper sexualized
julissa over here and by the way one
thing about our identity that I want to
get into is our personal relationships
with being mexican-american because
Julius and I you and I actually very
different points of entry to the United
States and I think of different
relationships with that with that term
mexican-american I mean I can say for me
I I was born in Pampa Texas I was raised
in Houston Texas
I consider myself mexican-american but
for a long time I denied that I was
Hispanic and tried to pass essentially
is like Italian and for for a long time
I mean like for the first maybe seven
years of my life and this was something
that I didn't do because my parents had
any lack of pride and being and being
Hispanic or being Latino but because I
looked at the media and I looked at the
people that I went to school with and
nobody was Hispanic and Mexicans were
often referred to with derogatory terms
it didn't seem cool and because you know
one thing we'll get into is is colorism
and passing for white and what what
having different skin tones can do for a
Latina person but because I look kind of
ethnically ambiguous I sort of leaned
into that and it took me a long time and
it took a wave of pop culture embracing
Latins in entertainment and in politics
for me to come to terms with and accept
and learn to love my
background it's been a journey for me as
I think it's probably been a journey for
a lot of our listeners out there for a
lot of Latinos out there and that's
something we want to you know discuss so
so that's kind of my relationship with
my understanding of being
mexican-american Julisa tell us a little
bit about yeah I mean I have the note by
on my forehead you know as I say like I
mean you look at me and you're like yeah
she's Mexican I mean I think some people
will sometimes be like are you Filipino
and that's because you know the
Philippines was also calling us by Spain
and therefore they have spanish names
and and so we can look somewhat similar
but yeah but for the most part I mean I
have been chin up I like you can tell
him I mean I'm Mexican right and you
write that I did have a very different
experience because I grew up in Mexico
and I grew up being very proud of being
Mexican and so when I came to the US
when I was 11 and I was in school and
all of a sudden kids were trying to
bully me because I was Mexican I was
kind of like what do you mean like I'm
like you know warrior Astec princess
yeah you're making fun of my long hair
and like my hair is beautiful
I get extensions to get your hair
looking fly like my like no so I I've
always been very proud of being Mexican
however when you're in middle school and
you know I'm gonna when you're in middle
school people are mean and you want to
have friends and so therefore everything
about my identity I want it to be
American and in my mind what it meant to
be American was to be like an
all-american cheerleader blonde girl
like that was the image I had of what an
all-american girl looks like and part of
the reason I wrote this someone like me
book is because I won kids that age six
seven eighth grade to read books and
feel like their stories are so
important that there's books written
above that no but but yeah so like I did
have a different experience because I
love to be in Mexican and then when I
got here I felt like I had to I had to
like oppress all of those parts of me to
be to be included in America
and then of course for me there was this
extra layer of like I was undocumented
so I really really wanted to pass for
American like I had to learn how to hide
and I had to learn how to hide behind my
good English and my academic
accomplishments and my pom-poms right
because because I didn't want anybody to
suspect that I was undocumented right so
there is like a whole lot of to
unpack there is and there's a lot of
range of what it means to be a Latino in
the u.s. too and that's part of my
Julius and I are so excited to do this
this the show and explore this over the
next four episodes because we know that
Latinos out there who were listening to
this everybody's got a unique journey to
how they came about how they become
became Latin American and the United
States and Julia and I represent just
two of those stories but what's
important is that we not try to you know
falsely identify one way or another I
think I would be like for example
Spanish is is in our relationship with
Spanish too is another way that we kind
of identify it's a point of entry for
our ethnicity I for example grew up
speaking both languages in my house but
I'm definitely I would say I'm fluent in
Spanish and not fully bilingual by any
means having like an entire conversation
an entire interview in Spanish would be
more of a challenge trying to be funny
in Spanish by the way so much like
there's never been a moment that I feel
happier and more excited than when I
tell a joke in Spanish which I think has
happened twice once was that a 99-cent
store seven years ago and I still
remember the woman's face I don't even
know what the joke was but I was like I
just told a joke in Spanish and I felt
so excited you know and and and we also
have the the influence of our parents as
well and so like I will say - my parents
came to the States
well their relationships with being
mexican-american are very intriguing as
well I'm sure we'll unpack some of that
but my parents and my three older
brothers came to the States in the 70s
and their relationship to the US was one
of trying to assimilate as quickly as
possible as well so any any cultural
touchstone that they could attach
themselves to they did I know my brother
Rene is a big fan of oh you football for
instance because when they lived in
Oklahoma the way the Sooners the Sooners
you really hook em horns oh boy okay
that's yeah I know I actually I saw the
Sooners play at the Rose Bowl this past
year it was a lot of fun did they lose
yes
that's what happens when your sooner fan
I know you know who won the 2005
national championship at the Rose Bowl
tell me do the Texas Longhorns greatest
football game ever this is this is just
gonna be like a stand for the Longhorns
yeah his whole podcast is gonna be an
ode to it and and my brothers like
relationship with the Sooners is so
interesting cuz there's a kid the only
language that he spoke that was similar
to the kids that he went to school with
was football so for him like the part of
what was really cool to go to the Rose
Bowl last year what made a very cool was
that he was he is now in his in his 40s
he's older than I am he went with a
group of friends that like all white
friends that he's been friends with
since he was a kid and it's really
interesting seeing that relationship
evolve but anyway I bring up sports
because I think it's another point of
entry for identified I mean if the cover
of my other cover of my book is me doing
the splits and it's really now I really
because I really thought that if I could
be a cheerleader and if I could
understand sports that that would that
has always been my entry to America by
the way like when I was in high school
living in San Antonio being a Spurs fan
I couldn't talk about any pop culture
references because I wasn't allowed to
watch MTV because my parents thought
that I would get pregnant you watch the
real world basically so I was not
allowed to watch MTV I didn't grow up
watching you know my husband all the
time
anytime he makes a reference to like a
movie he watched when he was a kid and
I'm like I've never seen that movie he
you never had a childhood but so I
couldn't talk about those things but I
could talk about Avery Johnson and the
Admiral and Tim Duncan and I could talk
about the statistics of the game and and
fast forward to my time at Goldman Sachs
there was abundance people about golf I
couldn't talk to people about going to
ski and or house in the Hamptons
for the summer eventually I did because
eventually I did all those things yeah
you did
what I could talk to people about was
about football right and the fact that I
could speak football it gave me a way
into
America and culture you know for a lot
of people being Latino or Latin X or
Hispanic I was trying to like the the
term Hispanic less and less like every
time I say it yeah weenus I'm saying it
right now we're gonna unpack the
differences between those words too by
the way because there are big
differences yeah yeah but for a lot of
people do they think that all of these
terms are also interchangeably with
Mexican Oh totally and even with them
Latino community people get really mad
when they get calls Mexican really I'm
not a Mexican I am Colombian or Honduran
and like I too get offended when people
say that because I'm like being Mexican
is not a bad thing but I understand that
when you're not Mexican and you get
called to Mexican and Mexican stories
and narrative tends to take over the
whole Latino conversation like I can

it love it there you go
all right we've got some very big news
to talk about today uh dr. Christine
Blasi Ford a California professor who
grew up in the DC area has come forward
to say that when she was in high school
she was sexually assaulted by Supreme
Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Ford who
in July wrote to both members of
Congress and called The Washington Post
says that Cavanaugh and a friend once
forced her into a bedroom after they'd
been heavily drinking at a party the
Cavanaugh then pinned her to a bed
covered her mouth to stop her from
screaming and tried to take off her
clothes while his friend watch Ford told
the Post quote I thought he might
inadvertently kill me and says that she
first spoke about the incident in detail
in 2012 when she and her husband were in
couples therapy that therapist recorded
notes that were reviewed by the post
after they were shared by Ford they
don't mention Kavanagh by name but
described him and they largely tracked
the story that Ford has shared her
husband also recalls Ford using
Cavanaugh's name during those therapy
sessions on the advice of the attorney
she has hired Debra Katz
Ford has also taken a polygraph test
administered by a former FBI agent the
results concluded she was being
truthful both she and Brett Cavanaugh
said Monday they're willing to testify
about the matter before senators and
just before we started recording we have
learned that there will be a hearing on
Monday and that the vote that was
supposed to be held the committee vote
on Thursday and the Judiciary Committee
has been postponed so that on Monday at
the very least both for dr. Ford and
Brett Kavanaugh can go before the
Judiciary Committee and answer questions
Tommy let's start with the timeline of
these allegations because some
Republicans are calling this whole thing
an eleventh-hour
accusation orchestrated by Democrats how
can they even begin to say this with a
straight face I know I mean one thing to
know just if you've worked in government
I think you get a sense for how hard and
unlikely this to orchestrate a real
conspiracy like that's a that's what
they're alleging the Dianne Feinstein
received a letter from this place before
the the accuser in this instance and sat
on it through the confirmation hearings
for some reason to disclose it the
Sunday before the vote the vote itself
that is undercut by the number of data
points like the first being that this
woman reached out to the Washington Post
in early July she reached out to her
Congress woman's office and sent them
through them sent a letter to senator
Feinstein she didn't initially want to
go public because of exactly what we're
seeing happen now people attacking her
character her credibility accusing this
of being a partisan attack and so she
reluctantly decided to go forward what's
her name leaked out so all these
allegations are very easily undercut by
the facts that are already in the public
domain yeah love it it seems like the
timeline can be explained at least in
part nor a large part by dr. Ford's
reluctance to come forward which is
really understandable and very common
among victims of sexual assault
especially coming forward when the
alleged perpetrator is in the public
spotlight right now and you know all the
political bull back that comes with that
it isn't that why senator Feinstein and
congresswoman Eshoo didn't reveal the
allegations to the Judiciary Committee
earlier yeah that's what that's what it
looks like and I think there are some
people have been critical of Feinstein
there
about the way she handled inside of the
committee what is hard to argue with is
that the idea that we know this because
of Feinstein I think is just not true it
seems we actually know this despite what
Diane Feinstein did out of respect for
the request in the letter itself and
this is I think worth putting in the
context of what happens when a woman
makes a credible allegation a woman who
by all accounts is not a woman they have
trouble attacking the credibility of
without knowing more it is much easier
for them to say oh this is some kind of
a Feinstein Schumer plot because it's
easy to attack their political
adversaries it is much harder to attack
this woman and so they're saying oh this
is a an eleventh hour an eleventh hour
attack it's coordinated right before the
committee vote when the only reason we
know about this at all it's not because
of Dianne Feinstein er or or Ana su we
know about this because of reporting in
the Washington Post no and and we know
that these interviews took place in July
was a it was up to the woman it was up
to dr. Ford to decide when her name was
used and finally she allowed it after so
many details that already come out and
now that we have now that the post has
reviewed the therapists notes she
brought it up in two thousand and twelve
years before Brett Kavanaugh was
nominated to the Supreme Court so that's
you know that's quite a plot to hatch
and one other one other piece of this
too is the other person involved in this
is this guy mark judge mark judge was
asked about this allegation he is
clearly under an incredible amount of
pressure to say it didn't happen to join
Kavanaugh in denouncing it completely
but he has said twice now I have no
recollection which is not a denial
especially when we know that Mark judge
wrote a book about being blacked out and
drunk for much of his youth so the fact
that we now have these we have 2012
reports of this happening we have this
woman on the record making this
allegation we have the other person
potentially involved refusing to
outright deny it took place I mean that
is that is a lot you have credible
evidence I also I thought the most or
the most heartbreaking parts of the
Washington Post
worried about this read by late August
for to decided not to come forward
calculating the doing so would upend her
life and probably would not affect
Cavanaugh's confirmation and she said
quote why suffer through the
annihilation if it's not going to matter
so she she was ready in it by even as
late as August had decided I don't think
I'm gonna do this because I'm gonna get
all this blowback it's gonna be an
extremely painful experience and these
Republicans probably aren't going to do
anything about it which you can
completely understand her thinking you
can t understand I mean it's the
response has been so terrible
I mean Orrin Hatch right out of the gate
said I believe him he's a person of
immense integrity I've known him for a
long time and then he pivoted to be hard
for senators to not consider who he is
today because that is the issue right so
he's already not only saying he doesn't
believe her and believe her allegations
he's pivoting to but even if they're
true I care about who he is today so
they're dismissing these allegations out
of hand yeah I mean let's talk about
Bret Cavanaugh's response which has been
to categorically deny that the incident
ever took place saying quote this is a
completely false allegation I've never
done anything like what the accuser
describes to her or to anyone he also
reportedly told Orrin Hatch that he
denies being at the party in question
and that Ford might have mixed him up
with someone else and then his use I
love it you know Mike judge who was Marc
judge sorry who was the other person in
the room says he has no recollection how
credible is Brett Cavanaugh's denial
here Brett Kavanaugh has repeatedly lied
under oath about matters far less
serious than this he has dissembled
around nominations that he is hanging
his hat on the fact that he didn't
officially handle but did work on he
repeatedly lied under oath about his
involvement in the spying scandal
involving leaked documents from the
Senate Judiciary Committee I mean this
is somebody who again and again has
decided probably because he is a
partisan Republican operative that you
say whatever it takes to get through the
crisis of the
that's what he did when he's nominated
in 2004 that's what he did in 2006 that
is what he's doing right now first words
his first words as the Supreme Court
nominee no president has ever consulted
more widely or talked to more people
from more backgrounds to seek input for
Supreme Court nominations I realize this
is a silly little lie a ridiculous
exaggeration but it's easily provable
that Donald everyone knew that Donald
Trump selected Brett Kavanaugh off a
list that he was given from the
Federalist Society he did not consult a
lot of people so it's like and a bunch
of people said this at the time like why
would Brett Kavanaugh lie about
something so he's like so obviously
untrue he is a political operative you
know he came up as this overzealous ken
starr acolyte and now you know he will
say and do anything he takes to get
confirmed it's interesting it's
interesting that he is flat denying this
incident ever occurred because it seemed
very knowable if you were at a party
with a big group of people it seems
there was a this mark judge character
was apparently there that he's not
denying it completely says he doesn't
recall the incident so they should call
him forward and have him testify under
oath well that gets to your earlier
point on me which you know you have a
lot of Republicans and a lot of
Republican pundits out there saying oh
well you know this was something that
happened when he was a teenager years
ago and how can you be judged for that
it's like it's not as if this happened
and Brett Kavanaugh said you know I was
at a party I was pretty drunk I don't
remember exactly what happened and who
know you know I I don't remember it like
she did he's not even doing any of that
showed no remorse no contrition he's
saying absolutely not I didn't pray what
it didn't happen so basically that the
point is not you know whether or not he
should be forgiven for what he did years
ago which people can debate the point is
that he is either lucky it either
happened and if it happened he's lying
about it right and he's lying about it
over and over again all ari fleischer a
bunch of people on the right are out
there saying boy if we're all judged by
what we did in high school no one will
ever be confirmed to another job in
government again and like it just it's
so amazing that they're saying that
because they're assuming he did do it
and there then excusing him lying about
it under oath it's
like we're not talking about a legal
proceeding we're not talking about a
statute of limitations these are all
things that exist noticing you should be
judged forever by what you did at 17 but
what we're talking about is do you
deserve to be on the highest court in
the land the position that requires the
most integrity of any other job you
could imagine absolutely not
also by the way we're not talking about
roughhousing as some of them said we're
not talking about Aaron Rodgers you know
we're talking about attempted rape yeah
attempted rape and it's like there's few
things more serious than that and let's
also uh we have a Supreme Court with
many people on it okay this doesn't
happen every time a Supreme Court
justice is nominated this doesn't happen
didn't happen when Gorsuch well does
nominate how to win Elena Kagan right
was nominated a lot of comer Kratz are
just they do this every time they're
gonna have these allegations every time
no none of us wanted Gorsuch on the
court that was a stolen Supreme Court
seat that should have been Merrick
garland see there was no allegations
against Neil Gorsuch and also I just the
other thing about it is so galling the
again and again when Republicans when
people in power when when white people
are accused of things they are kids for
 ever that this is a youthful
indiscretion Don juniors just a kid even
there was a 40 year old man tweeting
like a but true but but
but when a black person has gunned down
when a black kid has gunned down
they're adults Donald Trump thinks 14 15
and six year old accused of rape now we
know are innocent he said that he
thought they should get the death
penalty so being the fact that certain
people in their eyes are adults from the
time their 13-year old
but people like Brett cab and all the
people that look like they're kids that
live in the enclaves that they're used
to traveling and these are kids that
make mistakes and deserve a second
chance and we see that and that's a big
deal because that inflow that affects a
lot of what we see that goes not that
has to do with more than just this
hearing that has to do what happens when
that guy Brock Turner is sends just a
few months when he committed an
incredibly disgusting crime at Stanford
so that's you know really gone and the
other thing too is it is amazing who
these guys choose to identify with this
idea of like oh nobody will make it
through Commission through committee or
bob Corker being like man may be
terrifying to have something like this
happen to me
it is incredible how often we see people
unable to identify with a victim much
more likely to identify it with someone
accused because they have they lack the
imagination and empathy to put them in
the she put themselves in the shoes of
someone making the accusation but they
find it much easier to understand what
it might feel like to be accused
themselves and also this Club enos in
Washington that is the same kind of club
enos that led to you know alt some
democratic lawyers and other people in
Washington establishment people saying
well I've known Brett Kavanaugh for a
long time and he's a nice guy and it's
like okay maybe there's plenty of people
you know who could be perfectly nice
people at the g8 meeting and the carpool
line yes you know and we wake up this
morning and this group the judicial
crisis network is announced that they're
running 1.5 million dollars worth of ads
to support the Cavanaugh nomination this
is an organization that just mops up
money from big donors that want to gut
regulations or whatever that is run by
guess who a former clerk for Clarence
Thomas piece of it it's cyclical
it is so gross and it's backed by like
big-money corporate interests as well
it's just a stir so let's talk about the
reaction to this news from the White
House and Senate Republicans who were
bit divided on how to handle this today
Trump unsurprisingly is standing behind
Cavanaugh though on Monday he was
surprisingly restrained when he told
reporters quote we want to go through a
full process here everybody out and if
it takes a little delay it takes a
little delay this came of course after
Republican senators Jeff Flake and barb
corker both said they'd be uncomfortable
voting YES on Cavanaugh's nomination
without hearing from Christine Ford and
investigating the allegations and now of
course there will be a hearing next week
even though McConnell John Cornyn Chuck
Grassley didn't want either Ford or
Cavanaugh to testify publicly they
wanted to do phone calls and they didn't
want to delay the committee vote
McConnell went so far as to blame
Democrats were pushing this allegation
and complained that Democrats aren't
quote following standard bipartisan
process and regular order could you hear
more American could you hear Merrick
garland screaming all the way from DC
when McConnell said that
you see that and it just it hurts your
chest because it's just you don't even
want to have to do the work of
explaining even to your own mind why it
makes you want to explode
because it is so hypocritical crazy well
this is but this is how this is how
Republicans have come to justify this -
so you know well the three of us and Dan
all at once all started tweeting about
Mitch McConnell when he said this and
how crazy it was right and I saw a
number of Republican pundits reply to
and they're like cocaine Mitch strikes
again like they're all like they think
they loved it they think it's something
like they have all internalized the fact
this is a very special pod save the
world episode for me because the echo
chamber has officially moved West Ben
Rhodes now a Los Angeles resident is
sitting in studio it could media Global
HQ Ben yes it's so great to actually see
your face when we're talking yeah the
entire infrastructure of the echo
chamber is back in my iPhone now let's
explain to people for one second what
the hell I'm talking about there was a
New Yorker story which we briefly
mentioned on pot save America that
talked about our Trump's national
security staff actually circulated a
memo that was written like an assessment
of a foreign insurgent network you are
running the echo chamber along with
Colin Col who is Biden's national
security adviser but the the broader
network encoded me Pfeifer Favreau some
others loved it was a little upset he
was left out we won't get into that what
did you make of this stupid memo well
you know there were a couple of strange
things about it yeah described Colin as
the operations chief feel I kind of like
Al Qaeda's number three like that keeps
getting whacked I think what was weird
about it is you know first they really
did write about us as if we were al
Qaeda and so people who should be
spending their time at work like
thinking writing about okay yeah I'm
ready my cut are going and thinking
about us and the mindset is that we
really are an enemy of the state just
like the media is to trump I should know
yeah we're recording this on 9/11 like
they really should be thinking I mean
the national security stuff yeah they
should not be viewing people who are
basically just expressing opposition to
Trump as an enemy the other thing that
was strange and reading it is they they
wrote it they must they seem to believe
this you know like they seem to actually
believe that you know there's there's a
constant plot to you know kind of
overthrow or undermine the government
when really it's just people expressing
opposition to Trump's policies and it
just shows you how deeply embedded the
kind of conspiracy theory mindset is in
the White House and that's very people
should understand like that's very
abnormal
you know we had lots of critics we
didn't sit around in national security
meetings and write memos you know
viewing Breitbart as like the enemy of
this state you know
aiming to overthrow the government I'll
say personally your viewers may not your
sorry your listeners may not remember
the black cube thing a bunch of Israeli
former Mossad guys hired to dig up dirt
on me and call and call and our families
and they contacted our wives what was
striking to me is that this memo
mirrored exactly what came out in that
black cube thing me and Collin as the
leaders of some echo chamber aiming to
undermine Trump so to me the forensics
are pretty obvious yet this memo was
kind of the point of origin of whatever
effort ultimately led to that and
similarly as with so many things we see
today the idea of hiring you know
foreign spies to essentially undermine
your political opponents United States
that's not normal no and it speaks to
again an administration in a White House
that you know is so profoundly outside
of what people should expect in our
country in our democracy they see
legitimate dissent as intolerable they
see the media's intolerable and they're
essentially even though they're inside
the most powerful building and
institution in the world you know they
still feel like they have this
conspiracy theory minded chip on their
shoulder yeah I mean right I mean it
seems clear to me a couple of things I
don't know this for sure but it seems
clear to me that Seb Gorka had a hand
writing this memo and you made the point
on our ongoing text chain that he had
literally nothing else to do sitting
around us good go to meetings so he's
reading our tweets and the memo said
like these are the people who you know
attacked Seb Gorka for being an
anti-semite because like i retweeted a
ford article about yeah how he belonged
to a nice somatic organization Tempe
render I mean just the the
self-absorption to see everything
through a prism of how it affects
yourself when you're suppose
to again be in a job where you're
looking out for the whole country you
know is is deeply deeply strange yeah so
there's that weird part I mean there's
there's the very strong likelihood that
this a national security staff product
was fed to a shadowy group of former
intelligence operatives I mean is there
is there a precedent for something like
that or their implications that you
think people should understand of how
kind of serious that actually is we want
to make fun of it because it sucks yeah
I mean I
it led clearly to a bunch of stuff I
mean people may remember the Devin Nunez
stunt right yep where he claimed that he
had this information that you know Susan
Rice and I were unmasking Trump
officials and it turns out I didn't ask
anybody and but it you know the it led
to all of this effort to throw up you
know dust to say you know what Obama
wiretap Trump Tower the reality is this
is not how the US government should
function and the reason it should be
concerning you know number one it sends
a pretty chilling message it's the same
thing of yanking Brennen security
clearance and two people in the
government yeah right who are not like
us who are actually you know career
people Foreign Service people
intelligence analysts you know that if
you deviate from you know some fuel T to
trump you you might be punished right
there might be foreign spies hired to
dig up dirt on you you wrote this op-ed
god knows what apparatus the
intelligence community's gonna come
after you you're threatening them at the
podium exactly and that is what
authoritarian governments do you know
they they come into power and they purge
their enemies they punish their enemies
they harass their enemies
that's what's unprecedented here is that
it will potentially have a chilling
effect on the advice that comes to trump
and people's willingness to speak truth
to power inside of government you know
that that the ability of Congress to
conduct oversight because the
Republicans have essentially signed on
to this project so it leads to you know
really a lack of accountability inside
of the government and frankly a chilling
effect on the ability of
to raise their voices in opposition to
what the government is doing yeah um
weird article okay so like I said
today's the anniversary of 9/11 we'll
release this on September 12th over the
weekend the Los Angeles Times had a
story where they assessed 17 years after
9/11 attacks
what is the strength of al Qaeda and
they suggest that al Qaeda might
actually be stronger than ever and I
wondered what your take on that was if
you saw that piece yeah I saw it I mean
I I don't I don't think that's right
because you have to separate out two
things here
how much is there support for extremism
and violent extremism as you know
practiced by al Qaeda in different parts
of the world but also how capable is
this terrorist network of carrying out
an attack you know I worked with the
9/11 Commission the the the hijackers
were highly trained individuals who
spent years designing that attack
learning how to fly planes learning the
vulnerabilities in our aviation system
so they could bring box cutters on to
those planes
picking the targets of the World Trade
Center in the Pentagon they were able to
do that because they weren't under
pressure you know they could just sit
there in Pakistan in different parts of
the world and in cells that they had in
places like Germany and planned this
catastrophic attack that capability does
not exist anymore you know those kind of
seasoned terrorists who have time and
space to exploit open societies they're
under a lot of pressure so yes while
there may be a lot of support for the
division of al Qaeda or Isis in
different parts of the Muslim world
there's not that type of network that
has the time and space and frankly
freedom of movement and action to plan
another 9/11 stylet right um the the
peace had some graphics were they
estimated the number of al-qaeda
fighters affiliates in countries like
Syria and Yemen and Libya and Somalia
and to me the common thread there was
like these are failed States there's no
governance there's no jobs there's no
infrastructure there's no army
necessarily in some of the places I mean
Yemen is a
Inchon example because they're getting
bombed constantly Riley there's the
kinetic attacks all day every day with
horrific results is there a lesson that
we should learn from that map about
reorg reorienting counterterrorism
policy towards diplomacy and development
and not just like bombing the out
of a country like Yemen yeah look I
think the really difficult thing for
Americans to recognize is that we got
the response to 9/11 in a lot of ways
wrong yeah you know that it was wrong to
obviously invade Iraq a country that had
nothing to do with 9/11 and essentially
you know blow up you know you know and
put open up the Pandora's box of
sectarian conflict in the heart of the
Middle East I think it's wrong that
we're still in Afghanistan fighting a
war almost 20 years after 9/11 we did
something's right in getting better at
hardening our defenses and going after
Ana pinpoint way terrorist networks but
it's notable you know that we have kept
the threat away from 9/11 style attacks
in the United States
but we've also contributed to the
breaking apart of these states and the
military effort and Yemen being led by
our so-called allies Saudi Arabia is a
case in point look where is that leading
it's not leading anywhere other than to
further breaking apart that country
potentially radicalizing people creating
openings for extremists and so I think
you know at some point we have to make a
pivot away from this kind of permanent
war across the Middle East and and parts
of North Africa towards more diplomatic
approaches because you know if we're
essentially moving from one war to the
next and breaking apart you know any
capacity of these states to govern
themselves either because what we're
doing or because of what Saudi Arabia is
doing you know ultimately you're gonna
have this constant festering sore of
failed States and and uncovering spaces
where yes it may be hard for a terrorist
organization to kind of just hole up and
plant a 9/11 attack for a couple years
but there's going to be fighting there's
going to be radicalization there's going
to be Isis type attacks
in places like Europe or individuals who
are angry about what's happening to
Middle East
commit acts of violence so I think that
you know task for the next Democratic
Congress next Democratic president is
going to be how do we definitively end
these wars and pivot to a more
diplomatic approach coupled with some
counterterrorism capabilities Obama
moved us in that direction by bringing
home you know well over a hundred
thousand troops from Iraq and
Afghanistan but we didn't get all the
way there yeah I want to ask you a
little more about Afghanistan in a
second but before we go to that question
I mean drones you can't talk about
counterterrorism without drones and I
read a lot these days
sort of just state it as a fact that
drone strikes create more terrorists and
they take off the battlefield and at
this point it's been what five years
since I've seen any intelligence on this
stuff so I don't really know the answer
but what's your take on that assertion I
think that I think that there's
something to it you know anybody who can
say with certainty that they know you
know that this you know cause had this
effect in terms of a drone strike it's
hard thing to measure here's what I do
know though is that drones were a useful
tool in taking out like I said kind of
irreplaceable leaders of al-qaeda like
people who had certain skills right they
knew how to make bombs or they had
contacts around the world or they were
financiers of terrorism my worry is once
the US government has a capability like
drones they don't like to give them up
and they can always find a reason well
there's a threat from this place and so
if we don't take these drone strikes
there's gonna be a threat and and we
can't live with that threat and my
concern is what is the plan to phase
these out you know do we need to be
taking you know how do we separate out
extremists who really do merit a
potential drone strike from just these
seem like bad guys so let's take them
out because I think where you do have a
problem is you know take a country like
Pakistan you know we're in this you know
constant situation where you know we're
potentially taking actions to inside a
Pakistan
the local population doesn't like and it
seems to never end and Pakistan
continues to be a bit of not just a bit
a mess continues to have radicalization
in large parts of the country continues
to have a government that cannot really
appear to be working closely with us
because the public in Pakistan is so
angry about drone strikes you know
that's not sustainable for time and so
in these places like Pakistan and Yemen
where there has been a lot of US
counterterrorism activity I do think
over time there needs to be plan to say
we're willing to live with a certain
amount of risk here because continuing
to take drone strikes is going to
continue to turn the local population
against us
and at what point is the value of taking
out some extremists
you know outweighed by the fact that you
know it's not a sustainable model of
security to constantly have a foreign
government the United States you're
taking military action to kill people in
these countries yeah you're talking
about the the point in which smart
counterterrorism policy intersects with
stupid politics in our country and boy
is that a dude and you know you
said in the in the in the White House
it's tough right because you know people
come to you and they say well if you if
you don't do something there could be an
attack right and once somebody says that
to you it's like ah yeah you know you're
thinking well I'll be responsible if
there's an attack and some someday
someone will sit in a congressional
hearing and say well they were warned
that if we don't take this strike in
Yemen you know something bad could
happen and so there's always a reason to
bomb some other country but at a certain
point we have to say it's time to
rethink that approach you know speaking
of rethinking approaches so right after
9/11 9/11 attacks we invaded Afghanistan
we're looking for bin Laden we're trying
to dismantle the al Qaeda Network and we
have been there ever since
yeah 2,200 Americans have been killed we
spent more than eight hundred and forty
billion dollars with a be fighting the
Taliban and paying for relief and
reconstruction which the New York Times
noted is more expensive in current
dollars than the Marshall Plan yeah
which rebuilt Europe after World War two
when you look at that those numbers in
that time frame unbalance was this worth
it
we're we wrong harder question were we
wrong to surge troops in 2009 and
refocus on Afghanistan or
that kind of broken at them I think look
first of all we should be out of
Afghanistan I think this should be a
priority for Democrats they take back
Congress I'd like to see Democratic
candidates for president saying we
should be out of Afghanistan and I look
at this way I was in New York on 9/11 I
saw the World Trade Center you know get
attacked I saw the first tower fall and
you know I I wanted to go get the people
who did this yeah
if somebody had said to me this kind of
angry 24 year old kid you know walking
around the streets in New York on that
day worried about whether I knew anybody
was killed hey we're gonna go in
Afghanistan and we're gonna topple the
Taliban and we're gonna take out Osama
bin Laden and we're gonna take out
essentially all the people responsible
for this I'd say okay that sounds good
if they said oh and by the way we're
also going to still be in Afghanistan 17
years from now trying to prop up a
government fighting constant insurgency
and spending a trillion dollars I think
well that makes no sense I don't think
anybody in the United States would have
thought the bat made sense and a certain
point you have to say we've accomplished
the objective that we went there for we
took out the people who did this we
delivered justice to bin Laden we took
out the Taliban and now it's time to
leave and again there's the same problem
where they'll say well if we leave you
know
the Taliban could come come back and
take over parts of the country they
already have like us being there is not
a stabilizing presence it just is
feeding this perpetual insurgency this
perpetual war there and it's having
we're not accomplish staying is not
accomplishing the thing that people say
will yeah and so I think we were wrong
in I don't think we were wrong to surge
some forces there and to go after al
Qaeda I think we were wrong and not
being clear at defining the acceptable
end point at which point we could get
out right because there were always you
know the Taliban they they're just
people who live there I mean you talked
about assessments of numbers every year
they'd say well the Taliban has twenty
or thirty thousand fighters we were
killing like 10,000 people probably more
than that each year I don't know the
exact number clearly that no but that
number never changed always still it's
always a stalemate and that the fact is
that the
tribal networks of people who live in
Afghanistan and it gonna be fighting to
control the areas where they live the
Taliban is not tried to conduct attacks
against the United States like Al Qaeda
is so it's not our job to eradicate the
Taliban we're not going to do it and we
shouldn't try to do it yeah a
potentially even crazier idea for a war
that has been floated currently we know
from leaks we know from Bob Woodward's
book we know from Trump's own public
statements that he is seriously talking
to his national security team about
invading Venezuela and in fact had to be
talked out of it if you believe some of
the reports now it's a level set of
Venezuela it is a humanitarian disaster
people are starving hospitals have
literally no supplies to use to treat
their patients there is the potential
for a massive refugee crisis in South
America so this is like a huge yeah huge
serious problem but what do you make of
these ideas for a military option for
Venezuela like even even I think Marco
Rubio seems to be seriously considering
I think it's totally insane you know
been Venezuela I mean first of all you
I am here at the Greek Theatre in
beautiful Los Angeles we are backstage
if you hear some drums
that's soundcheck so you should think
that's cool with one of my favorite
artists Jayson visible Jason thank you
for visiting us healing you flyover
country happy to be here LA so I wanna
start with a song you wrote called
elephant because it's just like
beautiful heartbreaking song that you
know if you haven't actually heard it
before you might want to pause play the
song
yeah wait for your song or return to the
podcast after you've dried up your face
it's it's about you know a couple it's
like watching someone you love die of
cancers right right and so I'll never
forget walking home from my office down
Melrose Avenue in LA listening the song
and just weeping like like everybody
else walking down Melrose was doing yeah
there's a lot of reason to cry walking
on motifs but what was amazing about
that moment was it created real empathy
and me for a fictional character and I
think that empathy has been missing in
like political discourse long before
Donald Trump ever came to be and I'm
wondering if there's a way that we can
like steal your mojo and you the empathy
creation magic from artists to fix this
well you know discussion I mean I think
it's better for everybody if we just try
to pretend like we're somebody else
every once in a while you know but yeah
you're right I mean the the Trump thing
would never have happened if we were
still acting like civilized grown
citizens you know I think that that was
probably a result you know not the the
Trump administration is not the disease
it's just a symptom oh yeah you know and
the disease to me is people have really
I don't want to say that they've stopped
caring about each other but I don't know
that they ever really have as much as
they should or as much as we should you
know because I don't believe that this
is as bad as it's been yeah in America I
mean we almost didn't make it all the
other countries in the world were
laughing at us right you know around
around the civil war time saying look at
these guys they just got started and
already they're killing each other and
watching from the bleachers and you know
and we were ourselves to death
and ditches I mean more people died from
diarrhea and the Civil War than anything
else you know and it's it's been worse
right but it's also been a lot better
and and you know I still think of it
like we've fallen a few rungs on a
ladder that we're still trying to climb
you know but yeah I think part of the
problem is the idea of delayed
gratification is really I think hard for
people to grasp I think it's a lot
easier for people to say you know the
the low-hanging fruit conundrum for
people to say this is right in front of
me so I'm gonna take it rather than
really realizing and I'm not talking
about like uh a financial system I'm not
saying people should be socialist or
communist that's a different
conversation but just in the way that we
treat each other on a day to day basis I
think every once in a while it might
even be in your own self-interest for
your neighbors to be happy you know and
I think that's something that we've sort
of forgotten it's like you can still be
as selfish as you want right you're just
gonna have a way better day if
everybody's being treated fairly if your
neighbor comes and says I think
someone's trying to break in yeah that'd
be good and you know if everybody was
getting treated fairly we wouldn't need
to break into so many houses your house
might not get broken in in the first
place you know those are worse a live
life and I'm not saying that you know
you should because I love old guitars
and sneakers way too much to be a
communist but I do feel like there's
there's a level of fairness there where
you know there's a there's a certain
amount of success you can have and then
you really need to start thinking about
okay is this more than I need you know
and not just financially but I'm talking
about you know in every possible way do
I have more power in general than I need
and if you do I think it's probably time
to start sharing that mm-hmm so I come
out of the gate hot with an empathy
question I'm gonna reveal myself to be a
hypocrite which is to say like politics
basically it mostly enrages me these
days yeah
and that's like I have a off valve right
I get to talk about it for livings yeah
it makes it easier but like in person
I'm a pretty
person I like don't usually tell people
what I do for a living if I think it's
gonna start a shitty brutal day today
but on the on the internet it's like
let's go let's get angry let's get
profane and sometimes when I am I'm rage
tweeting at something Trump said the
song you wrote called hope the high road
it comes into my head and I feel very
guilty so I'm here to that's what that
song is for so I'm here to ask you is
that is it an aspirational song for you
are you able to like live by that and
not get pulled into the muck oh no I
still get pulled into it all the time
you know and I think even even having
dignity and self-respect in discourse is
a privilege you know because your
dignity and your self-respect it's gonna
go away as soon as you don't have any
water or as soon as you don't have any
food right you know so the the
opportunity to say you know let's take
the high road is yeah that's a that's a
great privilege to have and the
opportunity to turn it off and go about
your daily life and not have to bring it
up I don't have to bring up politics to
people on the street because I've got on
shoes mm-hmm you know I was walking
barefooted
I would be talking about the politics of
getting me some goddamn shoes you know
so it's it's yeah and I think realizing
that privilege you know I don't I don't
think you have to be on all the time
because within that privilege there is a
point of diminishing returns you know
and you you kind of have to assert at a
certain point you have to be a hypocrite
to really get anything done you know or
I do from my position because if I'm not
a hypocrite that I'm walking around
screaming all the time right you know
and if I'm walking around screaming all
the time nobody's listening to me
anymore true and you know they're
locking me up somewhere so you sort of
have to you have to use that privilege
to keep yourself sane enough and
functional enough to create rational
arguments that might get across to
people who otherwise wouldn't listen but
you know as an overall theme you know
that song is it's it's it's it's sort of
the impossible dream there you know it's
like let's let's do our best to try to
stay civilized in this and you know it's
not it's it's not going to always be
possible sometimes you're just gonna get
you know so angry sigh it happens to me
all the time but I have some friends who
you know that the only thing they post
on their Twitter account is rage toward
the administration and I guarantee you
I'm just as angry as they are but man
you're gonna turn everybody off if
you're just screaming about it all the
time and you know the the only really
good thing about hypocrisy is being a
hypocrite does not mean you're wrong
that does not make your point wrong you
know it you can be just you can be right
about everything and live by none of it
and be a hypocrite and a genius you know
sure speaking of some some non geniuses
the NRS see the National Republican
Senatorial Committee came out and
criticized you the other day it was you
and Ben Folds headline to rally for Phil
Bredesen the former governor of
Tennessee who's running for Senate we
should pause for a second on who Ben
Folds is if you haven't heard of the Ben
Folds Five check him out he wrote a song
called brick that that was a big hit
tore up everybody in high school for a
while everybody realized what it was
about you know it was like super sad and
all of a sudden they realize it's a song
about abortion and they're like oh my
god oh my god but but n-fold is like
this like virtuoso piano player on the
board of love like the Symphony
Orchestra right like a very super super
grown-up dude yeah with a really really
sick weird sense of humor that I just
love I've always been a fan of his work
I think I think the song Satan is my
master where he says he buys my
Metallica records for me I think that's
genius that's old that's old bin full
sorry what deep cuts for three that's
pre TV talent show judging Ben falls so
there's a lot of layers of Ben Folds
yeah the N RSC decided to attack you and
Ben Folds by saying Phil Bredesen was
partnering with the unhinge left by
doing an event with you as a concert my
read on that is like a recovering
political professional was just to laugh
at how stupid it is like a popular local
artist and Ben Folds who we've discussed
now yeah but what did you make of this
oh no they totally missed it was it was
laughable I was proud of it you know
because being insulted doesn't bother me
I know I know what I do in the world I'm
fine with myself you know but I I
thought it was a great moment for for
Phil's campaign for one thing because
it's just completely backfired and it
really showed you how out of touch the
people who crafted that particular
insult were because if there's anything
that my career has been about over the
past six or seven years it's been
injured miss you know and how to get
reimaged they stay that way I've been
pretty Angley it was great I went to my
therapist I was like you know how you
told me I'm supposed to take some more
risks now like like kind of like I used
to but not you know like measured risk
well now on him and I think you'll feel
like that's probably pretty good for me
and she's know you're on his she said
they're not gonna shoot you are they and
I was like no no I'm not that popular
you know at this point but but uh but
yeah I'm unhinged it's good it's good
for me to feel dangerous yeah you're
dangerous I mean wife looked at me
differently after that she's like ooh
you're unhinge let's get a motorcycle
yeah I mean but it's like part of this
trend where athletes celebrities artists
are criticized for having an opinion are
talking about social issues or politics
right like Laura Ingraham famously told
LeBron and Kevin Durant to shut up in
dribble because everyone wants to hear
what she has to say and not them how do
you deal with that or view your
responsibility as an artist to talk
about things that are important and you
know the world well it really it's an
it's a non-issue I mean the real issue
is you know Kevin and LeBron disagree
with Laura and so Lauren's Laura is
doing everything she can do to get
people to not pay attention to him right
you know nobody cares where those voices
are coming from right nobody gives a
damn if it's me or Ted Nugent or LeBron
James or you know it's really the issue
is not bad
it'd be nice if if they really meant it
you know but we we know it's a game yeah
it's it's a game listen I played this
benefit show in a crazy ski town a while
back where I just went up and played
like 45 minutes for all these people who
donated a ton of money you know to some
organization they had I'm not gonna get
too awful off
specific about it but it was a good
thing I had a good time nobody told me
until after I played my set that Ted
Cruz was in the audience you know
they're probably smart to do that and
not tell me that but I didn't play white
man's world so I was so mad I didn't
find out until the show was over and
they packed everything no I was like can
I just run up to him and play this song
in his face right now but you know he's
out there listening to the lyrics and
like bopping along they don't believe
any of this they don't the far
right they're just doing that because
they think they're gonna get more
powerful that way nobody really believes
that maybe pants pence looks like
enough of a Mennonite to maybe go along
with that kind of stuff like he looks
like the kind of guy who wouldn't wear
it like wouldn't marry a woman who wore
pants he won't sitting to dinner with
him yeah exactly exactly he's probably
afraid he's gonna have to pick up the
check but he you know most most of the
people who are at least the pundits most
of the people who are running for office
too
you know on the far right side of things
they know all that is ridiculous they
know that we're right they just don't
want anybody to listen to us because it
threatens their power right it's um I
mean Trump's favorite pastime right now
is is telling NFL athletes African
American athletes how to stand or sit
during a national anthem right yeah and
like you know it's hardly the first time
that patriotism has been you know the
weather we've demanded a specific type
of patriotism and the Dixie Chicks were
essentially run out of country music
when they criticized President Bush on
the Iraq war because they were women yes
yeah yes 100%
Bambi's we were in that insane period in
2003 where you couldn't say the Iraq war
was a bad idea yeah it was all because
they were women
if anybody McGraw had done it nobody
would have came here know it was because
they were women they were talking out of
turn well okay that's a very interesting
point because I also the I don't think
that like most drunk guys at a bar
singing along to born in the USA have
any clue what that song is about no they
don't and watch Eric church's record
sales they're not gonna drop you know
after his interview in Rolling Stone
where he talked about you know how
assault weapons are not the best idea
for everybody
the NRA you know he talked like he
didn't really particularly love the
inner
right nothing's gonna happen Eric Church
you know guys like me can say whatever
we want to say but that that thing
happened because Natalie was a woman and
I thought forever I thought that it was
different I thought it happened because
they were selling their records to
people who weren't similar enough to
them mmm you know and I thought that's
what happened I thought they got popular
on country radio you know middle
America's buying these albums and
Natalie is not the kind of person who
believes the same thing as the majority
of her audience so when she allows
herself to be herself then there's this
huge blowback within one day we were
playing that very same venue where that
happened in London and I was walking
around the place on the sidewalk and it
just hit me it's like no that's not that
has nothing to do with it it just
happened cuz she was a woman and people
didn't want to hear her opinion because
she was a woman and it gave them an
opportunity to push another woman out of
the entertainment business I mean yes I
think that is right but back to your
question well no I mean look that's part
of the question because you you see this
like patriotism Music Factory in country
music sometimes but then I listen to
songs that you wrote like TVA was about
the Tennessee Valley Authority and like
what it meant for a whole bunch of
people or dress blues which honors the
death of marine corporal Matthew
Connelly but is overtly critical of the
Iraq war and I think those songs are a
hell of a lot more patriotic than like
Iraq and roll or ever was
coming out in 2003 man I love my country
very much you know I love my daughter
very much but you know it's my job to
try to help her be better you know and I
mean I think that that's a type of
patriotism that rings more true to me
than anything else I think it's your job
to stay reasonably educated at least you
know as educated as you're privileged to
be about what goes on in your country
and try to do what's right try to
encourage people in leadership positions
to do what's right you know I don't see
blanket acceptance as ever helping
anybody you know I mean or at blanket
encouragement maybe blanket acceptance
but not blanket encouragement you know
you don't have to in order to love an
institution you most certainly don't
have to agree with every decision they
make and and I don't think you should
you know I love Gibson guitars but
they're bankrupt right now are they yeah
yeah they're in a bad shape I'm a Taylor
guy yeah they're good before yeah yeah
for the acoustics I like them more but
the Taylor's play really really well
it's just cuz they got that big booming
dreadknot is that like your the thing I
like the loudest guitar as possible okay
for acoustic guitars I think it's kind
of like the green M&M principle so you
know you may already know this but
everybody used to give Van Halen a hard
time about the green M&Ms no green M&Ms
on their rider and they thought that was
just them being prima donnas but really
and David Lee Roth talked about this in
his book but really they would put that
in the rider in order to make sure that
the entire rider was read because they
were on a tour with airplane a lot of
tertiary markets and they were doing
rooms where they want to assure that all
of their stage production could be
supported by the room you know so
somebody could very easily get hurt you
know if you're if you're blasting off a
bunch of pyro and jumping off the
speaker's in the Civic Auditorium in
Columbus and somebody hasn't gone
through the proper channels and they
haven't read the entire writer so they
knew as soon as they walked into the
dressing room if there's green M&Ms in
that bowl somebody either didn't read
the whole rider or didn't care about
what it said when they saw there's no
green M&Ms they could go onstage without
fear of getting their neck broken by a
falling lighting truss there was a
reason as a method to that it was a
reason I mean it's it's silly but I love
that story and so is the green M&Ms that
relates at Martinson yes the volume of
the guitar is the green M&M to me if I
play an acoustic guitar and it is louder
than any other acoustic guitar in the
room I know all the pieces of it are put
there the way it's supposed to be yeah I
I bought myself the guitar that I
remember seeing in Guitar Center and
wanting with all every fiber of my being
when I was 12 years old and then I
realized two years ago that I'm old yeah
and I can buy whatever I want
it's like koa wood beautiful tailings I
used to have a tailor that I really
liked and and I bought it with some
student loan money in college one year I
went to all my teachers and I was like
I'm not gonna buy your textbook because
this is a scam and you know it's a scam
and I'll study I'll take notes and you
know I'll get whatever I need to get
from the library but I must been my
student loan money on something that
actually does me some good for that work
it worked every single one of them was
great with it and I made 1b and the rest
is that semester yeah yeah it
worked and I don't know if it would work
now but you know in those days it was
like they were looking at me and I was
from Alabama and I was like you know
they're like well I'm sure if he you
know he probably didn't have a whole lot
of money coming into here so we're not

new generation Danica Rohm and Jennifer
Carroll Foy who won their races for the
Virginia House of Delegates in 2017 and
Seth Moulton an Iraq war veteran who
came home and ran for Congress in
Massachusetts also friend of the pod so
check it out all right let's get to the
news guys Barack Obama is back
our old boss delivered a major speech on
Friday in Illinois and hit the campaign
trail here in California over the
weekend we hated it
spoiler we'll get right to the point we
hated it in both appearances he finally
broke his silence about his successor
saying that Donald Trump is a symptom
not the cause of our current political
crisis which he blamed on a Republican
Party that has trafficked in division
resentment and paranoia doesn't sound
like the Republicans we know he also
made clear that the biggest threat to
our democracy is indifference and
delivered an impassioned plea for
everyone to vote especially all you
young people let's start with the
message of the speech particularly his
critique of Trump and the Republicans
Tommy what did you think about his
analysis of our current situation and
were you surprised that he didn't pull
any punches um yeah it was a strong
speech it was a full-throated indictment
of trumps in his worst actions they
didn't pull punches on say
Charlottesville and his response said
Nazis parading through the streets I
mean he hit him on all the the things
that we all wanted to hear Barack Obama
criticized him on I think that there's
value in that message I think there's
there's some like nice level setting to
hear from him how far we've drifted and
also to see what a normal president
looks like so I imagine this will
inspire and motivate Democrats and
volunteers on the trail it also reminded
me though how hard it is to
counter-program Trump because it was an
hour-long speech with a lot of nuance
and context which yeah I mean he told
the whole story and it's hard to do
that and then be intellectually honest
when Trump just gonna go out there and
say you know the economy's actually
perfect and North Korea is fixed and I'm
gonna protect you from crime and only I
can save everything and there we go so
you know I think ultimately you're
speaking at two totally different
audiences but I think having him out on
the trail will fire people up and get
Democrats to the polls or at least
volunteer and do more yeah love it
Obama said of Republican politics it's
not conservative it sure isn't normal
it's radical it's a vision that says the
protection of our power and those who
back us is all that matters even when it
hurts the country what did you think of
that critique I for the most part so I
really like the speech I really liked it
in part because one thing he does in
this speech which is identify himself
with Democrats as opposed to against
Washington which is something he did for
a very long time which was of value I
also think to tommy's point it was long
and it was hard to cover all that he
said but what I think is good about it
is it really lays out a very
sophisticated I think ultimately hopeful
argument while still having the critique
of Trump in there it is just valuable
for Democrats who will be campaigning to
have this as an example of how to sound
because you know he brock obama
continues to be the most popular and
unifying leader of the democratic party
my problem is with saying this is not
conservative I think there's two ways to
go at that there's one is it true and is
it valuable is it true no it is not true
it is conservative I think one of the
fantasies we have to dispel is the idea
that there is some nascent form of
conservatism that's just about to be in
charge right we're just waiting for the
four the three reasonable sounding
op-eds and natural National Review to
come become sentient when to run for
Congress John Huntsman moves back to the
United States yeah I see I see I sort of
saw it as small see conservative from a
long time ago you know like I think he
and he always used to do this during his
presidency too like you talk about
conservative conservative is caring
about the rule of law it's caring about
our institutions you know it's all this
kind of stuff
and I think he would probably say that
the Republican Party hasn't been small
keet small see traditionally
conservative in quite a long time of
course or or ever right well at least at
least a modder in the modern era so that
gets to the next point is it a valuable
thing to say I think that's debatable
one of things I was thinking about while
watching him say that is well who is
that for and I do think there is value
to having it be part of what we say to
people who might be independents might
not be voters to say wait a second this
isn't about Democrat a Republican what's
going on is crazy even if you consider
yourself conservative even if you don't
consider yourself a Democrat you should
come along with us I think there's real
value in that but there is a it's a
short-term proposition when what we also
need to do is make sure people
understand that what's happened to
conservatism has its roots in
conservatism and we need to stamp that
out and we need to say this is what
republicanism has become this is what
conservatism has become I think I think
in large part this is semantics because
ultimately I agree that that's the
larger case yeah I was I was impressed
and relieved that he sort of laid the
blame for trumpism at the feet of the
Republican Party because I was like
we've had we had this debate around John
McCain's funeral right and it's sort of
been a debate about Trump that stretched
back to 2016 because at times it seemed
like in 2016 the Clinton campaign and
Obama we're saying that Trump is some
sort of aberration from the Republican
Party because they were trying to get
Republicans to vote for Hillary Clinton
right and it's this idea that like this
isn't the Republican Party we know you
know Donald Trump is different and
clearly it is the Republican Party and
we saw right like Donald Trump is here
because the Republican Party became sort
of rotten to its core which is something
that probably started way back in you
know when Gingrich took over Congress in
the early 90s maybe even as far back as
the 80s right but we really and then
eaten Barack Obama's presidency we saw
this all the time so the fact that he at
least went right at the Republican Party
as the problem was I thought good yeah I
agree with that too I think it gets that
yes and I think a lot of this is about
how honest should you be to make the
best
case so one thing he says throughout the
speech is common ground exists it's
actually a really lovely part of the
speech where he says you common ground
exists between people I know that there
are Republicans in the world who can
care about this I know that there's
compassion that there are places where
we can find common ground even if it
doesn't seem like it and that is true
but of course the logical conclusion is
there is common ground in the country
but not in Washington why not well
because of a massive propaganda effort a
sense that these people are above
democratic reproach because of
gerrymandering and vote suppression and
the power of the Koch brothers Network
and if you really do believe in a
country that that where people can find
common ground together there's only one
thing we can do which is stamp out this
form of republicanism defeat it
completely and govern without them until
they learn that there's a price to be
paid for the kind of politics they
practice of course that's not
particularly uplifting right yeah I mean
he's all like two challenges for
President Obama he's always gonna defend
institutions and government and sort of
like try to rally people towards to
strive to create a better kind of
government that actually works and
delivers for people he's also always
gonna be intellectually honest or at
least far more so than president Trump
and say things like better is good
mm-hmm and that's not a big rallying cry
especially wouldn't compared to I alone
can fix it and like all the that
Trump says so it's a it's a it's a
tougher it's a bigger challenge for us
like we are trying to practice a better
type of politics to beat a demagogue and
a monster and that's tough anything look
we're we're talking about this it's not
really an abstract either you know
Obama's a former president but like this
is sort of the test that better o'rourke
is rejecting is betting on in Texas
right I mean he goes into all these
counties that have never seen a
candidate a lot of Republicans a lot of
independents who may be considered
themselves conservative evangelical
stuff like that and he's trying to reach
out to them not with a
middle-of-the-road centrist message but
a progressive message and seeing if that
he really can't do that I mean look the
sad fact is 87 85 percent of Republicans
support Donald Trump so in a way it is
the Republican Party this is this is
what they believe but we also know that
you know less people are Republicans now
that probably makes up 30% of the
country and so there's a lot of people
who have left
Republican Party you consider themselves
independents and a small tiny percentage
of the Republican Party who is not you
know doesn't favor Donald Trump you know
that we could possibly reach in Senate
look it is a it is a fundamental problem
it's a problem we've been grappling with
as Democrats it's a problem it's a it's
a basic almost mathematical problem what
do you do when one side totally abhors
compromise and believes in power at all
costs because you can do you play the
same game that they play or do you find
a way to uphold your values while still
finding a way to win I think it's really
hard I think that there is a
contradiction inside of it which is in
order to prove to these people that
their score sure to earth tactus are
fruitless ultimately we need to we need
to stop treating them like reasonable
people we can work with because they're
not we need to defeat them and obviously
that's a tough thing to discuss there's
nuance required there I thought he did
one of I think he did the best job he's
ever done as a candidate as president as
an ex-president in describing the
current menace of what's going on inside
the Republican Party and I think that is
very good yeah let's talk about the
reaction from Trump and other
Republicans Trump said last week that he
fell asleep during Obama's speech but he
has spent the past several days showing
that he was particularly sensitive to
Obama's assertion that Trump doesn't
deserve credit for the current economy
he was whining about this all weekend
long can you just before I I do want to
quote him because it's so stupid he goes
it was very good for sleeping which is
just literally the the insult the common
triumph formulation it's that structure
he might as well have said for me to
poop on it but it is so funny because
like he could have he could have stayed
with that as his line right like it was
boring I didn't pay attention I fell
asleep but then he just you know for
four days after I mean right before we
started recording he just put on another
video of Obama talking about the economy
and he's tweeting about it his tweet
Monday is the economy is so good perhaps
the best in our country's history
remember it's the economy stupid that
the Democrats are flailing and lying
like crazy phony books articles and TV
hits like no other
all has had to endure and they are
losing big very dishonest people tell me
what's the truth about who's responsible
for the current economic recovery I mean
just a broader point first what are the
things this White House is really good
at is keeping shitty stories about them
by constantly referencing them so I'm so
glad Oh bah McKay Matt him on this music
clearly you bothered him and this this
lie shouldn't go unchallenged so a
couple of facts in the nineteen months
since Trump's inauguration the economy
has created 3.5 eight million new jobs
that is less than the three point nine
six million created in the last 19
months of Obama's presidency so they're
imperfect comparisons because Trump
hasn't been there for eight years but
you know they're the we've hit 4.2
percent in the second quarter of I think
economic growth the unemployment is way
down but it's been on trajectory to go
down since you know the Recovery Act one
place so like this has been a long long
run of really great economic news they'd
like to point to the big corporate tax
cut for billionaires and say that that
somehow is the reason for all of this it
doesn't seem like there's much if any
evidence that that's the case they also
like to point to like these like soft
feelings like Larry Kudlow said Trump
has ended the war on business and he's
ended the war on success like that's the
kind of they have to default to
because the numbers literally don't back
him up to the point where his top
economists today was asked to explain
something Trump had tweeted and was like
well that's just factually inaccurate I
can't defend it yeah I also think this
idea that you know everyone air ative
out there is Donald Trump is
unbelievable unpopular like most you
know unpopular president in decades and
if only he wasn't so crazy and you know
he was more on message and he talked
about the economy more he'd be in better
shape because you know you point to some
polls saying that people think he's
better on the economy than a lot of
other issues but I also think look when
Barack Obama was leaving office and we
had all that job growth and we had all
that economic growth all the pundits in
the all in the narrative in Washington
was you know Barack Obama's saying that
the economy is great but really people
aren't feeling the recovery yeah well
right now we have wages are barely
growing
and costs are growing faster than wages
43% of all households don't earn enough
to afford a monthly budget that includes
housing food childcare healthcare
transportation in a cellphone
there isn't a county in America where
someone earning minimum wage can afford
the rent for a two-bedroom apartment
like I don't think that Donald Trump
running around saying how wonderful the
economy is that it is the best in the
history of the country is necessarily
the best message yeah it doesn't I don't
I think you're right it's uh I just want
that I don't want Democrats to be scared
away by that you know no I think it is
certainly true that if the economy
economy and Donald Trump were were more
disciplined he would be more popular but
there's also something inherently I
don't know this I mean revealing about
the way he brags about the economy in
the same way that he sends out Mike
Pence to say that Donald Trump is one of
the greatest presidents in history it's
it's interesting just how much the
subtext is always see see it's fine that
I'm president right it's fine if it was
so bad that I'm president if I couldn't
do the job how could the economy be
doing okay or if I'm not sure they don't
they don't need to just say he's doing a
good job they need to say he's doing as
as well as an American president can do
because they know fundamentally not
legally not based on the Russia scandal
but fundamentally as a man he's
illegitimate as a human being he's
illegitimate in the job so all of this
is kind of wrapped up in that you know
we talk about it it's always it's always
true presidents are not as responsible
for the economy as we want as we say
Bill Clinton takes credit for tens of
millions of jobs Barack Obama took a
took took hits for the fact that the
recovery was slow from the worst
financial crisis ever Donald Trump is
going around bragging I mean it's pretty
impressive to create 94 months of job
growth in 18 months pretty amazing so
it's all I think that I mean
right if you if you look at the reality
of the policies he's put in place like
he's made it so fewer people have health
care and he's passed a tax cut that is
overwhelmingly weighted towards the
wealthy now to your point earlier about
the messaging
I don't know if it is the wrong message
because like when we were with Obama
everyone was like oh who the polling
Alex you recently reported that
President Trump promised Kim jong-un
that he would sign a declaration to end
the Korean War a quick reminder that the
Korean War ended with an armistice but
not an official peace treaty so
technically they would need this next
step to happen um why is this promised
creating problems now for Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo as he tries to hammer
out the final details of a deal with
North Korea sure so it's it's kind of
bricks down to the current impasse in
the negotiations right the United States
wants North Korea to give up all of its
nuclear weapons and give a list of its
entire arsenal its facilities etc etc
and the US and sorry and North Korea
wants a peace treaty and so when Trump
tells Kim jong-un that he wants a peace
that he would sign a peace declaration
what that really means is that Trump
would be moving in the direction of
giving North Korea what it wants moving
the direction of the peace treaty and
that's a big deal for Pompeo because
Pompeo consistently has been authorized
to ask for a lot of weapons up front
from Kim jong-un and basically this
comes down to the North Korean saying
your president has told us that he's
going to sign this declaration why are
you asking us for all of our weapons and
quite literally has told pump air in the
room call your president
so Trump has caused a massive issue from
Pompeo and at this point it almost seems
like they don't want to deal with Pompeo
but ret would rather deal with trumpet
as well so what it seems like we're
learning is not only with nothing
accomplished at the Singapore summit
even though President Trump declared
shortly afterwards that the threat from
North Korea's nuclear weapons program
was now gone but it sounds like in fact
we have may have given up far more than
we initially understood because he made
this promise to sign a peace declaration
in the North Korea and so dragging their
feet on doing anything meaningful on a
nuclear program until that piece of the
the sequencing is done right right in
sequencing matters a great deal of North
Korea if we actually look at the
documents that Trump and Kim signed in
Singapore in June what it actually shows
if you look at the four points the talks
about peace come first or the first two
points right the nuclearization bit
actually comes second so if you're the
North Koreans you're thinking
Trump is promised he's going to sign
this declaration to the Singapore
document says that this peace and
normalization of relations comes before
we give up our weapons so what is Pompeo
talking about when he meets with us
right no wonder then that they are so
angry and they'd rather deal with come
directly which brings us back to a point
that you guys make a lot on worldly that
I hear about a lot on the weeds which is
the details matter and this is a pretty
big detail and the hard part of the
negotiation was now handed to Mike
Pompeo and it reminds me of an anecdote
from Bob Woodward's new book that leaked
out today where he talks about an NSA
meeting on North Korea with Trump where
he questioned why we're spending any
money in the region to begin with and he
showed apparently according to Woodward
so little understanding of the issues
that general mattis complained or sorry
secretary defence matters complained
that he sounded like a fifth or sixth
grader we've heard anecdotes like this
since Trump first took office but now it
seems clear that he is actually screwing
up negotiations when he tries to go in
there by himself and meet one-on-one
with Kim jong-un or with Putin are you
hearing any increased concern among
Republicans of Congress or people at the
State Department about the handling of
these like fraught critically important
national security issues I mean I well
first you mentioned the Whooper book I
think what we've learned not just the
North Korea bit but generally is that it
seems worse than we thought yeah on
North Korea itself you're you're
basically hearing everyone say well
we're at an impasse it's usually the
North Koreans you know they're at fault
they're the ones on negotiation and look
you can make a fair argument about right
that's true right for decades North
Koreans have been cheating on on talks
they've been lying and then frankly they
could be using Trump's promise as a way
to drive a wedge between Trump and
Pompeyo so it's possible that this is a
bit overblown but let's let's be real if
Trump is promising to sign a declaration
both in person to Kim and has signed a
document that says so then it seems
crazy that they have not that the u.s.
at least has not coordinated on its end
to work on that process before anything
else to make those kind of dual
commitments and then say oh no we want
your
weapons upfront before we do anything
else I don't blame the North Koreans for
feeling at least a bit of whiplash
mm-hmm
speaking of whiplash Trump canceled I
think via tweet secretary Pompey Oz was
supposed to be I guess last weekend trip
to North Korea
I guess reporters were getting briefed
in real time as this happened no one
knew it no new who was gonna be a
canceled and he just did it at the same
time Trump wants to have another meeting
reportedly with Kim jong-un I mean do
you think that this thing just stalls
out until they either do or do not get
back together at some forum I think
that's right and in a weird ironic twist
of fate I think you know Trump and Kim
are the kind of only ones that can
figure this out at this point right
you know when Trump says I want to meet
him and and others kind of balk at that
I think it makes some sort of sense
obviously this is diplomacy turned on
its head this isn't the usual way it
should be done or frankly even the way
it should be done in general but we've
reached the sort of point where they
kind of do needed me to guess and they
do need to maybe hash something out of
course taking mattis's warnings it would
be nice if Trump cared about details
more than at a 5th or 6th grade level
because to discuss these issues with Kim
requires a pretty deep understanding of
what's happening but I don't see you
know sending Pompeo or the new top
negotiator stephen vegan over there will
really lead to any sustained progress
unless Trump goes in and maybe hatches
something out I mean while I mean is
North Korea slowed down and Eve its
nuclear development efforts are they
benefiting from sanctions I mean how do
you feel like they have fared from the
deal so far such as it is up front I
mean North Korea is continuing its
nuclear program we've heard that from
our own intelligence estimates we've
heard that from the International Atomic
Energy Agency we even heard today Dan
Costa Director of National Intelligence
say that North Korea basically continues
apace and that he's not even sure that
they really do want to give up its
nuclear weapons so that they're willing
to concede anything so if you're the
North Koreans you've kind of won
something you've won prestige you're
still in negotiations with the u.s. the
talk of war has gone away you're
possibly getting some economic benefits
right you've seen China and Russia
and even South Korea relaxed some of the
sanctions they've been put on earlier so
you're coming away with fewer threats
more money and still developing a
program if they may have to give up some
nuclear weapons or some part of its
arsenal down the line but as of now it
seems like a general win for North Korea
yeah I want to stay on the Woodward book
for a minute because you know he's
obviously a once-in-a-generation
reporter but these books take on an
added weight in Washington based on who
he is and you know his process is pretty
well worn and successful over you know I
think eight presidents now basically
what he does is he invites
administration officials over to his
house his chef cooks you dinner
you aren't seen coming and going because
you can park in the garage and then he
sort of sits down with a list of you
know criticisms of that staffer who
happens to be in this house at that
moment and they quickly cough up all the
details and talk about their
colleagues and Brynn's repeat you got a
great book so you learned something from
these things one thing I noticed today I
believe you wrote this up for Vox was
apparently President Trump told general
mattis that he thought we should
assassinate President Assad of Syria in
response to his use of chemical weapons
I think that's an understandable
sentiment in the moment but I I read
that and I wondered should I feel like
okay that's a very impulsive response
and it confirms my fear about this
administration or should I feel like
mattis has actually done a pretty good
job of walking back some of these worst
impulses or maybe a combination of both
well how would you make a bet yeah I
felt I felt one that so I kind of wanna
take away putting aside I can't believe
me to say this so putting aside what's
good for the America in the world okay
if you just take the process I by itself
right Trump has has a feeling he wants
to do he wants to pursue an objective
it's unclear if it was an order or just
kind of an on the phone comment but
let's say it was an order and mattis
slow rolls it that does go away against
the process of the u.s. foreign policy
making to a certain extent obviously
staffers provide options and the
president decides but it seems pretty
clear what Trump wanted
do and so format is to kind of push back
on that I find just kind of interesting
in a breakdown on the way this
administration works now putting back in
what's good for the world see it of
course makes sense why mattes would push
back on this killing Assad would not
only be a massive escalation of
America's involvement in the war it
would be a logistics bite some what
logistical II hard because you know who
knows where I was going to be right no
bunker or some deal
it was clearly anger Russia and Iran it
would mat it would just become a even
worse crisis in Syria so you can see why
Madison push back but yeah I mean it's
your own fears this is we've known this
from about Trump before I mean in 2011
he was criticizing Obama for not killing
Gaddafi or openly want you know calling
for his death and said it basically if
you were leading he would want the same
he would do that so yeah it looks like
if Trump is leading which he is he's
gonna at least bring this issue up but
as sort of a norms level if Woodward's
reporting is true and there's really no
reason to doubt it at this point it
looks like the present United States has
abolished the norm that is sort of been
going on of we do not open we do not try
to kill the leader yeah
assassinations are I've been a no-no for
a while in the White House but you know
what are you gonna do another recurring
theme in the book it that in my view is
disrespect for members of the military
there's the insults of McCain including
confusion that he left a
imprisonment in Vietnam early rather
than actually staying and and refusing
to be released early so until his fellow
soldiers were released he mocks general
McMaster he apparently blows up at a
group of generals during a meeting at
the Pentagon and one in the in the
Situation Room there is there's some
elements of this that are a little
gossipy right like making fun of the way
McMaster talks but there's also the fact
that he still hasn't visited US service
members in Afghanistan and I'm I'm just
waiting for some real rumblings out of
the Pentagon about the repeated
disrespect and hope curious have you
heard anything like that are you
surprised that the disrespect during
McCain's funeral
again for example that more you know
military officials weren't speaking out
I'm not surprised that military
officials didn't speak out solely
because they stay apolitical as much as
they can while they're still in uniform
I mean you've seen retired people come
to run in this defense or whatnot right
but usually in uniform they're not going
to even really much in background even
say anything however you will notice
that when Trump was disrespecting McCain
you just saw veterans groups come out
and drove it right this is when the when
the flag went back up yep
veterans groups just came out in droves
to say how hurt they were driven by
veterans calling their the you know
their group representative clearly
people that were in the military and
certainly are in the military too sir
I'm sure have noticed this trend with
Trump you didn't even need to him to be
President to know that you could see
this with the Khan family during the
campaign you could see this as he talked
about McCain himself you know he was
captured I like people who weren't
captured Trump's disdain for the
military or at least lack of respect for
it in the way that he should his
commander in chief has been evident for
quite some time and frankly he's also
done very little to command it I mean
since the very beginning he offered the
military total authorization
quote-unquote to do effectively what it
wanted yeah that's that's led to massive
bombing increases in the Middle East in
Africa really all over the place and so
his respect for the military is you go
off and do what you want but when it
comes to individual members their
service does not necessarily matter to
him as long as they are loyal to some
sort of extent which actually makes me
wonder what's going to happen between
Trump and mattis now yeah that's
interesting I mean in the one area where
actually I think he has not gotten what
he wanted was Afghanistan you know there
were all these rumblings that he was
just gonna pull out all troops and end
our involvement there and a precipitous
manner in fact he sent more do you think
that there was any likelihood of policy
changes in Afghanistan or is this
something that he's just put on the
backburner and and not focused on
anymore there's good reason for Trump to
a push back on his men on his advisors
about Afghanistan right it's been a long
war why are we there really any chance
to win you remember even Tillerson was
kind of like look we may not win with
the Taliban
neither yeah there was it was sort of
this feeling in the administration that
were just kind of there for for being
their sake at this point and so I'm
wondering at what point Trump kind of
blows up here and says they're all
coming out obviously we know that it
took months and months and months for
the administration to really convince
Trump that he needed to stay of course
then he only chose about 3,000 or so
troops which helped set the margins on
advising Afghans but at the end of the
day is won't change the battle and
you're also having them come back into
the city so sorry that's a long thing
that I'm I'm genuinely interested in how
Trump views this war day-to-day but my
my instinct is Trump is not following
this for day-to-day yeah therefore
something really really really bad he's
happened in Afghanistan in order for him
to take notice even though the war has
obviously been getting worse over the
last couple of months and we just lost a
sixth service member this year yeah I
mean look it's funny I'm genuinely very
interested in what he decides to do to
but I'm it's also strangely a policy
area where I'm the most sympathetic to
his frustrations about the lack of a
plan that seems different or new or
designed to change the outcome in any
way and it does seem like there's this
consensus in Washington that as John
McCain said in 2008 that we can kind of
muddle through is unacceptable or maybe
the best policy and I do wonder if a
trump-like eruption may be the only one
to to break through that you know log
jam that's existed for what 17 years now
right I mean that's totally possible and
the thing with with Afghanistan
especially and this is sort of the other
part that interests me is as you just
rightly said there's really kind of no
winning option here but Trump likes to
win and that so even though he has an
instinctive I want to get us out of
there we're spending too much money
our troops are dying how many more loss
limits do we need can you know can we
afford there's a part of him I'm sure
that goes well if I kind of pull
everyone out am I not admitting defeat
am I not the the president that lost
right you could imagine you know that's
going through his mind and just on
reporting on Afghanistan
and just kind of talking through this
with people in DC I literally find
myself in almost every conversation
going I feel like I've asked this
question before yeah I feel like I've
had this conversation before there's
really nothing new at this point we're
having the same debates over and over
and over and over again and obviously
pleading to no real results on the
ground yeah I mean look I lived through
the 2009 you know Afghan policy review
the President Obama did and you know the
decision to send tens of thousands more
u.s. servicemembers into Afghanistan and
it does you know I wonder what real
value was derived for the United States
what was that really in our national
interests do that I mean there's an
argument to be made at the time that
things were getting so bad that you
might have lost major cities or
population centers where the government
could have fallen and that would have
been a catastrophe but yet no one has
articulated a plan for success that that
makes me feel better about the prospect
of losing more men and women you know
between now and when we eventually get
out but I'm wondering and in sort of
your own debates with Afghanistan I mean
where was that it was the ultimate
objective was I'm assuming at least the
discussion was can we win this war and
if not what can we manage I mean were
you I'm assuming you were having that
kind of high-level discussion and then
I'm assuming you guys had the
conversation of winning the wars
probably not a really viable option
right yeah that's right I mean I think
like one of the earliest things
President Obama did was to try to step
back as far as humanly possible and say
what is the objective here is it to
destroy al Qaeda and deny them a safe
haven from which to plan the next 9/11
yes is it to destroy every last vestige
of the Taliban no because that's
probably not possible
and so I think it was an effort to you
know push you know the Taliban and other
forces back to build up local capacity
for the asking Afghan you know police
army everyone else you know increase our
intelligence collection our
counterterrorism abilities in the region
but yeah I mean I think like scoping
what's possible is very important and in
President Trump from the reports out of
Woodward's book seems to have no real
sense of what he wants the objectives to
be he's like just wants them to kill bad
guys and doesn't know really
that means right but I do think it's at
least visceral for him and frankly a
decent question asked which is all the
things that you described right building
well I was gonna put this out of the
video if I don't show that okay welcome
to pod save America I'm Jon Favreau I'm
Dan Pfeiffer later in the pod you'll

conversations with a fantastic
conversation with Senator Warren so
check it out on this week's keep it Jon
Lovitz IRA Cara and Louis to talk about
the New Yorkers uninviting of Steve
Bannon to its ideas festival that seems
like something that happened three years
ago and on this week's pod saved the
world
Tommy talks with the Wall Street
Journal's Julie Biko it's about how the
government and Qatar is trying to

tell me send me something else here okay
Tommy also does a roundup of some of the
foreign policy news out of the new

it's called the other side of freedom
he's also on tour and you can find more
information about sorry he's also on
tour and you can find
information about where you can see him
on his website check it out man
everyone everyone from crooked media has
a book huh why are you written a book
yet the writers of your generation
because I can't write more than 140
characters at a time man sorry to say hi
to I think it gets close to 80 right to
it
okay well anyway anyone wants a 280
character anyone wants a 280 character
book give me a call okay
you could you could probably sell it go
give this just a compilation of your
tweets
there's so sad it's it's sad because
there are people out there who will do
that I'm sure and sell books based on
the compilation of their tweets all
right let's get to the news because
there is plenty of it
the week began with Donald Trump having
a meltdown over Bob Woodward's new book
which has various senior White House
staff and cabinet secretaries calling
the president every different version of
stupid and dishonest you can think of
then on Thursday Trump was called the
following a moral anti-democratic
impetuous petty ineffective reckless
erratic unstable and he was accused of
quote acting in a manner that is
detrimental to the health of our
Republic these accusations were made not
by a Democrat or a member of the media
or even a nevertrump Republican they
were made by a senior administration
official who wrote an anonymous op-ed in
the New York Times the Trump official
also claimed that there had been
whispers among the cabinet about
invoking the 25th amendment which would
allow for the removal of the president
but they didn't want to start a
constitutional crisis thanks
and so this Trump official wants us to
know that they are quote unsung heroes
and quote adults in the room who were
stopping some of trumps worst impulses
they called themselves not the deep
state dan but the steady state so I just
want to start by saying thank you
Patriots for your service we are all
indebted to you Dan what was your first
reaction to this to this out bad
yesterday no
it what we we know all of these things
we know them from reporting that's been
going on for almost two years now
we know this from all the various books
from people as esteemed as Bob Woodward
and as sketchy as a Marrissa everything
in the middle toss is the same thing
about common trumpet he is a dangerously
unfit willfully ignorant man child with
incapable of controlling his emotion Dan
we knew this we knew this from the
moment that he walked down the
escalator in Trump Tower and announced
that he was going to run for president
of the United States and every single
thing he has tweeted since then or said
in public has confirmed it yes
no anyone we know that from some
secret source plague modern-day Dieterle
knows because we have accessed the
 Twitter he tells us every day
and we will talk about this but his
response to the accusation is he is an
unstable with a passing knowledge
how government works his response to
that was to validate it by sending
tweets in bloom attic I'm gonna table
more I didn't understand how government
works I mean it is it's no shame and I
have you know how much respect I have
for this person and how much gratitude I
have from the patriotism zero-zero Sam I
think they should quit walk out of there
and put your name put your name to if
you truly believe what you said in there
then you owe it to the country not to
enable the currently in office
here it is to step away publicly say who
you are what you saw and what needs to
change because you if you are assaulting
nearly from trumped the NAG of media the
Republicans it's easy to dismiss
anonymous source it becomes much harder
if there is a person with a title and
experience and a reputation that is on
the line here and that's what this
person should have done yeah a few
things here number one we're also not
just talking about some single
individual who's decided to write an
op-ed here the person in the op-ed said
there are multiple senior administration
officials in the government who feel the
same way
a couple senior administration officials
immediately reached out to Axios after
that and said the person took the words
right out of my mouth wish I could have
said the same thing so we know and we
know from the Woodward book that just
came out this week we knew from previous
books you said that there are a lot of
people in the administration who feel
the same way and what you said about
what they should be doing about this is
exactly right people from you know the
left side of the spectrum
jeet here at the New Republic all the
way to David Frum at the Atlantic we're
all talking about this last night and
they both of those guys said the same
thing which is this is essentially an
administrative coup d'etat this is
basically but there is a mechanism for
removing the President of the United
States from office if you believe he is
unfit to serve or he has abused his
office in some way and those those
mechanisms the most I'm sorry most
important one is impeachment you can
impeach him you can go public you can
bring these concerns to Congress and
then Congress couldn't reach the
president you could invoke the 25th
amendment though as we've said before
even invoking the 25th amendment you
know it starts with the cabinet but then
it has to go to Congress to either way
either way the only constitutional
Avenue for removing the president from
office ultimately leads to Congress
doing its duty we know that Congress has
refused to do its duty so far but if
there are a bunch of individuals within
the administration who believe that the
president is a threat to our national
security which the person who wrote this
op-ed clearly believes the president is
a threat to national security then you
should go to Congress let them know let
the public know and then put the
pressure on Congress to remove the
president from office that's what you do
what you don't do is keep the president
in office say nothing or say it
anonymously in the New York Times or
tell reporters about it on background
and do nothing because you want to still
take what you can get from this
president whether it's a tax cut or
whether it's putting Brett Kavanaugh on
the Supreme Court
that's not that's that's the unpatriotic
way of handling this the if this is an
administrative coup d'etat is the least
effective coup d'etat in the long
history of coup d'etat because it was
just a few maybe a month ago that the
quote-unquote steady state failed to
resent the president from standing next
to Vladimir Putin and endorsing Putin's
view of whatever 2016 election over the
information and objections of America's
own intelligence community
if the steady-state was so effective the
president probably would not have put
out a statement endorsing the solution
he would not have put out a statement
siding with the neo-nazis who protested
in charge so they there this whole idea
that there's some quote-unquote
committee to say of America filled with
true patriots is these people
are senior they're not senior
ministration officials they are senior
administration enablers so we're
continuing the fiction that we are not
headed towards a cliff in this country
because we have a clown president yeah
like where were these people when the
Trump administration was ripping
children away from their parents and
putting them in cages when they were
didn't see reference today that yes the
senior administration official didn't
there's dozens of other Patriots to come
together to protect America they may
believe accurately the Donald Trump is
dangerously unfit for the job that is
patently obvious but let's not forget
the reason that these supports they are
propping up or weekend at bernie's
president is because they looked tax
cuts they were pollution they loved
deregulation and they seemed to be
completely fine with a the moral
atrocity of a policy of separating
children from their parents that is not
what they are trying to stop they are
trying to keep trying to keep the game
going as long as possible so they can
score as many conservative points as
they can until everyone figures is out
in Shepherdson out of office either by
ballot box or some other mechanism
well that's exactly right I mean the
real coup d'etat here is that a bunch of
conservative Republicans have made a
bargain with themselves saying ok we
will allow the President to pursue his
ethno nationalist xenophobic policies
and statements whether it's immigration
whether it's weighted in charlottesville
whatever else it might be and we will
risk the security of the country in the
event of a national security crisis or
some kind of attack we will risk that
because it hasn't happened yet by just
sort of but but while we risk that we
will make sure that we take everything
we can get and and make sure that all of
our policy preferences conservative
policy preferences are realized so we'll
take the tax cuts will take Brett
Kavanaugh will take all the other you
know conservative wish list of policies
that we're hoping for and as we try to
take everything we can get we'll just
hold out hope that maybe things don't
get worse that maybe something really
bad doesn't happen and it maybe we can
stop some of the worst things he's doing
and is there a risk that we won't be
able to stop it and then he could really
do something horrible yeah but that risk
is worth it as long as we get our stuff
that's basically what they've said
that's and that's not that's right
that's not just the deal that senior
administration officials have made
that's the deal that just about every
Republican member of Congress has made
to I mean it's like it's a Paul Ryan
bargain it's the same thing I mean I
think you pointed this out but this is
not a ton different from Paul Ryan
telling mark Leibovich of the New York
Times in August well at least I can wake
up and look at myself in the mirror and
say I've prevented that tragedy and that
tragedy and that tragedy and Leibovich
said well what do you mean which
tragedies he said well I'm not gonna say
okay well you're not gonna say and also
this is the first time you've brought
this up in August of 2018 and he's been
president since January of 2017 so yeah
you've been living pretty dishonestly
yourself Paul Ryan tragedy prevention is
not like your batting average of the MLB
like 300 on tragedy prevention is not
something to be proud of you're supposed
to prevent all the tragedies it's just I
it is like I found myself the first I I
read the op-ed the first time I was like
no like you said I was also curious
I'm like who did this and then as I read
it again last night a couple times
preparing for this pod I found myself
angrier and angrier each time I read it
because like we can all joke about oh
you know some people are like well you
know Trump is obviously he's an awful
president blah blah blah but you know
we've lived through worse and and that's
definitely true but you know we've said
this before on this pod we still haven't
lived through a genuine national
security crisis or terrorist attack or
global pandemic under Donald Trump and
we are very lucky for that but that luck
could run out at any moment and if it
does the fact remains that we have a
dangerously unstable man with his finger
on the nuclear button and that is not
just my judgment that is not the
judgment of most Americans there's not
just the judgment of most Americans it's
the judgment of the people who work for
the President himself we all know it and
we are like living on borrowed time here
because when this happens when something
bad happens and he handles it the way
that we imagine he'll handle it which is
the way that an unstable maniac
would handle it everyone's gonna be like
oh how could we have prevented this well
now now is the time we could have
prevented it if Republicans actually
 stood up to this man I mean the
thing about all of this is even if all
of this is true and obvious to anyone
with eyes but even if Trump was
moderately competent at his job had
impulse control better than a
seven-year-old had a knowledge of
government better than a fifth or sixth
grader as general mattis would say even
if that was true is still still a
mayerly company racist who's been
credibly accused of sexual assault 19
times right and so even if you get his
there are so much long hair he's a bad
person who was bad at his job who
doesn't know what he is doing it's not
just one thing it's like well you know
you read the histories
Ragan in the final years of the White
House and he was clear beginning to
suffer some of the challenges of
Alzheimer's according to some of the
reports and people were sort of like
there was an apparatus to sort of prop
that right this is not keeping this is
something very different than that Trump
is bad in every way that person
everywhere else and there's an entire
Republican Party who has turned a blind
eye to it issue point in order to
advance their agenda and they know time
is short
right whether it's because Trump losing
an election because whatever can happen
by Mahler and so it is just sham as much
horrible through the system as
possible before this accidental
president is forced leave office one way
or another yeah now just to turn to what
I consider the minor point here do we
have any clue who wrote this op-ed and
does it even matter I know this is
what's on everyone's mind this is what
everyone's wondering this is the
question that's coming up in the media a
lot in fact who's driving to the office
today
I stopped at a stoplight and this guy in
a motorcycle pulls up next to me and
he's like hey Jon love pod save America
who do you think the senior
administration official was this isn't
DC we live in Los Angeles and I was like
I don't know man I'm like you know
senior administration official that
could be a whole bunch of people it
could be a mid-level staffer the way the
New York Times does and I'm like getting
into this debate with him while we're at
this red light he's like right right I
guess it could be a lower level staffer
than we think that's true that's true
he's like so you don't think it was like
John Kelly I was like no I don't think
it was John Kelly and the light turns
green any zooms off what's happening
right now I guess I guess you should be
glad that everyone's engaged in politics
but yeah important that's true that is
true there's a tiny iota of a silver
lining in this very dark cloud that
America I screamed I screamed after him
as he sped away I was like vote save
America make sure you're right is dirt I
do not have a guess my dad asked me this
last night too
to me it's like who do you think it was
I was like I have no idea he's like come
on come on make a guess all right the
only thing I could narrow it down to is
I do think it's probably someone who is
not the senior-most level at the White
House it has to be senior enough that
the New York Times you know I trusted
the New York Times wouldn't print
someone who was super junior here I
would bet that it's someone who works on
national security issues since those
people seem to be the most alarmed or
legal issues in the Department of
Justice since you know Trump has
probably levelled the most attacks on
the rule of law and has probably worried
people on national security apparatus
more than anywhere else but again I'm
completely guessing I have no idea what
do you think if I had to pick a guess
based on nothing I would guess dan
coates oh yeah he put out a statement
this morning saying that it went yeah he
said was not me or my deputy because our
principles exactly what exactly the
author anonymous piece with it okay well
it's funny because they are all putting
out statements this morning this is
Thursday morning we're recording this
you know the like pence and his office
said of course it's been beneath the
office of the vice president yeah right
okay you once write an op-ed saying that
like Mulan was a you know threat to the
country
beneath Mike Pence's office so you know
he's denying it ben Carson denied it
like thanks Ben yeah we really thought
it was you so a bunch of people are
denying it now and I just wonder like at
what point
I mean clearly these people don't have a
problem with lying so who knows yeah I
think the New York Times I've had I've
been thinking a lot about their decision
to do this like wasn't the right thing
to do was it you know just it's
unprecedented and I do think the New
York Times sort of owes us he owes the
public the answer to three questions

implied and so we may know the answer

[Laughter]
okay
the Senate is holding hearings this week
as we speak in fact on the nomination of
Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court
Kavanaugh has spent the past 12 years on
the bench as a judge on the federal
appeals court in DC he's also a veteran
of the George W Bush White House where
he worked in the counsel's office and a
staff secretary before that he was part
of ken starr's team that investigated
Bill Clinton in the 1990s and ever since
he's acted as a fierce partisan who's
dedicated most of his career to
advancing the interests of the
Republican Party notably he's praised
former chief justice rehnquist dissent
in Roe vs. Wade his ruling has
consistently favored the interests of
corporations over the public and his
views of executive power could protect
Donald Trump who has been implicated as
a co-conspirator and at least two
felonies remember that that's something
that happened um Tommy I want to start
with you the Trump White House sent a
letter to the Senate on Friday saying
that they were withholding over a
hundred thousand pages of documents
about Cavanaugh record on the assertion
of constitutional privilege they dumped
forty two thousand pages of Cavanaugh
documents on the Senate Judiciary
Committee late last night this led to
quite a scene this morning where all the
Senate Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee called for the hearings be
postponed Chuck Grassley wouldn't even
allow them to vote on the motion how
much of a big deal is this and what can
Democrat to do about it yeah happy labor
day to the Judiciary Committee staff you
have a lot less reading to do this
weekend and every weekend I think this
is a big deal I mean Cavanaugh worked
the White House for a couple years he
had two roles he was in the counsel's
office he was a staff secretary which
means he had his hands on every big
issue thousands of documents to the
point where they had to create this new
system to vet them for public release
because it was taking so long so they
hired a lawyer named Bill Burke who was
Cavanaugh's literal news deputy at the
White House to direct the process at the
same time the same lawyers representing
Don began
Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon and
Muller probe so that feels like a bit of
a conflict but like you know ultimately
they the Burks team said they had like
600,000 documents to release and they've
only given 267 thousand pages to the
committee all of which are from the time
as white House Counsel they've refused
to even request the documents from his
time as staff secretary so that starts
the problem here and then Friday night
the White House says we're holding back
a hundred thousand more pages citing
executive privilege that has never
happened before during a Supreme Court
hearing and then they dumped forty
thousand pages of documents on the
committee's head the night before the
hearing so substantively like if you're
in this process where you're desperately
trying to figure out what this nominee
believes and what he's gonna do on
issues and how he would vote and he's
doing everything in his power to not
tell you anything yes this matters but I
also think like politically anything
that sounds like a cover-up or documents
are being withhold withheld is like a
potent political issue Republicans spend
years searching for Hillary Clinton's
billing records from a law firm she
worked at in Arkansas and turned it to a
scandal so certainly you can get people
interested in what they're trying to
hide here and I thought the the
committee Democrats did a great job this
morning of raising the issue early
Kamala Harris Cory Booker
Senator Leahy all like laid out the
stakes here and I think you know it I
don't know that this document that this
this fight is going to ultimately move
voters but can certainly I'm sorry
ultimately move Republican senators but
it certainly could move political
opinion among voters out in states up
love it because of the document issue
some Democrats including former Schumer
spokesman Brian Fallon have urged Senate
Democrats to walk out of the hearings
and protest other people like Joe Biden
have said that the better approach is to
stay in the room and ask hard questions
it seems like itami just mentioned they
sort of the Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee committee sort of with the
middle ground here they basically tried
as hard as they could in those first I
don't know hour of the hearing to
basically you know say we want to
adjourn this hearing we want to call for
a vote it's funny Grassley wouldn't even
let them vote on a motion to adjourn
because apparently a couple Republican
senators weren't there and Grassley
wouldn't have had them vote
so instead of instead of even allowing
them to vote on the motion to adjourn it
to postpone the hearing basically just
steamrolled them and didn't do anything
what do you think about sort of the
Senate Democrats strategy is there
anything more they could be doing what
do you think yeah I think it's a really
hard question I I'm of two minds of it
on the one hand I see the values
staying and asking hard questions on the
other hand I think we're in this tough
position of trying to create the sense
that what we have here is unprecedented
what we have here is a real crisis that
a we don't have enough information about
this person in a way that is
unprecedented unprecedented and B there
really is a significant chance that that
that cabinet gets elevated to the court
and fundamentally changes the rights of
women to make decisions about their own
bodies and so I think Democrats
generally have been struggling with how
to get people as passionate engaged and
concerned about this when on when first
of all it is perspective prospective in
the sense that we can look at what we
know about Kavanagh we can make our best
guess but no one does know for sure what
happens when Brett Calvin I was on the
Supreme Court you can count on the fact
that he will side with corporations you
can count on the fact that he will be
hostile to women's rights and will play
some role in restricting the rights of
women but the the actual outcome is
unknown and then the combination of not
having information from Cavanaugh's time
and government and also the fact that
the that the news media has just not put
that much attention on this a few
seconds in various broadcasts has made
it all feel like a foregone conclusion
and I don't believe that Senate
Democrats can solve that in the opening
of a hearing I appreciated that they
tried I appreciated them I am I am at a
place where I genuinely appreciate
whenever Senate Democrats act as though
what is happening should not be treated
as normal should not be treated as
business as usual which is what they did
this morning but we're asking them to
solve a problem in a hearing that has
been months weeks of not months coming
yeah I agree with that I mean I'm trying
to turn to just play out in my mind what
would happen if they walked out because
I thought there's for a value to both
suggestions here yeah and if the Senate
Democrats all walked out of a hearing
there would be a ton of news about it it
was breaking it would be on every
channel they probably hold some big
speech outside of the Capitol you know
they would say this is unprecedented
this is not normal right and so
and everyone would cheer them on and
then thinking of purely like who has the
power here Senate Republicans would
pretty quickly then be able to say okay
you're not going to participate in the
hearings it we're going to bring
all 50 senators that we have now that
they by the way you know governor Ducey
of Arizona just 2.2 Jon Kyl to fill
McCain seat so they will have 50 votes
so we're gonna take all 50 senators that
we have and if Democrats are going to
participate in the hearings you know
we'll just vote on Kavanagh today or
tomorrow or next week so again it's
Democrats are facing this problem where
they just you know even if every single
Democrat is off the fence and isn't know
which they aren't yet which is something
we should talk about they don't
necessarily have the power to stop the
nomination on their own their only hope
here is to somehow have enough public
pressure on Murkowski and Collins
throughout this hearing process that one
of them flips B or or somehow delay the
hearings enough have them be drawn out
enough that somehow the vote happens
after November and then you know if we
won a majority in the Senate then
perhaps they could delay the hearings
even more but beyond those two outcomes
I just don't know what else Democrats
can do it's effective and actually
stopping him outside of what they did
today which was great because they've
delayed the hearings a lot and they show
that they were fighting yeah you know
and also I mean John you need to go as
far as them calling a vote immediately
Democrats walk out that get some
headlines and now the hearing is just
conducted by Republicans who will just
write ask him softball questions and
actually will be liberated to go even
further to give cabin all the space to
dissemble and tell whatever story he
wants to tell about his past about his
documents about what what he's released
what he hasn't so you know even before
you get to more sort of outlandish
outcomes the immediate aftermath of
walking out is not very good I mean I
was thinking about you you look at
what's happening right now with
Cavanaugh and you know there have been
times when activists have sort of
pressed the alarm button and then
something happens that's true around the
the first Muslim ban that's been true
about family separation that was true
around health care but for whatever
reason they you know they've been
smashing the panic button
and there just hasn't been the response
that we've seen around other issues and
I think it's I think it feels tootinest
due to disconnected from people and I
think a lot of the groups a lot of
women's organizations a lot of
progressives have been really trying to
make the case as to why this affects
people but the truth is it's not on
Senate Democrats alone it was it's also
on voters it's on people paying
attention to make it clear that they
care about this tell me one of the lines
of argument that Democrats are going to
take during these hearings is about
Kavanagh potentially recusing himself
from any matters involving Trump sources
close to Kavanagh told ABC News that the
judge will not promise to recuse himself
from cases involving investigations of
President Trump including a possible
constitutional fight over a subpoena of
the president that would compel him to
answer Mahler's question how much do you
think Democrats should focus on this
recusal question during the hearing it's
a good think a lot a significant amount
I think the Woodward book which we'll
talk about later has some scenes in it
today that I think will create more news
around the prospect of Trump
participating in the Moller
investigation and or all his efforts to
shut it down before it stops so you know
I do think like it's a it's a fruitful
line of inquiry that is both important
subsidy but also will get covered but I
mean just like one silver lining on the
broader Cavanaugh discussion is that the
polling on Cavanaugh is actually really
bad for Trump you have in the I think
what Washington Post poll 38% want to
confirm him 39% don't I think 25 percent
are undecided so you know his approval
is especially bad in the Northeast which
should worry Susan Collins so look to
this broader question of like there is
sort of a fatalist sense I think among
Democrats about this nomination The
Huffington Post reported that Susan
Collins essentially pre-approved him
during her conversations with Trump
before he even made the pick so the
conventional wisdom is that it's a lost
cause but I think like that is dangerous
because the conventional wisdom is wrong
a lot we all remember 2016 and politics
change quickly and so you know I think
Democrats could raise the recusal issue
they could raise roe v wade they could
raise this document question and make it
so that
the numbers for Cavanaugh are worse and
worse and worse and completely changed
the conventional wisdom that oh this
would be a bad vote for red state
Democrats or that you know Susan Collins
gets more by going along with the Koch
brothers and the big special interest
groups i voting for him then voting
against him and actually standing up for
roe v wade so like we have to make these
fights you the the DC conventional
wisdom on these issues changes quickly
and is always wrong yeah I love it I
mean what do you thinking you know as
Tommy just pointed out Kavanagh has the
lowest level of support for a Supreme
Court nominee since 1987 when Robert
Bork's nomination was defeated by
Democrats during a hearing and yet you
know still there are five Democrats who
are still undecided over Cavanaugh even
after meeting with him Joe Donnelly
Heidi Heitkamp Doug Jones Joe Manchin
Claire McCaskill what do you think what
is the best strategy to get these
senators off the fence through this
hearing for these three I think it's I
think it's driving at them hard that
everyone's kidding themselves when they
say that that Cavanaugh won't overturn
it won't severe that that Cavanaugh
won't severely restrict Roe if not
outright overturn it if give it the
chance
I think pointing out the fact that this
is somebody who may play a role in
protecting Donald Trump and then
pointing out the fact that they're
covering up whatever his record is I
think is all are all the right things to
do I mean it's interesting the fact it
part of the problem is there is a
separation between the politics and will
and the outcome in that you know
Republicans have justified so much of
their morally despicable behavior around
judges and so they are going to drive
towards getting Cavanaugh on the bench
no matter how low his approval rating is
no matter what they have to do no matter
what documents they refused to release
no matter how hypocritical they look you
know this is this is a heist and you
know it isn't going well they've lost a
few guys you know but this is their last
big one this is their last big one
before maybe they retire forever and
they're gonna go for it and
they're not going and they're not gonna
go to jail they're not going down for
this they're gonna get that they're
gonna they're gonna finish the job all
of that means that I don't yeah sorry no
and so so I
you know I separate the politics around
the Republicans which I think are much
harder i I don't think it's that
complicated we need to just make it
clear to people like Claire McCaskill
and Heidi Heitkamp that there's more
pain and supporting this person and
there is in not supporting this person I
think there's a very very good case to
be made that the politics of Supreme
Court justices has change that is an old
logic that tells them they need to
support somebody like this and I think
we just need to make that case to them
over and over again we just show that
that that that they're most passionate
voters the people that will help them
retain their seats care about this and
that means calling that means keeping
the pressure on and that means not
accepting the logic of it being a
foregone conclusion we can't control
what Republicans can do that's much
harder but we can make sure that
Democrats held the line and drew a
really strong contrast when the drop
yeah I'd also say that those senators
that I just mentioned those red state
senators are running ads in their
campaigns in those red states right now
talking about how if Republicans win
they will repeal pre-existing conditions
they will appeal the Affordable Care Act
it'll get rid of your health care so
they're running sort of this like
economically populist campaign and I
think during this hearing
we'll probably hear some very pointed
questions to Cavanaugh about his record
and his beliefs around the Affordable
Care Act the president's ability to sort
of enforce the Affordable Care Act if he
wants or not and the fact that Cavanaugh
in almost every single instance has
ruled in favor of corporations over the
public over working people and so you
know if you hear from these red state
Democrats like oh you know in my state
roe v wade is a tougher sell or you know
this executive power thing and the
Muller investigation is a tougher sell
like you know we can disagree with them
on that but fine even on just health
care and on economic issues you can
really hammer this guy and then tell
your voters back home the reason I voted
no on Cavanaugh is because he is going
to continue to stick it to working
people as he's done his entire career
and unions don't yeah and unions and
unions we have learned in ballot
measures in state and local elections
there is a quiet incredibly strong vote
in favor of
laborer in favor of organizing we've
seen it in Oklahoma we've seen it
on August 22nd at around 7:30 p.m. a
president Trump tweeted the following
I've asked Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo to closely study the South Africa
land and farm seizures and
expropriations that's a hard word to say
and the large scale killing of farmers
South African government is now seizing
land from white farmers tagged at Tucker
Carlson at Fox News Trump was apparently
watching Tucker Carlson show on Fox who
featured a segment about South Africa
that claimed white farmers were being
targeted in a wave of murders instead of
protecting them he said the South
African government was preparing to take
their farms many observers in the US and
abroad scratched their head at this
tweet but unfortunately the virulent
white nationalist and assorted racists
on social media cheered so John first
question everyone in South Africa must
be freaking out about this rampage of
murder and land stealing right I mean
this has to be the biggest story ever in
the country yes they are freaking out at
the same time as the vast majority of
white people also employ black gardeners
and black domestic workers it's quite a
paradox yes yes I am of course being
sarcastic because as we'll go through
there doesn't seem to be any basis in
fact for these allegations so let's
start with his claim that there's some
rampage of murders I saw a recent study
that said the killings of farmers
generally is at a 20-year low and has
been in steady decline since 1998 and
New York Times reported that the South
African government actually doesn't
break down homicide statistics by race
so it's not clear where these statistics
are coming from I mean does that jibe
with your understanding of crime rates
in South Africa it does so last year or
2016 2017 there were 74 murders of
farmers in South Africa which sounds
pretty bad right but then you realize
that sadly there's been 19,000 murders
in the whole country South Africa is a
violent place it has the 10th highest
murder rate in the world Cape Town which
many people know as this
beautiful spectacular city is actually
the most violent city outside of the
Americas and in addition to that context
you have to understand that as you
pointed out these statistics are not
broken down by race and the majority of
people who work on farms are black not
white so it's quite possible although we
don't know that actually the main
victims of attacks on farms are black
farm workers so that's interesting I did
not know that about the the general
crime rate that is disconcerting if you
if you take a list of the 15 most
violent cities in the world I think 13
are in Latin America
one is Solaris and the other is Cape
Town so regarding the second claim about
land seizure it is true that the South
African government the ANC plans to
change the country's constitution to
allow the seizure of some land without
compensation right I mean why are they
making that change it's a it's a big
question and you do have to unpack it a
little bit you don't necessarily have to
start in 1651 when the Dutch rock doctor
what is no cake tone but you do have to
start some way back which tucker carlson
didn't on his show know there was the
great there was the great moment in that
segment when he tried to define racism
for South Africans where I'm just I'm
just sitting there watching I mean I
think these guys have a pretty good idea
about what that is so I guess we should
start with the legacy apartheid right I
mean my understanding you know apartheid
was a period from essentially the the
mid early 40s through 1991 or 1994
really of just institutionalized racism
in South Africa and under apartheid the
majority of the black population was
moved to segregated areas that made up I
think like 13 percent of the country's
land and then according to a 2016 audit
of land ownership white farmers still
owned nearly 73 percent of the nation's
agricultural lands so I believe 8
percent of South Africa's population is
white according to the census so I mean
isn't that just a glaring injustice that
the government is trying to tackle yeah
and it's been trying to tackle it since
1994 and like you say this is the deep
legacy of not just a part ID but the
system of racial segregation that was in
place before then and that system was it
was cruel and it was vast and it was
extensive you had millions of black
South Africans after 1948 being removed
from where they lived and put into
cramped pretty vile Puffin homelands
from which they were only irregularly
taken out in order to work on the mines
and that legacy is still apparent today
despite what the ANC has tried to do
since 1994 it tried to do a number of
things but they were broadly three one
was to give restitution for those people
who were moved off the land so to say
here is your land back or at least here
is some cash compensation the second was
to try to buy up white owned farmland on
the open market and then redistribute it
to black farmers and the third was to
give black South Africans in the Maine
who didn't have proper property rights
secure title so they could take out
mortgage and go to the bank and things
like that right and so I read that you
know I think I saw that in 1994 white
farm ownership was around 85 percent now
it's apparently 73 percent so it doesn't
seem like a lot of progress has been
made since apartheid ended to more
fairly distribute land is that fair it's
fair up to a point those statistics that
you cite only refer to the land that's
held by individuals so there's a whole
bunch of other land that's held by
companies and trusts and crucially by
the government as well so you see other
statistics that suggest perhaps black
ownership is is a bit higher and there
has been some
redistribution from white farm owners to
to black farm owners but like with all
of the efforts that land reform that ANC
has done since 1994 it's been slow and
it's been inept so while the ANC was of
course not responsible for the unjust
legacy that inherited in 1994 I think
most people would agree it's done far
too little to right those wrongs since
um well so the government is seeking
this Authority this constitutional
change that would allow them to
redistribute land it doesn't necessarily
mean they're going to use it right I
mean do you have a sense of whether they
will actually move on on this issue or
you know you mentioned previously that a
lot of efforts have been installed and
slowed at best yeah you need to step
back a little bit and understand the
political context of of kind of South
Africa in 2018 so there's a general
election next year and has ever in
general election there's a lot of polity
when general elections approach there's
a lot of politic going on since February
South Africa's had a new president a guy
called Cyril Ramaphosa who took over
from a guy called Jacob Zuma who was
deeply corrupt and ruined a considerable
number of South Africa's institutions
and when he took power when he ran
opposer took power he was faced with a
divided ANC party which still runs South
Africa but also a kind of growing
impatience on the left of the country's
political scene there's a splinter group
party called the economic freedom
fighters and so he was that he was under
pressure to do something to show that he
was going to be different to Jacob Zuma
that he was doing something about the
rampant echo economic inequality that's
still apparent in South Africa and land
reform making a gesture on land reform
was one way
to do that the details though as you say
are still unclear they've said they will
amend South Africa's Constitution to
make it easier or to clarify the
conditions under which land could be
taken without compensation but there's a
long way to go before any of that's
actually done and Tia said that they
would only do this in a way that would
not harm the economy and not not harm
food production which is a coded way of
saying we are not a Zimbabwe hmm
interesting
so I mean to sort of level set on the
initial claims Trump was making these
groups are making it seems like one the
statistics around the murders is just
simply inaccurate and frankly looks like
the numbers are somewhat fabricated the
question of whether land will be taken
and redistributed is is TBD it may
happen but it sounds like you think
there's a whole lot of steps that need
to happen before before anything Bly
should be moved on so kind of brings me
back to the tweets at our Carlson
segment and the fact that there are
these right-wing groups pushing this lie
and they found a willing audience from
right-wing racist trolls in the United
States like Alex Jones are in Coulter or
Tucker Carlson I mean apparently they
are groups from South Africa are making
visits to Washington I read that one of
them sat down with Ted Cruz they sat
down with the Cato Institute are these
arguments being made in South Africa or
are they just lobbying foreign
governments for action the the the white
nationalist argument is not something
you hear a lot about in South Africa
it's something that's actually kind of
pushed more by people from outside than
inside earlier this year and Australia's
Home Affairs Minister he had picked up
on some of the same stuff that Tucker
Carlson presumably picked up on and then
he offered asylum to what we called
Australia's oppressed and cricket loving
cousins but in South Africa itself it's
not something that comes up a lot so
that weakens our
ooh in many ways I seem more comfortable
talking about issues of race than say
Americans are it's something that's
salient which perhaps can have tempers
some of the extremes and when it comes
to land reform the two schools of
thought are broadly those who think it's
not especially important to their daily
lives but has a lot of symbolic value
and those that understand that symbolic
value but think that it's a kind of
economically dangerous thing to do
mmm-hmm yeah you mean you mentioned this
these comments by the Australian home
minister who has jumped on these news
stories to I mean do we have a sense or
two questions one we have a sense that
these officials are reading these
reports and genuinely being fooled or by
essentially fake news or do we think
this is fitting into a worldview that
they want to push one and is there
concern in South Africa that President
Trump regurgitating these right-wing
tropes it could supercharge the story
and and you know increase the amount of
you know people who think that this is
actually happening I'm not sure as to
how these ideas get in front of
politicians you'll probably have a
better idea then than I do
I said the second question yeah I mean
it's not played particularly well you've
got Rama poseur today saying in a speech
you know stay out of our issues Trump
stay out our issues which incidentally
has a long history as well I mean many
Americans are loved in South Africa but
the American government as a whole still
has a bit of a kind of rocky reputation
because economic sanctions by America
won't apply to apartheid South Africa
until 1986 properly and people like Rama
poser who are part of the struggle they
don't forget that stuff very easily what
what I think the danger of something
like Trump's tweets are in a country
like South Africa is is well racist
something that people are comfortable
talking about when there is such
economic inequality and such economic
problems anything that kind of stirs up
racial
hatred either by whites towards blacks
or often from blacks towards whites is
dangerous um could that be why the
government in South Africa you know call
 on Trump's claim pretty quickly
one official called it hysterical and
based on false information I mean was
this huge news in South Africa and were
you surprised by how swift and strong
the reaction was it was big news in
South Africa and I think sometimes it
pays just to remember where South Africa
is on a map it's at the southern tip of
a big continent it it can feel like
you're quite far away from the rest of
the world here and when you have the
President of the United States making I
think only his second tweet about Africa
the other being that has
countries write about your country then
you stand up and yeah it's it's been on
the TV news the talk radio stations
which are popular here have been talk
I've been talking about it so it's it's
become very salient how much do you
think the ANC has riding on getting this
right I mean you mentioned when Jacob
Zuma stepped down earlier this year you
know he survived all these scandals but
ultimately fell out of favor with
basically everybody the ANC has his
great history it's the party Mandela
they shouldered so much of the the
promise of ending apartheid how much are
people looking to them to make
meaningful reforms quickly this is a
huge year head for the ANC like you say
has this incredible history of which
most South Africans white and black are
very proud but there is a real sense in
which since 1994 while there has been
some progress it has made many many
mistakes and those were those were
especially prevalent on to Jacob Zuma I
mean he ruined this country's
institutions I was trying to think of a
way of explaining this to Americans
and perhaps if you imagine that if the
Treasury the IRS the FBI the DOJ the CIA
the Department for Interior and the
Department of I
Donald Trump's cronies and all of the
ostensibly neutral officials in the way
down were all run by Donald Trump
cronies and they were all seeking to get
off the criminal friends of the
president then you'd have some sense of
how badly things got so South Africans
are affectionate towards the ANC but
they're also impatient and it's
important to remember that as of next
year the median age of a South African
will be 25 which means that half of the
country won't have been alive when
Mandela became president so they have
less reason to care about the struggle
narrative and this is where we find
ourselves on the eve of the election a
deep residual of warmth towards the ANC
he will win the next election but the
question is whether it can do so in in
such a way that solidifies its hold on
power or whether it will kind of go back
162 percent I think the last election
but most people think it might drop
below that well that generational issue
raised is so interesting because I mean
the thing about apartheid and it's a
evil policy and it was so recent I mean
this was occurring in the in the late
19th early 90s and you know I also don't
know that young Americans realize how
wrong the United States was on this
issue for a long time it was not that
long ago that that you know Reagan was
denouncing the ANC as a terrorist
organization and Mandela was on a watch
list I mean that did not change until
george w bush i believe i mean i do is
these america looked at fondly and
is that someone who helped in the
struggle or is it weary South Africans
have a huge affection for America and in
many ways said I forget it
feels quite American if you're here you
know there's very much a driving culture
it's quite outdoorsy people go to malls
there's a shouty cable news culture as
well and there's this huge affection for
many of the Americans who were involved
in the in the struggle especially often
kind of church leaders as black church
leaders but like I was saying before the
legacy of government policy isn't easily
forgotten and many of the people high up
in the ANC still to this day naturally
gravitate towards kind of Chinese ideals
which which stems originally from the
role of China and to a lesser extent the
Soviet Union in the struggle there have
been a bunch of news stories about the
land reform South Africa that are making
comparisons to what happened in Zimbabwe
under Mugabe rule can you give a just a
quick overview of what God they did and
how that may or may not be different and
whether you think that the comparison is
is appropriate and fair it's not a fair
comparison for a start that actually
were land seizures in Zimbabwe and just
to repeat there are no land seizures
taking place in South Africa in 2000
watt Mugabe who by that point had been
dictator in Zimbabwe for two decades he
was fearing that he would lose the
general election which would have been a
sham anyway but in order to shore up the
support amongst some of the people in
his in his in his base he essentially
gave them free rein to expropriate the
mostly white held farms in Zimbabwe and
this unleash chaos and on these violence
there were
you know dozens of attacks very violent
not just on the white farm owners but
again on the black farmworkers and this
left a catastrophic economic legacy
Zimbabwe today is poorer than it was in
the 1980s this is a country that used to
export food to the rest of the continent
it now relies on USAID for food parcels
for millions of its people my final
question for you is is a broad one and
you know I realized that Africa is a
continent comprised of many many people
in countries but you know as you travel
around South Africa as you visit other
countries to report what do you hear
about President Trump in the state of US
politics I mean has has the
country's comment resonated and and
change the way people think of us I
think people are able to differentiate
America from Trump but at the same time
I think it does worry people in in
African capital cities that I visit
visit that America is run by somebody
who depended frankly could be one of
their leaders and and that has been
something that people have said to me
people expect better from the United
States and this matters I think because
it's it's sad but it also matters
because it potentially accelerates I can
abroad a structural trend which is
taking place and that is the the looking
eastwards of many of these countries
towards China where so much of the
investment for infrastructure and the
light comes from so if you don't have a
president who is engaged in the
continent and the very least seems to
respect you then why wouldn't you just
go ever more towards Beijing especially
when it gives you money without calling
you a country so you mentioned
China's investment I mean they have this
broader initiative called Dalton road
where they're essentially
for huge projects all across the planet
is a way to exert influence I mean is
that are you seeing the effects of those
investments and more of a Chinese
presence and influence on policy in
countries across the continent I haven't
been here for so long I mean Chinese
investment in Africa has been taking
place for four decades now and some of
it is being wrapped into this can abroad
a slightly nebulous belt and Road
initiative the key thing now for many
African countries in relation to Chinese
investment though is that the the money
is starting to be required to be paid
back and if you remember maybe a couple
of decades ago now there was this huge
kind of groundswell of dropping the debt
that many African countries has gotten
themselves into and largely that process
was successful a lot of countries got
all right
all right try this a third time one more
time
[Applause]
welcome to pod save america i'm john
favreau i'm dan piper
later in the pod we'll talk to stephanie
sriac of emily's list about the success
of female candidates in this election
cycle and what's at stake
for women in november we're also going
to talk about the results of this week's
primaries in arizona oklahoma and
florida
the dl democrats cut with mitch
mcconnell to confirm another batch of
trump's judges
the announcement that the white house
council is leaving and where it fits
into a week where trump is
freaking out on multiple fronts which is
basically
every week um on pod save the world
this week tommy tries to figure out what
the hell president trump was talking
about when he live-tweeted a racist
conspiracy theory about south
south africa that he saw in tucker
carlson's fox news show
bedtime he never thought he'd have to do
a pod save the world episode on that
when he started the pod
uh the tweet claimed that white south
african farmers are being murdered and
their land is getting seized by the
state and so tommy
in a comment so tommy an economist
africa bureau chief john mcdermott
figure out what's true what's false and
why the tweet was cheered by white
nationalist groups all over the world
man that's dark um
it's a fascinating episode though uh and
make sure to check out this week's keep
it uh where ira kara and lewis explore
among other stories
how social media reacted to the death of
john mccain this past weekend
and actually before we start dan um we
haven't heard from you on this topic yet
do you have
you have any thoughts on mccain's legacy
that you want to share having
been on the 08 campaign and run against
him
yeah look i think you guys had a really
smart nuanced discussion with us about
love its peace about
how the political world reacted to
mccain was exactly right i just wanted
to say a couple things about it which is
first and foremost twitter like there
are all kinds of bad forms of twitter
i'm not entirely sure what the good
forms are maybe it's like
during live events you care about like
the oscars the mmas or sports events but
in general there is no twitter worse
than
political figure passes away twitter
yeah which is where
everyone no one can take a break and
just say
we're everyone thinks this is the moment
they have to offer their hot take
because the moment for the most
engagement on that hot take will pass if
they don't do it right there
so like yelling about john mccain's
legacy in the moments after he died
seems completely not constructive to me
and
it's just it's a toxic conversation and
then there's also
because twitter is inherently a platform
of self-promotion
that it is it makes it a terrible fit
for remembering
other people so people's takes are john
mc honor john mccain
by doing the exact thing i would
otherwise be asking you to do
and the thing about john mccain is like
any
he is a human and a politician and so he
was flawed in both ways he made mistakes
and he was a pro like he was not a
political hero he did things so he was
an american hero
and he did think but he did very
political things which makes him not
that different than every other
politician which is
he was a maverick at one point and then
when he wanted the republican nomination
he
ran far to the right and holding him up
as the perfect avatar
for what we wanted our politics today or
an
enemy of everything we care about in our
politics i think is an impossible
standard for anyone to meet
and it's also a terrible way of looking
at john mccain who was one of our more
human
politicians in the sense that he kind of
threw himself out there and
was sometimes admitted when he was wrong
sometimes
uh lost his temper was sort of human
and it just i just found twitter and the
political discussion to be so depressing
over the weekend because it's just like
a person passed away and
who you know had flaws like everyone
else and we either
ignored those flaws for the purpose of
holding them up as an ideal of a
politics that probably never existed or
or highlighted those flaws for the
purpose of making a political point that
we probably did that you didn't need
john mccain's depth to make
yeah are you trying to say that social
media doesn't adequately capture
all the subtleties and nuance of the
human existence
it's actually unfair to even so yes i am
saying that
twitter in particular is terrible about
this but it's even more than that
because
like twitter is just a mirror of our
larger political conversation in this
country these days because for sure
twitter twitter determine it's not that
everyone is terrible but twitter
influences and drives what politicians
say it drives with the media covers and
so we're in this
uh this never-ending loop of ugliness
that is at its worst when we need it
when we should be our most human
well um if i die dan i want you to go
find my worst tweets
and just ratio the out of them
that's what i want
um okay we had another set of primaries
on tuesday in florida oklahoma and
arizona
so let's start there uh in the race to
replace
jeff flake in the united states senate
the democratic candidate
uh congresswoman kirsten cinema won her
primary she's going to face fellow
congresswoman martha mcsally
who survived an ugly primary against two
of the most revolting human beings in
politics
i feel confident in saying that joe
arpaio the disgraced sheriff who's
responsible for the torture of
immigrants and prisoners
and conspiracy theorist kelly ward who
suggested that the mccain family
announcement that the senator was
stopping medical treatment
was designed to hurt her campaign um
dan mcsally is who the republican
establishment wanted
but uh ward and arpaio received a
combined
47 of the republican vote um what does
that tell us does that tell us anything
uh it tells us the republicans have real
problems if not political problems just
general
problems with their voters because
there's a real chance that if
ward or ohio had run they would have
beaten
martha mcsally yeah and that
and that is notable if if you if a kelly
ward
or a joe arpaio can be competitive in
your party your
your party is pretty diseased to be
honest
yeah how formidable is a a candidate is
mcsally do you think
she's the best candidate they had to
offer for that race she she did a good
job she
navigated the sort of the currents
of be of sorry again she navigated the
currents
of being a republican in the trump era
pretty well which is she managed to
keep uh states with
enough of trump's voters to win without
supplicating herself in the way that
as we'll discuss ron desantis did to win
the primary and so look she
this i think this race is a toss-up uh
democrats have had
high hopes on arizona for a long time
and they continue
to do uh to come up short and
so like this is this is race for control
of the senate right here there is no
path
to uh taking the senate without
democrats winning this arizona state
this is going to be a tough race
yeah and uh kirsten cinema makes a bit
of history as the first openly bisexual
senate nominee
she was also homeless for three years of
her life um
fascinating personal story uh you can
check out our interview with her
from april 26th we had her on the pod
then um
arizona also has the chance to elect its
first latino governor in more than
40 years david garcia a veteran and
education professor who's called for
medicare for all and wants to hike
teacher pay after the strikes in arizona
that have made the current republican
governor doug ducey
fairly unpopular and vulnerable in this
race uh he was
one of the more popular governors in the
country before the teachers strike
and now uh democrats have you know i
guess the governor's races
it's a very contested tight race there
right
yeah i mean we have we have we
absolutely have a shot i think we have
the right nominee to have that shot it's
it's it's gonna be tough arizona is a
tough state but this is a year in which
democrats have a real shot because of
the enthusiasm advantage and so
if the if we do the organizing and the
working
and we get the volunteers then we have a
real we have a shot at it and
winning some of the most odious
immigration policies in this country the
things that were the forbearer for what
trump and stephen miller are doing
the model of the trump immigration
policy started in arizona so if you
ever needed an idea of why it is so
important to have a governorship look at
arizona uh let's talk about oklahoma
where there's a fair amount of good news
out of one of the most conservative
states in the country voters booted out
six of the 10 republican candidates in
runoffs who voted against pay raises for
teachers
who went on strike there earlier this
year altogether 12
republican incumbents lost their seats
democrats also have a chance to take the
governorship
outgoing republican mary fallon is the
most unpopular governor in the country
with an impressively awful approval
rating of
19 that you have to try
really hard to get 19 approval um and
foreign
in oklahoma you're a republican oklahoma
you got 19
approval um so we have former attorney
general
drew edmondson on the democratic side
he's already won statewide three times
so that's really good
he's now facing republican kevin stitt a
very trumpy businessman who was also
against the teacher pay raises
whose state republicans worry was their
weakest primary candidate so the
republicans did not get the candidate
they wanted in this primary
um dan what's going on in deep deep deep
red
oklahoma i think you are seeing
the power of
populist activism to transcend party
lines
where if you everything else in life is
viewed through this partisan filter of
either your forward or against it you're
a republican or a democrat but these
teacher protests
in these deep red states have had real
impact and
if democrats can find ways to align
themselves
with the teachers
workers of all races who are fighting
for a fairer economy for better wages
you can completely upend the political
dynamics in these red states and i think
there's
real lessons to be learned here in all
of the red states that democrats have to
win in for governors races and senate
races
that there is a there is a real chance
for
not nativism and racism wrapped in the
cloth of populism but true
economic populism that transcends race
in
all backgrounds yeah well i was going to
say i mean despite the fact that trump
is
unbelievably popular in oklahoma in a
state like oklahoma
i don't see oklahoma is in a laboratory
for
trumpism what's happened in oklahoma is
was a laboratory for ryanism for paul
ryan's view of the world which is mary
fallon
she basically passed this huge tax cut
that crippled the state's finances
there are now four-day school weeks in
oklahoma because there's no funding left
um there's not enough qualified teachers
by far there's decaying textbooks
the rural hospitals have been forced to
close in the state
waiting lists for the community help for
elderly and the disabled
are as long as 10 years long there's
actually a driving limit on
state troops to uh ration fuel
so oklahoma and this happened in kansas
as well
like these are examples of what happens
when you
cut taxes cut government services and
let everyone fend for themselves
and even in these very red states when
people see that basic services
aren't around anymore they can't count
on government they can't count on their
own community
they're going to start becoming much
more populous and i think the question
for democrats
is like how do we want to direct that
populist anger and
trump is trump has decided that he wants
to direct it by fanning
you know racial resentment and
resentment against immigrants
and what we have to say is you know this
is sort of our economic
progressive platform to actually make
sure that there's a government that's
improving your life
that's right that's exactly right um all
right let's go let's get to the most
exciting race of the night
the governor's race in florida where 39
year old tallahassee mayor andrew gillum
who was badly outspent and behind in the
polls for most of the race
won the primary and now has the chance
to make history as the state's first
african-american
governor gillum is running on a platform
that includes a 15
minimum wage medicare for all the repeal
of the
stand your ground laws in florida a
whole bunch of other positions
um dan how much did you know about
gillum before this race
and and what do you think of him as a
candidate i
i had read a lot about him and people i
knew and respected in politics have been
talking about him for for a while now as
someone as a rising star
who is incredibly talented and i hadn't
looked incredibly carefully
at this race i people i had whose
opinions and respect in part who were
without a doubt fans of gillum but just
had believed pretty uh
steadily that gwen graham who was the
daughter former congresswoman daughter
of long time
florida senator bob graham was going to
win
the election and and but the thing
sorry i've been sleep deprived this
morning not making sense um
grandma's gonna win so i sort of just
took that at at face value but in the
last few weeks
i've been hearing more and more from
people who were who had been supporting
gillum that there was momentum on the
ground it was just a question of whether
that was going to
get him over the hump at the end but he
clearly was the candidate with momentum
at the end of the race
so yeah you mentioned former
congresswoman gwen graham um she was the
front-runner for most of the race
per nbc news she spent eight million
dollars on
television uh the other two candidates
in the race
also outspent gillum on television he
only spent
589 thousand dollars on television
um how did he win what does that tell us
about
communication and media strategy in 2018
i'm so glad you asked this question this
is a hobby course of mine
i know if you want to win well this
would be my advice to any candidate
if someone comes to you and your
political consultant your
guru whoever else and lays out the
budget for your campaign and they have
you spending
more money on television than digital
then you have hired the wrong person you
should particularly in a democratic
primary you should be
having you should be spending more money
but just think about it this way
and when was the last time you watched a
television ad
i when it's uh when it's been on my
phone or in my twitter feed because it's
some political thing
because it's a political one that's it
right like that it's already gone viral
and some people will like they're like
well dan you
watch sports all the time you must watch
the tv ads during sports i don't even do
that even with the like the live events
are the last times
the people are truly held captive to tv
and that but even then
most a lot of people are they're doing
other things they are
looking at their phone they're looking
at their tablet whatever else and not
streaming services that don't have ads
yeah it's just
it is the problem this is the thing that
scares me
the most about running against trump in
2020 is that the model of campaigns that
democrats have been running for a very
long time
is based on outdated views of how people
communicate
so we look at we are inc direct mail
tv ads and phone calls so let me try
this question again when was the last
time you paid attention to something in
your mailbox
you answered a call from an unknown
number or you watch a television ad
and and i think the candidates who have
had the most success are the ones who've
been willing to update that model and
oftentimes you up in the model out of
we are very lucky to be joined here in
studio first first guest in the new
media studio I honored its by the way
stunningly beautiful particularly the
blue backdrop jump and it is a work in
progress it's a little work
Nizar work but if we look to the future
anyway and in case you didn't recognize
his voice he is the current lieutenant
governor of the state of California the
Democratic nominee for governor Gavin
Newsom good to be here
honor to be here honor to be here it's
good to have you by the way lieutenant
governor's I mean can we talk about
lieutenant governor's going on she's I
mean come on you know I mean it's the
profoundly important position it's a lot
like cinematographers they're they don't
get the credit they deserve I'm saying a
beneath the director is the
cinematographer uh-huh no one else with
me I don't really know what the
cinematographer does ya know acally
exactly knows other than about Kerry
said John Kerry you forgot was
lieutenant governor everyone forgot John
Kerry
that's what tenant governor said the
most important job with lieutenant
governor is waking up every morning
making your way to the front door
picking up the morning paper going to
the obituary section scene of the
governor's name appears in it and if it
doesn't you go back to bed that's the
number one job according to John Kerry
now I don't subscribe to that point of
view I've heard that before I don't know
that was a John Kerry right so we're
gonna bring up to what he's here yeah
you gonna come verify that you know
that's lieutenant go that's that's kind
of that's a that's a Lieutenant Governor
joke I like that that's what we talk
amongst ourselves there's not many of
its lieutenant governor in joke there's
the meetings
speaking of lines of secession start
with the fact that as we were recording
this there is a split screen on the news
in on one side Paul Manafort is being
found guilty on the other side Michael
Cohen is pleading guilty Michael Cohen
said that he was directed by a candidate
doesn't name him another name um I
wonder who to commit to commit but Rose
Martin O'Malley was it O'Malley what a
doubt so can't get a break
they said lock her up maybe it's just
not what we expected maybe it's a
circuitous path it was Hillary the whole
time uh let's just start with that what
do you make of the rampant criminality
well that's the only way to describe it
you just said it
yeah rampant criminality but it's
interesting bank fraud you know we'll
get to the money laundering trial which
is the obstruction of justice trial
which is the great irony of this this
was the tougher case to win right on
metaphor but as it relates to Cohen and
everything around Trump that goes back
to money and at the end of the day I
mean what how by the way how long does
an audit take at the IRS I mean use it
when it's done will obviously get the
benefit of the tax returns I'm just
curious how long do you guys know what's
the average audit I know know it seems
to be taking a little bit seem to be
able to tell you if you get that's at
the end of the day that's that's that's
the that's the the fear factor for the
Trump administration money all goes back
to money fundamentally and that's
centered so it's not surprising everyone
around him the circle is getting smaller
and smaller I mean what do you think
like you know we've been talking for a
long time in this podcast about you know
the potential of criminality we now have
Michael Cohen saying he was directed to
commit a crime by the president United
States it's still early where of course
recording this on Tuesday people
probably listen to this a couple days
from now or a week from now um if we get
to this point where Donald Trump has
been basically named an unindicted
co-conspirator in a crime you know for a
while we've been saying Democrats should
be not be talking too much about Russia
that's not what people care about we
shouldn't be talking about a future that
much does this change the calculation a
little bit do you think the Democrats
need to sort of stand strong here and
hold the president accountable yeah I
mean again on the the Russia side of
this it's still a circuitous correct
right I mean so we're just getting into
finance or malfeasance around everybody
that's surrounding him which by the way
has been his legacy it's been his
history yeah I mean these are the folks
that he's constantly surround himself so
it's not surprising it's splitting into
his administration but no look I rush
aside Moeller finished the investigation
Dudek ate the facts as it relates to
subsequent shoes dropping obviously
Miller's got more and will hide up in
that respectively he's like it was
Imelda Marcos with the amount of shoes
he's able there's lots of shoes
you weren't even alive you were there
greeting about that in the history but
I'll give you my word you know about no
it is jaw-dropping I mean the normalcy
of all this I mean the fact that you
know as you suggest split screen what
more potency do you want one of these
things is enough to end their
administration in the traditional sense
but this is just Tuesday as you suggest
yeah just Tuesday and you know so he'll
tweet himself out and least in a new
direction within the next 48 hours and
then we'll see where the dust settles
but it is extraordinary and I have no
confidence that we can stick on one
there at over one story for even a
weekly basis yeah that's the problem
so you said that you're looking to run a
state that is a positive alternative to
Donald Trump if you take office as
governor what are the two or three most
important things you want to get done in
that first year to sort of prove that
case that it's a positive alter well
it's hard to say in the first year but
I'll tell you if we don't address the
issue of wealth disparity not just
income inequality the issues of social
mobility this whole experiment collapses
I don't think there's a bigger issue nor
a country I don't think the big area
around the rest of the world all
grappling with this issue these
disparities you know it's interesting I
was just talking to mayor Garcetti from
Los Angeles and he made a point that a
reporter made to him which I thought was
interesting I never put it in
perspective that California is the only
state that's attached to the brand the
California Dream
there's no Iowa dream or New Hampshire
dream it's not necessarily sort of a
part of the conversation and it is
interesting fact about California and
perhaps that's the size and scope or
just what we've always represented that
pioneering spirit of being on the
leading and cutting edge so in that
sense as someone who believes the future
happens here first in California I feel
deep sense of responsibility to address
the issue of those disparities but that
can't be done overnight it's been a 4050
year trend line that's now a headline
but it's simply not sustainable and I
say this as a business guy I've got 23
small businesses or close to a little
over 700 employees in the state and
that's not to impress you but to impress
upon you a strong entrepreneurial bias
meaning I am a pro job pro-business
Democrat
businesses cannot thrive in a world
that's failing and this whole thing is
in peril if we continue down this path
and I'm worried about IT and
globalization detonating the same time
the nature of work changing in real time
the future of work is relates to
automation that this could get out of
hand so we have to address that number
one
so we've talked some people you know
there's a lot of talk about universal
basic income as one potential policy
solution that's very popular in the Bay
Area and all around California
we've had two other people who talked
about Federal jobs guarantee state jobs
guarantee weirdy and some people have
said we need a combination of both where
do you come down on some of those really
big policy solutions and inequality
Valtor said it best said work solves ya
win and by the way so give the guy a
break I'm gonna do this thank you all
right I'm just trying to be as heir
apparent
but halters a you know work solves
life's three great evils boredom vice
and need you can address the issue of
need but you're not necessarily
addressing the issue of boredom advice
and I'm not suggesting that there's not
a fanciful notion of a universal basic
I'm allowing all of us to find our inner
Renaissance self I get all that and I'm
intrigued by it in fact just how the
privilege of spending some time with
Chris Hughes and others that have done a
lot of thinking on this and of course
someone who's been on your show who's a
rock star and really one of my most
favorite politicians in this country not
just the state Michael Tubbs from
Stockton who's experimenting in
California in a local level it's
intriguing to me that said I'm more
interested in enhancing the Earned
Income Tax Credit extending it into the
middle class extending it to caregivers
doing more in that space child tax
credits that I think could more
substantively in the short term address
the issue deep child poverty I think the
issue of child poverty is the issue
we've got to tackle first
again I live in the richest in the
poorest state 7.4 million people living
below the poverty line 134 thousand
homeless anyone comes to California you
sit here and go what the hell's going on
not just in the big urban areas here in
LA or Northern California San Francisco
San Jose but increasingly in the inland
part of the state that's an issue that's
half
on our watch we own that and we've got
to step things up and we've got to look
I think as you suggest in your question
and novel approaches employment
insurance not just unemployment
insurance look at opportunities a new
around a Marshall Plan around
apprenticeship programs and vocational
strategies not just rhetoric in the
margins which frankly has been our
toolkit in the past let's know but
homelessness for a second because San
Francisco has a thorny terrible homeless
problem LA has a thorny terrible
homeless problem you're the mayor of San
Francisco do you view that as a place
where you fail do you view that a place
where you made progress what is your
response to people who hold that out as
a big negative for you yeah I mean a lot
do but there's a lot of lazy pundits
Rhian that I haven't been mayor in seven
eight years and we actually decreased
the street population by 40 percent when
I was mayor so we made enormous progress
in the short term so you think that that
has with those policies abandoned have
have had things gotten worse since you
left no and I'm not and no in fact oh
they've gotten much worse and in this
respect the street population is change
the overall numbers I've addict elite
changed here's the problem though it's
not it's a it's a not a static number we
started with about 7,000 people on the
street we got 12,000 people off the
street there was still close to 7,000
people on the street we did its survey
our annual surveys one survey showed
over ninety percent of the people on the
streets weren't from San Francisco so as
soon as you house two or three people
this dynamic population continues to
challenge mayors cities large and small
so there's no way mayor can solve this
alone it's got to be regionalized
the state of California needs to
intervene State of California's been
nowhere to be found on almost policy in
the past shelter soft sleep housing and
supportive services is the closest
approximation to a solution to
homelessness but the federal government
also needs to reconcile the fact for 40
years Housing and Urban development's
gotten out of the Housing and Urban
Development business and the subsidy
businesses section 8 housing vouchers
public housing providing the kind of
support that cities and counties and
states need so this is animated animated
my why when I ran for mayor in animated
my successes and failures to answer your
question quite honestly and my critics
it fueled them and it also feels my
sense of purpose as it relates to a
candidate for governor
that recognizes that mayor Garcetti here
other mayor's simply cannot do it
without significant resource and
resourcefulness from the next governor
so on resources one thing you've said in
praising Governor Brown is that you can
be progressive without being profligate
someone said that you've gone back and
forth on projects like rail and other
mass mass transit projects where are you
now on high-speed rail in California and
what is how is your position change well
I mean when the facts changed if you
don't change then you're an ideologue
and then I have strong critique of
ideologues of all stripes I was the
co-chair it was a very passionately
engaged in the original bond the nine
point nine five billion dollar bond but
as a 33 billion dollar bond third of the
money was going to come from the private
sector a third of the money from the
feds third of money from the state only
three point five billions come from the
feds not $1 come from the private sector
and the state no longer can afford one
third because the price of this projects
on the low end seventy seven point three
billion dollars high in 98 point one
that said we have a brand new business
plan and the old business plan I
criticized the old leadership frankly I
was very critical of as well and those
reflect my previous comments they have
completely reconstituted the plan
focused it not north/south now east/west
primarily a valley to valley Silicon
Valley to Central Valley plan and I
believe if we can achieve that we're
still short of billions of dollars but
if we can achieve that then we can
invite the private sector and get it
down here in Southern California one
thing that seems to be plaguing cities
playing the entire country is these
projects are extraordinarily expensive
the lengths of time it's taking to
complete them is going up and it's need
to be something that everybody is
wringing their hands about why why has
infrastructure from in the United States
become prohibitively expensive to the
point where we're not building any
process process process you know it I
mean it's one of the great things about
our democracy process people the right
to apply and people have a right to
engage people have a right to a post not
just support people are the right to due
process people have the right to access
justice courts eminent domain
proceedings is a substantive answer to
the question as relates to
the issue of the state doing land
acquisition for right away for this
system being part of the delay our
environmental review which embraces take
a backseat to no one in my passion for
the environment but there's a time value
associated with that and obviously costs
there's no sequa in when they did that
high-speed rail fence Shanghai and
Beijing they weren't worried much about
land acquisition as we are in the United
States due process and access to justice
or remediation let alone the issues of
an environmental justice in the United
States we do and we pay a price for that
and some levels we also are in the envy
of the world for that Ananta levels but
the bottom line is this it goes to the
issue of trust and if you're gonna say
you support something damn it if
something changes have the courage of
saying it's changed and you know what if
there's trade-offs there's honesty and
transparency and you're going to talk
about those trade-offs and I just prefer
politicians that are open argument
interested in evidence and not
ideological Democrats we can't stand the
ideologues on the right and yet when
folks and our party are presented
certain facts and we stubbornly dismiss
them because they're easily knitted into
the progressive frame then we're playing
in the same kind of I think cynicism
that invites critique and so I just
think you got to be more honest more
transparent and large-scale projects
rarely do they come in at time on budget
and that's something we're just gonna
substant amor honest and transparent
about but it has gotten worse I mean is
it it's a problem that's gotten worse
mean these projects are costing more and
taking longer over time basically
everywhere do you not do you see that
something to address you see as a
problem for next yeah I mean a burner to
deal with yeah let me just a very brief
without boring you but let me just
attempt to modestly bore you over a
60-second version so I it's up in our
long-term care facility in San Francisco
Laguna Honda hospital and doesn't matter
what it was but as a 299 million dollar
bond wasn't 300 million it wasn't 305
was 299 and I said well why is it
tonight yeah I mean I found out it's cuz
it poll-tested well but it wasn't what
is gonna cost
and so I expressed that very publicly
saying you know we're making that number
up and folks were outraged and said you
don't care about seniors you don't care
about the health because I was now
I wasn't opposing the project was
opposing the construct of the project
because I knew it would disappoint
people it's exactly what happened wildly
over that budget significantly more
modest in terms of projects hope so when
I became mayor rather than criticizing I
had the chance to rebuild our public
hospital 884 point six million dollars
people said why eight hundred eighty
four point six because we actually did
the pre development work we put money up
to figure out actually how much it cost
you know in doing so the voters
overwhelmingly supported it because we
were honest about it even though the
polling said we probably better to say
it's 499 million my point is if you're
honest you're transparent by the way
came in right on time and on budget
interestingly and of the last mayor
could take credit not me because he was
on the back end of that construction
project but the point is that's how I
think you approach these things just be
damn honest change so let's talk about
something very costly single-payer
health care you've been very supportive
over the course of the campaign you've
expressed in the past support for Senate
bill 562 single-payer health care here
in California amended yes right so it
passed the state Senate it died an
assembly do you as governor do you hope
to revive that bill do you want to see a
new bill how do you how do you plan to
get single-payer passed it needs to be
pulled into the governor's office the
executive needs to lead it Obamacare
would not have happened it was just
exclusively a legislative Fiat that said
Nancy Pelosi did a magical job of
organizing it but it required the
concerted contributions in the president
nine states the only way in a state
whose populations larger than 163
Nations California's economies larger
than all but four nations the fifth
largest economy to approximate a
strategy for universal carriers with the
welcome oh I think I just heard a
swishing
now I'm hearing in my head weird head
man okay welcome to pod save America I'm

Newsome in his running mate would be a
Newsome twosome cool and we'll talk
about the Democratic Party's recent move
to reduce the power of super delegates
uh love it
yo how was love it or leave it we had a
should anyone listen fantastic love it

heads but it was a great episode looking
Tommy what's up in a pod set what's up
with the world owes man they're
everywhere
- quick plugs check out last week's
episode with former CIA director Michael
Morell we talked all about the security
clearance issue and why it's actually a
pretty big deal and then for this week I
am going to sit down and have someone
explain to me Donald Trump's bizarre
tweet from last week about how white
farmers in South Africa are having their
farms ripped away from them and claims
of white genocide this horrible white
nationalist rhetoric what's real what's
not and try to figure that out I'm
excited to listen to that one because I
have no idea either
and didn't dig into the so weird it's
it's worse than you think okay oh good
yeah
with everything it's a new wheel there's
there's new wilderness episode out today
called the filter it's about how
Democrats can break through in this
media environment by rethinking their
communication strategy it features
people like Dan Pfeiffer heard of him
Laura Olin and crooked media's chief
content officer Tanya so manator yes
great in her pod debut I will listen to
that on the way home lots of people are
talking about it online
lots of temporal commentator fans
everyone is talking about time she's
very embarrassed doors
oh so many it stands so much stamina
what can we do Tanya stands all right
let's get to the news yeah John McCain
the war hero Senate veteran and former
Republican presidential candidate died
this past weekend from brain cancer at
81 years old he will lie in state in the
Capitol Rotunda and receive a full dress
funeral service at the Washington
National Cathedral where he will be
eulogized by presidents George W Bush
and Barack Obama in a farewell letter
that was read on Monday by close aide
Rick Davis McCain wrote quote I lived
and died a proud American we are
citizens of the world's greatest
republic a nation of ideals not blood
and soil do not despair of our present
difficulties we believe always in the
promise and greatness of America because
nothing is inevitable here Tommy you and
I worked for Barack Obama when he ran
against John McCain in 2008 what are
some of your memories and impressions of
the man um you know the primary in 2008
was was I think far more contentious and
the general election was and I felt like
a lot of us went into that general
election with some mixed feelings
because what you know about John McCain
the public figure it's hard not to
admire him I mean the courage he showed
in Vietnam when he was a Pio W the fact
that he refused early release when he
was offered it and spent another several
years being tortured in captivity in
solitary confinement sometimes I mean
like that kind of strength is remarkable
I think that there's a risk when a
public figure passes away that
end up doing you know hey geography and
lionizing people and treating them as
perfect there's also I think some value
in talking about those imperfections but
I think what one of the things that was
great about McCain was that he made a
lot of mistakes but he was the kind of
person that owned up to them all the
time like he he admitted that calling
the Confederate flag a symbol of
heritage was was politically expedient
and a mistake I think that honesty says
something about your character he
apologized for voting against a holiday
to honor Martin Luther King Day which is
a very disgraceful thing that people did
but he apologized for it he admitted the
Iraq war was a mistake ultimately he
turned his experience as part of the the
Keating five and that scandal into a
crusade in for a campaign finance reform
so I think his striving to improve
himself and and you know try to put
values ahead of himself is something
that we should appreciate in honor even
if you hate his policies so I mean those
are my initial thoughts well but you
were a great priest I love it you were a
great peace on crooked comm today titled
mourning a patriot whose politics you
hate what made you want to write that
piece so I there were there were two
pieces to it one is simply what happens
when a public figure dies today and the
debate that begins immediately in the
fact that nothing is gonna stop an
immediate debate from happening ever
again you know there's this there's this
effort when a figure on when if a
prominent Democrat were to pass away
you'll see democratic pundits saying
things like can't we save the criticism
for another day and vice versa when a
prominent Republican dies and that shows
out how the world works anymore
everything is immediate for good and for
ill and the truth is it shouldn't
because it shouldn't wait because every
eulogy is a closing argument in one way
or another and the legacy of a
politician matters because the legacy of
a politician shapes the views we hold of
the policies that they espoused so it is
important to have that debate and
because of Twitter because of social
media because of television because of
Technology that debate begins
immediately but at the same time
there's a there's a kind of navel-gazing
as we have public mourning about whose
mourning how they're Mourning what it
means what it doesn't mean this kind of
argument this quarrel around how we feel
and how we're supposed to feel and I
found it frustrating and what I wanted
to do was just try to write down what I
was thinking before I saw what everybody
else was saying just sort of I'll be
honest that that when I saw the news
that McCain had died my immediate
thought was oh man Twitter's gonna be a
 night but it was my first thought
too and then I thought let me stop
myself for a second let me stop for a
second and think how do I actually feel
how do I actually feel and how I
actually felt was sad I did I felt sad
that is how I felt and I and as I then
watched what unfolded on Twitter I just
wanted to write something down that said
this is how I'm reacting to this this is
why I think it's appropriate I John
McCain's legacy is complicated you know
Tommy lays out all the things John
McCain apologized for and it's a
reminder that John McCain got a lot of
 stuff wrong and caused a lot of
damage in his career but at the same
time it is foolish and I think childish
and incorrect to reduce John McCain to
simply a Republican partisan simply a
right-wing politician he was more than
that he was special and and it and it
doesn't make you a worse Democrat to
note that doesn't make you naive it
doesn't make you silly it doesn't mean
you're capitulating to terrible policies
it doesn't make medicare-for-all less
likely you can take a moment and say
this is the good and this is the ill and
it's worth noting and appreciating
someone because if you can't stop and
say John McCain is the kind of opponent
you should celebrate when he dies then
no one is and maybe that's how you feel
but you should admit that yeah I was I
was also sad and I also I've had this
respect for him ever since I first knew
about him from the before the 2008
campaign to the 2008 campaign to I
remember when the three of us were
sitting there watching the ACA repeal
debate play out
at the very end it seemed like McCain
might vote against repeal vote against
skinny repeal and again Twitter was a
mess everyone's like stop holding out
hope for John McCain he's not the
courageous person you think he is oh but
this isn't a Sorkin drama you do liberal
cowards I thought to myself maybe I'm
being a little naive here maybe it won't
happen and sure enough he did he did the
right thing and look he's he's a
complicated person he was a complicated
person as everyone said he was not a
centrist he was not a moderate his
politics were very conservative except
for these moments of Independence on
campaign finance reform climate change
immigration torture and then of course
health care but the even on those issues
he went back and forth on some of them
right right
but why we think this about John McCain
is not because of his policy in the
policies but really it was something
about his character and restyle and I
think what you get at tommy was exactly
right which is he is someone who was
self-aware enough to know when he was
wrong that he could make mistakes that
he was fallible and he was always trying
to live up to his own standards even if
he failed often in doing that well so I
mean I think it's impossible to judge
McCain in today without contrasting him
to Trump and just a few thoughts in that
I mean we all became pretty close
friends with a lot of people who work
for McCain and they love him they revere
him and I think that's actually telling
because that ain't the case at a lot of
offices in Washington a lot of people
get to know their boss and they think he
or she is an
and the McCain people loved him a
senator grant told The Washington Post
that he and McCain had visited active
war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan 47
times that shows genuine interest to get
out in the field
talk to servicemembers see what's
happening on the ground Donald Trump has
not visited war zone one time again to
the point about like admitting their
stakes Trump will never admit he's made
a mistake he'll never apologized and I
think that's like that's one of the
things we all dislike about him most and
it's one of the things like we've all
had an a friend that we genuinely didn't
like Tommy are wrong you'd be wrong all
the time
I think everyone is dated that person
have been friends with a person and it's
like it's the worst so it's like it is a
character thing and I think we too
more than ever we miss that kind of
character in politician yeah and look I
think it's not just a comparison between
McCain and trumpet it's a comparison
between McCain and the rest of the
Republican Party like there there is no
doubt that if the Republican Party were
filled with John McCain's that our
politics would be in a lot better shape
yes not not that not the Senate or
anything because you still need
Democrats there to fight against all his
shitty policies that he has right right
but if if every senator and the
President had states right now we're
Republicans but they were more in the
mold of John McCain there would be more
compromise there would be more things
done they would still be pushing pretty
conservative pretty right-wing policies
but at least we would be able to deal
with people who had integrity in mind as
a value in public service yeah I mean I
said this I said in the piece which is
just the world would be worse if John
McCain got his way but the world would
be better if more politicians were like
him that's right you know it's funny to
- Tommy's point about Trump it is such a
testament to how awful Trump is that any
time there is simply a statement of
American values in this case it was John
McCain's statement that he released
after he died that simple statement of
American values reads like a rebuke to
Trump which certainly is but the fact
that simply saying America is at land of
ideals and not blood and soil is seen as
a rebuke to the president is actually
worth you know that well it's worth
noting and it makes me think that
Democrat should take heed of that for
2020 yeah when the end in 2018 - when
you were running that like simple
statements of American values of what we
stand for what this country's already
been about are going to be some of the
starkest contrasts with Donald Trump I
mean and like to some of the major
criticisms out there I mean the Iraq war
was a disastrous decision I think
there's a lot of people who you know I
think people get overheated about some
of these things and call him a war
monger all he's like yes he was very Pro
intervention abroad I think that was a
decision born of his public service in
the Navy so you know I understand and
respected so that I mean I think it's a
valid policy critique I think it's valid
to critique the choice of Sarah Palin I
think it was in hindsight inexcusable to
pick someone so clearly unqualified
the job that was irresponsible but I
don't know that we could have or he
could have known ahead of time that she
would like unleash the pre alt-right
Mogga forces of you know culture warrior
awfulness that ultimately happened I
think he publicly regretted the choice
ultimately he also probably felt a
little guilty because they hung her out
to dry like she wasn't ready and they
humiliated her in front of country with
these interviews and things I will say I
think I think that is his probably two
greatest mistakes in his in his career
one is the Iraq war which he not only
supported like a lot of Democrats did
but was also a cheerleader for for a
very long time and I think the second
one was the choice of Sarah Palin and I
think you're right Tommy I think it's at
the outset he thought he was getting
some reformer from Alaska
we all did by the way and we all felt
that all that she turned out to be much
no one Sarah Palin didn't know what
Sarah Palin got to become when Sarah
Palin was picked so though I remember as
soon that the moment that she you know
she was picked and everyone was like oh
god she's gonna be an effective VP
candidate and you know Democrats are
screwed and then when I saw her at the
convention it was when she gave that
convention speech that you could see the
darkness and ugliness in there and where
this thing was gonna go and then it got
really bad and you're looking he'd gone
two ways though she could have gone two
ways but she didn't know she did not
wait because of question though this is
something that I was struggling with
even it's one of things that people
responded to what I wrote about and I
actually I think it's worth considering
I don't know I think it's a it was a
question that I had which is are we
you know this he was one of the leading
cheerleaders for the war in Iraq and it
caused an incredible amount of death and
turmoil it was a massive it was a
massive historical error incredibly
calamitous is that not enough to say
well that is his legacy all the rest the
character the choices the the goodness
in him all of it pales in comparison to
the harm and cost of Iraq I think you've
been president at the time you know it
is George Bush's legacy yeah I think
it's harder to say about a senator
especially when there were so many votes
in favor of it yeah yeah I mean look
it's it's an important piece of this and
it shouldn't be glossed over by any
means I mean it we go through the same
thing when we think when people say you
know Trump is so much worse than george
w bush right George
you Bush's decision to go into Iraq led
to greater human catastrophe him than
anything Trump has done so far yeah but
you can still say that Trump as a
president as a leader as a human being
it's been far worse right you know like
George Burton had a worse policy
consequence during his presidency but
Trump is still degraded the presidency
in the country probably worse yeah
right um would you want to talk about
going back to the 2008 campaign sort of
the Palin McCain thing because as McCain
watches sort of Palin unleash these
forces you can sort of see him struggle
with it and you know at times he decided
to go along with it and I think in the
Obama campaign that's what got us
angriest at McCain during that campaign
right is that he disappointed us so much
when she was out there doing those
rallies talking about a brothel around
around with terrorists because of Bill
Ayers and look there were ads from the
McCain campaign where they went after
the Ayers Association as well which you
always could tell that McCain was
uncomfortable with and he wrestled with
this I think the moment that really
crystallized how he wrestled with this
was a moment that has been talked about
over the last couple days and Greg Jaffe
at The Washington Post wrote a piece
about this this is when towards the end
of the 2008 campaign a woman stood up at
a town hall to McCain and she asked him
a question and we'll just play the clip
of it right now
I gotta ask you a question I don't not
believing
I can't trust Obama I I have read about
him and he's not he's not he's a he's an
Arab he is not no no ma'am no ma'am he's
a he's a he's a decent family man
citizen that I just happened to have
disagreements with on fundamental issues
and that's what this campaign is all
about he's not thank
[Applause]
so now some people were saying that you
know McCain should have that was the
least he could have done that McCain
should have gone farther he should have
said you know so what if he was air so
what if he was Muslim whatever she was
trying to say there I didn't take it
that way at the time being in Chicago at
the campaign headquarters watching that
I vividly remember watching that and
thinking in this moment John McCain did
the good and decent thing because it
wasn't he was saying no he's not an Arab
he's decent family man if he was saying
no to basically her entire
characterization of Barack Obama which
was you can't trust him he's an other
he's a foreign terror
if that's the standard were setting for
McCain then it's a higher bar than we'd
set for ourselves in 2008 when we were
responding to those charges when people
would call me and say there's something
out there that says Obama is a secret
Muslim I would denounce it and say no
he's not the second half of that
sentence should have been and who gives
a if he is what's wrong with having
Michael last week President Trump
decided to take away former CIA director
John Brennan security clearance he did
it by having his press secretary read a
566 word statement attacking John's
character in Trump's name mind you from
the podium at the White House briefing
so very classy in that statement he
floated that he may we take away
clearances from other critics
subsequently sent a bunch of angry
tweets and attacking John another
national security staffer so a real fun
weekend
um so Michael can we start with the
basics what if why do former officials
like John Brennan keep your clearances
people like you John Brennan keep your
clearances after leaving government
services and realistically how often do
those individuals get called on to talk
about classified matters tell me that's
a that that's a great place to start
there's a long tradition of former
senior officials keeping their
clearances when they leave government
the fundamental reason is not you know
let me emphasize not to benefit the
individual it is to benefit the
government so it allows former officials
to come in and spend time with current
officials advising them on what happened
on past issues I did that with my
predecessors getting their advice on
current issues I did that with my
predecessors and just getting their
wisdom right just sitting down and have
a cup of coffee or breakfast and talking
about things in general and I did that
with my predecessors and I've done that
at CIA the last five years and in other
parts of the government as well the
other reason you want former senior
officials to have clearances is to serve
on commissions mm-hmm both congressional
commissions and executive branch
commissions where security clearances
are a requirement so I've served on -
since leaving government I served on one
for President Obama in the aftermath of
the Snowden disclosures on on the best
ways to handle that and recommendations
to the President on policy changes and
I'm serving on one on one right now a
congressional
Commission on the defense needs of the
United States both of those required
security clearances there's a third
reason why you want former senior
officials to have these clearances and
that's because they they serve companies
in the private sector and here they do
make money that's but let's be honest
about that they do make money but these
companies are serving the US government
so these are defense contractors
intelligence contractors who are doing
work for the government and who need
people to sit on their boards of
directors and oversee classified
contracts on the behalf of their
shareholders mm-hmm it's an
extraordinarily important function for
the private sector and that's an
important piece of this too so lots of
different reasons all of them at the end
of the day to the benefit of the
government got it so just to dig in on
this a little bit I mean you mentioned
the Snowden Commission in 2013 I think
was called the President Obama's review
group on intelligence communications
technologies is that the more likely
Avenue that someone like you or John
Brennan would be called on to discuss
intelligence matters or is there a
chance there could be a specific
operational issue that was you know
conducted over a long time frame that
only a small group of people were read
into or knew about which would make you
know specific individuals knowledge even
more importantly I'm trying to like yeah
imagine a scenario where you or John
might be called back in knowing that the
politics right now probably make that
unlikely for John
so it's both so when I was deputy
director at CIA I can think of a
specific instance I can't I can't say
what it is for obvious reasons but I
could think of a specific instance with
an extraordinarily sensitive issue where
there was not a lot of written material
at the agency but where my predecessor
Steve kappes had intimate knowledge of
it on and I needed to bring Steve in and
set him down and have him tell me I'm
everything that he knew about it and
I'll tell you that my successor of real
you know well yeah um there was a
specific instance after I left and she
was the deputy where she needed to bring
me and to do exactly the same so it
really it really cuts across all sorts
of issues
I actually know people know former Obama
administration officials who have spent
a lot of time with a trump
administration I don't think either
group spends you know time publicly
talking about that but it's been a lot
of time with Trump administration
officials helping them think about
national security and I think that's
extraordinarily important
I actually no one who received an award
from the agency they were spending time
with for the for the value of what they
were providing at no cost of the
government huh
that really helps me understand this
issue better because something like the
president's intelligence advisory board
which has a broader mandates its review
policies writ large I imagine there are
a lot of people that could serve on that
board I want people like you I want
people like John with experience but
there's a lot of folks that are highly
qualified something narrow like what
you're discussing depriving yourself of
this former CIA directors insight on a
very specific closely held operation
seems to be actually extremely damaging
because as you'd know better than
anybody the in the Intel world just
because you have a clearance doesn't
mean you know something right and only a
few people get read into sensitive
matters exactly and people do ask you
know do you really need a clearance in
order to be able to do that right you
know a standing clearance isn't it
possible that Gina Haspel could call me
in to talk to me about something and
give me a one day clearance and the
answer to that question is yes but you
actually when you give these one-day
clearances to people you actually want
to have some sense that that you can
trust them and so these former senior
officials who have these clearances
actually continue to go through the
reinvestigation process and so they they
continue to be cleared over time so this
is not this is not
you know lifetime without another look
at the individual so the fact that they
have these clearances on it and and the
fact that they continue to get looked at
from a security perspective gives you
confidence if you're in these current
jobs right to be able to trust these
people the who you're having these
conversations with yeah you mentioned
this discharge that Trump keeps making
that officials are making money off of
their security clearance can you explain
that a little more I mean I've heard you
talk about on your podcast intelligence
matters how the government does not pay
you to be on these advisory boards but
you mentioned the private sector and
this oversight capacity can you explain
that a little more yes so in terms of of
the service you provide on on executive
branch or congressional Commission's
that is purely pro bono right I've been
on - I didn't receive a dime actually
there was a significant opportunity cost
because of the the amount of time that
it takes right I mean the most amount of
work absolutely and you don't get paid
for that right you do it because of your
commitment and dedication to the entry
and by the way you're not working from
home or you're at your summer house
you're like in a skiff somewhere right
in an Adz facility here yeah you're in a
skiff and your phones outside right and
you run out of once a while and check it
and yeah it's tough and then when you go
in to consult with with current
officials right when I go into the
agency and I've done that a lot in the
last five years you don't get paid for
that either
right so the only time you get paid is
when you're working for the private
sector
and and you absolutely get paid but the
important point is that the private
sector is still working on behalf of the
government in that case right so the
government is still the ultimate winner
even though you're being paid right um I
read in The New Yorker this morning that
some people in Trump's team pushed him
to strip away President Obama's
clearance but that actually HR McMaster
the former national security adviser
convinced President Trump not to how
often two former presidents get national
security briefings and why is that
custom or that courtesy extended to them
that is a great question and I read that
article too and I was absolutely shocked
that the discussion inside the White
House even happened paranoid
so former presidents and going you know
I was an agency for 33 years and going
back at least that far I know that
former presidents had a right to get an
intelligence briefing anytime that they
wanted when I was briefing President
Bush every day his father would
occasionally sit in on the briefing that
was super cool right two presidents
sitting there so so they would get a
briefing anytime they wanted it right
and that's important not for them to be
able to come in and advise the current
president right that doesn't happen very
often but former presidents do work
international continue to work
international issues they continue to
meet with foreign leaders and is
extraordinarily important right for them
to be able to be able to understand
where an issue stands for them to
continue to work on behalf of the United
States when those when they are in those
conversations so it's it's you know it's
something that's been going on for a
long time and it's extraordinarily
important and you know shocking to me
that they even discuss taking away Obama
on President Obama's clearance yeah I do
you think it speaks to how far-reaching
the paranoia became about the so-called
deep state but we can get to that um I
know from talking to you know friends of
yours colleagues of yours that you what
you think this this conversation and
what the president is doing to
politicize national security and
security clearance is causing real
long-term damage to the country can you
explain why you believe that yeah and I
think that's a great question and I
think probably Tommy we need to unpack
it a little bit please um you know if I
was briefing this in the sitting room in
the old days I would tell you there's
there's like three buckets here right
there's three there's three types of
damage you know one is to national
security I think and and that that
breaks down into a couple different
pieces one is the stripping of
clearances you know directly undermines
the ability of former officials to serve
the government directly as we've already
discussed the second is it undermines
their ability to serve it indirectly
through the private
sector as we discussed but I think the
the the threat the third piece the third
damage to national security here is that
the that the threat to strip clearances
I think can impact current national
security work and by that I mean if
there are senior officials today or even
mid-level officials who believe that
that their future opportunities outside
of government are at risk right if they
say the wrong things to the president
it could affect what they say today yeah
and they might hold back and I think
that is a particularly damaging
possibility that we need to think about
so there's there's this big bucket of
damage to national security then there's
also this bucket of damage to the
economy in terms of what we talked about
the importance to shareholders of having
somebody on a board who can make sure
that these companies are managing these
classified contracts in an important way
right that's a that's an important
economic function for our country and
the national security industry that
supports it and then perhaps the biggest
damage is the third bucket Tommy which
is which is the damage to the public
debate or the damage to the public
square if you want to call it down and
there's two pieces to that one is to the
extent that people with clearances are
intimidated from speaking out the public
losses and when when folks were signing
on this weekend to a statement in
support of John Brennan and opposed to
the president's actions here I saw a
handful of people who said you know I
would love to sign this but I can't
because I'm concerned about X Y or Z so
I saw it firsthand this weekend that
some people were holding back in terms
of what their views really were because
they were concerned about having their
security clearances stripped right that
damages the country at the end of the
day yeah and then I think even there's
broader issue than just those folks with
clearances right and this gets to the
heart of the First Amendment issue here
which is if you're an ordinary American
who's who speaks up and and you don't
have a clearance you're an ordinary
American without a clearance but you do
speak up you do speak your mind you know
on podcasts or on the you write op-eds
or whatever you know you may this may
give you pause right because you may
think alright he's taking security
clearances away today in order to try to
intimidate people into silence what will
it be tomorrow will it be IRS audits
right so it potentially has a dampening
effect on the public debate across the
board that's why the you know in a in a
public debate sense that's why this is
so critical that first scenario you
outlined really concerns me because you
know for example we have a president
that tweeted the threat from North
Korea's nuclear program is all gone
everything is rosy and he may you may
have to be an analyst someday who goes
into the ppb into the Oval Office and
says in fact sir they haven't gotten rid
of any of their nuclear weapons we just
discovered this new secret nuclear
program that they have that they hadn't
disclosed to us previously you know
things are not good I mean did was that
a big part of your job delivering a
message to a president that anchored
them or damaged them politically so a
big part of my job was telling
presidents what they didn't want to hear
right yeah wasn't very often that it
that it hurt them politically it was
often it was often information or
analysis that said to them you know sir
your policies are really not working now
you didn't pitch it that way right but
that was that was the clear message and
that's something that intelligence
officers the Director of National
Intelligence the director CIA have to do
you know on a daily weekly basis mm-hmm
it also worried me when I see him attack
current officials whether their
intelligence or law enforcement I mean
he was hammering Peter Strasser on the
FBI's counter espionage unit until he
finally was fired now one of his
favorite targets is bruise or the
current current DOJ lawyer should we be
even more worried about this
this sends two current government
officials who can't respond or defend
themselves and might you know change the
way they conduct business in real time
so the Bruce or the Bruce or issue is is
is actually potentially more damaging
than everything else we've already
talked about right because Bruce is an
active Department of Justice employee
who was during extraordinarily important
work and to take Bruce's security
clearance away because of issues
relating to do with his wife right means
that he could not do those anymore
yeah and it and it sends right and we
all know what he's working on and it
sends a really powerful signal right to
anybody who's working on those issues
gosh you better look over your back
right and you don't want your
intelligence officials or your law
enforcement officials to be thinking
about that yeah there's a New Yorker
story out this week about how John
Brennan made the decision to speak out
and it talks about general rules of the
road for political speech for former
members of the military in the
intelligence community and you had a
couple of really interesting quotes in
that piece the article makes the point
that the military specifically
discourages officers from expressing
political views after they retire and
you're quoted saying there's no similar
ethos in the intelligence community
there's no instruction book for former
professionals but you also tell new
recruits to leave their politics in the
car and then don't bring it inside the
building even how do you guys navigate
working in the government and an
environment that is so inherently
political and not let it impact your
decisions it seems almost impossible so
it's beaten to you from day one right it
is absolutely it's part of the culture
it's part of the training it's part of
the daily conversation that you do not
let your political views and you don't
let your policy views affect your work
in any way right affect how you collect
information or affect how you assess it
and that's what I used to you know when
I used to talk to young officers about
this I would say you leave those things
in your car right you don't bring those
in and you know in
in my many years in the CIA there was
there was always people who supported
the current president politically and
those who opposed the current president
politically you know these people vote
these people have views these people
have views on policy so in the run-up to
the Iraq war there were people who were
supportive of President Bush's decision
to do it there were people who were
opposed in fact there were a lot more
people who were opposed and but you
don't let any of that right affect your
work and it really is Tommy it really is
a remarkable organization in that
respect I was actually in in CIA at CIA
headquarters last Friday so this is you
know one day after the president's trip
John of his security clearance and you
know literally 12 hours after former a
group of former directors and deputy
directors including me put out a
statement criticizing the president in a
really remarkable first time that that's
ever happened in the history of former
intelligence officers um and I probably
talked to 50 people at this retirement
ceremony and nobody nobody raised either
John having his security clearances
taken away or what I had done the night
before in terms of signing on to this
statement nobody raised it so politics
is just not in the hallway there it's
just not and it's just part it just it
it it is a deep deep part of the culture
that it stays out of the building and it
stays out of a conversation that's
interesting that was true in the
Situation Room - yeah I think people
don't believe me when I say that but I
remember maybe one time politics was
raised and I think Dennis through the
person out of the exact building exactly
um along those lines about that
regarding that letter a conservative
commentator that I'll be honest I don't
usually listen to because I think he's a
little bit of a amagad ed ender said
something over the weekend that that you
welcome to pod save America I'm John
Favreau
I'm dan hyper today on the pod we're
going to talk about the fact that the
President of the United States has been
implicated in a felony jeffrey toobin of
CNN and the New Yorker will join us to
talk about the legal implications while
the two of us will scream into the
microphone about the political
implications big pod today dan big pod
it's very excited about this and it's
about midday Tuesday few housekeeping
items on pods save the world this week
Tommy talks with former acting CIA
director Mike Morell about President
Trump's decision to revoke the security
clearances of former officials like John
Brennan Morell explains why this
decision to politicize intelligence is
so risky and why some spy operations are
so sensitive and closely held that
former officials like John may be the
only ones who can explain them to the
new CIA team so check that out in the
latest episode of crooked conversations
ben rhoades talks to Tommy about
Benghazi and how that moment led to
Trump as president and what it's like
running the deep state as Ben does it's
the final insult his trial that sent him
to get mo so yeah let's go that yeah we
should we should cut that or not oh no
let's definitely vit in it's the final
installment of Ben's series of
conversations this month exploring the
deep state now exploring the issues and
theme central to his memoir the worlds
it is it was a fantastic series on
crooked convos and if you haven't heard
enough of Ben Rhodes you can hear him on
episode 10 of the wilderness which is
about one of his very favorite subjects
the blob
our nickname for the foreign policy
establishment in Washington DC the whole
episode explores how Democrats can avoid
conventional thinking on foreign policy
and what a new era of American
leadership might look like fantastic
episode check it out okay tonight before
we move on tell the good news tonight
bull it'll smoke up your ass please do
though always time for that yeah let's
swap it into the outline in the last
minute here look I did I just want to
say as not just a friend
and colleague of many years but just as
someone who consumes a ton of political
media that the wilderness is just superb
it really is I do it is just like it is
some of it is the kind of content that
we do not get about politics it is both
it is contextualizing it is smart and
includes this incredibly diverse array
of voices within our party and it takes
on a lot of really hard questions that
not just about our party but also about
what we were involved in and where Obama
succeeded and where he didn't it's just
it's really in addition to the fact that
it was my daughter to sleep which is a
huge bonus but it is honest class yeah
but it is a really it's really a
tremendous achievement and you should be
very proud of it well thank you very
much positive America listeners go check
it out I know there's a whole bunch of
you that haven't heard it yet and that's
okay it doesn't have to it doesn't fit
with the news cycle so you can check it
out at any time if you're looking for
some content on a sleepy Sunday check it
out
but yeah it would be I don't think
you'll be disappointed and if you are
you can yell at me about it
okay let us get to the news on Tuesday
Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael
Cohen pled guilty in a New York
courthouse to federal crimes that image
I that again play guilty in a New York
courthouse to federal crimes that
implicated the President himself is an
unindicted co-conspirator to multiple
illegal campaign contributions while
this was happening in the same couple of
minutes
a jury in Alexandria found Trump's
former campaign manager Paul Manafort
guilty of eight counts of financial
crimes a massive development into
Special Counsel Robert Muller's
investigation which has issued more than
a hundred criminal counts against 32
people and three companies that has now
led to guilty pleas or convictions that
include Trump's campaign manager Trump's
deputy campaign manager Trump's national
security adviser Trump's personal lawyer
and Trump's foreign policy advisor so
many witches dan where were you with
this all went down and what were your
first reactions
I was home and as I am Austin these days
and I was watching it it was like a
quadruple screen experience I had CNN on
I had I was following Twitter on my
phone I had my laptop up so that the
multiple conversations were happening
either on the kirkin media slacks are in
various Obama Alumni Tech's chains just
the minute five minute just accounting
of what's going to happen there were
highs and lows there were moments in
which we thought man F what was going to
get off and that what Cohen would agree
to or testify to it would be much less
significant than this and it we
basically was the political equivalent
of what most of else of America does
when there's a really exciting car chase
happening it was riveting it was
absolutely riveting one of those moments
were you needed a whole bunch of screens
in front of you because there needs to
be like a screen for each Trump official
who was being indicted you needed the
you needed the iPad you need the phone
no it was fight the slack channel was
funny a crooked media because we had
quite a roller coaster of emotion there
at the you know at the beginning said oh
this is gonna be good and then they were
like well Cohen's not going to cooperate
he's just gonna plead guilty and and
then you were very dark and then Brian
boiler said it's going to be a good day
but it was it we decided that it was
very good that you were pessimistic
about the whole thing because when you
were pessimistic previously which is
most of your life we won two
presidential elections when you suddenly
briefly became optimistic in 2016 we
lost so it's good to see you back at the
dark side again yeah yeah I tried on
just a brief brief moment when her and
went horribly wrong I do think never
seen the thirty first thirty called June
7th 1994 about like this day in sports
when all these crazy things happen it
was opening the world Co yeah I don't
see no but I know of his own yeah and
there's a there was a Stanley Cup gaming
that it all was overshadowed by the OJ
chase right and like this did it this
like yet Tuesday felt like the political
version of that day it was all happening
at runtime and moments that I think
as we think about the Trump era if it is
not if he did not cancel all the
elections and just be rule was a
intemperate dictator for the rest of his
life we will look back at this is this
pivot number all these really really
important things happened across the
board like it was not even we'll talk
about some business but there were like
things that would have led the news in
any other scenario right that we're
buried if they happen on this day this
were was Christ's own crimes own crimes
so let's go through each of Tuesday's
developments from big deal to bigger
deal the biggest deal first
molar and Michael Flynn jointly
requested this week that Flynn
sentencing be delayed this was
definitely under the radar after
everything else that happened Flynn
Trump's former national security adviser
has admitted to lying to the FBI and has
been cooperating with Muller since late
last year something people forget and
the filing seems to indicate that Flynn
still has information that could be
useful to Muller's investigation and is
still providing that information which
is why they are delaying the sentencing
the other possibility I guess for
delaying the sentencing is that the
sentencing would reveal something that
Muller does not want to be made public
yet anything else interesting on the
Flynn thing for you Dan well I think
it's just we live in a world of
cascading crimes that we sometimes
forget about the other crimes and so
it's worth noting that when what he
knows about right addition to being a
foreign policy of our search from
throughout the campaign at the time in
which collusion is been alleged he is
also someone who is very close to Russia
and very close to the Russians
and most importantly and like this
should remain one of the biggest most
controversial and biggest red flags I
ministration we forget about it is that
a long time ago is that Clinton was
intimately involved in having
conversations with the Russians before
after Trump won that before he was sworn
in about potentially undoing the
sanctions that Obama had put in place to
sanction Russia for help neutral
the election and also the opening of a
secret back channel where between the
Russians and Kushner to help of a US law
enforcement intelligence services these
are huge red flags think that Flynn has
first-person knowledge of and that he's
apparently telling Muller about so like
we forget about Flynn because we're so
focused on Cohen and metaphor but in the
rush of part of the investigation he is
sort of the rosetta stone yes yes I
would say that opening a back-channel of
communication to the hostile foreign
government that influenced our election
with the purpose of electing Donald
Trump is certainly a red flag involved
in a plot to kidnapped a Turkish citizen
on American soil and returns in Turkey
for money so there's there's also been
kidnapping
ransom for hire stand all that he was
allegedly involved in who hasn't been
involved in a little kidnapping plot
right that goes on to serve in the
highest level of the government I mean
this hat you know how many national
security advisers Tom Donnellan he had a
couple of those I know okay let's uh
let's move on to manna fort who was
convicted on eight of 18 counts a list
of charges that included five counts of
tax fraud two counts of bank fraud and
one count of failing to disclose a
foreign bank account the jury couldn't
come to an agreement on the other ten
counts because apparently there was one
holdout everyone was 11 to one on all
the other ten counts but there was one
holdout and so basically the government
now has to decide whether they want to
retry those ten counts but even if they
don't even if they choose not to the
pain certainly isn't over for manna fort
who was also set to stand trial next
month in Washington DC on more than half
a dozen other charges including
conspiracy to launder money failure to
register as a foreign agent and
obstruction of justice Trump tweeted on
Wednesday that he feels quote very badly
for Manta Ford and his family quote this
is his tweet and then he put of course
this words in quotation marks as you do
justice took a twelve-year-old tax case
among other things applied tremendous
pressure on him and unlike Michael Cohen
he refused to quote break make and then
he said make up stories in order to get
a quote deal such respect for a brave
man a large number of counts 10 could
not even be decided we of course first
of all one big lie and that whole thing
was it wasn't a twelve-year-old tax case
the fraud was committed in 2016
among couple of other years 2014-2015
and of course we also heard on Fox News
when Donald Trump sat down for an
interview there he he basically didn't
say yes or no when asked whether he was
a considering a pardon for Manta for he
just said you know he's been treated
very fairly and sort of demurred dan how
big of a deal is the Manta Ford
conviction and what do you think comes
next here I mean it is just worth noting
that the president's campaign manager
who stayed in touch with the
administration and tried to it was in
the position of influencing
administration hires
was convicted of eight felonies in
stands trial for more the president's
campaign manager is a convicted felon
now insert the names David Plouffe Robby
Mook and the Republican Party would be
filing impeachment articles against
Barack Obama or a hypothetical president
Hillary Clinton this is this is a giant
deal on its face even if it tells us
nothing else about collusion the you
know potential campaign finance
violations talked about shortly there
was nothing else the president the
United States has the disturbing habit
of hiring and hanging out with criminals
and that should race that should also
read some red flags the American people
like I don't know how many criminals you
hang out with I mean so you know one one
of the many Trump reactions and what
Trump White House reactions to the Manta
Ford news is well these were you know
these were crimes he committed that have
nothing to do with Russia
forget about Russian it has nothing to
do with Russia collusion and
everything's supposed to be a Russian
inclusion and and that isn't even true
right so our friend norm Eisen and a few
others wrote this op-ed in the New York
Times they said the trial evidence
included mr. Mandor for its close ties
to pro-russia forces and his desperate
financial straits as he volunteered his
time for the next president he offered
briefings to a pro-russian sorry
he offered briefings to a pro Russia
Ukrainian all
gark and dangled a position in the Trump
administration in front of a banker who
provided him a loan for which he would
not otherwise have qualified so it does
seem like with this trial and with these
charges
Moeller is setting up a story here about
Paul Manafort as this person who was
deeply in debt to pro-russia forces and
then out of the blue said with all this
debt that I have I am gonna volunteer
for free to work on the Trump campaign
and help them and also by the way of
course he was in charge of the
Republican National Convention that year
and the platform and instrumental in
changing the platform to a more
pro-russia platform when a whole bunch
of other Republicans and conservatives
in the party disagreed so a lot of
coincidences there I guess yeah just
when you say when you tell that story
that you just told which we lose in the
moment-by-moment Twitter outrageous and
the things that happened it is an
incredibly compelling and concerning
story that you know this like we've said
this a thousand times but it is not
always true that when there's smoke
there's fire but there has never been in
the history of time this much smoke and
no fire yeah so the question what
happens next to manna for his defense
attorney Kevin downing said that his
client is quote evaluating all of his
options at this point I don't I don't
know how much time that's gonna take the
problem is with for manna fort is he has
less leverage now because he has already
been found guilty on eight counts and
the amount of jail time he could get for
those eight counts even at the least is
looking at you know seven eight nine 10
years the guy 70 years old it's a very
easily he could be looking at a life
sentence here so and that's even before
the second trial he's about to have in
DC where the evidence is even more
overwhelming and now he goes into that
trial having already been convicted of
eight counts which doesn't really help
so he seems pretty yeah he's got
his three choices it seems like go to
jail for the rest of his life cooperate
and go to jail for a good portion of
rest of his life or hold out hope that
Donald Trump will pardon him he seems to
be leaning to the latter and Donald
Trump through his mistress craisins is
also imagine this world where another
president's campaign manager was
convicted of eight felonies for tax
evasion and the immediate reaction of
the president was to tweet nice things
about them and it seems like if you're
Paul Manafort you see that's really like
maybe I hold that a little hunger I'll
be pardoned and therefore spend none of
the rest of my life in jail and so
there's a chance he will he may take
that path that seems to be the path that
he has been on to the beginning and it
is also worth memory because we can
never remember all the things that
happened is that we know from reporting
that John Dowd when he was Trump's
attorney spoke to Michael Flynn's
attorney and raised the prospect of
pardons
and so it is also possible that someone
close to close to Trump or one of trumps
attorneys has raised the prospect of
pardons for manna port as well so he may
he may be wait I mean it's this is
regulation but it but he very likely
could be waiting for someone who to wait
for Trump to do who was already pardoned
people like Joe Arpaio and Dinesh
D'Souza so part pardoning horrible
people is something that he seems pretty
calm for what and look we're gonna talk
about sort of what happens if Trump does
part and Manta for it but even before we
get there it's worth asking why Trump
thinks it's a good move to pardon Manta
for when pardoning him will help Paul
Manafort obviously but it doesn't help
Donald Trump in the sense that if Paul
Manafort is pardoned by Donald Trump
Paul Manafort could then be compelled to
testify against Donald Trump by robert
muller and he cannot take the fifth at
that point and if he lies under oath
then he is guilty of a new crime which i
guess i guess apparently you know Donald
Trump could just Martin Paul Manafort in
perpetuity he pardons him he testifies
against him Paul Manafort lies he
perjured himself he gets convicted again
Donald Trump convicts him again I guess
we could just you know pardon Paul
Manafort for
for a long time but I don't quite know
why Trump thinks it's a great idea to
Paulo - pardon Paul Manta for even aside
from the political implications of what
it looks like to pardon your former
campaign manager who basically was just
convicted of stealing 10 million dollars
from the American government by not
paying his taxes and defrauding the
government well the answer to your
question would be Donald Trump is an
idiot advised by idiots mm-hmm you know
that's always that's always your best
bet when you don't know what's going on
when you know the real answer that the
the probable explanation is we are run
by morons all right let's get to
Cohen the big the big one
Cohen admitted on Tuesday to violating
campaign finance law during the 2016
campaign when he made payments to two
women who alleged to have had affairs
with Trump and then as he stood up in
court
Cohen said that he did this for quote
the principle purpose of influencing the
election and that he was directed to
make the payments by the President of
the United States others implicated in
the court documents include the Trump
Organization American media incorporated
in the National Enquirer in one or more
members of the Trump campaign according
to The Wall Street Journal quote David
pecker the chairman of American media
Inc which publishes the National
Enquirer also provided prosecutors with
details about payments mr. Cohen
arranged with women who alleged sexual
encounters with President Trump
including mr. Trump's knowledge of the
deals so now here we are on Thursday it
is not just Michael Cohen's word against
yes all right welcome to pod save
America I'm John Favreau
I'm John Lovett I'm Tommy Vitor we are
coming at you from our new studio here
in crooked media headquarters see a
familiar curtain it's a work in progress
see a new fern-like thing that's
definitely a fake plant Elijah told us
we have to comment on the public access
nature of the studio for those who were
gonna seek video clips of this this
looks like are you listening to this it
doesn't really matter it looks like when
Laura Trump was doing Trump TV it's got
a real Wayne's World vibe for you
Millennials who like things that came
before your time anyway today on the pod
uh Tommy has an interview with Johanna
Hayes a first-time candidate and former
National Teacher of the Year who could
make history this fall as the first
african-american Democrat ever elected
to the Congress from Connecticut we'll
also talk about the latest in the Trump
investigation as well as the corrupt
goons who were running Washington dough
it down John I know I know just one well
sorry let's cut that um love it how was
love relieved it so good last week was
it amazing birthday edition yes it was a
birthday edition they made me dab Lauren
Mayberry of churches came by and she did
a dramatic reading of Omarosa is
prologue we had an awesome panel it was
a great show you check it out
what did Travis just put on the screen
make him dab if he says no chant until
he dabs yes it's great they did do that
that's such a good Jen and I dabbed
Congrats thank you like Paul Ryan anyway
so listen to that for the dabbing Tommy
I know you just recorded a fresh pod
save the world today I did I talked with
former deputy director former acting CIA
director he was both Michael Morell
about the John Brennan another secured
National Guard officials security
clearance dust-up with President Trump
over the weekend why is it a big deal to
real Donnybrook the fight we should be
picking you know get one when it's a
great detail all the context all you
need to know so check it out and for pod
save the world fan
and any fans of US foreign policy

out today that is called the blob it is
about Democrats and foreign policy and
national security Ben Rhodes is favorite
set of people we got Ben Rhodes we got
Samantha power we got Marcy wheeler Jake
Sullivan
all your favorites Matt does it's gonna
be great
what do you estimate just by the vengers
assemble also you know we told you we're
gonna make an announcement
we had a big an announcement on Colbert
last pod mm-hmm that announcement was
vote save America go to vote save
America calm vote save America is
basically our initiative to make sure
that everyone is registered to vote
allow you to find campaign events in
your area so you can go help out
volunteer mm-hmm and you'll get a you
get to look at your ballot a sample
ballot it's a one-stop shop John now the
key here mm-hmm couple of things one
when this idea for surface when we're
talking about it we're like that has to
already exist turns out it didn't so
thank God Tonya soma Nader's here she
worked at the White House digital office
helped us pull this together along with
Shaniqua our political director but not
all the features we just described are
ready yet it takes a while to put
together your ballot like the state
doesn't necessarily have all the polling
locations so don't get upset if it's not
there but you need to sign up now so we
can get you the information that you
need when it's all available yeah it's
worth it it's something we think will
help people just be engaged right cool
right now the best thing to do is sign
up with your email and what you can do
now is check your voting registration
and register online and like you said to
me as the as we get into September and
October all the other good stuff will be
there but already there's a ton of
events listed so when you actually sign
up it tells you what you can do where
you are to participate right now which
is a great first step and even more
importantly just share it put it on our
Facebook page tweet it out like tell
your friends about it because we have no
stake in this besides democracy this is
a tool we paid to assemble because we
want to make it easier for people to
vote and get engage that's the whole
thing
and so we hope people use it yeah do it
alright let's get to the news there were
quite a few developments in the
investigation
into the gang of dip shits running the
government right now so let's just go
through them one by one great on Friday
special consul robert mullet recommended
in a memo that former trump eight george
papadapolis serve up to six months in
prison for the crime of lying to the FBI
which he pled guilty to Muller says that
Papadopoulos has repeated lies about his
contacts with Russian officials during
the 2016 campaign cause damage to the
government's investigation Tommy what
did we learn from Muller's filing here
anything useful uh I think we learned
well with all things George papadopolis
it's hard to tell whether he's just very
stupid or very stupid and hiding some
very bad behavior but it's certainly a
combination of both I think a lot of
people thought that Papadopoulos was
cooperating constantly and offering all
kinds of good information in fact that
that's not the case according to Muller
and this document it says he lied to
conceal his contacts with Russians and
Russian intermediaries which the
government says prevented them from
adequately questioning key witnesses
there was a professor Massoud who was in
the United States pop-pop-pop adop Allah
didn't explain how important he was in
real time so Massoud went back to
wherever he is now and they were unable
to fully question and so you know we
learned that George isn't like molars
Golden Goose but he's an important
witness and he also is a reminder of the
steel dossier is not how this whole
Russia probe started it started with an
offer of dirt on Hillary Clinton to a
bunch of officials and George got drunk
and bragged about it yeah and even
though he's not he's clearly not the
star witness here it also the filings
showed just how extensive I thought the
investigation is because the memo says
the defendant did not provide quote
substantial assistance and much of the
info provided came only after the
government confronted him with his own
emails text messages internet search
history and other info it had obtained
via search warrants and subpoenas
including a phone he used while he was
in the UK yeah which he used to talk
with this professor at great length and
it was the fourth proper session where
he was like oh you would the London
phone wouldn't you say that like this
guy's in some trouble I mean that is
pretty stupid and and we should end by
saying he still has legal exposure
potential additional charges relating to
you know not acting as a foreign agent
conspiracy to defraud the United States
all the other good stuff mother's
looking to what do you think love it
George papadopolis is what technically
speaking is a dolt he's a dope he's a
real dope and he's going through quite a
little Martin shkreli phase on Twitter
oh yeah yeah and I don't think it ends
well for him he's like for tweets are we
ever buying a wu-tang album you know
it's really not good but anyway when you
staff your campaign with criminals and
the when you say if your campaign with
criminals and the drugs or Republican
politics some of they would end up in
jail okay well let's on that note let's
move on to the next goon
which one the New York Times reported
over the weekend that White House
Counsel dawn McGann has been extensively
cooperating with Mahler's team sitting
for at least three for at least three
voluntary interviews that have lasted
more than 30 hours altogether well you
know what I say John was that what's
good for the goose is good for them
again but I always say The Times
reported Magan and his attorney couldn't
understand why Trump was so willing to
let him speak with Muller's team but the
Trump's attorneys felt their client had
nothing to hide Trump apparently was
also mistaken that the White House
Counsel represents him personally and is
there to defend his interests not to
represent the White House in the office
of the presidency itself
The Times followed up with a report on
Monday that Trump's lawyers still have
no idea what McGann told Muller's team
when he met with them though then there
was a sort of a late-breaking Washington
Post story before we started recording
that said McGann's lawyer in an email
said that he does not believe that
McGann incriminated the president in his
testimony in that and Wayne in fact that
you sent an email to a bunch of people
in the White House and the legal team
saying he did not incriminate him also
just we just pause for a moment to say
that's where things are at at the White
House where McGann has his lord hey can
you do me a favor I'm having a room
getting real weird vibes at work would
you mind just sending an email for me I
think if I sent it it's weird you mind
sending it and don't even say that I
asked you to send it just send it that
says I didn't incriminate the president
in federal crimes
because I work with these people but you
don't understand I work with them every
day it's so weird well they'd it's funny
that mean they did say like well if he
had incriminating the president if he
had witnessed the president committing
any crimes he surely would have resigned
because I'm sure he's a man of
upstanding characters again again a
hilarious thing I think you'll know the
president is a criminal because that's
when I'll quit
Tommy how significant is this story you
know it's hard to tell yeah I mean one
one initial thought I had when I was
reading it was I could finally
appreciate how frustrated Trump must be
with this whole process because he picks
up the paper and he learns about how his
White House Counsel is cooperating far
more than he ever knew with the
investigation that could take down his
presidency and now he's in a position
where if he fires McGann it could be
used against him in an obstruction case
so that sucks I don't really feel
sympathy for him but I get why he's best
there's some question though about the
motive behind this leak Marcy wheeler
we've had on the show really strongly
pushed back on the idea that McGann is
cooperating here by choice and that he's
really doing anything special because as
the White House Counsel he's the
government's lawyer he's the lawyer for
the office of the presidency he doesn't
have the chance to assert
attorney-client privilege like you would
in a normal case and Bob Bauer writes
about this on lawfare it's pretty well
established law so they're trying to
make this argument that they've been
incredibly transparent with the
investigation Trump's team loves to cite
the fact that they've turned over a
million pages of documents but a lot of
this is sort of a smokescreen because if
you're turning over like a million pages
of emails that are news clippings it
sorted meaningless like the key is that
Trump still hasn't sat for an interview
Bush and Cheney did during the plane
investigations so the other key thing
that Marci pointed out was McGann and
this whole article is about the
obstruction of justice charges it
doesn't say at Muller asked McGann about
Russian collusion specifically even
though he was the key lawyer on the case
on these issues so I'm the kid on the
campaign I'm sorry he was the key lawyer
on the campaign about these issues he's
like a campaign finance experts so
McGann faces real risk here and it sort
of glosses over that fat
but I don't know I just think it's so
awesome that Magan apparently decided to
be really helpful and cooperate it
because one day
Trump's other lawyers Ty Cobb and John
Dowd went to a fancy steak place and you
know talked a little too loud at lunch
in New York Times reporter heard them
bitching about Dom McGann and so he was
like well these guys are trying to screw
me I'm gonna go cooperate with Muller
and this place is just a snake pit and
it's gonna kill them all it seemed as if
from all the reporting that McGann
believed that Trump mount may make him
the fall guy for obstruction and be like
well I was given advice by my White
House Counsel that I could take these
actions whether it was firing Comey
whether it was telling Co me to let
Flynn off all this kind of stuff and he
remembers that John Dean President
Nixon's counsel they tried to set him up
as the fall guy for Watergate Dean
obviously pled guilty to obstruction
charges and then cooperated with the
government to help bring down Nixon and
so McGann from a gans point of view he's
thinking I want to cover my ass
I want to cooperate with Muller and I'll
end like you said and if I don't
cooperate with Muller now he could
subpoena me anyway right yeah it's
interesting it's been a lot of reporting
about whether Trump's whether Trump
thinks Trump did anything wrong what
seems to me as obvious what what seems
to me is obvious is that done McGann
doesn't believe that Don McGann
facilitated Donald Trump breaking the
law at the White House and so it would
make sense to me that he would try to
protect himself but but you know Bob
Bauer made this point about the fact
that and and Tommy you made it to that
McGann is required to cooperate to me
what's more interesting molested in the
kind of meeting out of guilt like is
Trump trying to drop the dime on McGann
is began trying to protect himself
whether it's from what happened during
the campaign or what happened in the
White House what I what to me is more
interesting and important is the White
House Counsel had to spend 30 hours
talking to Robert Muller because of all
he knows around this investigation and
how wrapped up his office now is into a
series of investigations into very
serious federal crimes which is
as Bob Bauer pointed out it's a it's a
unique situation for the White House
Council to be in to have been be a
witness
to be a witness in this way and to
continue and to be a witness while
continuing to play the role of White
House Counsel well and all the
president's lawyers and a lot of the
people in the White House have said for
a long time oh we don't believe that
it's possible that Donald Trump could be
charged with obstruction of justice or
could be guilty of obstruction of
justice or it could be impeached for
obstruction of justice rightly we don't
think this is a real thing and clearly
Don McGann doesn't believe that because
that's why I don't we can't set down and
wanted to cooperate about this now the
question is why did Trump let him again
do it in that well then that seems to be
a whole there's some problems I mean
like there seems to be a couple buckets
of frustration one everyone's mad and
McGann's lawyer didn't fully briefed
Trump's legal team on how much he said
how long he said it etc - there was this
early strategy where Trump's lawyers for
some reason believed him when he said he
didn't do anything wrong knowing that he
is a long history of lying to everyone
including his family and lawyers and
figure and they decided let's fully
cooperate with this inquiry and then you
know the Rudy Giuliani's of the world
have shut it down since McGann was
opposed to that strategy from day one it
was like sounds like you know Steve
Bannon has been on the record forever
saying that participating or cooperating
with the investigation was mistake so
that flight is happening I mean in the
day you have a bunch of largely
incompetent people who don't trust each
other battling it out constantly it's
like it's gonna be a horrible outcome
even you know even Trump himself can't
help but reveal the underlying
criminality we're all assuming as part
of this conversation because he's saying
things like Don McGann's no rat yeah I
know a favorite you can't rat somebody
out for not breaking the law
that's not how Wratten people out works
also have you not watched anything I
thought I know you fast-forward through
the non violent parts of movies but
there has been cut you have you not
caught a conversation in Goodfellas the
villain in the Nixon White House was
starts with Nixon dare you rat on
Richard Nixon I mean we kiss or get
caught up in the details of like who's
ratting out who and everybody well I
would like to step back for a second
all these from the White House
are telling Axios that began was a
helpful witness to trump they're glad he
cooperated because he was helpful and
they said quote in the two meetings to
discuss firing Comey the president was
instructed by aides that this is not
going to end the investigation it's only
going to make it worse the heat will be
turned up and Trump said I understand
that but I have no confidence in him so
I'm going to fire him that's a good fact
said the source first of all look anyone
imagine Donald Trump saying I have no
confidence in him anymore I'm going to
fire him of course not but also like
that we we know that's all
because Donald Trump told Lester Holt
why he fired Jim Comey and then which is
which is because of the Russia thing and
then the next day in the Oval Office
when they were the Russian
Foreign Minister in there Donald Trump
said them oh the pressures off me now
because I got rid of Comey and he was on
my ass about that Russia thing there are
no like well you know Donald Trump what
he cares about most of all is competence
and in the people who serve in his
administration loyalty disloyalty help
him hurt him what matters to him is the
faithful execution of our laws give me a
break also I was reminded that Trump
tried to get Don Magan to deny a New
York Times report that said Trump had
pressured him to fire Muller and McCain
had to remind him like hey boss you
actually did do that even though Trump
right and then Trump went old Rob Porter
another great guy working in this White
House to tell him again that if you
refuse to make a statement denying the
story that he be fired and began again
refused so like of course all the ways
you've so meta again ask call me for a
loyalty pledge ask Co me to let Flynn go
fires co me
tries to fire Muller well tries to get
sessions to fire Muller publicly
pressure sessions to fire today that he
can take over the investigation anytime
if he won the legal thing here is a
corrupt intent corrupt intent to
obstruct justice it's also like you can
step even further back from all of this
you know so much of so much of the
stories you guys talk about this on
Thursday that that so much is happening
in the open but as if but we're
constantly searching for that secret
that's gonna that's gonna make the new
difference it's gonna change everybody's
mind here again what we are seeing is
extraordinary reporting that the White
House Council has spent 30 hours again
last week vice-president pence delivered
a speech where he outlined the
administration's plan to create a
military command dedicated to space and
establish a space force as the sixth
branch of the US military as soon as
2020 so it's easy to laugh at President
Trump and his dumb tweets like
spaceforce all the way exclamation mark
but I wanted to take the idea seriously
and see if there's some merit here and
if there's a need for the United States
to double down on its investments in
space and specifically military
technology in space so I'm really
grateful for you for being here with me
and talking through all this complicated
stuff great thanks everybody is joking
about space force but we we do have some
legitimately big problems in space that
need to be fixed right okay and so you
know an important point I think is the
military is already operating in space I
think right we've got satellites for
communication there's intelligence
collection satellites you've got missile
defense there's GPS and other similar
technologies used to guide precision
munitions we've gotten missiles that go
into space before coming back down into
the atmosphere to hit their targets what
is the military footprint like in space
and what is the what is the costs to the
US taxpayer to invest in those
technologies yeah well so space is
really important to the military it
generally allows the Pentagon to fight
the kind of wars that it wants to fight
and that means operating anywhere in the
world it means getting there quickly
fighting in very precise and effective
ways so all the things you mentioned and
I would also add that they play a role
in command and control of our own
nuclear forces and weapons play into how
the military does does business it's
part of almost any operation you can
imagine or conflict that the military
plans for involves and relies upon space
assets our adversaries I you know
according to pensive speech are
investing in space-based defense
technology do you think they're
investing more than we are and me heaps
Penn specifically meant
that in 2007 China hit an old weather
satellite with a missile which he called
a very provocative demonstration of
China's growing capability to
militarized space but is that a big
concern that you could you know use a
missile to take out a bunch of
satellites and suddenly we don't have
eyes and ears yeah that's actually one
of a lot of concerns the United States
the space acquisition budget is around
10 billion dollars a year it's not jump
change I was big and so but but that's
actually why Russia and China are trying
to contest that because there are ways
to do that that don't require them to
spend nearly that amount of money so you
mentioned of course the anti-satellite
weapons the china test in 2007 which
destroyed its own weather satellites and
tracked who were you know still dealing
with the thousands of pieces of debris
in space from that but there are a lot
of other threats too you can
theoretically use cyber operations to
spy on satellites collect that data you
could spoof or even change data so what
we are seeing might be wrong you can
maybe even hijack satellites
theoretically there's also electronic
warfare so you can jam signals that are
going to and from satellites so Iran
reportedly did this in 2009 when they
used electronic warfare capabilities to
jam transmissions from Voice of America
into Iran and then the newer set of
threats that a lot of people are talking
about is directed energy or lasers to
blind and confused satellites and so we
hear that Russia may be trying to field
an airborne laser that would be able to
blind our satellites in coming years so
there's it's it's definitely the anti
satellite kind of physical destructive
component of this is worrisome but
that's not nearly the only you know
threat threat that we have are we gonna
have like spaceship equivalent of c-130s
with with Star Trek enabled or looking
men and women on them with laser guns
like or is that is that a very distant
future yeah I don't know about that I
mean it's this you know the logo later
we can yeah talk about that but I mean
so many of the capabilities that DoD has
is our satellites right it's right it's
not the traditional vision and depiction
of you know of the sci-fi future but I
would also mention that that it's not
just the military these same assets are
something that we all are civilians
really rely on so GPS is the obvious one
that's used for military purposes but we
all rely on it for our you know map
services and future automated vehicles
but the timing component of it is also
really interesting space assets
synchronized time so that we are all
exactly on the same clock and that
doesn't just matter that you and I are
like meeting up at our you know meeting
spot at the same time it matters because
cell phone towers for example doing the
kind of transition between different
cell phone towers as we move around
depends on this precise timing some day
the electrical grid might rely on this
very precise timing to manage the power
flows of electricity so the civilian
reliance is really big and and given the
vulnerabilities something that's pretty
concerning so it seems like just based
on what you've told me so far you know
there is a lot to talk about important
things to invest in it seems like the
idea isn't on its face silly but we also
have a bit of a checkered history of
investing in space-based technology
right and I'm thinking about I'm not
thinking about NASA which did incredible
things land on the moon spun out all
this technology that we all use today
but Reagan had his so-called Star Wars
program which I think blew through 30
billion dollars in ten years before
being effectively abandoned should that
should that worry yes that history yeah
definitely I mean this is one of my
concerns with the proposal is the the
bureaucracy and the resources and the
potential not just for waste but for
energy and attention to be spent on an
organizational move that will take a lot
of energy but won't necessarily fix the
things that needs to be fixed in in
space right I mean the space force may
ultimately be a bad idea but it's not a
crazy idea the idea it's been raised
many times over the years Congress has
been asking DoD to do better
organizationally in space for several
years and you know have been pretty
dissatisfied with the trajectory of that
so and there there are good arguments
for and against all these things it's
not just a totally crazy idea so let's
talk about the process you mentioned for
how they'll create the space force by
understanding it sounds like they start
with a space command that's overseen by
a four-star general and that has a
special acquisitions office I guess that
would sort of sounds like Special Forces
Command or like CENTCOM is that a is
that an accurate comparison yeah so
there are four major announcements that
vice president Pence made and the first
one was this space operations force so
these are like the elite war fighters
who really know space
this kind of already exists but it's not
really being dealt with in you know
really cohesive way where these forces
are being managed these are the guys
that operate satellites they track
objects in space they you know monitor
and detect those threats and I think the
good thing about this part of the
proposal is it this this cadre of more
elite operational space war fighters
will go to places like Pacific Command
which has to think about and plan for
conflict with China or European Command
which has to think about and plan for
conflict with Russia and they will
integrate and kind of
the game of space in in that that
planning in some of the other you know
the other commands the second thing that
vice president Pence announced was
creation of a space development agency
so this would to get to your acquisition
question earlier this would be the
agency that that buys things that that
that purchases the ten billion dollars
and figures out how to prioritize that
money and what is supposedly good about
this organization is that it wouldn't
have to follow the very painful
acquisition rules that are so slow and
really just pretty broken yeah within
the Department of Defense in general so
it's circumvent some of those rules and
then it would also engage better with a
private sector which is going pretty
gangbusters with new space capabilities
and things like you know satellite
swarms and and other things that the
military could could really get in on my
skepticism of of this particular part of
the plan is do you really need a whole
new agency to make the rules a little
bit easier for space I think it's it
could be an addition of bureaucracy that
you could probably find other ways
around and then the other major
announcement was the creation of Space
Command so Space Command is not a space
force a space force would be a military
department or a service and that is the
component that that trains organizes and
equips your forces the Space Command
would be an operational element that
uses those forces got it so this kind of
confuses me because there is no other
area where you have both the operational
command and a service so it's really
unclear how these things eventually turn
into
spaceforce over time and if you don't
take the right time to evolve it and
figure out what your plan is I think you
could end up with a pretty messy
situation yeah it sounds like the
near-term step they'll create a new
civilian position which is Assistant
Secretary of Defense for space who will
report up to the Secretary of Defense
but that is on the road to creating a
fully independent Secretary of space
force as a whole new branch of the Armed
Forces so I would guess it would be Air
Force Army Coast Guard Marine Corps Navy
space force right I mean that feels like
a huge bureaucratic monstrous process
that would worry me in any scenario it
is and not only would space force be you
know like like the Marine Corps so the
Marine Corps is within the Department of
Navy there have been ideas floated in
fact the House of Representatives passed
some legislation that never made it to
final but to make a space Corps within
the Air Force but the president was very
clear that in this case it is a
free-standing independent separate
branch of the military and when you I
mean just as an example of the trappings
that goes with that when you make a
command so when they make Space Command
as a combatant command that comes with a
historian write an inspector general
public affairs officers legislative
affairs officers it comes with a
security detail for the commander so
there's a lot of trappings that that
come with that if you do a service I
mean services in the Pentagon have
hallways upon hallways of offices doing
manpower logistics Intel for structure
so there's there's a huge amount of
structure that goes into any of these
organizations and even if you try to you
know go light you could go light on this
conceivably but these things really have
a way of taking on a life of their own
yeah they really do I mean you did a lot
of work on standing up side
come and write and we're writing and
thinking in work of the Pentagon was
that process messy was it worth it was
an important to mean how would you
compare the space force command to what
you guys did in terms of cyber yeah I
mean I think that the debate over what
what to do with cyber and what to do is
space has been very similar in nature
when I did and I've led the cyber
command elevation packages I mean we we
looked at that at least three times over
five years and sometimes made the
decision not to do anything and then
finally we decided to elevate so it was
a very long and considered process the
same has kind of been happening on the
space side they've been talking and
thinking about a space force or a space
command for a long time
so it's not like the idea is new but
what what really strikes me is if you
ask anybody in the Department of Defense
right now why is Cyber Command an
operational command and space is going
to be a military department like why did
you choose to take one what we call a
domain and make it one thing and another
domain and make it something else right
nobody I guarantee nobody would be able
to give you you know fully reasoned
answer to that yeah there's a lot of
things about the the DoD structure that
has never made sense to me for example
why is the second largest air force in
the world the US Navy I kind of get it
they depend ships right but like you'd
think this could be somehow made a
component of the air force is there a
reason not to make space force a
component of the air force yeah well so
the argument is that the air force just
doesn't really have it in their DNA to
do space well they are too focused on
air power they are too focused on
you know what is necessary for air and
not space and so that culturally they
can just never you know truly be a
strong advocate for space so this is
actually it's the same argument that
they used to pull the Air Force out of
its original home in the army because
the army so focused on land warfare
could never truly understand air so so
there is an argument and a feeling among
some space experts over time that the
Air Force just hasn't been able to do
what it really needs to that you need a
more focused advocate for space are
there like game-changing military
technologies being developed that aren't
necessarily space-based but that might
touch on space that were you for example
I think pence in his speech talked about
Russia and China working develop a
hypersonic low altitude missiles that go
you know something like five or more
times the speed of sound that could
strike us in hours if launched from say
China that are maneuverable there would
be able to circumvent all our missile
defense systems you know you mentioned
earlier of laser based weapons
there's always reports about ship
killing missiles are there like things
that are out there that could be
game-changing and and truly put us at a
disadvantage yeah definitely I mean I
think that that that at all that they
all fall into the bucket of kind of
asymmetric weapons I mean things that
are relatively cheap and relatively easy
to do on a on a shoestring that can
counter our advantage
cyber operations falls into this
category
as well as you know some of the other
kind of counter satellite anti-satellite
capabilities that we've talked about I
would add to your list drones and
automated capabilities that could really
could really change what secretary
mattis calls the the character of
warfare oh god its base drone he
believes that it'll never change the
nature of warfare but in terms of the
character of warfare there's there's a
real possibility that that is changing
over time and that's I think reflected
in the broader strategy where the
Department of Defense has said Russia
and China and the competitions there are
now our top priority is there a scenario
where there's some sort of space-based
technology developed that people are
thinking about when they talk about
space force say I mean I guess it could
be simple as the ability to take out all
our satellites at once that would would
create that overwhelming advantage
that's something that is that people
have identified and actually talked
about I'm not sure I I don't know as
much about the specific space
technologies because frankly a lot of
that just happens in the classified
world right right what I think would be
a game changer for us is if we find a
way to be extremely resilient to the
threats to our space capabilities and
and I think it's actually the one of the
biggest arguments not to pursue a space
force is that you shouldn't be so
focused on space as the place as a place
you should focus on the things that we
need to do in space communications and
navigations and warning and so some of
those things can't don't have to be done
in space they might be able to be done
through new kinds of terrestrial
communication systems so if you focus
too much on space you fail to identify
what some of the other technologies are
that might be land base
that can help us make sure that what we
use space for is always available to us
even if a China or Russia is attacking
them so to your question about the game
changers I think there needs to be a
more holistic look not just at the
things that are in space but making sure
that that we can still do those missions
what you just said I think echoes what
the US Secretary of Defense Jim mattis
had previously said about the space
force which is he didn't want to add a
separate service that would likely
present a narrower and even more
parochial approach to space operations
what do you make of him laying down that
marker and then seemingly flip-flopping
on it not that long after when he now
says he supports the space force is is
he doing his job and and and you know
lining up and saluting and doing what
the president says or should he be you
stick it to his guns here about you know
tens of billion dollars worth of
investment yeah I mean I I would I will
be speculating but I think that there is
a little bit of resignation I would
imagine that you know this this
directive has come very very explicitly
from the president and pence there's
probably been some work in this report
that has raised up other ideas that has
made the military a bit more comfortable
with with doing this if they can figure
out how to phase it the right way and
you know do it in ways that they're more
comfortable with but but it's it was
very notable in March and June when
Trump started talking about this and
when he directed the Pentagon to do this
process it was not whether we should do
a space force it was how we should do a
space force right and it's not clear how
he got this bug in his ear right if if
he just liked the ring of the of the
term space force or if maybe somewhere
in the press
some of doings a space strategy that
they released in in March somebody
raised this idea and and it just
captured him but but but he's made you
know no bones about it and that it
wasn't the I would imagine that it was
not the normal kind of process where
agency comes and says here are your
three or four options to achieve a
particular objective it was directed
from I to do this I think the moon
landing is the last global event that he
remembers in full and the rest is hazy
um there are a bunch of technologies
that we all enjoyed today that came out
of the space program that came out of
NASA there's satellite TV there's memory
foam pillows there's modern tires on
your car there's the foil blankets that
people use after marathons water
purification systems it goes up the list
goes on it I don't there you go dried
ice cream um is there an argument
they're trying to develop big bold new
technologies or take a big swing like
creating a space force even if it's for
we are here with secretary Hillary
Clinton at her home in Chappaqua to talk
about her book what happened thank you
so much for being on pot save America I
am thrilled to be on pot save America
really happy that you all are here today
well so love it has been asking for this
for so long I mean it's not like begging
I just glad it worked out but I am so
delighted that you're still asking I
don't know what we'll do after we
actually complete this podcast we may
have to think of something we have other
shows we made among events we have a lot
coming down the pike do you really yes
okay I need to hear all about that John
I do want to let our podcast listeners
know that her guard is down Hillary
Clinton's guard is down so you write in
the book about the challenges you faced
running as a woman one silver lining of
2016 is that a record number of women
have now decided to run for office what
advice would you give them about how to
grapple with a kind of sexism that you
grappled with during the campaign I'm so
glad you started with that John because
you know I wrote this book to explain
what I think happened but also to raise
issues that I think we have to deal with
so that they won't have the same impact
on the next election and the one after
that and I write a whole chapter called
on being a woman in politics because I
was really quite taken aback at the
attitude and the behavior of my general
election opponent because he made no
bones about it literally he was so
sexist and not just about me but about
his Republican woman opponent he is
women and reporters on TV and elsewhere
so it was really a part of the
atmosphere and I want not just women but
men as well to know this is endemic
sexism and misogyny are still endemic
we've made progress but we can't allow
ourselves to go backward and as I point
out in the book
it never was just about me I happen to
have the big bullseye on
headbutt it was about women and in the
months since we've seen reports out of
Silicon Valley and other businesses as
well as politics we're distinguished
women like Elizabeth Warren or Kamala
Harris or Kirsten Gillibrand or you know
others in the media are being treated to
a level of overt sexism that I thought
we had at least diminished and maybe put
a lid on but it seems to have popped
back up so I'm hoping that everybody
will read in my book that chapter
because I want everyone to think about
it and be serious about it and then I
think we have to stand up and speak out
men and women alike
so when Kamala Harris is basically told
to stop talking or Elizabeth Warren is
told to stand down we need to say hey
wait a minute
you know that is overtly sexist and
we're not going to put up with it and
her colleagues and everybody else should
say the same thing so the excerpts of
the book that have leaked out so far
have set off another round of Bernie
versus Hillary recriminations everyone's
favorite pastime now I know that
elsewhere in the book you give Bernie a
lot of credit you say that the debate is
overblown that you actually agree on
most issues but it seems like there's
still an important debate about what
comes next for the party that we should
talk about so from the spring Washington
Post poll found that 67% of voters think
Democrats are out of touch with the
concerns of the average person and that
includes 44% of Democrats to turn this
around do you think the democratic party
needs to fundamentally change as an
institution with regards to policy or do
you think it's about sharpening our
message better technology in the party
and stuff like that I've given this a
lot of thought as you might guess
because it is deeply distressing to me
that we are painted like that and I can
only speak again from my own experience
which I try to relate in the book I had
such a different experience in o8 you
know as you all know because you were
part of the Obama campaign once it was
over it was over and
I quickly endorsed President Obama I
worked really hard to get him elected I
was still arguing with my supporters at
the Denver convention telling people
don't be ridiculous you've got a vote
for senator Obama at the time and I was
thrilled when he got elected I didn't
get anything like that respect from
Sanders and his supporters and it hurt
you know to have basically captured the
nomination ending up with more than 4
million votes than he had but he dragged
it out and he was so reluctant but why
would we be surprised he's not a
Democrat and that's not a slam on him
that is just a repetition of what he
says about himself so what I'm focused
on are people who are proud to be
Democrats people who want to defend the
legacy of Democrats of our last
president and presidents before who have
done so much to help so many Americans
economically in terms of civil rights
human rights and I think we are facing a
couple of very difficult obstacles first
the other side has dedicated propaganda
channels that's what I call Fox News
right it has outlets like Breitbart and
you know crazy Infowars and things like
that in this particular election it was
aided and abetted by the Russians and
the role that Facebook and other
platforms played we are late to that you
know we did not understand how a reality
TV campaign would so dominate the media
environment and I confess you know I was
trying to do everything I could to build
on the success of President Obama's
campaign I had a lot of people you guys
know involved in the campaign we were
really proud of it but boy it was tough
to break through so I think the
Democrats can do a lot but they are
still going to face a very difficult
media environment and we've got to
figure out how we're gonna break through
I mean obviously more podcasts more
other ways of communicating so voices
can be heard and real positions can be
understood is part of it but we're still
at a disadvantage well so what do you
think of recently , Harris
both Warren have signed on to Bernie's
single-payer health care plan do you
think that's a good idea do you think
that we need some of these bolder
policies oh look I've been for universal
health care for many decades and there's
a difference between single-payer and
universal health care under President
Obama we got the Affordable Care Act so
we got to 90% coverage and one of the
differences we had in the primary
campaign was my very strong defense of
the Affordable Care Act and my strong
defense of what President Obama had
achieved and my recognition that we had
come so far that I was certainly not
going to support ripping it up and
trying to start all over again but in
terms of a political statement to say
we've got to get to universal health
care and maybe we should consider you
know some kind of single-payer besides
Medicare which is single-payer and
Medicaid which is largely single-payer
we need to be looking hard at this but I
think that the more likely outcome after
we try to raise the attention of the
electorate on what we could achieve is
the continuing struggle to expand health
care I said we need a public option I
was very clear about that so I don't
have any criticism whatsoever and
staking a big claim on where we need to
end up but I also say look let's be
realistic about how we're gonna get to
where we need to be so there was an
internal debate within your campaign
towards the end about whether to attack
Trump as divisive and offensive or
whether to emphasize your economic
message in order to win back some of
these working-class voters and your
husband reportedly advocated for that it
seems like Democrats are going to face
this issue again and again and we're
gonna face it with Trump we may face it
with others what should they do
obviously have to do both but it
campaigns about choosing resources ads
messages how do you face that well we
were trying to do both we never stopped
on the economic agenda and there's been
lots of analysis since the election I
talk more about jobs and anybody else we
put forth a really detailed set of ideas
about what would work we did not get the
kind of coverage that we need
you know I went back and looked I say
this in the book you know in the 2008
general election campaign there were 200
minutes devoted to policy by 2012 it was
down to about 114 minutes by 2016 it was
32 minutes and so all of the work and
effort that I did in this campaign and
that I saw others do because when you
run for president you should tell people
what you're gonna do that seems like a
pretty straightforward idea what just
not competitive with the reality TV show
going on on the other side and we tried
so many different ways to break through
that and we did of course advertise what
we saw as the threats that Trump posed
to the country because frankly we
thought and I still believe he's a clear
and present danger to America
and I would have been less than
responsible if I didn't talk about that
but we tried to do both we tried to make
the case for both and I'd be the first
to tell you it was difficult to break
through I want to turn to like realism
what does I mean you talked about now
you talked about in the book I feel like
the book is a nuanced
look at how these issues play out and
basically what caused this loss as well
as the realization that you should not
be in the same room with James Comey
anytime soon just for his sake mostly
he's pretty tall I think you take him
honestly I think you have the I think
you have the passion because you know
John brought up single-payer you said
this you said in the book Bernie and the
race meant you had less space and
credibility to run a feisty progressive
campaign that won in 2008 in
Pennsylvania in Ohio and I I didn't
fully understand that because I don't
understand why Bernie's presence
prevents you from running that kind of a
campaign well what I mean by that is
because we certainly were trying to run
that kind of a campaign is that his
claims which he could not defend really
not even explain when pressed filled up
a lot of space you know when I was
running against President Obama in 2008
we had differences but they were you
know this is my bias they were honest
differences that we presented and we
defended and
whether it was an individual mandate or
not in healthcare each of us was ready
to say here's why or here's why not that
was not possible in this primary
campaign and you know I I point out that
every time we made a claim on what we
were gonna do he would just say okay I'm
gonna do more of it and so the the
argument was never adequately joined and
I spent a lot of time you know basically
defending President Obama in a
Democratic primary hood I couldn't
believe it every speech started with I
don't think President Obama gets the
credit he deserves for saving the
economy saving the auto industry getting
us on the road to universal health care
and you know this is I was running at
somebody who publicly advocated
President Obama being primary right so
it was difficult to have what I consider
to be a fair-minded debate about okay we
have had a successful two-term president
where do we go from here with somebody
who wasn't a Democrat who criticized
both President Obama and me and it was
much more challenging to have a kind of
straightforward argument of okay health
care what are we gonna do about health
care because he would say oh we're gonna
do you know single-payer and I say well
how you gonna do it and well you
wouldn't know but the claim and the you
know laying down of the gauntlet on that
made it harder but one of the points you
make in that sort of lessons from all
this is that he has a point about the
importance of universal programs that
arguing for a big universal college or
or health care or what-have-you
makes a lot of sense to people first of
all it's clear and easy for people
understand and also it avoids the kind
of stigma that you have on things that
are more directed right the problem that
happened with the expansion of Medicaid
for example under Obamacare so it seems
like in a lot of ways yes in the moment
in a campaign some of these big promises
are more about vision but in practice
you do see the merits of having done
that right because it seems like that's
one of your recommendations for the
party moving forward well it's what I do
recommend that we try to figure out but
if you're gonna do it you got to be able
to answer all the questions that are
going to be raised and what was odd to
me about this election many things were
odd about it but one of the
it was odd about it is we came forward
with very specific proposals about
moving toward universality right and I
believe that to this day about how we
can get from where we are but I always
believed it turned out wrongly John that
there would be a moment of reckoning
because I'd always seen it in a general
election I always saw that at some point
whether it was in a tough interview or
in a debate somebody would say okay
you've had vacated for this how are you
gonna pay for it how are you actually
going to structure it that's what I was
waiting for it never came this time it
never came so yes maybe I was a little
more inclined in the primary because I
won by four million votes to say okay
look we're going to get there but we're
gonna do it in a very you know careful
thoughtful way because I really believed
a lot of the Trump rhetoric was going to
be you know finally punctured and that I
would be on a debate stage and somebody
said well you know you talk about this
wall what are you talking about where
did some money gonna come from or you it
never happened he was never held
accountable so a lot of my preparation
for those moments cuz I did think that
in many ways the election would come
down to the debates they often do it
didn't happen so one of the other
arguments you make for this kind of a
policy shop and I know these policy
people I work with them yes Jake
Sullivan is one of the smartest human
beings you can meet in your life you
talk about how these things had
footnotes and they were ready to they
were sort of ready to hit the ground
running and you said one of the problems
is it wasn't just about the merits of
these policies but is about the optics
of it right but at the same time you
recognize the need for a more expansive
vision for Democrats I mean one argument
against us on the merits is in a
campaign you set a big goal it may be
unachievable but you can compromise when
you're governing I mean you make the
comparison state of welfare in the 90s
and how President Clinton in the 90s
held off on signing on several versions
of a bill until he felt as though it
reached enough compromise and that's a
pragmatism of governing but isn't there
a distinction between the pragmatism of
governing and the vision and sort of
Overton Window you open during the
campaign I think that's a very fair
assessment but remember I was following
a two-term Democratic
and I was really aware of how important
it was to embrace that legacy and defend
it because on the merits I thought it
was really important and I believed that
if I had said okay we're gonna have
universal health care single-payer first
question would have been well why didn't
President Obama do that well because it
was really hard and what he got done was
amazing you know yeah see that's tough
whereas Sanders who's not even a
Democrat who criticized the president
all the time he could say whatever he
wanted to say I was not only running on
my own I was running to build on the
progress of the prior eight years I was
unapologetic about that but I also knew
the headwinds against somebody trying to
run to succeed a two-term president
their own party we're pretty intense I
mean Americans get bored they get tired
they want a change they think somebody
else can do something better even though
they liked Bill Clinton and they liked
Barack Obama but they wanted a change so
I was trying to be as honest as I could
about yes we're gonna build on the
Affordable Care Act we're gonna finish
the last 10% of people who are not
insured we're gonna be able to do it
because here are the fixes that will
make it work
and yeah I put me in a bit of a
straightjacket but it was what I thought
was called for given the fact that you
know I wasn't going to be spouting stuff
that then would be immediately
contradicted because well why wasn't it
done before
immigration is another example right I
mean daca was a great accomplishment I'm
for immigration reform Sanders voted
against it in 2007 and so I'm trying to
say we're gonna protect what we have but
we're gonna try to go further now that
is not as exciting as saying you know
throw them all out or whatever the
alternative is it was constant
calibration and you know it was it was a
tough line to walk so one of the other
debates one of the other argument you
had during the campaign was over money
in politics and it's one of the things
that Bernie levels against the
Democratic Party writ large and I think
it's important for moving forward you
know you say correctly
Bernie couldn't in that debate point to
a single instance once you changed your
mind because of donations but you also
said that you wanted to end the
stranglehold of the wealthy have on our
government and in the book you talked
about the danger of
according donors where is that danger I
mean you don't have to change your mind
for this money to have some kind of an
influence and what what do you think the
danger of courting donors is well I'm
for public financing and I put forth a
very comprehensive set of changes I
voted for you know mccain-feingold I
mean I think the Supreme Court has so
perverted our electoral system and
citizens united is a gateway to
corruption and I think we've seen that
over and over again so I don't have any
problem with people donating to your
campaign
and neither does Bernie Sanders by the
way because you know he takes money from
people as well what I wanted to do was
to say look we need a whole different
system and so I said I was going for a
constitutional amendment from day one on
citizens united because there's no way
to get to where I think we have to be
unless we change the Constitution but
until then we live with the system yes
and one of the consequences of this
system is raising huge sums of money and
going to amongst the financial industry
and other industries and raising money
going to the Hamptons and raising money
and for people who aren't proud to be
Democrats who maybe could be Democrats
it looks terrible and what they see is
access and influence and it's hard to
argue that they're wrong I mean isn't
there a price we pay for a system in
which Democrats were supposed to
advocate for working people it's been a
great deal of their time with rich
people have a fundamentally vested
interest in the status you know what's
so interesting I don't see it that way I
understand the argument but anybody who
donates to a Democratic candidate who is
she is the Democratic nominee for
Congress in New York's 14th
congressional district she strikes fear
in the hearts of Joe Lieberman and James
Comey welcome Alexandria Acacio Cortes
how are you I'm good I'm good so your
you've had this rise you've been
traveling the country campaigning
candidates want you there you've
inspired people one sign for me is a
bunch of people from our team at crooked
wanted to meet you and you should just
know that they're not banging down the
door when when dick durbin comes to town
what do you make of that what do you
think is driving that interest I think
that for so long
I think just lots of everyday people
across the country have been frustrated
with our politics and I think there were
certain aspects about my win even if you
take the politics off the table the fact
that we were a grassroots campaign that
you know I didn't take any lobbyist
money that I had defeated not just a
10th term incumbent but was outspent 10
to 1 and we still won I think it was
kind of this okay things are maybe still
possible in America that I think you
know really resonated with a lot of
folks across the political spectrum so
you've said our swing voter is not red
to blue our swing voter is the non voter
to the voter which is something that
because what we've been talking about a
lot what do you think are the issues
that are gonna get non voters to become
voters and and what have you learned
being on the trail you've been in Kansas
you've been all over the place yeah well
I think it's um it's kind of this
opposite of what I think a lot of folks
in the political establishment think
that they think that you know this
running to the center moderating our
policies being as close to a saltine
cracker as possible is what is going to
make us win elections and I don't think
that that's the case I think what
animates non-voters is feeling like
someone is really fighting for them I
think there are a lot of folks that have
felt as though the Democratic Party
hasn't been fighting hard enough for
them in terms of being really clear
about articulating our priorities
drawing a line
in the sand not just saying we care
about education healthcare and housing
but we believe in single-payer health
care you know just having a plan a an
idea instead of just reform and so I
think that that in order to turnout
non-voters we need to be really explicit
in how we are fighting for them in new
york 14 you know our district is half in
the bronx half in queens voter turnout
is 3% in the primaries and and we
expanded the electorate 68% over the
last off year midterm primary in order
for us to win and the under-40
electorate actually matched the
over-sixty electorate in our race which
is unheard of yeah but it's because we
talked about student loans we talked
about climate change we talked about the
things that our generation is gonna have
to deal with yeah so you face this
blowback I want to get to the
conservative blowback but there's even
been some moderates or or just you know
Democratic mainstream politicians who
have said hold on a second you know she
won in the Bronx but she doesn't know
what works in the Midwest or she doesn't
know what works in Kansas now I know
you've pushed back on that but I guess I
you know there are more non voters that
we can get to become voters and there
are Republicans that we can make
Democrats or independents that we can
get to turnout for Democrats but do you
think that there do you at least
recognize that there's a trade-off there
or do you reject the trade-off too so I
guess I would argue that you know what
maybe there are some independents that
might be turned off by moving to the
left but it's worth it because we can
get the non voters to turnout
yeah no I definitely I'm not here to say
that like my platform is going to win
everybody across all electorates but I
agree with you I think that there's much
more to be gained by targeting non
voters than by targeting Republicans and
even then you know I was having this
conversation last night when I think
about a swing voter all the swing voters
that I know in my life all the swing
voters that I've also met in my life
they never make their decision based on
who is the most moderate one
like they don't you know the people who
go for example your Obama to trump voter
they didn't vote for Obama because he
was the most Republican of them all you
know you didn't write and they didn't
vote for Trump because he was the most
democratic of them all I think that
swing voters make their decisions on on
factors that are actually independent of
political ideology and we're so we are
so boiled down and myopic about
left-right political understanding that
I think that we just like don't even
understand what a swing voter is I think
they've I think they vote based on
certain character based things I think
they vote based on authenticity about I
think they vote based on how much they
think they can trust one candidate over
another
I think they vote uncertain even like
emotional or character based factors
more in some cases than certain
political ideologies so then does just
being from what what is being for
Medicare for all then represent to those
voters is about being anti-establishment
is it about advocating for what you
believe in because if you if you take
that position that these are people that
are turning out for reasons other than
ideology yeah
what role does is the ideology play well
the ideology I think plays a really big
role because I think what people are
really thirsty for as well is that I
think they actually are looking for a
working class champion and as much as
Trump was lying through his teeth the
entire campaign trail if you took the
painful time to pay attention to his
rallies he was speaking very directly to
working-class people especially in the
Midwest he was talking about trade when
you heard him talk about health care he
was saying we're gonna make your co-pays
cheaper we're gonna lower your
deductibles he was describing the
outcomes of Medicare for all he was the
most liberal of the entire Republican
field on health care so I think that
people are really just looking for
someone that's willing to kind of stick
their neck out in order to advance the
issues of working-class Americans and I
think that that is in conjunction with
this idea of trust and often
and whether it's deserved or not I think
there's a real hunger for it what you
know you're from New York you're younger
than me which is annoying but the I
think there's a lot of people around our
age who grew up with Trump as a figure
in New York yeah yeah and actually for
me you know when I hear Trump speak I
recognize a certain kind of New York oh
yeah class voice do you have that
feeling when you when you hear it
totally totally I know like I know that
guy yeah like I know that guy I know him
really really well I may not have met
him but I feel like in this very bizarre
way that I understand Donald Trump's
soul
I have bar tended for Donald Trump I
have you know I have I've had guys cat
called me who are Donald Trump in New
York City you know my father was an
architect he's dealt with God like he
dealt with guys in business like these
shady real-estate developers I know that
guy like I know that guy and I also
understand his personality it's like a
very New York or archetype kind of thing
yeah and it's amazing he has that he has
that specific his skill is that he
doesn't sound like the kind of rich New
Yorker he will is he's always wanted to
be he does sound more like a Queens guy
yeah Bronx guy you hear it
mm-hmm he totally does it that's the one
thing that I don't understand - yeah
like that's the one thing that is kind
of a trip to me I'm like how does this
like multi-generational silver spoon guy
like something like this not just sound
like this but like he is he is it in a
weird way yeah you know but I I think it
also probably maybe has to do with the
industry that his family came from
because like these New York like
construction real estate developer guys
they kind of they have that personality
too so I think it has to do with the
industry that his family comes from that
he's able to channel that because it's
very much a thing like it's like a thing
like he's not an aberration which is why
like I I feel like I have the
to him that I have because I like I know
how to deal with guys like that and the
way that you deal with them is not
giving them more attention yeah I think
that well we've tried giving it more
attention and so far it hasn't worked
yeah so we I asked on Twitter what
people wanted us to talk with you about
and there were two main categories there
was some how it got into the
conservative blood stream what it always
seemed to have that effect of I think
they have like a search query yeah like
a Google Alert so you know there was a
lot of bad faith you know what happens
after you seize the means of production
but there isn't a mentality around
spending inside of that that I did want
to talk about you know we don't talk
about what defense cost imagine a
trillion dollars in debt because of the
corporate tax cuts yet and we talk about
pre-k health care college suddenly it's
unrealistic because of cost and it's not
just bad faith Republicans that make
that argument you hear it from Democrats
as well what's your response to that
well I think it's that same exact thing
it's that we you know they say how are
you gonna pay for it as though they
haven't used these same ways to pay for
unlimited wars to pay for trillion
dollar tax cuts and tax cut extensions
they use these mechanisms to pay for
these things all the time they only want
to know it just seems like their pockets
are only empty when we're talking about
education and investing in human capital
in the United States education health
care housing and investing in the middle
class all of a sudden you know there's
nothing left all of a sudden the
wealthiest nation in the world has it
were just totally scarce then we have
complete scarcity when it comes to the
things that are most important and so
for me I think it belies a lack of moral
priority and it's unfortunate I think
that but I also think a lot of these
folks especially those on I think
perhaps on the Democratic side perhaps
they don't even see it you know I don't
know I don't know if that's a generous
interpretation or not but I think that
they start kind of buying into
conservative talking points they get
dragged into
their court all the time and I think it
is because there's this really myopic
and also just misunderstanding of
politics as this flat two-dimensional
left right thing and so they always feel
like okay the right says this thing we
have to respond to it and that's why
they're winning that's why they've won
for the last ten years because they've
dragged us onto their Court and we we
refused to have our own strong message
to force them to play defense on yeah so
what I talk about what it means to have
that strong message because this is
another thing people asked about and it
was around democratic socialism and
about setting big goals versus when to
compromise and this is a fair number of
people like me who believe in Medicare
for all universal pre-k debt-free
college higher minimum wage progressive
tax code but I'm not a socialist I
believe in those things because I
believe in a regulated free market and a
social safety net what's the difference
between you and me I think the thing is
is that it's such a big tent term
because I could easily say that you're
not a capitalist because you believe
those things I could easily say that
capitalists believe in complete
laissez-faire you know invisible salad
fingers you know economy and that
because you don't believe that
corporation should dictate every single
aspect of your life that you are not a
capitalist so I think it's like a
similar thing in terms of this
conversation about socialism that unless
you like you are like a communist you're
not a socialist right and I think it's
it's one of these things where if you
believe in like the limitations of just
pure free market you know free market is
if you believed in pure free market then
you would believe in the ACA you
wouldn't believe in Medicare for all you
wouldn't believe in tuition free public
college but in order for us to build
wealth as a society we have to
understand that there are multiple
players and multiple sectors in our
economy that can build wealth
corporations and businesses build wealth
but
also when we for example decided to take
the affirmative and bold step into
building an interstate highway system
and to electrify in this country into
providing tuition-free public K through
12 education for all those are not
capitalist things but we have to realize
that there are there is more than one
way to build wealth and so you know a
democratic socialism the idea of
democratic socialism so there are people
that perhaps believe all the same things
you do and the difference is that they
would call themselves a democratic
socialist and other people wouldn't and
like I think that that's fine you know I
think that we draw a lot of artificial
lines in the sand plenty of socialists
would say I'm not a socialist it's like
that's and I don't even think that
that's what's really what's up for
debate right now right and I just think
that we make a lot of these
conversations about isms but at the end
of the day a lot of these isms are
ultimately academic definitions and the
world is so much bigger and messier than
that I guess I think that's right you
know I'm of two minds of it in part
because you know you know I see I see
the rise of democratic socialist groups
and and and activists as a good thing
it's a response to Trump it's a response
to feeling left behind by the Democratic
Party it's very clear that you have
pulled the party to the left in ways
that I think are positive but at the
same time my worry is well if you have
to be a Democratic Socialist to advocate
for these things does that mean that
you're implicitly saying that they don't
have a home in the Democratic Party oh I
don't think I mean I don't necessarily
agree with that I don't think that you
have to call yourself a democratic
socialist to believe in these things but
I'm also not a hardliner
some people are a hardliner I'm not a
hardliner kind of person I'm very
pragmatic so I meet everybody where
they're at even if you're like the most
Republican even if you call yourself a
Republican there are people who call
themselves Republican
I would say believe socialist things for
example if you're in a union that is a
form of democratic socialism is building
worker power so that a corporation
doesn't dictate and kind of undermine
your your right your economic rights to
you know basic human things that I think
are part of basic human dignity health
care a living wage union organizing is
like a very basic unit of democratic
socialism socialism it's a form of
putting democracy into the workplace
building collective power so that
workers can have a say and what happens
to them but you know I think that like
I'm not a hardliner
you know you could say I'm a union
worker you may not call yourself a
democratic socialist and that's totally
fine yeah I mean it's it's funny because
I've never I found it very frustrating
when people would as their sort of final
point and Bernie's not even a Democrat
right why I think that's dumb but the
same time you know one of my I think
after Trump won to me one of the
greatest fears was a that he would
attack institutions but also be that in
the wake of this incredible threat and a
sense of loss that there wouldn't be
unity on the left to me that unity is
really important so I guess what is the
value of being a democratic socialist
vers being a Democrat for you and I'm
not I'm not asking ya I'm generally not
curious well I mean I think that answer
is like you know super personal for
every person for me the reason why I use
this term is because to be completely
honest I don't know what it means to be
just a Democrat mmm-hmm you know like
there are Democrats who are anti choice
there are Democrats who don't believe in
a fifteen dollar or not even there's not
to be 15 bucks there Democrats who don't
believe that the minimum wage should be
a living wage there are Democrats who
are willing to allow fossil fuel
companies to do whatever they want and
so while I am happy to call myself a
Democrat I also want to be more than
that I want to communicate very clearly
that I believe in the United States
there
a minimum we should aspire to establish
institutions that are a minimum level
that provide a minimum level and
guarantee a minimum level of human
dignity in the United States joe
Manchin's a democrat mm-hmm
I'm not Joe Manchin ma Joe Manchin and I
are both Democrats but Joe Manchin
believes in coal he believes in you know
he may be voting for Cavanaugh you know
who's gonna totally dismantle roe v--
wade and allowed you know Trump to get
away with whatever he wants to get away
with and so for me it's not that I'm
it's not that that I'm going to you know
it's not that I'm here to burn the house
down
but it's that I tend to think that the
Democratic Party you know I am a
Democrat but I also kind of think that
it's a silver standard and for me it
adds a gold standard of guaranteed you
know to aspiring to a guaranteed minimum
level of economic and social dignity and
so there are plenty of people in the
party who agree who I think would
identify but they're also plenty of the
people plenty people in the party you
wouldn't agree right and just sort of
the the Joe Manchin argument so we had
Joe Manchin on and we pushed it pretty
hard to make sure that he would vote
against Republican repeal efforts on
health care and he was a vote on that
and the fact and I imagine if Joe and
Bancha were sitting here he'd say that's
all well and good but these are the
positions I believe I have to take and
when when you've needed me on votes on
health care I've been there when you
rather have a conservative Democrat like
me than a Republican who would be with
you on none of these issues well I think
we look at just look at what happened to
Joe Manchin this year Joe Manchin faced
a little to no talked about primary from
a woman on the Left apology and
Swearingen I know Paula Jean Swearengen
very well she's a Coal Miner's Daughter
she ran on no money like not only did
she run on no corporate money but she
she had nothing in two years for a
United States Senate race she raised a
hundred and seventy nine thousand
dollars total and you know like when
you're figuring stuff out in campaigns
like
she really had probably less than 100k
a little minute all right let's get to
the news at the end of a week where the
world was left to wonder whether the
President of the United States has been
compromised by a hostile foreign power
that's right a sentence that I just said
here in 2018 Donald Trump invited
Russian President Vladimir Putin to the
White House this fall and then spent the
weekend doing some good old-fashioned
rage tweeting where he once again
claimed that Russian interference in our
election was nothing more than a hoax
quote so President Obama knew about
Russia before the election why didn't he
do something about it why didn't he tell
our campaign because it's all a big hoax
that's why and he thought crooked
Hillary was going to win so guys we have
lots of other news to discuss from the
weekend and today but I don't want to
just breeze past this it seems pretty
clear that Trump meant exactly what he
said during the press conference with
Vladimir Putin yes you guys think yeah
welcome back the walk back walk back
it's and walk forward
he walked it back I mean he got a little
too much credit we talked about this he
got a little too much credit for his
initial walk back because midway through
reading the prepared remarks like a
hostage where he said that actually I
don't think dan coates is a mental
patient and I trust our intelligence
community and not Vladimir Putin he
threw in but it could have been anybody
he could have been a he couldn't stop
himself from throwing in the he walked
it back in the initial walk back already
and this has just taken it to its
logical conclusion ma'am Tommy do we
often invite leaders of hostile foreign
governments who've attacked our
elections to the White House do you see
a lot of value in that
no you're probably not going to get a
lot done you also you don't often invite
a foreign head of state who you just met
with accomplishing absolutely nothing
for a follow-up on your agenda last
meeting where you did some soft treason
maybe and no one really knows what
happened and it's it's not just us libs
who were surprised about this I believe
the news was broken to Dan Coates the
Director of National Intelligence by
Andrea Mitchell during an interview on
Friday and I think he said something
like excuse me
yeah no listen Dan was exactly where he
should be which was sitting in Aspen on
stage with Andrea Mitchell we're all
great thought leaders are it's important
for the head of the DNI to be there and
ass
been on a stage where ideas not working
or ideas are flourishing the idea in
that session was oh no the president is
a corrupt or is he question mark
in conversation Andrea Mitchell dan
coates I mean there's articles about
whether national security officials are
ever gonna get a full readout of what
was discussed the Russians are just
announcing things left and right new
partnerships on Syria things are gonna
do visa vie Iran etc etc and his own
administration has no idea what was
discussed what he agreed to what he
promised except for maybe this
translator who's just you know stuck
playing monkey it'll here between come
on American translator yeah where are
you translator and how's that memory huh
do you take any notes I want to just two
quick points one I think we need to get
Trump is like momento I think that he is
losing track of what he's supposed to
say and he needs to get a tattoo that
says I accept the conclusions of the
intelligence community on this arm and
then maybe I don't know don't do crimes
on this car and also too it is so
desperate to invite Vladimir Putin to
the u.s. right after the Helsinki summit
it is well it's there some time for the
midterms he's gonna be he's gonna join
him on the stump yeah he's got it how
does Putin pole in Michigan if he goes
to uh if Putin goes to Wisconsin he'll
have been there more than Hillary is a
long journey for that one and yeah and
all the way yeah I know I know all the
reasons that you have a problem with my
saying that I already know I know I
should do better I will do better but
it's just the point I was only I was
getting towards eventually it's just
it's it's it's a little bit you know you
went on a date you had a good day you
can't invite him to another date when
you get home you think it's too
desperate it's too desperate gonna wait
two days wait two days maybe maybe Putin
would text you Trump did you think John
wrote swingers is that why we're here
how cool would that have been huh
what have we replaced him with the
otherwise I thought it's all last year
that's why sign up at his company I
don't know anyone would notice what
about Trump's argument that the Obama
administration never warned his campaign
about Russia I realized that it's easy
to blow past a lot of these things but I
just let's do a little fact check on
this one yeah I mean
he's the president United States he
doesn't need to be like he can get
access to any information that we have
in the US government from the CIA the
NSA the entire intelligence community
anytime he wants he could walk into a
room and say tell me all the secrets all
the cool the moon-landing being
faked allegedly what area 51 all the
cool all the Russian hack me
he has access to all of it him to go out
there and claim he wasn't told about any
of this is so ludicrous and like lo and
behold of course as it always happens
now it leaks out that he got a very
detailed briefing August of 2016 right
after all of this went down I like it
was in the press like he didn't need to
be told by Obama Hillary Clinton told
him about it at the debate also I will
point at no puppet I would no puppet no
puppet you're probably you're the puppet
I'm the puppet no he's the puppet we're
the puppets both puppets Punch and Judy
those are puppets what await what are
those puppets from there there there's
some sort of old-fashioned puppet show
Punch and Judy I don't know I don't know
any I don't know anything more about
them other than there's Punch and
there's Judy this is very borscht belt
listen we have a lot of tweets after
this listen the point gonna make is only
why didn't President Obama warned me
about this hoax that isn't real that is
his argument I should have been this
entire scandal is that made-up hoax in
which nothing happened I should have
been told about I should have been told
about it by the president before before
I did the crimes
why didn't President Obama tell me about
the crimes I was about to commit yeah I
mean he was he was briefed in August of
2016 he then was told that Russia played
a direct role in the hacks against the
DNC which we know about because he then
said Russia if you're listening please
find the rest of the deleted emails and
go hack them and John you're being
unfair okay they did a different
different Act they did they took his
implicit invitation and did a related
hack which is apparently a skull Patrol
just acts like a casual observer of the
country that he runs it drives me
 crazy that's what happens when
no pundit and a Fox News pundit you know
what becomes president you know so Trump
in various Republican politicians and
pundits also spent a lot of time this
weekend lying about a newly released
previously
classified application by the FBI to
obtain a warrant to monitor the
communications of Carter Paige a former
Trump campaign official who the
government had reason to believe was
interacting with Russian officials who
the law that allows the FBI to apply for
this kind of warrant is known as the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
which is why it's often referred to as a
FISA warrant we had some people on
Twitter asking us to please give us a
brief on this what what if I have Warren
is Tommy before we get into this
specific case what is the process for
obtaining a FISA warrant it's incredibly
onerous I you can now read it I mean
there's a long application where you
have to fill out all this probable cause
you can put for a judge George Soros
okay George Soros gets Hillary Clinton
on the blower you're right you get one
of his typing helpers too he presses he
presses the deep State Steve speed dial
sorry sorry for interrupting so yes so
you go to a judge
all of them in this instance were
appointed by Republicans and they
approve it or not and you have to go
back on a regular basis to get it
reviewed and renewed so it's a pretty
closely held process here and what what
new facts did we learn from from this
application being released even though
it was heavily redacted we learned a
number of things I mean one I guess I
don't know that we learned this for the
first time but we learned that Devon
newness is a discredited liar I don't
know if you want to get into this now a
little later okay
do it so remember when this was all
being discussed in the first place
dumb Devon our friend and if you if you
want Devon Nunez to leave Congress check
out Andrew Jannes for Congress's Twitter
account web page where ever you want to
go Chris go google his name you'll get
that his wwww have been tried the same
Devon tried to say a bunch of things one
was that the steel dossier
we all remember Chris teal he put
together the P tape dossier was the sole
basis of the FISA application that is
not true
Nunez also tried to say that the steel
that the FISA application didn't say who
funded the steel dossier that it came
from a partisan source that is not sure
there's like an entire page of notes
about how the source might have been
compromised and the judge is allowed to
evaluate on that on the mayor
we also learned that the 5s application
wasn't solely based on the CEO dossier
and that it was approved by four
Republican judges and then it got longer
every time because new information was
added presumably because they learned
things that were relevant or important
about Carter pates in the process and so
we've learned that you know everything
the Republicans have done in service of
Donald Trump trying to defend him from
charges of collusion has been a lie
but like the bigger problem here with
Trump is that he tries to conflate the
page surveillance with the the look into
the collusion generally like the right
the investigation into Russian
interference in our election and they're
simply not the same thing well that's
what yeah the FBI applied for this
warrant in October of 2016 which was
months after Carter page left the Trump
campaign so he was no longer an employee
of the Trump campaign so the idea that
it was to sabotage the Trump campaign is
sort of silly and it was already months
after they had already opened an
investigation into connections between
Trump officials and the Russian
government
so because of George papadopolis so the
idea that Republicans keep pushing the
Republican pundits keep pushing that the
whole Muller investigation was based on
that dirty dossier and this application
is completely false they opened the
investigation after George papadopolis
got drunk in London lab in London some
Australians he didn't know and blab to
an Australian diplomat about meeting a
professor who offered all kinds of dirt
on Hillary Clinton that's what began the
investigation in this in this
application the FBI offered evidence
that Paige was the subject of quote
targeted recruitment by Russia and its
efforts to sabotage the 2016 election
and that he'd been Koch quote
collaborating and conspiring with the
Russian government they had probable
cause to believe that that is not a
small thing
no that was not a small thing Carter
took a trip to Russia in July of 2016
the steal dossier alleged that he met
with senior Russian officials he lied
and denied that and then when pressed by
the House Intelligence Committee he
finally admitted that he did meet with
senior Russian officials just not the
ones mentioned in the steel dossier so
Carter hasn't shown himself to be the
most trustworthy narrator of his home
life which if you've ever seen him on TV
we're not surprised yeah look I think
there's one thing we certainly don't
understand which is what makes Carter
page tick
you know what gets hit back him out of
it I don't care I don't care how many
warrants for surveillance you've got on
Carter pay yeah I need a mystic and a
divining rod and I don't know what I
mean it's also important to because the
holding steel dossier cuz it was paid
for by you know the Clinton campaign or
the Democratic Party or law firms
connected to Democrats it's garbage
right it says in the application in
subsequent FISA renewals the Department
of Justice provided additional
information obtained through multiple
independent sources that corroborated
Steele's reporting this is important
they did not just take the steel
dossier and put it in application and
say to the judges now go approve it they
independently corroborated the reporting
that they needed to get the application
with various other individuals which is
why the judges approved it then but
another very important point was even if
they hadn't done that in the same breath
Trump in his like associates try
to claim the steel dossier as bias and
shouldn't be the basis for a FISA
application but they argue that Clinton
cache an oppo research book paid for
with Steve bannon's muddy should lead to
an FBI investigation into Hillary so
they are lying idiots who are trying to
have both sides and it's simply not how
the process works you are allowed to be
a witness and have some sort of
political or personal bias against the
person you are discussing yeah it's just
it basically boils down to this the old
conspiracy peddled by noonas Trump
Republicans and all their favorite
pundits on Fox was that the FBI have
lied to these FISA judges that somehow
they had concealed things in the
application and that they didn't and now
that we know that they revealed
everything they needed to in the
application because now that the
application is out the new conspiracy is
that judges were in on it too and
someone should look in on the judge this
is what Andrew McCarthy said on Fox News
and Trump retweeted and Hugh Hewitt and
all these people judges personally
picked by John Roberts right and looking
a lot of national security experts and
and legal people said we shouldn't focus
too much on the fact that they're
Republican appointed judges because just
because they're judges and the judiciary
is supposed to be independent should be
enough for people but it is worth
pointing out that yes they were all we
can appoint a judges selected by John
Roberts and and I also think what's
important to know is we're learning a
lot of this but Devon newness isn't
because he hasn't read the application
Devon has put together a memo
well if we remember he defeated himself
in the memo right because we actually
learned from Devin Eunice's attempt to
discredit this FISA application that it
was also based on Papadopoulos and that
that came first so he kind of began
discrediting himself earlier but I also
think we're in this debate now where
we're too baiting whether or not the
FISA application was legitimate the FISA
application is what four hundred pages
it is an extraordinary document it is a
it has first of all tons of it is is
blacked out and redacted so we have
actually know a good stuff yeah the good
stuff that they're saving that for later
that is for the other season three yeah
we don't get that we don't get that yet
we're gonna get 30 years from now is
gonna be you know will read in Acts EOC
but so we'll finally get to the wall a
big fight will happen
Axios will release it and of course
they'll have the long-form version which
is seven words but of course if you're
too busy there'll be a to work version
 but but you know we you know the
three of us got us at this debate over
over the evolving explanations for the
problems with the FISA application
started with saying that the steel
dossier was the cause than it was oh the
steel dossiers provenance wasn't
revealed now it's just this seems weak
and the judges are in on it they're kind
of running out of eggs
there's the stool is out of legs yeah as
I often say but that is a big takeaway
yeah which is let me do sorry let me
just finish the point which is only that
what we're talking about is a ton of
evidence about a conspiracy involving a
foreign government to involve themselves
in a presidential campaign and collude
with the Donald Trump campaign and then
administration what we're talking about
the the scale of the scandal is some
time lost in the debate over these picky
and details about this warrant but you
read the thing and you read the little
excerpts you like this is this is the
FBI screaming holy there is a
massive massive conspiracy it is
incredibly dangerous and we need to find
out what's going on right the big big
big picture take away from me is that
Trump's biggest offenders the worst
fringe right wing media the Mogga
dead-enders like kim Strasse land Hugh
Hewitt Trump's kids
House Republicans they will lie and
cherry-pick everything yeah
there's no way up is down they don't
care it is so brazen and then the bigger
problem here is known in the Republican
Party is really checking I'm like Marco
Rubio who we criticize a lot on the show
to his credit went on the sunday shows
and pushed back on the notion that this
application showed any wrongdoing but
these guys you know they've refused to
stand up for Trump for so long and like
every bully ever in the history of
reality in film saw weakness and pushed
and pushed and pushed until we got to
here and so you know Paul Ryan has
allowed Devin Yunus to run the House
Intelligence Committee and it's been
completely politicized and we're in a
place where there's just one news
channel and one right-wing sort of media
ecosystem believes one thing based on an
identical document and it is it is hard
for me to wrap my brain around how weird
and crazy and dangerous than well
because it's they've also succeeded in
making this a fight about whether Devin
newness is an idiot or a liar or not
when that's clear right when the when
the real take away love it like you were
saying is like oh my god the FBI had
probable cause with judges agreed with
them that Carter Page was leading an
effort to collude with the foreign
government who we know now because
they've been indicted for this sabotaged
our election and and it references many
other people so I'm there and
potentially other people and
specifically one thing that has been
public for a while but it's not talked
about enough the fact that Carter page
went to Moscow shortly before he joined
the campaign and then the Republican
convention was held and even though the
entire Republican establishment did not
want the platform to be changed to be
more Pro Russia than it was somehow the
Trump campaign decided to make the
welcome to plod save America I'm John
Favreau I'm John Lovett
Tommy Vitor later in today's pod we're
gonna talk to independent journalist
Marcy wheeler about president Trump's
meeting with Putin and about the latest
indictment in the Muller investigation
which includes the most detailed
accusations we've seen so far about
Russia's interference in the 2016
election lots to talk about today guys
on Friday American prosecutors indicted
a dozen Russian military operatives for
sabotaging our 2016 election by hacking
and stealing emails analytics and other
sensitive information from the
Democratic Party in the Clinton campaign
today at a press conference with
Vladimir Putin President Trump sided
with the Russian president over
America's own law enforcement and
intelligence agencies saying this quote
my people came to me Director of
National Intelligence dan coates came to
me and they said they think it's Russia
I have President Putin he just said it's
not Russia I'll say this I don't see any
reason why it would be guys any type I
know we deal with truly awful dishonest
unhinged Trump comments every hour of
every day but today really does feel
different to me there are a few moments
of the Trump presidency that I think
will truly stand out in history as the
most disgraceful Muslim ban
charlottesville family separations and
now I would include the Putin press
conference in Helsinki in front of the
entire world basically the president
noted States betrayed his own country to
defend one that sabotaged our own
elections I want to get your reactions
to this but first we have a special
guest in studio he tried to get a few
questions out at the press conference in
Helsinki but he flew back and he's here
with us today joining us on the pot is
Joe America hello it is me Joe America I
just returned from Helsinki I have to
say so you were watching different press
conference than me I saw men lead from
behind I was there obviously as
correspondent for NRA TV hired by a
lovely woman who owned furniture store
but also involved in politics deeply
strange
anyway I thought Trump did very good
very strong he is leading from behind
very far behind some people like to lead
from behind kind of close to the fronts
others lead from very far back that is
what I saw and feel like you people have
lost your mind side he was it was very
cool event very cool I was in some place
called Hall of Mirrors
Hall of Mirrors because it is on the
notes as you people say as I say
American on-the-nose anyway in are a
very good Pro America NRA times USA
forever ever thank you Joe America we
just thought we had to leaven this a
little bit it was it was a tough day bad
day of news and so thank you to Joe
America Tommy what did you uh what were
your reactions watching this Monday
morning well I just want to agree with
everything joe said but then they did
today did feel today felt different it
was it was it was well first of all it
was disgraceful I mean to watch
were used to Trump complaining about the
missing server and complaining about
Clinton and you know the election
results at at rallies or on Twitter but
like to see him do that at a joint press
conference with a foreign head of state
was just it outlined how crazy and
pathetic it actually is he didn't offer
even a mild rebuke of Putin not a single
harsh word he attacked Muller Hillary
the DNC stroke a Pakistani Channel man
like he was all over the map but not a
single word about election interference
all the things they're doing in Syria
alright anything else like he tried to
use the same rhetoric used on North
Korea to spin himself out of criticism
saying oh we should have had this
dialogue a long time ago before I got
the office or missing the fact that the
u.s. talked to Russia all the time in
fact you guys used to attack Obama over
the Russia reset all the time so it did
feel like the reaction was different too
we spent a couple hours in the office
just watching Fox News and they actually
were pretty hard on Trump a lot of
Republicans were hard on Trump so I
think we we learned something today you
can get criticized from the right if you
coddle Putin both sides debate between
literal Nazis and Klansmen and if you
show any compassion towards immigrants
by proposing a daca fix those are the
things will get you attacked by the
right in this country
love it do you want to do you want to do
a reaction and in the Jon Lovitz voice
yes sure I think that'd be better yeah
it was fascinating to watch in some ways
because this is not it's a it's both
surprising and not surprising it is not
surprising that Donald Trump stands next
to Putin and says exactly what he's been
saying all along right this is the exact
tenor he's taken the deeply strange and
and hard to explain
tenor that Trump has taken towards this
one country no problem standing next to
Merkel and criticizing her no problem
going after the UK an interview but
stands next to Putin and he can't find
can't find the words to be critical at
all he just shrinks and yet it is still
surprising and one thing that I thought
was really fascinating today and
watching the reaction is something
flipped I have never seen so many
reporters politicians including Chris
Wallace of Fox and and all the way to
NPR openly talking about whether or not
Vladimir Putin has damaging information
about Donald Trump I mean this is an
extraordinary thing we're so used to it
now because we've been hearing about
compromise for such a long time but that
were openly discussing it that to me
feels like the shift I mean we were
talking about this before we started
about what Adam Davidson said about us
reaching the endgame and this does feel
like feels like we're getting close to
the truth yeah but what happened what
what happens once we arrive at that
truth yeah is you know of much concern
to all of us with the Congress that we
have now but it does seem like we are
inching closer to the truth
I don't know if we're getting any closer
to the truth although I think we're
getting a lot closer to it being a
completely okay thing to say for
everyone to call and say I'm
just grateful that was I mean I cut back
from the press conference Anderson
Cooper Anderson Cooper's like that was
most disgraceful thing I've ever seen
from a president on foreign soil and
then you have Chuck Schumer doing a
press conference today where he said I'm
left to believe that they they have
compromising information on president
Trump I mean things that I think we're
seen as fringe or with things we kind of
joked about about the P tape are now
mainstream and real and I just think
like one thing that kept coming to my
head about the setting
was like there in Helsinki there in
Finland they share a border with Russia
they've had to build up their military
in recent years because there's a real
credible threat from the Russian
military right on their border and Trump
goes into this meeting by selling out
NATO and the EU and then he's coddling
Putin in this event in Helsinki I mean
it is terrifying these are like very
real stakes for the people living in a
country for the entire world and our
country looks like a joke you mentioned
Chuck Schumer I want to get to his
question from his press conference which
I think sort of sums it up which is what
could possibly cause President Trump to
put the interests of Russia over those
of the United States I think that's the
sort of the big question hanging over
all this but before we get there tell me
I want to take a step back a US official
directly involved with the Helsinki
summit told CNN this was not the plan so
what a moment of candor this wasn't the
plan why did they make that read treason
button to press at the event you didn't
see the treason coin they made with with
Putin and so my question was what was
the plan why have this meeting in the
first place what could the trump
administration possibly think the United
States would gain from this Putin wanted
this meeting right the easiest thing for
Trump and the Trump administration to do
would have just been to say no thanks
we're all good on the meeting this could
become very awkward Trump could say
something great why what were they
hoping to achieve with this meeting it's
easier to not fly to Helsinki than to
fly no one ever goes to Helsinki by
accident it seems like the only reason
they had this summit was because a whole
bunch of people told Trump not to have
the summit so yeah you're right he was
just hell-bent on doing it and
if you if you take him at his word he
thinks that if he's buddies with Putin
he can turn to him at dinner and say why
don't you knock it off in Syria or why
don't you help us out with North Korea
but that's just not how Putin works it's
not how the world works so it was
ill-considered there was no preparation
in his own team didn't seem to go into
this thing with much of a plan they
weren't allowed in half of the
meeting I mean there's those two
tranches that by the way very strange
like I think Obama probably had
one-on-one meetings with like Bibi
Netanyahu
or David Cameron with no notation her
staff yeah like really really close
allies the idea of going into a meeting
with Vladimir Putin with just a
translator is very odd
I mean maybe on the edges of a summit
you to pull aside pull aside maybe
there's something that is really
delicate that you only want to say in
the smallest possible setting or like
you don't trust Sergei Lavrov the
Foreign Minister if you're talking about
mid vetted when he was in power but this
is a weird this is setting Trump up for
failure because Trump is stupid and
Putin is pretty crafty so so now for the
big question is there is there any
explanation for Trump's love of Putin
and refusal to take Russia's election
sabotage seriously other than the
obvious one what is now the obvious one
which is that Russia has something on
Donald Trump and we should go through
what something could be because you know
everyone's like haha the P tape we joke
about the P tape all the time but
there's other things that he could have
over him there is there there could be a
financial reason right we've talked
about you know and Don jr. idiot Don
juniors that is before like a huge
cross-section of our assets are from
Russia we know that you know Trump
bought a whole bunch of properties in
cash there could be money laundering so
there could be that that was the
financial reasons there's also the very
simple one that if Russia did help Trump
well we I mean sorry if Trump did accept
Russia's help in the election if there
was collusion then Russia has that over
Trump right but so what what are the
what possible explanations could there
be for this that don't involve having
something on try having leverage on
Donald Trump so there's one there is one
and this is where you have this overlap
of the fact that the Trump characters
like overwritten right because it would
be enough for him to be a TV host with
like a personality disorder and it would
be enough for him to be a compromised
foreign agent criminal but it's both at
all times and there is absolutely truth
to the idea that if Donald Trump were to
admits that the Russians interfere with
the election to help him win it would be
admitting that in some way his election
is illegitimate and is absolutely true
and he's not as great as he thinks it's
not as great as he think he is
his ego can take
it's too embarrassing he would he would
he just can't he can't bring himself to
concede that and so no information can
confirm that to him I think that that is
a reasonable part not all of it it's a
reasonable part of of his behavior I
don't think it's enough to explain the
slavish slavish slavish slavish devotion
to Vladimir Putin the refusal to
criticize him on any front right because
the the the reason that that explanation
is not enough is because Donald Trump is
not just solicitous of Putin on the
issue of Russian interference he's also
solicited as a Putin on the issue of
Ukraine and Crimea and NATO and NATO and
Europe and all the rest and elevating
Putin and being so kind to Putin so I
don't believe that just the narcissistic
explanation is a and I think the biggest
reason or the narcissistic explanation
is not sufficient is that Donald Trump's
praise of Vladimir Putin did not begin
after the election once it was revealed
that Russia interfered in the election
right all through the 2016 campaign he
praised Vladimir Putin and played
praised him as a strong man and said and
excused the murder of journalists and
and and imprisoned and all the human
rights abuses that he had he did that
all through 2016 maybe he just digs
kleptocrats with authoritarian
tendencies who you know are into white
ethno states yeah I think that that
there is a true as a kindred there's
well that's the kindred spirit X okay
spirit theory there's that he has
leverage over them there's the ego
there's the kindred spirit we're both
authoritarians just sitting here in the
world in 2018 trying to figure just
trying to figure our way through the
world a couple of couple of P tapes I
just like one really weird thing
from this press conference I got some
attention in his opening statement Trump
said oh you're going with this he
brought up Russian interference with
Putin and then he was like but I'll let
Vladimir address it directly because he
raised an interesting idea
so then Putin like twenty minutes later
it goes on to say that the Russian
Federation will let Muller come to
Russia and Russian officials will
interview the Russians that Muller wants
extradited and that representative from
the team can sit in on that but there's
a big catch which is that Putin wants
access to US persons including Intel
officers agents whatever week
committed illegal acts against Russia
then he cites Bill Browder wrote a book
called red notice who's this like
billionaire who was basically driven out
of Russia because he was trying to fight
for his friend Sergei Magnitsky who was
killed there's a great pot save the
world on this check it out and says that
Browder's associates funneled money to
Clinton so it seems to me that the
interesting idea is that we give over us
Intel agents to Putin to be questioned
and harassed and maybe bill Browder to
like what the that's uninteresting
batshit crazy Donald Trump's called it a
great idea tastico idea literally like a
plot of literally the plot of the
villains of the film Specter and it's
like boot all putin had to do was was
cite the idea that Clinton might have
gotten money somehow in this scheme he's
like oh great my default fall guy
Hillary Clinton let's go there yeah that
was that was pretty weird right that was
pretty weird
yes right is the it's the it's the the
idea that you know like he hears from
Putin he hears from US intelligence who
can decide right that's it's the other
it's the underlying explanation for how
you could say something so ludicrous so
the White House spin on this which they
you know funneled through Jonathan Swan
of Axios was his brain can't process the
collusion and cyber attacks are two
different things
is one that's not spin here's a tip
whenever you're a White House official
telling a reporter the president's brain
can't process ex-boss too dumb yeah this
isn't a crime thing the prisons brains
all broke and we got a broken president
brain and it's a classic case of broken
president brain and everyone's getting
all crazy because they think that some
crimes happening really just that the
president can't process simple facts
he's got a McRib stuck in there 86 it's
mostly special sauce up there next their
next explanation he seems
constitutionally incapable of taking
anything more refined seriously again
when you say that the president is
constitutionally incapable of something
that's a problem and then they also went
on to tell Swan that a lot of them are
not proud of the man they work for
you're kidding well yeah well keep a
hold we won't hold our breaths for the
resignations you cowards have been
saying that since
Charles Ville and not one of you has
quit in protest just a quick shout out
to Reuters and the AAP by the way they
did a great job at that press conference
and really like asked him simple
questions and he up like it yes
the model it was it was quite good you
know I mean look I think the upshot of
this is whatever the reason Donald Trump
is in this for himself he only cares
about himself his own interest his own
ego saving his ass whatever it may be he
is not thinking about the United States
he's not thinking about America's
interests it is not just on this issue
it is on every single issue in
every decision he's made in every
statement he's uh turd since he's become
president the man does not care about
anyone but himself he will throw his
family under the bus he will throw his
aides under the bus he will throw the
United States under the bus and he will
throw the United States allies under the
bus and he showed all of that during
that press conference and today was a
disgrace and there's pretty universally
immediately described as such but
remember the Trump people described the
Access Hollywood tape release date is
this big inflection point where you
either with Donald you a ride-or-die for
Trump or you were not and you were out
of the club permanently he was he has
trained everyone around him to have
blind loyalty and the only people that
will be able to weather this with him
will tell him that he was great so
they're never gonna course correct
they're never gonna fix this even if it
gets hammered from the outside although
as you as you mentioned you guys
mentioned we talked about some of the
reactions let's go through some of the
reactions from conservatives and
Republicans because I don't think I've I
don't think I've seen anything like this
since the Access Hollywood tape from
bored Charlottesville or Charlottesville
yeah one of the most disgraceful
performances by an American president in
memory Republican Senator John McCain
shameful Republican Senator Jeff Flake
an affront to American democracy GOP
Congressman Peter Roskam I've seen in
Russian intelligence manipulate many
people in my career I never thought the
US president would be one of them
Republican congressman and former CIA
agent will hurt disgusting Fox host Neil
Cavuto an idiot savant
Geraldo know that is also a backhanded
compliment no negotiation is worth
throwing your own people and country
under the bus
Abbey Huntsman
Fox & Friends host and daughter of US
ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman who
sat there and did nothing and is somehow
still ambassador today yeah not really
maybe get your dad on the blower Abbey
see what he thinks
um so you know obviously everyone on
Twitter where all these Republicans make
president Trump nominated to the Supreme
Court Brett Kavanaugh a 53 year old
judge who currently sits in the United
States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit Cavanaugh spent most
of his life in Republican politics he
worked as staff secretary for George W
Bush before that he worked for Ken Starr
in the 90s where he investigated whether
Vince Foster's death was really a
suicide and helped write the report to
Congress that led to Bill Clinton's Bill
Clinton's impeachment blast from the
past gonna be fun for everyone since
then however he's also said that
indicted a sitting president would ill
serve the public interest
fivethirtyeight.com ranked the
ideologies of these potential nominees
and Cavanaugh ranked as more
conservative than Kennedy Roberts Alito
and gore such basically as right-wing as
Clarence Thomas gentlemen first
reactions to this pick I mean I think we
all just this has been a bad day for
everybody and I think we all just need
to be honest that this is a seismic
shift in the makeup of the court we've
now gone from Kennedy is there to center
swing to John Roberts is the center of
the court he the swing vote to the
extent that there is one which shows you
how much it's shifted and like I hate to
give the Trump Whitehouse credit but
they've done an effective job of
managing this process they did so
Gorsuch they prevented leaks they are
selling their nominee in a primetime
address but it's also it's an example of
Trump being fully owned by these
interest groups I mean you know if
thinking back during the campaign Trump
sort of floated his sister as maybe
being at the Supreme Court yeah remember
and then Ted Cruz kicked the out of
him for it and called her a radical
pro-abortion extremist she's better than
Cavanaugh to think it's a nice thing you
say about the current president sister
and so weeks later they released a list
judges generated by the Heritage
Foundation and then later on it was
added to with this Federalist Society
lists run by a creep named Leonard Leo
and so I mean the whole goal of this
list in this process to make sure
there's not another Kennedy there's not
another moderate so we need to worry
that everything we care about from roe v
wade to the you know the right to
organize in the union to the affordable
care act is at risk I mean this is a
monumental brutal day for people who
care about what we care about love it
yeah I think that's right yeah I guess I
mean I just say it's not you know what a
surprise
Trump chose a right-wing white guy who
hates the Clintons and doesn't believe a
president should be indicted so I mean
what a twist yeah let's talk about what
a twist
choosing Cavan I mean like you said
Tommy it's crazy that we got to a point
where we have a Republican president
who's just gonna automatically pick from
a list that a far right-wing group put
together that special interest group
that demanded he pick a certain justice
so that's crazy and it's both speaks
also too it speaks to the dirty deal at
the heart of the Trump administration
the dirty deal of Republicans will look
past the corruption and chaos and
vulgarity and racism and misogyny to get
the judges this is that this is
it so of course he does he's like you
mean they'll tolerate me if I just
choose a judge from this list and I'll
love me okay I'm done I don't care right
well it also and let's talk about among
the four finalists he could have picked
Hardiman who was the runner-up last time
to Gore such Hardiman though had a
background that wasn't quite as defined
didn't have as much writing some people
thought maybe on certain issues Hardman
might be more moderate some of the base
was a little worried that he might be a
judge Souter was famously picked by a
Republican president and then turned out
to be more moderate than they thought
Amy Barrett another possibility
also people didn't know exactly what her
rulings were so this is definitely the
most it's probably the most partisan
pick because this person was Cavanaugh
was in Republican politics for a very
long time has the most opinion like he
has a paper trail that's just miles long
from when he was staff secretary in the
White House it was where McConnell is
worried about apparently that paper
trail well that's what so that's that's
the point here this McConnell apparently
over the weekend told Trump that he was
more nervous about Cavanaugh being the
pick because he thought that there was a
longer paper trail he said that he was
concerned about the volume of documents
Cavanaugh created during his 12 years on
the court of appeals as well as I his
role in the Ken Starr
investigation as well as his role in the
bush White House and Heath and McConnell
was worried that Cavanaugh could help
the Democrats delay the nomination until
after the new court session begins on
October I want to talk about the bush
White House ears for a minute because
when you work at the White House every
email you send or every document that
you work on this part of the
presidential Records Act has to be
stored and kept so Cavanaugh's emails
are sitting somewhere at I guess the
bush library the the archivist controls
them and so when when the Obama White
House put forward Alana Kagan to be our
Supreme Court nominee we had that they
went through all the emails down a
little rock there were the Clinton
Library from her time in the Clinton
administration and released them and so
Democrats and the press need to demand
that Cavanaugh's emails all be released
but they should all be placed online
they should not be in some box fax
somewhere how people fly down there
should all be on a website like Kagan's
are right now because that's the
president yeah
and it's well so what is it what do we
think it says about Trump that he went
with what is potentially the riskiest
nominee to get through the Senate what
what was it about Brett Kavanaugh that
he likes so much more than Hardman or
Barrett or Catholic or some of the other
possibilities one thing could be that
Cavanaugh wrote a briefing once that
said that the president itíd state
should have quote absolute discretion to
determine whether and when to a point or
fire a special counsel and that a
president should not be criminally
indicted no matter what evidence of
wrongdoing is uncovered yeah we were
talking about these we were when the
names were first coming out we were
talking about them at the office and and
and and it was I was like oh people are
saying that Kevin does not the smart
pick because all these other people can
get through easy eat more easily and
Cavanaugh has this record of saying this
thing around investigations and it's
like well it's not the smart pick unless
you're a criminal
then it's a really smart pick to pick
the guy that will protect you yeah I
think that's probably a piece of it I
also think the Trump just wants a fight
he doesn't like it yeah he's in P likes
fights his operating principle with this
White House is to fight about
everything whether it's tariffs or the
courts so this guy oh people tell him
you can't pick this guy I'm gonna pick
this guy also
I mean apparently he was had had some
problems with Cavanaugh's ties to the
Bush administration because he just
treats all things bush like they're an
enemy but we don't know we can't get
inside this bozos brain I mean I'm sure
we'll get him over that I think that
these special interest groups probably
told him who they wanted him to pick and
this has been a foregone conclusion for
a long time
let's hope with some of the other issues
what we know about Kavanagh on the
Affordable Care Act he's argued that
even if the Supreme Court upholds a law
a president can refuse to enforce some
of it so that's that's great news for
people who care about the Affordable
Care Act he has declared the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau
unconstitutional on Roe vs. Wade
during his DC Circuit confirmation he
said he played the game where he said
he'd respect precedent and declined to
share his personal views so we can
expect that anyone on this list that
Leonard Lee he'll put together is gonna
try to overturn roe v-- wade but I think
it's gonna be up to Democratic senators
to try to probe during the hearings to
try to get something on it yeah this is
a simple one there's a huge difference
between someone saying as a lower court
judge I will respect a precedent and
someone who is going to be on the
Supreme Court saying they're going to
respect a precedent respecting a
precedent at a lower court level is a
totally different matter so the the I
already see that being put out there by
people trying to kind of I assume get to
Collins and Murkowski but it's it's it's
a totally unrelated point yeah the other
thing we know about him is when he was
nominated to the Circuit Court of
Appeals
it was held up for a long time because
Democrats thought he was too extreme
back then back in the early 2000s
remember we could hold things up because
somebody was too extreme right what a
time we should note that Collins and
Murkowski both voted for him in 2006 but
Collins put out a statement already and
because he's saying it was a very sort
of bland statement we're gonna meet with
him we're gonna hear his views we look
forward to the confirmation hearing so
they're not given anything up yet I mean
the other thing Tommy to your point the
Trump wants a fight it
both distressing annoying
infuriating that we are now going to
spend the summer reliving the political
fights of the 1990s they were going to
go through the Ken Starr investigation
again they were gonna talk about the
Clintons again then and then we're gonna
be treated to reliving the Bush years
again since he wishes that secretary in
the bush way that's too soon for that
that's too soon that's like bringing
spider-man back just like two-year
Andrew Garfield was spider in two
seconds after Tobey Maguire you know I
think they're yeah I really I hope this
doesn't focus too much on the Ken Starr
stuff I don't know maybe if there's
something useful that we should talk
about there I mean I'm sure that in his
Bush administration emails he waited on
some really touchy things like the Iraq
war
Gitmo surveillance torture surveillance
right so there could be some real
interesting things he's said or done
that we should talk about that the thing
that that drives me crazy about
Republicans versus Democrats on these
judicial discussions is that they've
done this masterful job of branding
their judges and their judicial
philosophy as conservative conservative
or constitutional list or you know
whatever I would like original text is
own terminology but its total I
mean the minute these judges get named
to a to a court they are activists they
are exactly what they claim not to be
they find novel ways to overturn
decades-old precedent as this court is
doing right now so like I don't know how
we fix that messaging fight because
we've got enrolled for decades on this
front but we need to do a better job I
think we've seen so far is the Democrats
have at least in the preparation for
this announcement has sort of prepared
for that and are now talking about these
Supreme Court picks is basically you
know an extension of the Republican
Party I mean that was like one senator
said that right I mean it is well no I
mean it's pretty much like Schumer's
mess I mean it's all their messaging
right now which i think is good you just
need to keep that out it's not named
Merrick garland what's it that's on name
Merrick garland for Surma
right yeah no kidding I I think that
this is a good I think your point is
right I actually think this fight is a
good place to do a better job you know I
can see us getting drawn into
conversations about the Ken Starr
investigation and the kind of salacious
questions that caught Cavanaugh wanted
to ask Bill Clinton and it's all very
interesting but then I think there's
really what were those things
referencing look um I don't know that I
can save and say it on this podcast
without blushing frankly but let's just
say that Brett Kavanaugh wanted to ask
Bill Clinton some very specific vulgar
questions anyway the there's two I'd be
like they're saying what you give the
listeners the gist of what he said look
it was about where Bill Clinton's just
went frankly I'm sorry you asked I don't
want to say it I don't want to say it
anyway specific sexual things the point
is we shouldn't talk about that because
there's two goals in this fight one is
to stop Cavanaugh and that is really
really hard go to stop Cavanaugh calm is
that a real website it's up cool someone
good running it yeah you got a good web
webmaster nothing
all right great yeah go there so anyway
there's two goals goal number one is to
do everything we can to stop Cavanaugh
that's really really hard the second
goal is to make sure that the fight we
have on Cavanaugh is a fight that helps
us politically in the fall and in
judicial fights to come and that's a
fight we have to win and it's a fight we
can win that we have a bet that we have
better odds of winning that fight and
that fight is best fought on unions
regulation choice and health care and
the the issues of what Cavanaugh's
radical radical sort of originalist
right-wing judicial philosophy what that
will mean for actual people so this idea
that we're gonna get dragged into the
Bush years unless there's really
important stuff about his record I think
or the Clinton years certainly I think
will be a bad path to go and I think so
far actually we'll see what happens but
I think senator
crowd certainly understand that because
they've been hitting choice and they've
been hitting health care pretty hard
here's my vote for one of the best
messages I've heard from Senate
Democrats so far Bob Casey up for
reelection in Pennsylvania a state that
Trump won he decided to come out
against the nominee this morning before
he knew who it was and here's what he
said in the statement this is some of
his statement this list is the bidding
of corporate special interests hell-bent
on handing health care over to insurance
companies and crushing unions any judge
on this list is fruit of a corrupt
process straight from the DC swamp I
will oppose the nomination because it
represents a corrupt bargain with the
far right big corporation and Washington
special interests that is outstanding
and also 100% accurate even more true
for Brooke have enough right like the
Koch brothers and their friends fund
these organizations like the Federalist
Society who create this pipeline of
judges who then slash regulations and
make them loads of money and put
Citizens United forward so they can
spend unlimited amounts on their
candidates it is this circular
horrifying process that is setting us
back for generations and I will say that
like having been in politics long enough
I guarantee that that message pulls very
very strongly
not just in blue states but in red
states and among some Trump voters as
well you know what's really great about
that statement too is that there's this
hemming and hawing DC conversation like
I got a wait to see who the nominee is I
got to make sure I give him a fair
hearing and is it you should you come
out before he's even pick someone
doesn't that seem that isn't that isn't
that mean you're not gonna take these
seriously isn't I mean you're too
partisan all that and there's a
legitimate debate there however what's
interesting is somebody comes up with a
statement like that that just tells the
truth about the situation and it's an
incredibly powerful argument that says
no I shouldn't wait for somebody let's
not pretend this process is something
else let's not pretend this is just a
random individual we're gonna give a
fair hearing this guy was chosen from a
list he was chosen from a list of people
to do the bidding of these interests
that's absolutely true
that's right yeah and I also think
there's you know there's this debate now
like oh it's a trump Supreme Court
nominee you're gonna put red state
Democrats in a tough spot no it's
not
this is this is the easiest no vote I
can ever imagine think about what
happened with Republicans when they not
only opposed Merrick garland but opposed
even a hearing for President
Obama's repeal on the Senate they
nothing happened
not one single Republican paid any price
for opposing for opposing any Supreme
Court justice from Barack Obama none but
if you want your base to walk away from
you and you're a Democrat vote for this
guy that'd be a Brett Kavanaugh fan if
you if a red state Democrat votes no on
Cavanaugh they are gonna have the base
voters that they need we're gonna show
up or in a volunteer vote for them knock
on doors making phone calls they're
gonna have them excited and showing up
for them if they vote YES on this I want
to find the swing voter who was like I
was really close to voting for Joe
Manchin or Heidi Heitkamp but then I
don't know they said no to Brett
Kavanaugh well I love I'm a huge Kevin
I'm a Kevin this voter doesn't like
President Trump doesn't like how the
Republicans have been handling Congress
but they do really love Brett Kavanaugh
and they're really disappointed and also
know that's not gonna happen and also
speaking to what Bob Casey said vote no
and make the argument on the terms you
believe that's right the argument on the
terms of health care make them make the
argument of the terms of access to
reproductive health because that is a
winning argument literally in every
state in the Union and that's another
thing about Bob Casey statement because
like if I was a senator I'd be making
the argument based on the fact that you
know break heaven is gonna criminalize
abortion and I'd be talking about the
ACA and stuff like that Bob Casey is one
of these senators he is personally you
know against abortion but he never
legislates that way he legislates
pro-choice he's got a good record there
but he decided not he decided to make
the argument on his terms on his issues
what he thought was right for those in
his state and that is possible for every
single Democrat in the Senate and there
have been there's been some criticism to
Casey like oh he just this was a
politically expedient way to get out of
a tough decision on someone who's
qualified so what now it's a fight it's
it's like picking a fight and I'd rather
be on that side and the other one of
that
and this is a hard fight I mean we have
to hold all the red state Democrats and
then we have to put maximum leverage on
college and Murkowski and that's gonna
be very hard but we should try as hard
as we possibly can
but we also we need to do a better job
welcome to plaid save America I'm John
Favreau I'm Dan Pfeiffer in studio we

here's some good news hysteria our new
podcast from crooked media launches
today by the time you listen to this
it'll probably be out so go check it out
and subscribe if you haven't already
this is a podcast hosted by aaron ryan
with a rotating set of co-hosts
including the wonderful Alyssa
Mastromonaco Blair Imani grace Parra
Kiran deal Meghan Gailey and ziwei
Fumito fantastic podcast and Dan your
book is out it is out and as we know yes
we still can yes we still can the title
and so we had some exciting news
yesterday we heard that thanks to the
wonderful community of Friends of the
pod yes we still can will debut at
number one on the New York Times
nonfiction but is amazing that's very
exciting it was a it was it's sort of a
bittersweet thing because I got the news
right as we I was sort of processing the
terrible news about Justice Kennedy's
decision that we're gonna talk about on
this pod but that got me thinking and
per usual I had an idea but that idea
came from Alyssa Mastromonaco
hysteria Cohoes hysteria co-hosts best
friend of the pod overall life coach
she had the suggestion that I was trying
to think about how to think about my
book and continuing to promote it in a
world where so much of what we care
about is at risk now that Justice
Kennedy has retired mr. McConnell is
gonna try to jam through some sort of
horrible human being to take that role
and so what we're gonna do is for the
next two weeks proceeds from a portion
of proceeds from yes we still can we
donated to Nero because the thing that
is perhaps most at risk more at risk
than any time in my life in politics as
a woman's right to choose in a role is
doing amazing work most nationally and
at the state level to push back on these
efforts restrict women's rugby dr.
freedom
and so I would like to see if we can do
this in two weeks
we could get to 5,000 books sold and we
will donate my portion of the proceeds
to neighbor all if we do that so
hopefully we this will be a way in which
we can least make a small bit of
difference as we think about the book in
the context of what's happening in the
country right now that is very good of
you and a very good idea for Melissa
pretty cool so everyone go bye yes we
still can
all right let's let's jump right into
the news I'd argue that June has been
the worst month of the Trump presidency
and I think yesterday may have been the
worst day of the worst month yeah I
agree with that
I was a gut punch is a gut punch Supreme
Court Justice Anthony Kennedy a
conservative who still voted with
liberal justices on issues like abortion
gay marriage affirmative action and
other civil rights issues announced on
Wednesday that he'll be retiring from
the Supreme Court the summer and Donald
Trump shortly afterwards announced that
he intends to replace him before the
midterm elections Senate Democrats only
have 49 votes which is not enough to
block the nomination dan on a scale of
one to oh Hillary just lost
Michigan where does this fall worse than
Hillary lost Michigan because we could
live we could have lived in a world
where Donald Trump was president and he
was a national embarrassment who did
terrible things but he did not change
the balance of the court because he
replaced even though the seat was stolen
he he got to replace a conservative
justice who was already one of the four
and the five four
balance of the court for so many things
we care about but Kennedy the most
important justice resigned under Trump
and now the balance of the court will
shift or will likely shift in a really
terrible direction for decades and it is
it is the this is the worst thing by far
that has happened to progressive the
progressive causes that we care about
under Trump's presidency yeah I mean to
me maybe the worst thing about this is
looking at the ages of some of the
potential replacement justices and some
of them were in their 40s some of them I
mean I think last night at a rally Trump
said I'm gonna nominate someone who can
serve for 40 years which means he is
thinking about one of the people in
their 40s
I forgot until I looked yesterday to
that Gorsuch is 50 I mean this is
uh it's a long long time there we have
to live with us we should mention here
that Kennedy's retirement comes after a
particularly awful week of Supreme Court
decisions already with him on the court
that was this was the good court right I
was like we're gonna talk about the
issues where a lot kennedy retirement
really is gonna make a big impact but
there are some issues where it's not
gonna make a huge impact because he was
already on the conservative majority
Donald Trump's Muslim ban was upheld
there was a ruling that may destroy
public employee unions and reduced their
membership by a third their teachers
government employees firefighters police
officers there was a ruling that said
crisis pregnancy centers did not have to
provide women information about
contraceptive services or abortion there
was a ruling that upheld gerrymandered
Texas districts that diluted the power
of black and Hispanic voters which came
after last month's ruling that Ohio is
allowed to purge people from voting
lists if they haven't voted recently in
all of these decisions think all of
these decisions were 5-4 with Kennedy in
the majority
so looks like that stolen Supreme Court
seat is already paid off big time huh
yeah I mean it is the someone said this
on Twitter it's the greatest theft of
political theft in history and with the
greatest consequences because these
consequences will last as you mentioned
decades because this would have been a
5-4 court the
other direction if marilyn Carlin had
been approved and then if Kennedy had
decided to resign we would have reverted
back to where we were just at a school
basically which is not awesome as you
just laid out but on some of the things
we cared most deeply about that 5-4
majority that has really been around for
decades because neither Obama nor Bush
nor Clinton changed the ideological
balance of the court because they
disappointed in judge Liberty the
Democratic presidents appointed liberal
liberal justices to replace liberal
justices in the conservative justice
replaced reporting can serve justice
replaced conservative justices and so
this is the first time we've had a shift
and so it the consequences of the
garland the stolen seat by Mitch
McConnell are will haunt us for the rest
of our lives
Chris Murphy tweeted yesterday even
before the Kennedy announcement let's
call it like it is the Supreme Court is
turning itself into a political arm of
the Republican Party there's a lot of
truth to that I mean there was a time
when a Democratic president could
appoint a justice and a Republican
president could appointed justice and
you didn't know for sure how that
justice would rule and in some examples
you have justices on the court still in
the court there have been approved that
were appointed by presidents of a
different party or different political
persuasion they end up being a surprise
it doesn't seem like that's the case
anymore no everyone knows what
everyone's gonna do and I had the
opportunity to work on the Sonia
Sotomayor nomination both in best part
of the team that was helping President
Obama get a list of nominees and think
about who was who would make the best
justice and who would be I was not as a
non-lawyer I was not really figuring out
the legal part of this but I was hoping
understand the confirmation politics of
various people and you don't ask the
questions right you'll mess a litmus
test questions I suspect in this case on
the Republican side where all the sort
of normal norms have been blown up they
ask those questions and it's like and
this is I'm sure we'll talk about this
as we go forward but the there was the
court could have reached this this place
of incredible beyond the pale it is a
ssin when the court ruled 5-4 in Bush
versus Gore essentially handing the
presidency to george w bush but it
bounced back in the sense that Democrats
did not May they did not try to tear the
court down after that they thought that
that was on position they wanted the
consequences for the country in the
polls were horrendous but we needed the
court to continue to play its important
role as a third branch of government and
I know it's hard to see how that happens
where we have taken the process of
appointing justices and done it with the
most cynical political hackery in the
history of mankind yeah I mean what's
awful right now is depending on who gets
nominated it's it seems very likely that
John Roberts is the swing vote on the
court now yeah and look John Roberts
famously was a vote to uphold the
Affordable Care Act
he has been you know pretty much
probably a couple clicks to the right of
Anthony Kennedy on just about everything
else but that is the swing vote on the
court now and John Roberts would not be
appointed by Donald Trump at this point
right Donald Trump Donald was making
sure I mean the list is out of the
people he promised he would pick from a
list of however many justices and you
can look through all those justices in
their records they're all in the mold of
course it was a real problem
yeah they're all ideologues and this is
they think it's interesting about this
is this is the only sort of normal thing
that Trump does right that's an easy one
yeah heap like droid Trump is gonna pick
the same person that Marco Rubio Jeb
Bush or John Kasich would have picked
because it's like why not like and I saw
some you know it takes on Twitter like
is he gonna pick Giuliani or sessions or
Jeanine Pirro or what you know all that
it's like he doesn't have to do that
with us what he wants to do is to
placate the conservatives because
there's a bargain and this whole
thing where it's like we turn away when
you steal an election and collude with
Putin and say crazy on Twitter and
jail toddlers but you give us some
supreme court justices in exchange
that's the deal
tax cuts and scream Court justices is
all we want and we will we will cover up
or enable anything you want yeah and
don't embarrass us with the pick I do
remember because Obama was an attorney
was president Harvard Law Review and a
law professor they thought it was just a
community we're gonna
pose community organizing he really
stepped up his game and he read all the
briefs of the people like the books he
would get were like stacks of binders
even take them you'd read all the
arguments to understand the judicial
approach of the people who was thinking
before name now we know Donald Trump is
not doing that right maybe basically I
think he just probably has them will
come in makes them like run in place for
a little bit to see how healthy they are
checks their chicks their age on their
ID it is like Mitch McConnell cool with
you great you got this seat he wants to
see how they look on TV yeah do they
look the part exactly which course oh
she looked the part right so let's talk
about what is at stake with this
nomination as soon as it was announced
Jeff Toobin legal analyst CNN tweeted
out abortion will be illegal in 20
states in 18 months so that was a gut
punch yeah to say the least
Dylan Matthews in vogue sorta piece a
court without Kennedy is substantially
more likely to overturn roe v-- wade and
allow states and maybe the federal
government to to ban most are all
abortions reject challenges to capital
punishment and solitary confinement rule
in favor of religious challenges to
anti-discrimination law and perhaps in
an extreme case reverse some past
Supreme Court rulings on gay rights
Kennedy was also more moderate in the
areas of Voting Rights criminal justice
reform you know he helped protect some
of the environmental decisions like the
Clean Air Act Clean Water Act the
Endangered Species Act so all of those
areas seem to be at risk do they miss
any I'm sure there are things that will
will be destroyed that we had even do
they have even occurred to us yet that
they will up yes it is possible
yeah I mean the the abortion issue is
perhaps the most frightening and I mean
illicit act with us at one of our shows
but there are only I believe 17 states
right now that have laws protecting
abortions and the rest have trigger laws
where if roe v wade is overturned
abortion will immediately be illegal in
those states
some people think some legal analysts
think you know it could be threatened by
as soon as someone's on the court and
there's a challenge someone who's in the
court there's a challenge they could
overturn roe
Wade others think Roberts some of the
other people will just chip away at roe
v-- wade with many different cases and
slowly just keep restricting abortion
rights either way it seems pretty
 awful yeah it this has been the
thing that has kept everyone up at night
for a long time which is like so many
other these other things they can be
sort of fixed in law and here is
something that has been a five
essentially five for fur as since the
original decision and which I think was
not fight forward but in the time since
then people there there were since the
80s at least it's been a 5-4 majority in
favor of keeping of upholding roe v--
wade and that is what is held it
together all this time and we've always
been one justice away and we've just
been fortunate that that did not happen
in when Bush was president and we could
this could have been and it all comes
back to Mitch McConnell because
if the if this if Obama had been able to
as he should have been fulfilled a
Scalia seat then we would have that this
wid that we would be in a better place
today we'd be in the same place we were
before and now this is very scary and
it's very scary for a lot of women like
ELISA was saying on Twitter that she's
been just heard eat her direct message
on Twitter being blown up by women
asking what this means because they're
very worried because they're like it is
worth noting that there are many states
in this country which even in a world
where roe v wade still stands it becomes
very you have the right to an abortion
but they have restricted access to
abortion to a point where it's almost
impossible and that's where we are now
and so now we're in danger of something
much worse that has just dramatic
consequences for so many people yeah
especially poor women and women of color
like people who are in live in these
women who live in these states a lot of
them very deep red states that have
already threatened abortion rights that
rollback reproductive rights and I think
the threat to reproductive rights even
before Kennedy was probably greater than
in any time in decades in many states
around the country and now and now it's
very very scary
let's talk about the reaction in
Congress Mitch McConnell said he wants
to vote this fall and that he expects
the nominee to be treated fairly he
actually had the gall to to tweet that
or say that this is despite his
insistence in 2016 about how it's unfair
to consider a SCOTUS nominee in an
election year because voters should have
a say and who gets to be on that bench
dandas Mitch McConnell give a flying
 if we think he's the most shameless
hypocrite to ever walk the halls of the
Senate now he was in his shamelessness
he loves it is so like yesterday
we still have about everyone just look
what a hypocrite Mitch McConnell is yeah
no kidding yeah he doesn't care
if you think he's a hypocrite that's the
whole point he gets stronger with every
tweet that calls him a hypocrite and
he's in Mitch McConnell this is not to
his credit it is to the opposite of
credit that would be to his blame I
don't know but he has no illusions about
who he is right
he knows he's the super villain here he
is not trying to be he's not sure he's
not Paul Ryan he's not Paul right I had
a reporter asked me this the other day
like why do you guys hate Paul Ryan so
much I'm not Mitch McConnell as much
like why does Paul Ryan get more
and I'm like because Mitch McConnell
just wallows in what a super villain he
is he loves it he doesn't care he
doesn't pretend to be anything else then
a power-hungry maniac who's trying to
win that's who he is
he'll tell you that Paul Ryan's like no
I'm oh I care about poverty I'm a sunny
conservative in the mold of jack kemp a
 Mitch McConnell watches
Game of Thrones in Brutes for the night
kick okay so that's Mitch McConnell he
is playing he knows what power is and he
uses power
what can Democrats do most Senate
Democrats have said that McConnell
should delay the vote until after the
election so that's good
some of the red state Democrats up in 18
like Joe Donnelly and Joe Manchin have
said they'd like to meet with the
nominee first what did you think of the
Democratic reaction so far and like what
what's our play here I think I think
it's important for everyone to be aware
the Democrats have very little leverage
here
if Mitch McConnell wants to jam this
person through and he can get 50
Republican senators to vote for them it
doesn't matter what Joe Manchin does it
doesn't matter what his Chuck Schumer
does he can just do it because not
having the majority in the Senate is
devastating in this front and we know
that this is the exact opposite of Mitch
McConnell didn't want to have a hearing
for Merrick garland so he couldn't in
there was nothing that Harry Reid could
do to make him do it I think Democrats
should I don't have an objection to
Democrats being willing to meet with the
nominee if Trump nominates it nominate
someone like I think that's fine I don't
welcome to pod save America I'm John
Favreau I'm Tommy Vietor another pod
today we have the author of the new
memoir the world as it is crooked
contributor best friend of the pod Ben
Rhodes is here in studio on the flush
thank god he is a text Jane he's
co-hosting with us today so this is your
third cone today yeah Ben went into a
cave to write for a year yeah yeah and
they just finally let me have my nose
into the wild it's okay Here I am we are
gonna talk about North Korea immigration
the Republican Party's nomination of a
Confederate for Senate but first a few
housekeeping items we're gonna be on
tour at the end of next week there's
still tickets for Nashville so go to
cricket calm Islam - with me - I've
never been we're gonna be in Atlanta and
Durham as well so very exciting all
right let's talk about the news I want
to get into North Korea but first we
should of course wish a happy birthday
to our president Donald Trump song is a
hundred and thirty-eight million views
on YouTube what is it happy birthday
John it's in the public domain I can
play it if I want happy birthday to
Donald Trump who along with his three
darling children is being sued today by
the New York Attorney General for quote
extensive and persistent violations of
state and federal law the Trump
Foundation raised money for charity and
then used it to influence Donald Trump's
presidential campaign they also used the
funds to pay back lawsuits that they
settled that have to do with Mara Lago
the reason we know all of these things
is because the evidence is out there
they put their crimes and emails yeah
again they are the worst
grifters also Don jr. Ivanka and Eric
are all named in the lawsuit because
they're board members of the Trump
Foundation which is supposed to
scrutinize their spending for science at
their leader in this case Papa Bear
Trump was misusing the funds the board
has not actually met since 1999 so a bit
of a dereliction of duty here can I just
say that like I remember we used to get
nervous because all the emails you send
in government are like public record and
so 25 years from now someone could find
out that you know Tommy didn't like some
reporter we weren't like hey when you
commit the crime can you
make sure to get a receipt for that
crime and send it back so that
ultimately like we can be the target of
lawsuits a couple years looping dad on
the crime
I mean corey lewandowski this is he's
got one of the emails just saying like
when can we get the disbursement of
money hopefully it would be great if we
could get it saturday when we're in iowa
unbeliever to find a point on it but so
they're doing great but let's talk about
let's talk about North Korea it's a good
day to have my two smartest foreign
policy pals here because we had
ourselves quite a summit with our new
dictator friend from North Korea on
Tuesday upon returning home conquering
hero Donald Trump tweeted there is no
longer a nuclear threat from North Korea
sleep well tonight
so obviously this man is out of his
goddamn mind and of course North Korea
has made no moves whatsoever to
denuclearize just yet but before we get
into all the crazy details what did you
guys think overall of the summit is the
world safer less safe or exactly as safe
as it was on Monday what do you think
then I think exactly is safe and and I
want to make a point to you know all our
progressive friends out there it is okay
to think that it's a very good thing
that we're pursuing diplomacy with North
Korea instead of going to war with them
and still think that this was a
catastrophe right I mean this was a
disaster of a summit let's be very clear
here right North Korea wants a bunch of
things right they want international
legitimacy well Trump just gave that to
them in a way they've never had in their
entire history of their country they're
there with the US president front of all
these flags North Korea once our
military presence in South Korea drawn
down Trump just seemed to want to go out
and decide to announce it we're not
gonna do military exercises with South
Korea anymore without even necessarily
telling the South Koreans beforehand
something that China and North Korea
have wanted for many years he just gave
it to them and North Korea once
sanctions relief and I have to think
that even if we're not giving that to
them ourselves the optics of this summit
if you're China you're thinking like I'm
not exactly gonna be cracking down on
the enforcement you know now that you
know Trump is buddies with Kim jung-un
so North Korea got like a lot of what
they wanted for nothing okay like I want
to be very clear about this
like reaffirming
Tommy and I've written a lot of
statements if the word reaffirm is in
the statement you are doing nothing you
are it's like I reaffirmed the you know
that I will make my bed tomorrow they
reaffirmed a commitment to
denuclearization
they don win in the past it under under
Bush under Clinton both times they broke
that promise they did not do it so they
reaffirmed that they were going to do
something that they have lied about
doing in the past so really there's no
new anything out of North Korea that no
no timeline to denuclearize no
inspections to verify that they're gonna
denuclearize so basically Trump gave
this huge spectacle and really leaves
there with nothing except the fact that
there'll be more meetings North Korea
leaves there with a lot of the things
that they wanted yeah I mean the Iran
deal was like a hundred and fifty nine
pages I believe the North Korea
agreement that they signed was 400 words
deleted they did half an op eds worth of
work and words like verifiable that they
talked about over and over and over
again in the run-up to this weren't in
the document even though we pushed for
it and that's important because that
means we get to inspect all these sites
and when pressed about this I believe
yesterday Mike Pompeo the Secretary of
State who was traveling in Seoul got a
little snippy lost his on all these
reporters said it was insulting and
frankly ludicrous for them to press him
on the details well boo-fucking-hoo mike
like the details matter here this isn't
congress where you introduce a bill and
walk away and Mike Pompeo would gave a
colonoscopy to the Iran deal right tails
you know like these guys literally like
the scrutiny that was I mean I know it
you can drive you insane if you actually
think about it but the scrutiny on the
Iran deal I know where we shipped 98% of
their nuclear material out of the
country had inspections on all of their
nuclear facilities had you know
centrifuges taken out and put in storage
Liz the scrutiny applied to that as
against you Mike Pompeo feels like his
he shouldn't be at even asked about like
how they're gonna make this work I mean
the double standards here I wasn't
saying I was gonna get there later
detected you to about the hypocrisy
around Iran when I do we get there get
there ultimately no which it's crazy
but what I was gonna ask like because we
there has been this thing on the left
where some people are like okay why are
we upset that you know they're talking
and they're doing diplomacy as opposed
to you know threatening nuclear war with
each other on Twitter what's like yeah
obviously that's way better
yeah but I'm wondering from you guys and
you know Ben obviously you helped lead
negotiations with Iran for the Iran deal
and then and keep open in Cuba
if if it was not the Trump
administration what would normal direct
diplomacy with the North Koreans which
we would all support what would that
look like what kind of preparations
would you do before them yeah I mean you
know the two examples I can draw from
Cuba you know I had to do the pre
diplomacy and I had 20 meetings with
Alejandro Castro Raul Castro's son
usually lasted eight hours sometimes two
days till you call him a smart guy who
loves his country too much to go hug him
general but but well you know before we
put it was two years before we put
Barack Obama in the room with Raul
Castro and by that point we teed
everything up we knew what the agenda
was we knew we were you're going to
establish embassies we knew we were
gonna they were gonna really they did
release a lot of political prisoners and
and take other steps and we were gonna
take steps as well so we did the prep
work you know now Trump said you know he
doesn't didn't need to prepare and that
was apparent though and with the Iran
deal like we had endless discussions
about what would constitute a good deal
we had a nuclear physicist a Nobel Prize
winning nuclear physicist Ernie Moniz
literally in those prep meetings and in
the negotiations so yeah but how was he
a rebounding in the NBA well because
they had Dennis Rodman so we knew
exactly what we wanted to get out of
those negotiations we knew what was
success and what wasn't and you could
just see it's like anybody who's gone
into school without doing the homework
for the tests in the oral presentation
you can just tell you could tell that
these guys had not done the work you
know you could tell that they didn't
know what they wanted to achieve they
couldn't you know all they could
articulate before was either a really
maximalist of demand that North Korea
give up all their nuclear weapons and
then coming out of this that they can't
even spin it because
they don't know what they were shooting
at I just wanna make two points like
reiterate something been said which is
these details matter because the North
is saying the denuclearization process
will be simultaneous Pompeo and Trump
are saying no they have to go first that
discrepancy is gonna come to a head
right well the only thing we all agree
happened is a concession for the United
States that we're gonna pause these
joint military exercises in South Korea
and that's something that you could you
could get there and you could ultimately
concede and and do that but Trump seems
to have just coughed it up in the
meeting and we know that because he
didn't tell the rocks or he didn't tell
the the South Koreans or US forces in
Korea before he did it and like all the
everyone who's out there saying well you
know he brought us back from the brink
of war so we should all be influenced
others on the brink of way he was
tweeting about his big nuclear button so
like another thing point you made man
that I just think people need to
remember is that by overselling the
summit as a success and saying the
problems are all solved he could make it
harder to keep sanctions in place and
the maximum pressure effort that he's
been working on could get rolled back so
like he could have heard us here can i
we talked about what North Korea got out
of the summit which was a lot we talked
about what the United States got out of
the summit which was almost nothing
there's other countries involved here
what did China get out of this what did
Russia get out of this and what did
South Korea get out of this if anything
except a surprise when they learned that
they we weren't having joy I know it's
very exercises anymore yeah I mean
lightning-round on that as China got a
huge win because what China wants is
less US military presence in their
region so Trump actually made a big
concession to China when he said he
wasn't been doing his military exercises
so the Chinese were sitting feeling
pretty good about things the Russians
had a great week we know the week
Vladimir Putin because I actually
thought that the more important summit
was the g7 yeah because literally the
unraveling of the post-world War two
order happened before eyes you know
Trump essentially picking fights with
all of our closest allies they are all
and you know having sat with these
people looking at angle amiracle Justin
Trudeau they're clearly past their
breaking point with Trump you know and
he's inviting Russia back into the the
g7 so we Russia's
pushing their objective you know people
always ask me what do you think Russia
wanted to do they want sanctions relief
when they meddled in our election no
they wanted that g7 summit they wanted
to see the split in the transatlantic
alliance a split in the Alliance the
world's democracies and they got that in
spades and so Trump you know before he
goes and cozies up to North Korean
dictators and Generals he literally
blows up the the the closest alliances
that we have in the world that is much
to Russia's benefit I think the South
Koreans I felt very bad for them in this
whole process because they're the reason
this diplomacy is happening because they
saw this you know fire and fury locked
and loaded and they knew they were the
ones that were being the crosshairs of
that so they're like we got something
here you know so they took this
initiative they went to the North
Koreans and I think they brought that
back to Trump Trump grabs it from them
says okay I'll go meet with that guy you
know and I actually don't think they
necessarily meant for this to go so fast
I think they just wanted to get some
diplomacy underway to avoid a war so
they're sitting there and they're stuck
because on the one hand they desperately
don't want there to be a war because
they would suffer all the consequences
but in the other hand they don't want
Trump to totally sell them out right in
the process and so I think right now
there's probably a lot of mixed feelings
in South Korea better this then you know
the escalation that we were on but this
doesn't look like it's going quite the
way we want doesn't selling out the
South Koreans seem like something that
Trump would totally do at the end of
this entire process well I wondered this
way back when that like in Trump's mind
the way that mind works you could see
him thinking like okay why do we have
all these troops in South Korea anyway
why do we protect South Korea what what
is that for us we yeah so you can see at
the end of this process him saying yeah
well not only freeze joint exercises
will remove troops from South Korea yeah
and then as long as he's not pointing
those nuclear weapons at the United
States we don't care what happens on the
crane what Allah and he said that over
the years he's made comments on like why
do we have troops in Korea you know we
have troops in Korea to assure the
survival of South Korea right and you
know he says so many insane things that
you know you lose track of them but he
said something you know when he was kind
of boasting about pausing the military
exercises he talked about how expensive
they were right that
you know that may be just a normal thing
for Trump to say but I think people have
to realize how do these things sound
abroad if you're Japan or South Korea
and literally your existence is
dependent upon the United States
providing these troops which by the way
we benefit from too because those are
growing economies and those are some of
our best trading partners in suddenly
you got a guy saying like I'm tired of
footing the bill for for these troops
there the south koreans are hearing that
as well at the end of this process yeah
he very well may sell us out take out
these troops and kind of leave us here
surrounded by China and North Korea
which is not exactly what we'd want to
be I'd like to add another entity to the
list of losers this week which was
oppressed peoples all around the world
well because Trump has signaled that he
does not give a about human rights
I mean he's done this before the what
about ISM went pressed on Putin killing
adversaries or journalists wherever he's
like well you know we do it too we're
killers too but he basically said you
know Kim jong-un has to be a rough guy
it's he's been a rough person he's smart
he loves his people he loves his country
I mean that's an insane thing to say
about a guy with a hundred thousand
political prisoners breaking rocks in a
 concentration camp I mean Nick
Kristof pointed this out in his piece
yesterday where he said that he you know
Trump was outfoxed there's peace a
couple days before that where he's like
Democrats don't be childish like get him
a chance
a 2014 UN report states that North
Korean human rights violations quote do
not have any parallel in the
contemporary world and that includes
mass executions torture for starvation
abductions and prison camps John you
know there's a source on this Trump's
2018 State of the Union where he said no
regime has oppressed his own citizens
more totally or brutally than the cruel
dictatorship in North Korea and and you
know I should have like a limit of the
number of times I can talk about
hypocrisy but you know when we dealt
with Cuban Iran we would always get this
argument but we would always raise human
rights in the meeting publicly we would
always speak about it when when
President Obama went to Cuba he talked
about the need for elections and by the
way the human rights picture in North
Korea is you guys suggest it's so much
worse and not only did he you know say
the things that Tommy quoted he he said
that the North Korean people loved Kim
jung-un
right and and what you have to realize
is he just legitimized his rule he just
said well they love him
that's that's Kim Jung Woon's argument
for why he does the things that he does
in North Korea and you also have to know
north Korea has state media right
they're gonna be playing that in a clip
over and over and over again right that
US president sang the North Korean
people love Kim Yuen that's gonna be
playing they get Fox overthink a Martha
McCallum live from North Korean yeah I
mean like they have trust me it's
nothing but Fox and friends over and and
Trump just gave them throughout this
whole summit a lot of content this is an
important point because um it's like
well all kinds of countries have human
rights abuses and we've dealt with them
throughout history is yes we're not
saying that the United States cannot
deal with countries that have human
rights announces if there are big things
at stake like denuclearize Yeah right
well obviously Iran has plenty of human
rights abuses so does Cuba we still
dealt with them because they were bigger
things at stake in Iran it was making
sure they don't have a nuclear weapon
right now there is a way that Trump
could have gone to North Korea met with
Kim Jong hoon and not praised him like
he did not said that people loved him
like he did and then and then he comes
back and Bret Baier asked him about this
and he reminds Trump that Kim executes
people and has done some really bad
things and Trump replies yeah but so
have other people done some really bad
things he's a tough guy I saw that and I
was like I just unbelievable and what
might I thought I would see never sorry
I would trash Justin Trudeau I mean part
part of it so stark here around the
world is like he can't find enough good
things to say about Kim jung-un
while he's like trashing the you know
the leaders of democracies I mean how is
that going down around the world you
ivenn thanks so much for joining us
today on part two the people a thank you
so much for having me so this is our
first real conversation I'm excited I'm
a voter here in the city I live in the
city from the city I'm interested in you
your platform so I'm hoping that we can
have a good conversation today yeah me
too I really appreciate it you know I
followed you a lot what you've been
doing for the people your career and
everything so yeah I'm really excited as
well the first question is why state's
attorney you've been a defense attorney
you've been a prosecutor like what makes
you want to be to some people the city's
sort of lead lawyer focused on putting
people in jail is how people think about
that rule to really make change to
really really make change the system
needs one you have to know the system
and being a prosecutor I was a
prosecutor so I understand that side
matter of fact they asked me I'll never
forget I was a prosecutor handling a
murder case and the judge we were
talking about sentencing the judge said
you know mr. Bates you're a defense
attorney wearing prosecutors suit and I
asked her why she say that she said
because you fought hard for this man to
have a lower sentence than his own
attorney so I became a defense attorney
and being defense attorney you know you
get to see the criminal justice system
to the eyes of people who are charged
some are guilty a number of them may not
be guilty I realize a lot of good people
sometime make that one split-second bad
mistake and so if that's the case
someone needs to be there who
understands them and so I think for me
having been a prosecutor and defense
attorneys not about locking people up
yeah if you're violent I have to hold
you accountable and they're different
levels of accountability but I'm really
been on second chances there's this
young man in my office named Corey Corey
did 23 years with the feds and so I you
know they reached out to me when he came
home we received his paralegal degree
and people are like hey this guy Corey
can give him a job so I said okay you
know I'll interview him he came in and
we talked it was interesting because
I'll never forget the sweater he wore
was the sweater from the 90s so I was
like I had the same sweater so then that
kind of just and I said talk to him he
played an audio tape of a hearing
involving a motion that he had written
there was some judges I honestly
recognized the judges voice they talked
about what a great job and how well it
was written so I said and talked him a
little more and I said you know what no
one's proudly gonna hire you because you
know you have a felony on your record
I'm gonna give you a child
I don't believe I can tell people what
I'm gonna do unless I've done it and so
what I realized where I thought I was
giving Cory something he gave me more
because he gave me and told me that when
there's somebody who's been down and
they've been through something if you're
actually there to pick them up and
believe in them they will work as hard
or harder than anybody they won't take
the opportunity for granted and they
really really will run with it and what
I learned from Cory was the importance
of making sure you support people and
that was it's been amazing he's now
still in my office one of my best
workers and he's basically doing things
and he really has helped and change the
office so much but I realized it got to
a point in his growth and development I
said you know Cory you're at a point
where now you should make so much more
you're not to pay what I can pay you
based on what I can but this what I'm
gonna do you need to have your own
business cuz I'm really big on business
I'm big on people being employed so I
help them and I said look some of the
people that can't afford me now they can
afford you to write the briefs emotions
and then they can pay me so much less
just to go in there and argue it in
court and so I wanted to make sure I can
help more people with my legal practice
because sometimes they just don't have
they ought to have you know smaller
payment plans and they can do that with
Cory but then they can still have the
attorney come in therefore if a smaller
fee at a later time period to pay me to
just make that argument and so that to
me is really important so the reason I
want to run is really help people it's
not to harm peoples not to lock people
up just to help them now how do you
think about the role of the state's
attorney in the sort of range of roles
that have to do something with violence
in the city and I asked because we see
sort of every election everybody is like
they're gonna be the person that fixes
the crime the city the mayor says this
city council president says it every
city council person says that the
state's attorney sort of say it that
they are going to be like the people
that bring in the thing that like
changes how people receive to be the
danger of the city how do you think
about the State Attorney's role as
unique in that range of offices the
state's attorney is the only one who
really can do something about it the
mayor doesn't charge people are married
and arrest people the head of city
council president they don't have
anything to do with it all the police
chief their police are making arrests
looking from the state's point of view
state's attorney decides who will get
charged and who won't get charged the
police can arrest 50 people the state's
attorney says we're not charging any of
them don't even come to the criminal
justice system this judge it only does
sentencing so the person has to be found
guilty before the judge can most likely
do a sentence the state's attorney is
the one who charges don't want state's
attorney is the one who often decides
what cases what may have a wiretap where
they won't have a wiretap the state's
attorney's office will decide what count
will be charged what count will be
called on a plea the state's attorney's
office will decide which one in terms of
the plea bargain what they'll offer in
2015 the law in the state of Maryland
changed its case called sharp sha RPE
case called sharp in 2015
said that the state's attorney's office
the one who now is in charge of
dictating plea bargains and makes the
sentencing recommendations dejected
before it was the judge the judge would
makes a sentence of recommendation on a
plea and the state's attorney would say
yea or nay now the judge can make a true
sentencing recommendation state says no
it is never going to happen the state's
astana says your honor our sentence and
recommendations 5 years and it's binding
the judge said looks at the defense
defense it says ok it's binding but
let's say a person is charged with 3
different types of handgun charges one
is a misdemeanor one is a felony but
doesn't hold mandatory jail time the
others are filling the holes mandatory
jail time the judge no one else decides
which count to call the state can decide
whether or not you have a felony on your
record or whether or not we're gonna go
with the misdemeanor and that's the
power and once you hold violent
offenders accountable then you make a
change but what about the individual
that comes to court who's in college on
his way to college the mother and father
aren't together he has no real knowing
at home to support him and now all of a
sudden he's before the state's attorney
having taken a cell phone well is that
gonna be a theft on a misdemeanor or is
that gonna be the felony now you give
him a felony he goes to college he can't
receive you know financial aid and what
about that the power that the state's
attorney office has why or maybe which
you could possibly do is this and this
is something I would do as a prosecutor
you know what I know I can ruin your
life I want you to do some community
service let's sit down and do 50 hours
community service know the people in the
community bring something back showing
you did it I'll go ahead and dismiss
this then you need
go to college and take this as a
learning lesson that's the power that
the state has so what will be different
about your administration than so the
promises that we've heard before and I
say that as somebody who grew up in the
city from Baltimore is that we've sort
of heard every sort of thing that people
can offer they're gonna like restructure
the office they're gonna like Target I
think about when cease fire was here was
this idea we're gonna like pour
resources into communities and like
divert people and we've had sort of 30
years of the most innovative practices
and like the outcomes really haven't
changed all that much so what would be
different about your administration I'm
the only one in this field that's
actually been in the trenches the
current state's attorney you know I
think about never tried a murder case
never been in the trenches was there
that long the other opponent you know he
was really terrible in terms of mass
incarceration
he bought a case that incarcerated more
black men in our city at one time that
anyone else charged 48 black men in this
neighborhood with these range of crimes
of all these murders being a part of BGF
only 14 people were found guilty the
most harm anyone received was 8 years I
watched that case ruin an entire
neighborhood yeah there wasn't a murder
in 18 months but there were no black men
in that neighborhood you can't do that I
represented a black man in that case who
basically lost his life lost his job
because he was charged with being a
member of a gang he lost his house
because he couldn't work and he lost his
family so to me what makes me difference
is I understand what what mass
incarceration does I look at violent
offenders totally different than
everybody else I have to sit down and
explain look we cannot do the violence
but I also sit down and understand
people are doing violence cuz they don't
have hope I recognize why are we
prosecuting small amounts of marijuana
let's stop that because we're giving
them criminal records to individuals who
can't get jobs and if they go to college
they can't do something with their life
one of the things that's interesting
people attack and look at the bail bonds
industry what I argued against I was
against hey this is a bill that's coming
in and this bill says that we should
have a second chance of the bail review
and they are talking about cash bail
cash bail cash bail to me Maryland and
Baltimore is totally different I'm not
so much for cash bail I'm against mass
incarceration once you took cash bail
out the equation there was no way to
release anybody
jail so would be lead to more mass
incarceration now people who don't
practice in the system of Baltimore City
they don't understand so they're looking
at it from a thousand feet up and say Oh
cash bail is terrible yes it is
but if there's nothing in this place we
have no system so we had a state's
attorney whose constant eked and
criticized the judges for everything the
judges are gonna say what we're not
letting anybody out on bail so we've
seen as a 23% increase in people being
incarcerated before they ever go to
trial meanwhile across the state we've
had a decrease I think of almost 15 to
18 percent of inmates being housed in
the Division of Correction so how is it
that prison population is going down but
pretrial population before anybody's
ever charters anything is going up
unfortunately there are so many people
are against cash bail that they never
say whether late is there another system
so when I'm up here yelling look we just
need to keep this bail system long
enough so we can put something in its
place it wasn't about cash bail and so
that was to me was a soil amazing and
Baltimore for instance you can have a
ten thousand dollar bail right and you
can give a bail bondsman a hundred
dollars and you'll get out it's unlike
anywhere else around so you and your
family members could come over a hundred
thousand dollars the bail bondsman will
get you out for one percent or less than
one percent and that's what the system
that made Baltimore unique and different
and there were so many activists and
other people who didn't understand the
bail bonds industry and that's what's
going on so now we've removed it we've
enhanced an increased mass incarceration
our state's attorney has a person who
goes there and answer to everybody be
held without bail so they're holding
these young people in without bail and
some of our older people they're losing
their houses they're losing their their
life and their livelihood and then when
it's time for their trial the state's
attorney then will say look we'll charge
you with the misdemeanor if you agree to
plead guilty so he charged them with a
misdemeanor and now they're pleading
guilty for something suspend all but
time served how is that fair that's not
what justice is about so for me I will
be different a lot different I recognize
what it's like to be charged because I
represent the people I know what it's
like for a mother who works two jobs to
pay me two hundred fifty dollars a month
because only things she has beside her
job as her baby
and her babies charged with a crime and
he died see him shaking in the jail cell
and what about the kids who can't read
you know how many people I've had to
read the facts their case to because
they couldn't read their discovery I
know what it's like for these kids and
no one's really been there voice isn't
it time that someone who was on the
other side of that line was their voice
for me the criminal justice system could
really change people's lives if it
happened the right way I don't want you
to be a part of it and I'm fortunate if
you're in it I want you to get up on
your feet I want you to do something
better with your life because I want you
to be a success story because at Howard
University I learned you have to lift as
we climb
now let's I want to talk about some of
the things you said you talked about one
of your opponents in the targeting of
the bgf you also in your sort of planet
what you said today you talked about
this logo some like violent offenders
and some people would say that like if
it is a known and there are a lot of
issues with like the way we categorize
gang gangs in general but if it's like a
known sort of group of gang members how
would that not fall in line what you're
saying about like prosecuting violent
offenders that like you seem to be
criticizing him for prosecuting a group
of violent offenders but you also sort
of talk about about taking about
limiters off the street as like a part
of your strategy so what's the
difference there well many people that
were in that group were not part of BGF
they just happen to live in that
neighborhood where some bgf people were
he did a wiretap that wiretap arrested
anybody who talked to anybody so you
could have a cousin who's part of bgf
and you know I'm Baltimore you can have
your cousin your cousin does what they
do if they hustle they hustle but the
end of the day they still your cousin
and if you go to the barbershop you're
in a barber shop before five people they
could be bgf you know you're not
involved in their life so what they did
and what he did not have an experience
or knowing what's happened in the
community
remember this gentleman never really
lived in Baltimore City and if you'd
even look at his record his driving
record he only moved in a Baltimore City
November 3rd 2016 I've been in Baltimore
since 1995 I moved out the city for a
very brief time period to have my mother
who's handicapped built her house so she
could have a place then my wife and I
moved right back into the city I've
always been associated city connected to
the city understand what makes the city
live Bree
and so from my standpoint I understand
that not everybody you have two black
men on the corner that doesn't mean both
of them are sitting out there selling
drugs yeah that makes me I think my push
is like how do you and this is like I'm
genuinely curious is you talk about
violent offenders and that makes sense
to me how do you do that in a way that
doesn't recreate the same sort of
race-based disparities that you seem to
be criticizing like I don't I'm trying
to understand that like what you do with
violent offenders is to me let's take
how I kind of view a lot of programs
called community prosecution community
prosecution deals with the grassroots
level right in the community and one of
the things that made me really
understand it could work was this lady
named Miss Johnson goes to my church
these boys sit out there and sell drugs
right outside her stoop there's no
camera nothing they sell on Tuesday
Thursday Saturday and Sunday
and so community prosecution involved
miss Johnson just coming to one of our
community forums she could tell her
pastor what's happening she may not come
or pass well let us know then we'll have
a car where the police go with the video
cameras and I'll do a couple undercover
buys once they do that we videotape and
we know who the individuals are who
actually selling the drugs it could be
twenty people on the corner but we know
which two came to the car and just sold
it sell the drugs we'll have a warrant
for their arrest when we arrest them
then we get in their phone once we get
in their phone will see the real
communications that are between the two
of them once we see the real
communication between the two
communications also go up to say who's
bringing the packs in and things like
that we're not just talking about hey
you're having a conversation with a
person hey what's going on what's
happening and so from there you begin to
have a better understanding and that's
how you begin to take down the gang what
happens oftentimes with a lot of those
Rico style federal style investigations
they come and grab everybody and once
they grab everybody people would just go
ahead and plead guilty because they're
afraid my whole thing is let's not do a
a wiretap from the top looking down
let's do it from the ground floor
building our way up to really see who
the people communicating what they're
doing in my case my gentlemen and that
the case that I had with my opponent my
gentleman got his hair cut in a
neighborhood and he was a bodybuilder
and so one of the guys who was selling
drugs he said hey I'm gonna come by and
get that I understand to me that sounds
like it's something drug-related he goes
and that goes in the house comes back
out the police
stop it was a brown powdery substance
they thought it was heroin I'm getting a
hundred percent it was tested and came
back to be creatine the officers told my
opponent hey this man has creatine my
opponent said doesn't matter he talked
to someone from bgf so he's charged he
was charged with being a known gang
member and because of that he lost his
job but he couldn't get his 401k because
the company had a policy if your charge
is something with you as an act of
terrorism we can't give you a 401k he
literally lost everything so it takes
understanding the people and
the rooh thank you for joining us on
party of the people my pleasure so good
to be here so I know we recorded alive
and the audio was awful so here we are
in the studio take two here we go
so why state's attorney you know I spend
a lot of my time explaining to folks in
Baltimore that there is no one who can
do more good for criminal justice reform
in Baltimore or can have more of an
impact on crime in Baltimore than the
state's attorney so many folks think
when crime goes up we blame the police
commissioner or we blame the mayor we
blame the City Council but the reality
is that in Baltimore and other cities
across the country it's always been the
top prosecutor that has set priorities
that has led these proactive
investigations that have made such a
difference you know the tragedy of what
is unfolded in Baltimore these last
couple years is not just that we've had
eleven hundred plus murders and Counting
not just the tens of thousands of
burglaries and robberies that are
happening by the dozens every day the
tragedy is that it didn't have to be
that way in fact for over a decade we
saw fewer and fewer arrests in Baltimore
we saw fewer and fewer young black men
incarcerated for petty offenses year
after year and we saw fewer and fewer
homicides and shootings and carjackings
and robberies we figured out a way to
bring crime down and at the same time
arrest fewer people and that was led by
prosecutors it was the US Attorney for
the District of Maryland the state's
attorney for Baltimore City the Attorney
General for the state of Maryland who
were spearheading those strategies and
today I sit here in a city that I love a
city that has given my family so many
opportunities and crime is out of
control it has become the defining
narrative of Baltimore and if we want to
change what's going on in Baltimore we
have to start by tackling the problem of
crime and I don't think I don't think
anybody has more power to do that than
the state's attorney for Baltimore City
and what in your experience qualifies
you for this role you know I've had the
privilege of dedicating my entire career
to public service as you know I'm from
Baltimore and my parents are retired
city schoolteachers my mom taught at
poly before I was born and finished her
career at Morgan State my father was at
Edmondson and Douglas and southern
Western these proud schools with long
traditions in Baltimore and I myself am
the product of public schools I went to
Edmondson Heights Elementary and I
graduated from Woodlawn high school and
then I had the privilege of going to
Yale for college and Harvard for Law
School
where I served as president of the
Harvard Law Review before Barack Obama
made it cool I then clerked on the US
Supreme Court for Justice Stephen Breyer
and then I returned to Baltimore for a
career in public service I was a federal
prosecutor I was a city prosecutor I was
the head of the major investigations
unit which was a unit dedicated to going
after the most dangerous criminals the
most violent gangs and most recently I
served as Deputy Attorney General for
the state of Maryland and between my
deep roots in Baltimore and a career as
a proven prosecutor we're in a very
precarious moment here in Baltimore I
think my entire career has prepared me
for this this extraordinary moment now
let's talk about your platform so you
make a pretty aggressive claim that
you're gonna cut homicides about half in
the first three years of your
administration if you are the state's
attorney we've seen people running for
this office time and time again and make
big claims that they are not able to
follow through on what makes this one
something that you think you actually
could pull off let me say a couple of
things let me start by talking about the
politics of this actually most political
consultants would tell you to say you're
gonna reduce crime or you're gonna
reduce crime significantly they never
actually give you a concrete marker that
you can be measured against a lot of my
advisor said why are you suggesting such
a concrete number when you're running
for re-election they're gonna hold you
to that and my answer was I want to be
held to that I'm not saying these things
to get elected I'm saying these things
because these are the pledges that I
make that I believe I can deliver on and
if I can't then the people of Baltimore
are entitled to hold me accountable
against my own promises and pledges the
second thing to bear in mind is this
isn't as ambitious as it sounds we were
80% of the way there five years ago if
we cut murders in half in Baltimore our
city would be almost as safe as
Milwaukee as Oakland
that's how off the charts we are but I I
remind people that you're right people
oftentimes say the same 15 words when it
comes to crime
focus on violent repeat offenders let's
invest in the youth let's focus on
re-entry all of those things are true I
believe them deep in my heart but I
think what distinguishes me from
certainly the other candidates but from
a lot of other politicians is the
concrete details of the plan afterwards
what are the next 15 words for the next
150 words for how you translate those
aspirations those promises into results
so we put out a very specific plan we're
gonna focus on the 11 deadliest
neighborhoods in Baltimore City each of
which have had 50 or more homicides and
shootings since 2015 we're gonna develop
focused gang prosecutions in each of
those neighborhoods that's not about
locking up the corner boys it's not
about mass incarceration about
identifying the engines of violence the
specific violent repeat offenders that
are part of these organized crews and
bringing them to justice
thanks to proactive long-term
investigations the second thing I want
to do is I actually want to marry
community policing with community
prosecution our prosecutors shouldn't be
doing cases in West Baltimore one week
in cases in East Baltimore the next week
they should get to care about their
community they should get to know not
only the patrol officers and the Intel
lieutenants but the faith leaders the
community organizations the schools the
streets the violent gangs the violent
repeat offenders that define their
particular plot of responsibilities that
I think gives them a sense of ownership
over that as well the third part of the
plan is to focus on high-impact
prosecutions and if it's okay let me
come back to that looks that thing's an
important one the fourth is to reinvest
in reentry one of the most terrifying
statistics about Baltimore City is that
73% of the people that are released into
our city are really incarcerated within
three years that's absolutely
unacceptable it is the definition of a
revolving door when I decided to run I
promised myself I wouldn't over promise
what I can do I can't solve that problem
alone I've got a thirty five million
dollar budget and 200 lawyers that work
for me but I can be the tip of the spear
I can go into prisons not six days
before people are released but six
months before they're released and sit
down and talk with the most at-risk in
25:35 of them and say gentlemen and a
lot of them will be young black men we
got some bad news and we got some good
news the bad news is that you are at
greatest risk of being killed or killing
someone else within a year of your
release the good news is that no one in
this room wants that to happen so we're
gonna develop for you a comprehensive
reentry plan that addresses your
specific demons the trauma from your
childhood the substance abuse challenges
that you struggled with as an adult the
record that needs to get expunged the
skills deficits that we need to be
addressed that job training the housing
placement that we need to make sure is
in place before you get out to ensure
that you have a successful shot at
becoming constructive member of society
again that prosecutors can do that's
something that prosecutors have been
doing in the outside of prisons there's
no reason we shouldn't be playing a role
when it comes to re-entry as well the
last part of the plan is really
important because we have to stop
prosecuting victims of addiction and
victims of trafficking for petty
offenses every time we decide to
prosecute a heroin addict for loitering
we are making a decision to take
resources away from a circuit court
felony prosecutor who's got too many
carjackings on on their docket when I
announced my campaign I said we're gonna
bring record-breaking homicide rates to
record lows at record speed and at the
same time create the most transparent
innovative progressive Prosecutor's
Office in American history and I mean
what I say we don't need mandatory
minimums we don't need mass
incarceration we're gonna stop and end
the cash bail system we're gonna stop
seeking life without parole for
juveniles and we're gonna stop
prosecuting victims of addiction and
victims of trafficking for these petty
offenses categorically across the board
and one of the reasons why that's so
important for a city like Baltimore is
those are resources we can reclaim to
focus on what I referred to earlier as
high-impact prosecutions a couple years
ago reported with the Baltimore Sun
found that Baltimore had one of the
highest lethality indexes in the country
so in most American cities even the most
dangerous ones one in five one in six
shootings ends in death in Baltimore
it's one in three and this reporter said
I don't understand we got Johns Hopkins
one of the best hospitals in the known
you know
on the east side we got a level 1 Shock
Trauma Center at the University of
Maryland on the west side where some of
the best surgeons in the country come to
Train why are our shootings more fatal
than other American cities well he
looked at data nobody had ever looked at
before he figured it out
turns out Baltimore has a higher
percentage of headshots than any other
American city Baltimore has a higher
average caliber weapon than any other
American city and Baltimore has more
casings per crime scene than other
American cities quite literally our
shooters are using bigger bullets more
bullets and they're finishing their
victims off with headshots again that's
terrifying but there is an insight there
there's an opportunity there because in
2015 three years ago we had 344
homicides
nearly 250 of which are unsolved today
it's a terrible clearance rate again I
can't go and solve all of them but what
I can do is create a cold-case unit of
prosecutors as I've pledged to do to
focus on those homicides that have the
profile of being committed by a serial
killer because if you're using 40
caliber weapons and high-capacity
magazines and finishing your victims off
with headshots that's not your first
crime it's not even your first shooting
you've done it over and over again and
we can bring a measure of justice not
only to that family but we can prevent
two or three or four more those are the
kinds of things that we can do to create
a progressive office but also a more
safe City now how did you get to have is
it the aggregate of all those things you
didn't just sort of adds up to have how
did you get yeah you know between
college at Yale and and Harvard Law
School I spent three years in McKinsey
and we did lots of tables and graphs and
I want to be very concrete about this
those 11 neighbourhoods account for
about 40% of the homicides in Baltimore
City and one of the things that we did
was we said let's look at two examples
of prosecutions we've done in Baltimore
City to see what kind of impact we can
have on those neighborhoods and we made
some assumptions we said if we were half
as successful in those 11 neighborhoods
as we were in Greenmount in Cherry Hill
in investigations that I was involved in
here's the impact we could have with
that particular strategy and we made
similar assumptions about each of the
five strategies to find that we could
get us to half it's also linked to the
fact that that's where we would have
been
just a couple of years if we'd stayed on
track from before three years ago so you
know the new state's attorney the
current state's attorney excuse me got
into office in 2015 if we'd stayed on
track from the two thousand eleven
twelve thirteen fourteen that's where
we'd have been just a couple years later
let's talk about the idea of the Lebanon
deadliest neighborhoods in the gang
prosecution how do you focus on gangs
without recreating the disparities
around race that we know exist in the
criminal justice system and I asked
because you and I both know that people
who are involved in Street organizations
don't carry around membership cards are
like hey I'm in a gang like please come
arrest me so how do you do that in a way
that isn't just creating drag nets and
communities and sweeping people up ya
know it's a really important point
because there is a temptation to try to
ratchet up the number of people you've
been dated and what I think is really
important is to make sure your
prosecutors know that their goal is not
to get everyone off of the street it's
to get the engines of violence off the
street and the truth is that prosecutors
have to sleep in the bed they make if
you indict a lot of people just for the
sake of the indictment two things happen
number one you lose credibility with
judges number two you got that many more
cases that you have to resolve and so as
a federal prosecutor we learned that the
importance was not to indict a hundred
people he was to indict the ten or 12
that were most important to that
organization and you can look at their
records you can look at soft
intelligence from the community you can
look at the crimes that those
individuals are committing to make sure
you're not arresting every victim of
addiction who happens to also sell drugs
for the organization every you know
homeless person who happens to also you
know get a little bit of money to to you
know to hold some of the cash or hold
some of the drugs
that's an irresponsible strategy it's
also not gonna make us any safer
and by the way when you do arrest some
of those individuals you're not actually
making the streets safer because they go
charged with some modest role in the
organization and they go right back out
they spend 12 hours in central booking
and the right background of the street
and the only reason frankly they spend
more time is if they can't make some
modest cash bail because they can't
afford it and that of course is a
huge problem here in Baltimore City that
I intend to end by you know getting rid
of the cash bail system all together in
Baltimore but in the meantime if you're
not being thoughtful and focused on who
you are bringing to justice
these dragnet strategies of yesteryear
end up creating lots of cases but very
little safety for the sake of the
community let me paraphrase back what I
think I heard is the the way that you
would not recreate the disparities is
focusing on like high people who are
leaders essentially yeah like that would
be the strategy I think there's there's
two critical criteria
there's the leadership and the folks
that are actually committing the
carjacking of the shootings and the
killings those are the categories of
folks that you have to bring to justice
to you know bring into a courtroom if
you're gonna try to reduce the violence
level and then you create this
opportunity in that community to allow
all the other social services to come in
to make sure that the the treatment
alternatives for these victims of
addiction are immediately available to
make sure that the job opportunities for
the corner boys that used to be working
for that gang are provided an immediate
alternative the criminal justice system
has for too long been asked to shoulder
the burdens of society that won't work
but I can create the opportunity within
a particular neighborhood so that the
other institutions of government can
come in and make a real impact but if
you're trying to treat victims of
addiction in a community in the morning
and in the afternoon a gang is trying to
sell them drugs you're never gonna make
much progress you're gonna take two
steps forward immediately two steps back
but if you can extract the gang and the
violent repeat offenders and the leaders
from the organization off the streets
you then do create a window to really
make a difference now you talk about
opportunity you and I both were here in
the city when the ceasefire came to
Baltimore and operated in Baltimore you
and I both know that and we didn't know
each other at the time but we know that
ceasefire did not have the impact that
people thought and for those of you
listening ceasefire was this initiative
of or ceasefire was this idea of we will
flood neighborhoods and people who have
been
justice-involved with resources so well
how people come to like the basement of
a church as a part of their probation or
parole or whatever condition and they'll
be resource providers there and that
just didn't actually change it didn't
have an impact and it seems like you are
proposing something similar to that so
what would be different about your
approach that you are arguing would have
an impact yeah well let me first start
by diagnosing why ceasefire didn't seem
to have the success in Baltimore that it
saw in other cities and it's important
to remember that ceasefire nationally
has had tremendous impact on you know
big and small cities on cities like
Baltimore and similes different from
Baltimore but in this respect there is a
frustration that breaks the heart of
people like you and me that love
Baltimore there are always people that
are looking for someone else to stumble
there's a constant ambition among so
many people in government and I hear
these stories where folks were rooting
for cease fire not to work because they
were thinking about running for mayor or
they were hoping that that particular
division wouldn't succeed because they
wanted that division to not be as
coveted or glorious as another one he
was really frustrating but let's talk
about more specific concrete things and
again I think that there were two
aspects to this one of them was the
continuity ceasefire is one of these
models you have to learn you have to
have prosecutors and police understand
how to do the exercise you and I were
talking about how about how to
distinguish between the people that need
to be brought to justice and the people
that don't have darted not the priority
and that takes time and ceasefire needed
an investment over time that had some
continuity to it that it never gotten
you know we had a change of leadership
in the mayor's office we had a change of
leadership in the police commissioner we
have a change of leadership in the
state's attorney's office and all of
those things are disruptive forces that
make a program like ceasefire which is
non-governmental really struggle because
you get different people giving you
my guest today needs no introduction Ben
Rhodes who you all know as the former
deputy national security advisor for
strategic communications for Barack
Obama and now he is the author of the
book the world as it is a memoir of the
Obama White House Ben welcome back to
the show good to be with you Tommy as
always so my first impression of this
book is that it's well first it's really
good I mean I'm like you're it but it's
it's not just good cuz it's good writing
and it's not good because it's about
Obama and I like Obama it's good because
it's brutally honest you know this is
not a hey geography this is you were
honest about his faults you were honest
about your own mistakes and faults I
feel like reading this that you went
through an evolution from defending his
foreign policy to just explaining it and
it is the best explanation of the things
he did and why he did them and the
headwinds and things we faced at the
time that I've read literally anywhere
so did it take you some time in space to
get to a place where you could even
write this thing because it certainly
took me a while to realize that like I
was no longer a spokesman I didn't need
to respond to everything on Twitter and
I could actually step back and be a
little analytical yeah it's a really
good point I think there are two things
that that helped me one is like the the
the dynamic I was going for when I sat
down to write this was to try to explain
to people you know because there are a
lot of White House memoirs or
administration memoirs and not a lot of
them you know or that memorable they
tend to just kind of defend positions
that people took in meetings and that's
kind of it what I realized was a little
different about my story is it I was 29
years old when I moved out to Chicago to
work on the campaign and I was seven and
you know Matt you Tommy I was like
totally anonymous you know I was an
enormous you know unlike you know
Hillary Clinton or John Kerry or Leon
Panetta so a reader I wanted to explain
to a reader what's it like to be like a
normal guy who finds himself suddenly on
a campaign and then in the White House
and then in this deputy advisor role so
pull back the curtain on the personal
dynamic you know
what did this do to my personal life
what is it like to find yourself
suddenly in in that kind of pressure
cooker in that kind of limelight and and
that gave me an entry point I think to
speak more honestly about like my own
doubts and self doubts and flaws and
then right you open this thing like in a
long-distance relationship you hope will
last sleeping on a mattress on the floor
in Chicago yeah yes I'm married with two
kids by the end I mean like that's a
massive life change exactly and this is
all playing out you know your life as
you know doesn't stop when you go into
these jobs yeah but it looks like it
does to the outside world but you know
yeah I moved at Chicago I was you know
living with my girlfriend had to do a
long-distance relationship
see if that works is this job gonna work
out you know I didn't I could have told
you then that I'd end up being the
deputy national advisor and so that gave
me a kind of a voice and a way to talk
about things that was more personal and
less like a recounting of events but you
make a great point I mean you know the
instinct that you have is to be a
spokesperson for Obama and to defend him
and defend his legacy and it did take
you know some some doing to just kind of
get that mindset to the side because I
realized you know overall I obviously
you know would want to defend our policy
do think highly of President Obama but
you know what like that's gonna be more
credible if you're honest about what you
did wrong or what you don't know you did
right or wrong or the warts and all on
his character and my character and all
of us and and you know honesty is
ultimately more credible and I had a
weird experience when I was with you
also when we did a pod said the world
event with Samantha in LA I remember
some guy in the audience asked me like
why did we didn't why did we didn't
recognize the Armenian Genocide and I
remember saying well that was a mistake
we should have done that and it was the
first time I think I'd ever done that in
public just been like yeah it's
something we did is a total mistake and
and it was liberating to be like I don't
have to just say well we were weighing
these security concerns it's a small
thing but but it does allow for I think
a better understanding for people of
what it was what it was like to go
through this yeah and it turns every it
turns discussions about these issues
into conversations and not argue
yeah it's just such a nice place to get
to um I just want to go into one
specific criticism and then step back
more you talked about during the Arab
Spring you felt like after those initial
days of pushing the envelope on on
universal rights and human rights and
support for the protesters that the
government and Obama as well sort of
fell back into a traditional posture of
supporting the military and those in
power and when you pushed Obama on this
you said quote at times he seemed to be
hurt
using his powerful mind to find
justifications for more modest ambitions
and essentially that our response during
the Arab Spring didn't meet the
magnitude of the change that was
happening across the region do you think
that his ambitions were moderated by
cautious advisors like Bob gates or was
it political concerns or a growing
recognition of our inability maybe to
influence events or some combination of
all of that it's a fascinating question
and I think there are two issues here
there's Egypt in particular and there I
do think that the advisors and the
instincts of the US government ended up
pulling him back and I think I find a
lot wrong with what we did on Egypt you
know I supported breaking with Mubarak
not just because it was the right thing
to do but because frankly I didn't think
Mubarak was going to be able to
withstand those protests that was a
minority position and the government
certainly not the position of Bob Gates
and Hillary Clinton and and our agencies
in national security agencies and what
happened Tommy after that and you you
were there you may remember this the
government never adjusted to Obama's
position you know their default was we
work with the military we work with the
intelligence services and as soon as
Mubarak was out of power there was kind
of this rush to just embrace the
military that was in the interim role as
leading the country and a lot of
mistakes were made by the you know the
military kind of set up a dynamic in
Egypt where the Egyptian military where
it was kind of them or the Muslim
Brotherhood binary and they kind of
sidelined secular parties it might have
offered a third alternative and
ultimately the Muslim Brotherhood won
the election in part I believe because
of how the military set that dynamic up
and then ultimately the Egyptian
military had a coup
which we didn't even call a coup which I
often think was a mistake and so I feel
like we I don't know that Egypt you know
you could never go back and say
everything would have turned out
differently but I do feel like we never
saw through to a logical end point a
policy that had democracy in Egypt as as
its goal that we basically you know took
this dramatic action and breaking
Mubarak but the the government didn't
change its general orientation of being
deferential to the Egyptian military in
the aftermath of that shift
I think separately on the questions of
military intervention in Libya and then
ultimately Syria there I think Obama on
his own was very was very cautious and
frankly after he did intervene in Libya
was even more reluctant to do so in
Syria there I actually in the book I
described kind of going through this
evolution of coming to believe that he
was right and and and and looking at
these countries you know realizing our
ability to use our military to shape
events inside of Syria or Libya was
ultimately going to be very limited so
you know I think you know historians
will be debating this for four decades
but I do think you know we have to
acknowledge that we we kind of charged
up the hill at the beginning of the Arab
Spring but we we never went all in in
support of it and ultimately Obama's
more cautious instincts kind of came
together with the dysfunction in the
Middle East to lead to a much more you
know moderated deliberate type of
approach yeah I mean just just to plug
the book again for a second I mean you
it really brought me back to those 16 17
crazy days when the protests were just
rolling in Egypt I mean there was that
final phone call where Obama told
Mubarak that it was time to go and I
remember standing outside the Oval
Office I think you were in it and
hearing not just Obama shouting into the
phone but you could hear Mubarak
screaming back in English and Arabic on
speakerphone it was just they felt like
the world was moving so fast and there
absolutely nothing we could do to keep
up with it another great little anecdote
just before I move on just talking about
the you know the president can make a
decision but the government doesn't
always follow my favorite little note in
that is when you were talking about
writing a Guantanamo speech you said you
sent the intelligence community and edit
calling Gitmo illegal black hole and you
cut back a note that changed it to
detainees at Guantanamo a more legal
representation have been afforded more
process than any enemy combatant in the
history of the world
so yeah a little inertia there it is
real quick on that one I mean I was like
31 years old right right writing this
book are we yeah another campaign you
know we've been saying we're gonna close
Gitmo and it's a black hole cuz nobody
there has been prosecuted and then I get
in government I write a speech like that
and you have to clear that the
intelligence community and I get that
back and I'm like what do I do with this
you know like his white yeah exactly it
was a it was definitely a situation
where you realize that unlike a
presidential campaign the US government
it's not a deep state but it is it does
have its own antibodies yeah I'm jumping
around a bit but I want to go to that
just that the period you opened with in
the book that post-election period which
is you know publicly Obama is the guy
bucking up the whole white house he's
graciously welcoming Donald Trump to the
Oval Office he's putting on a brave face
with foreign leaders but privately he is
starting to question what happened and
whether that means his entire worldview
and approach was wrong and whether he
may be backed people into a corner and
led them to revert to tribalism Maureen
Dowd wrote a kind of shitty column
asserting that that anecdote that
chapter you wrote about means Obama
thought he was too good for us I thought
that was a miss Reid but you were there
what was he thinking what was he saying
and what were those weeks and months
like yeah you know the notion that that
that was arrogance you know that that
was a surprising take for me because
actually the opposite he was second
guessing you know himself and profound
ways and self examining and profound
ways I
what happened essentially and I tell the
story like you know at first he was
bucking us all up in the White House you
know and then
as time began to pass you know he
started to question things like we all
did like well you know was that the
Comey letter or was that the Russians
was it the Hillary campaign like well
how did this happen
but then what was really interesting as
we went on this farm trip and the
consequences abroad felt even more stark
than at home in this strange way because
at home you at least have to have in the
media that he said she said and there
both sides abroad it was uniform horror
at what had happened you know we in in
Greece and then Germany Angela Merkel
was you know we I described she had a
tear in her eye the last time she saw
Obama we get to to the summit Lima
everybody's kind of asking him well
what's gonna happen now we had this
meeting with Justin Trudeau where he
tries to kind of urge him to speak up
for for liberal values going forward and
you know I think what what he's
referring to there is not were we wrong
about the campaign or about Heil earlier
he's referring to the pace of change in
the United States and and in really the
West I'd say you know the the the
movement of people trade that that
globalization in a way had gotten out
ahead of where people were and that
people whether it's the brexit vote or
the Trump election it showed that people
were clinging to their you know more
traditional identities whether it's make
you know Russia great again or make
America great again that that
essentially his brand of inclusive
politics was not what was rejected by
voters who wanted to be tribal and and
didn't want to embrace a future that is
more inclusive and diverse and tolerant
and globalist to use a word that has
come under assault and that that's what
he was really wrestling with is like how
do we balance you know as progressives
our view that the world continues to
move in a certain direction with the
kind of reactionary forces that want to
push back against that and that the
balanced you know we had to take
seriously the fact that you know this
was a pretty dramatic correction with
brexit and Trump winning elections and
with Putin kind of asserting himself
you know should lead all of us to at
least you know question well how do we
if we're gonna promote these values
these progressive values how do we make
sure that they don't we don't do so in a
way that loses you know you're not gonna
want everybody over but you know that
loses contact with people who also don't
want to feel like their traditional
identities are under assault yeah you
got called up the Oval Office right
after Obama's meeting with with Trump
right yeah but so the read out in the
book it sounds like in person face to
face Trump was a bit of a he was
friendly he was open to preserving the
Iran deal talking about Obamacare you
know it sounded like there was not a lot
of the bravado and bless her that you
see in public was that ever since talk
and Obama yeah I know there was none of
it and you know he was kind of bemused
he didn't really know what to make of it
because Trump was very had been very
ingratiating and said nice things about
how they both drew huge crowds and you
know we can draw big crowds but Hillary
can't and you know Obama's trying to
walk him through health care and
immigration and the Iran deal and you
know Trump's not particularly engaging
on that but saying oh yeah I'll take a
look at that and so he he was kind of
struggling to know what to do with that
you know in a way it'd be easier if
Trump came in and was like let's debate
healthcare you know but that's not what
happened and and you know it I think on
the one hand sure that made the meeting
go better it also made him think well
like what what's actually gonna happen
here ya know and during that same time
period
meanwhile the US government the
intelligence community they are slowly
coming to terms with just the amount of
Russian interference and theologian and
and all the stunning linkages to the
Trump campaign you write about how
initially you weren't right into those
discussions for reasons I'll let you
explain but then when you were brought
in you guys got briefed more and more
like probably daily what was it like
slowly coming to grips and getting
presented the full picture of that
amount of interference when the rest of
the world has no idea yet yeah it was
kind of like you know having the the
first edit of the horror movie and
watching it unfold
I mean first your point
you know and I wasn't you know wasn't
sour grape so I was in the meetings the
point I was making is essentially we saw
Russia develop a certain capability to
wage information warfare in Ukraine that
after the toppling of the Yanukovych
govern Ukraine Putin kind of went all-in
obviously annexing Crimea but also in
creating these capabilities he's
thousands of bots who could spread
social media disinformation a capacity
to lie a desire to push information into
Western publics using Artie their other
platform so we kind of got or even
intercepting phone calls and I talked
about one where they intercepted phone
call of a US diplomat and released it
publicly which you know I had never been
done while I was in government that I
could remember and what happened in the
election is the the Russia question was
treated like a cyber issue
so over that summer of 2016 there were
all these secret meetings and it
reminded me tommy of like the bin Laden
meetings when you now were there where
there are these people who are really
important meeting in Situation Room and
you're not invited and you kind of know
better than to ask like hey what's that
unmarked meeting you know and they
literally turn off the cameras that let
people's assistants see who's in a
meeting if it's breaking up etc that's
exactly right they don't put the topic
of the meeting on the door and stuff
which they normally do so I figured out
over time that that might have something
to do with Russia and finally in
September Susan Rice sat me down said
hey we've had this process going with
respect to Russia and we're gonna do a
statement from the intelligence
community that is you know calling out
there interference and she kind of
caught me up to speed on it now the the
problem I think in retrospect is that
there were no communications people in
those meetings because this was viewed
as kind of a cybersecurity issue right
so let's you know who can defend the
election systems and who can figure out
what the hack was and we'll bring the
communications people in at the end
which is how sometimes people thought
about you know a lot of things but it's
not just me like you know Jen Psaki for
instance - our communications director
she had been the target of a Russian -
information campaign you know they'd
spend years just disparaging her and you
know because she would criticize them on
Ukraine and when she was a State
Department so person we had some
experience about this fake news issue
and this is a kind of information
warfare issue there wasn't really at
that table and so when the statement did
come out from the intelligence community
in October saying that Russia was
meddling election it talked about the
hacking it didn't say anything about the
fake news and so it was kind of like the
missing piece of our warning and and how
we talked about these things
now I also was sympathetic to Obama he's
like look because I went to him and I
said that to him and he said well look I
mean we can't if I tell people that this
is fake news Trump's gonna say the
elections rigged the people consuming
that news aren't gonna listen to me you
she is an investigative journalist who
covers civil rights and racial injustice
for the New York Times magazine
she's a 2017 MacArthur Fellow which
means we just have met two geniuses
whose reporting has also won a Peabody
Award the George Polk award and the
National Magazine Award she's a total
badass
please welcome to call Hannah Jones I
[Applause]
[Music]
just want you all to understand the
level of genius that has been brought to
you tonight I hope you're I hope you're
getting it and fabulous hair let's be
clear we're excited to talk to you a
little bit about your work before we
dive into some of your reporting I would
love to talk to you about an
organization that you founded called the
I to be wells society and if you all
don't know who I to be wells is perhaps
you can talk a little bit about the
legend and Trailblazer that she was but
you founded it in order to increase the
number of people of color doing
investigative journalism which is
obviously critically important but
what's your vision in in 20 years in 30
years what do you want to be different
about the news because there are more
folks of color doing that kind of
reporting absolutely so if you don't
know who I to be wells was she was the
most badass reporter of the 19th century
she was a woman who was born into
slavery who went on to investigate the
true causes of lynchings of black
Americans
she had her newspaper burned down in
Memphis she was run out of Memphis she
went on to helped co-found the
n-double-a-cp she was a suffragist when
white suffragists try to segregate
suffrages marches she elbowed her way to
the front of the line because she
refused to be segregated
yeah I could I could go on and on she
hated me right I won't be held back from
the crudité I will have equal access to
the crew to tax exactly she fought for
that too
[Laughter]
but she off you know until recently most
people had never heard of her she was as
many black women cast to the shadows of
history and her true role and
investigative reporting was denied so in
2016 myself and three other black
investigative journalists found at the
IDB wealth Society for investigative
reporting because we were tired of being
the only black investigative journalists
that we saw and that matters because I
think it's clear in Trump's America that
investigative reporting is the most
critical reporting that happens in a
democracy it's the reporting that holds
power to account that uncovers the way
that power is wielded against vulnerable
people and to in this country are more
vulnerable than people of color but the
people who are often doing this work
don't come from those communities don't
have the same access to those
communities and so we decided that we
were going to change that that we were
tired of the excuses which we have all
heard in any organization that is claims
that wants diversity is we really want
to but we just can't find anyone that's
 and so we decided we're going
to train and mentor journalists of color
to become investigative reporters so
that when we here in three years five
years ten years that we can't find
anyone we can give you a long list of
people because we have trained them
ourselves
and a lot of the reporting that you have
been doing as of late has been focused
on school segregation and you recently
talked about the journey of finding a
school for your own daughter I'll never
forget my mother went to private schools
in st. Louis where I grew up decided to
send myself and my brother to private
schools when I asked her a couple months
ago if she had it to do all over again
if she would have made that choice she
said I probably would have homeschooled
you just because of all of the different
challenges that young people of color
endure in school settings and so as you
were going through this journey yourself
you talked a little bit about where you
and your husband landed on where she
would go and how challenging was that
journey for you sure so this is the part
where like all the white people in the
audience who have been on the right side
of this I'm about to show you how you're
on the wrong side of this issue right so
right so everyone in here I imagine
things to themselves is very progressive
yet we live in the third most segregated
city in the country and we have the most
segregated large public school system in
the country which means when it comes
down to actually living the values that
you espouse in a very intimate way which
is where do you live and where do you
send your children to school most of the
people I would say in this audience and
in the city don't live their values so
that's just the truth of the work that I
do
don't Cheers send your kids to school
black kids so I've written about school
segregation in my entire career and most
of the time that I wrote about it I
didn't have a child and as we all know
it's very easy to have values and to say
what you believe in when you don't
actually have a child that you have to
enroll in schools we moved to New York
again one of the most segregated school
districts and suddenly we're confronted
with the question of where were we going
to send our own child to school were we
going to send her to a school that
looked like the neighborhood we lived in
we live in their first iverson of course
a high poverty black neighborhood that's
right Brooklyn is the only borough
[Laughter]
and we had to decide if we were gonna do
what most middle-class parents do which
is use their advantage to get their kids
away from poor black kids and we decided
we weren't going to do that with our
daughter so the piece that I wrote in
2016 was about segregation in a liberal
City but also our decision to send our
child to a high poverty segregated
school because I truly don't believe
that my child deserves more than any
other child and I think until more of us
do with our actions what we say we
believe then we are either choosing to
sustain a system of vast inequality for
those children who have always been
disadvantaged or we can choose to do
things that will break that system down
and that's what we tried to do like I
want to do the right thing and I want to
help build an education system that's
fair and more equitable but I have to
choose where my kids go based on the
system as it exists right now and I want
my politics to make the world better but
I have to send us keep my kids to a
school as the world exists right now
what do you say to parents or struggling
with that difference what I say is you
cannot say that you want equality yet
seek to advantage your own child in
every way those two things are actually
in direct conflict and I'm not
pretending that it's easy if you read
the piece that I wrote in 2016 I talked
about my husband and I argued about this
we had a lot of fears the same fear that
every parent has you feel guilt right
you're you as a parent feel like I have
to try to do everything to give my child
the best of everything but if we do that
then we have to understand that the
system we have now will always exist and
that what we are saying is that for
those of us whose children already have
every advantage the most important thing
is keeping all of that advantage and
denying even a semblance of that
advantage to those kids who have been
disadvantaged generationally I
understand that most people are still
going to make that choice to advantage
their child I see my work is saying I'm
going to at least force us to confront
the hip
ah cracy of that to hold up the mirror
and acknowledge we actually don't want
equality so it's not easy yeah I know
right now there are people who are like
wait our daughter gets to middle school
then she's not gonna live her values
like people who are hoping that I will
fail to live my values I think about my
daughter and if there someday she will
ask me like mom what the were you
doing like what but the truth is these
are children and children who score
lower on test scores aren't scoring
lower because they don't care or because
they're dumb it's because they clearly
don't get the same education of those of
us who have privilege can ensure that
our children get and we need to share
that advantage because the difference is
the difference is do I give up a little
bit of advantage that I can make up for
I can give my child tutoring I can take
her to every museum I can give her
everything I can make up that advantage
before the poor black or brown child the
public school might be the only shot
that they have of a decent life and we
who have purpose want to take that too
and I think that's unfair we're in a
capitalist country if you want to buy
the best education you can with your
with your money feel free but these are
tax funded public schools and just
because you're rich you shouldn't get
exclusive access to the best schools
we've seen in just the past couple weeks
protests emerging across the country
against underfunded public schools from
Oklahoma to Kentucky to West Virginia
and these are protests about not about
inequities within the public schools but
about the lack of funding the lack of
teacher salaries pension issues writ
large across the school systems and
these are teachers protesting for every
school every student at the same time
you're talking about about inequities
within the public school system how do
you strike that balance because it seems
like one of the ways in which you can
get parents to care more about
inequities at the system or at least
take them on is by making every school
better right I mean how what is the
balance between making the whole system
better while solving inequality within
the system so one I think we should
understand that the struggles that we're
seeing across the country of
underfunding of public schools it's a
direct result of brown v board and the
desegregation of schools as we start to
see white Americans having to share
educational spaces you see it with draw
of support of public education that is
directly linked even in places where
there are not a lot of black kids it is
that understanding that once black
children get access to those spaces and
you can look at it in terms of public
pools public parks public hospitals
anyplace where after the civil rights
movement black people gained access you
started to see a loss of support so
these things are directly connected but
that also shows how the fates of all of
us are connected that you can't contain
that a lack of investment in schools
only the black schools that it becomes a
problem for all Americans no matter what
their colors are if we decide that
public institutions are no longer
important so I think that is the beauty
of integration is that it ties our fates
together we know that from the founding
of this country even before this country
when we decided that black people were
going to be a caste of people who didn't
have humanity who didn't have
citizenship at any time we have isolated
black people arrests away from those who
have power in this country we have
declined to give them the same resources
or access as other people when you
tie our fates together that means you
can't deprive a black child of a
textbook a teacher a teacher like I'm in
schools where there's no teacher in the
classroom if your little child is in
that class with it with that black child
- you will best be sure that if a white
child is in that class with that black
child that black child is gonna get with
that white child always gets so it's not
to say that there aren't struggling
schools that are white because there
clearly are but what it is to say is if
there's a black school nearby that black
school will always have less and that's
why we have to tie our fates together if
we ought to be a truly a multiracial
democracy and you know the odds are not
a white folks favor anymore numerically
who's gonna pay your Social Security
who's gonna pay for all of the things
that we need if we are depriving now 50
percent of the children born our people
of color of a proper education so as
Malcolm X would say one day our chickens
are going to come home to roost if we
continue to pretend that black and brown
children are not as worthy of the same
education that white people demand for
their children got the wrong person you
know you are we are indebted to you for
holding up the mirror to us even if we
don't want to look and see what's in it
and yet holding up the mirror hopefully
at least gives us some vision into what
can work even if it isn't working and so
I would just love to know from you as we
close out what good things are you
hopeful about and especially if there's
a good thing that you are certain about
we'd love to hear that any TV shows you
like so in general I leave hope to other
people because I'm always looking at you
know the long arc of history which I say
is actually a circle that keeps turning
back on itself is long and it bends back
to the beginning
exactly
hard to argue the one thing though that
I will say is when I first did my first
year-long investigation in school
segregation which is about four years
ago I set up a Google Alert on school
segregation in every search term having
to do with school segregation and I
could go a couple months without a
single article coming up we weren't
talking about it we figured it was a
settled issue we were done I get several
Google Alerts every day we have a new
superintendent or Chancellor in New York
City Schools who is bout it on this
issue at least appearing who's pushing
back against you know after when white
parents who have had outside control in
the school district I think all over the
country I give talks every single week
to communities who want to grapple with
this issue I don't think that we will
ever do right by black children in this
country but I think we are certainly at
a place where we cannot ignore it and
pretend that we are progressive people
well us grappling with that truth is due
in large part to you and your work so
thank you for holding up the mirror
thank you for the work you do every day
thank you for joining us upon saying
America
Nicole Hannah Jones everyone guys give
it up again for Nicole Hannah Jones
[Applause]
you
it's time for our under-the-radar
segment where everyone goes around and
mentions the most important story we
didn't get to cover Tommy
start with you thank you so I don't know
that he's under the radar but after
declaring that everyone believes he
deserves the Nobel Peace Prize no no no
president Trump is now saying he doesn't
know if his meeting with Kim jong-un is
going to happen coins may I know they
got those cool coins he's blaming the
Chinese for Kim's change of heart in a
press conference yesterday sort of like
what happens like I don't care it's no
big deal
this was predictable he took the meeting
with no deliberation no coordination
with his team they didn't try to make
sure everyone's on the same page he just
wanted the headline and so I I
personally would love love to see the
u.s. engaged North Korea in a diplomatic
process but this is technical this is
complicated the details really matter
and what worries me is that if these if
these talks fall apart and Trump's ego
gets bruised then what he just tore up
the Iran deal and this week he sent out
a Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to
spell out their their new plan such as
it is and what that plan was was a wish
list that said Iran should stop doing
everything that they do that we don't
like or else they will face sanctions or
military force and the problem with that
is that the Europeans are ripshit pissed
at us for tearing up the Iran deal and
they're not gonna put on more sanctions
and the Russians and the Chinese sure as
hell aren't gonna pay attention what he
says about Iran so that means we either
back down or there's conflict so this is
very real very scary stuff and there are
no adults in the room speaking out and
navigating these very shallow rocky
waters of trumps intellect and ego and
that is not good
and one last thing I just want to say
which is not my
under the radar news which I just want
to thank the the wheeler family for
being here tonight they lost their son
band at Sandy Hook and they wake up
every day and they live with that
reality and they watch the news and they
see parkland and they see Santa Fe and
they keep fighting and working to get
real gun control past and if they can
wake up and fight for that and then we
can too
[Applause]
Alysa
okay what do you got for us let's talk
about our Secretary of the Interior who
wants to just burn down the parklands
and give it to like developers and also
does not have the love of animals that I
do I guess so I just want everyone to
know about this story in case you've
missed it because obviously so many
other insane things are happening on
Monday the Secretary of the Interior who
is known to have like mounted animal
heads and a taxidermy bear in his office
he and the Trump's have decided that
they're gonna roll back the rules of the
Obama administration which precluded
things like bears with mama bears with
their cubs being shot in their dens
coyote pups being shot in their dens
bears being killed while they hibernate
caribou who are swimming are allowed
we're not at the time under Barack Obama
Ken Salazar in Sally Jewell the caribou
we're not allowed to be shot while they
swam by motor boats and so the new
Secretary of the Interior
Ryan zenki he's rolling back all of
those protections and so it is his good
idea that especially in Alaska but you
know according to news reports to be
rolled out to many other states that
animals can be killed in the most
inhumane brutal ways that we have sort
of fought against for years and that
when we sort of when the Obama rules
came out everyone was like well of
course bears shouldn't be shot while
they're hibernating but that was before
Don junior and Eric and they just
thought that like Cecil the lion would
have been such a good get so anyway
there is a petition that is it's it's up
for review it's a 60-day review this
rule that they want to pass and it's up
for comment I think that I was the first
comment on the interior page but I will
again circulate
but everyone should shop because there
are so many terrible things happening
that they think we don't see things like
you know disgusting trophy hunting like
this isn't for people to eat you know
this isn't for people who need food
these are for people who want to mount
this on their walls and so anyway
that's my under the radar story and
follow me and I will circulate the
petition that you too can sign shoot a
buffalo from the Train love it what do
you got
we had a labor activist and expert named
Saru Jayaraman on love it or leave it
and it blew my mind
so I learned a lot about this so the the
current federal so the minimum wage is
the minimum wage we're all fighting for
a higher minimum wage the federal
minimum wage for tipped workers do you
guys know what it is it's to jump Wow
that's two dollars and 13 cents 43
states have a minimum wage between $2
and $7 this is I think one of those
issues where if Democrats really grabbed
onto it I think it would be obviously an
important policy because we're talking
about raising the wages for people that
work for all for Olive Garden that work
for IHOP you know one in roughly 1 in 11
Americans work in a restaurant half of
all Americans will at some point work in
a restaurant
seventy percent of tipped workers at
restaurants are women forty percent are
mothers
this is an economic issue over and over
again people who work in restaurants are
some of the poorest working people in
the United States in part because we
have this 2 dollar minimum wage and
there are some states that have passed
higher minimum wage especially a place
like California I think New York is in
the process of raising their minimum
wage for tipped workers but 43 states
again it's between two and seven dollars
it's also a issue around race because
it's a disproportionately people of
color that are working in these tip jobs
and people of color are tipped less than
than white people and white men also
it's a harassment issue because when you
tell people that they're not actually
paid by their employer that they're paid
by customers they're expected to endure
a greater level of abuse which is why
7% of a pea of people work in the
restaurant industry 37% of sexual
harassment claves are from restaurants
and finally it's a political issue I
think that if Democrats started talking
more about this there are 12 million
people I think that would come out to
vote for a higher wage because they're
currently working in restaurants there
are lots of people who no longer work in
restaurants who remember what it was
like to be harassed and underpaid and
relying on tips it's an antiquated
system and you know we've talked a lot
about the need to kind of have bigger
and bolder ideas to think differently
about politics because of what happened
and the fact that someone like Donald
Trump could become president and I think
one of those things that we need to
think about is how to make people who
are working every day some of the
poorest working people in United States
feel as though politics is about them
and one of the ways we could do that is
it is by raising the federal tipped wage
above $2.13 an hour and the restaurant
industry I am sure will come back and
say that oh this is about mom and top
restaurants there are exceptions you can
do there are lots of things you can do
this is about corporations that are
making millions and millions and
billions of dollars off the backs of
poor working people and they deserve a
living wage so that tips are on top of
what they earn and not instead of what
they earn and I think more Democrats
need to talk about it it's help them
organize and win in Michigan we stopped
it when the Trump administration tried
to get tips from people and this is a
this is it kind of under the radar issue
that I think could help get millions of
people to the polls yes praise be really
super fast event so we talked about that
on pad save the people and one of the
things I learned after that thanks to
the internet and Twitter is that one of
the things one of the unintended
ramifications of that can be that
kitchen staff then get cut out of pay
raises so that doesn't mean that we
shouldn't raise the tipped minimum wage
because we absolutely should it means
that we Democrats write the laws on this
they have to ensure that kitchen staff
have access and guaranteed eligibility
absolutely and I think in addition to
yeah no totally and I just every stat I
just said I stole from Sarah Russo just
that's Brittany what do you got trust
women I have that I do Porto Rico is
what I have we haven't heard much about
Porto Rico in a few months and that
might lead all of us to believe that
everything is fine there since Hurricane
Maria and I couldn't be further from the
truth
so what is it it's May 23rd right now
May 31st was the deadline is still the
deadline to have restored 100% of power
to all residents on the island as of
today there are 14,500 people still
without power which means that less than
1% of energy customers actually have
access to their power so we were
supposed to be at 100 percent in like a
week and we're at less than 1% in
addition there's a lovely gentleman
running for Congress in Florida John I
remember his name doesn't matter he's
running and he believes that the folks
who had the access and privilege to
actually be able to flee from Puerto
Rico to Florida should not be able to
vote when they get there even though
these people are Americans they're
American I'm not even trying to hide it
he's probably like ms-13 right yeah of
course and then on top of all of that
just two weeks ago peaceful protesters
who were in the streets protesting
measures such as school closings and
increased university tuitions and the
cutting of several benefits were met
with tear gas just two weeks ago and I
can personally tell you tear gas is not
fun there are a couple of things that
come to mind about this one is that
every single person there is a fellow
American and even if they weren't their
fellow human beings
and if I'm honest and if we're honest
with ourselves we can't blame Trump all
the way for all of us having forgotten
about Puerto Rico like that's on us and
I guarantee you that if we were talking
about an island or a state full of white
folks we would not be having the same
conversation people would have their
power people would be nobody would be
questioning their vote nobody would be
trying to close their schools or tear
gassing them in the streets Trump would
be there every other Sunday but every
yes because of the beautiful green
pastures yes but the call to action here
is to remember what did he go to
remember our fellow citizens there and
after you go and donate to Stacey Abrams
which you need to do Hey now the next
piece of homework is to find local
Puerto Rican charities and organizations
that are doing the work down there and
donate to them because it's really a
shame that we haven't been getting to
talk about this and here's mine so
Democrats had a very big night on
Tuesday last night a bunch of primary
elections across the country she want to
give a few highlights in Kentucky six
House districts we nominated the first
marine woman to fly an f-18 jet Amy
McGrath in Texas we nominated a
Democratic candidate who would be the
first Latina and the first openly gay
woman to serve as governor Lupe Valdez

intelligence officer in the Texas 23rd
named Gina Ortiz Jones in Georgia gun
reform activist Lucy bass the mother of
Jordan Davis goes to a runoff for the
six house district and we nominated a
candidate who will be the first black
female governor in American history
[Music]
[Applause]
here's the deal it was a good night for
Democrats turnout was up but a lot of
these places that all these people won
are very red and a lot of them start off
as underdogs a lot of these candidates
so we have a lot of work to do
we have 23 seats that we need to flip
the house there are five here in New
York there are five in New Jersey
that's 10 right there so after you're
done here tonight go to swing left org

very cool hello New York
[Music]
welcome to Radio City Music Hall and
welcome to positive America I'm Jon
Favreau what's up New York City I'm
Britney PAC net you can do it this is
cool I'm John Lovett I am Alyssa
Mastromonaco shout out to Dan Pfeiffer
we wish you was here we have some great
friends joining us tonight Seth Meyers
is here
I just heard Questlove is here
and the award-winning investigative
journalist for the New York Times Nicole
Hannah Jones is here I don't want to yet
we wanted to take it in a little bit
Radio City Music Hall that's ridiculous
that's ridiculous
so guys it has now been a year since the
President of the United States told the
country that he fired his FBI director
because of the Russia thing this then
caused Trump's hand-picked Deputy
Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to
appoint Special Counsel Robert Muller to
launch an investigation okay yeah Robert
[Applause]
Radio City Music Hall yeah to appoint
robert muller to launch an investigation
into donald trump and associates for
obstruction of justice and conspiracy to
defraud the United States one year later
the investigation has resulted in 75
criminal charges again 75 75 75 criminal
charges against 22 individuals and
companies and five guilty pleas on that
list of guilty pleas and indictments
includes Donald Trump's campaign manager
Donald Trump's deputy campaign manager
Donald Trump's national security adviser
in Donald Trump's foreign policy adviser
Donald Trump's personal lawyer and
business associate and all-around
wonderful guy Michael Cohen is also
expected
[Applause]
the crimes range from bank fraud to
money laundering to perjury to a
conspiracy to defraud the bipartisan
Senate Intelligence Committee has also
in concluded that Russia successfully
interfered in our election with the
purpose of electing Donald Trump and we
know from news reports that the Trump
campaign was not only willing to accept
that help from Russia but now from other
foreign governments as well like Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates so
Jon love it my first question is what
kind of a witch-hunt is this if the
witch trials in Salem had the hit rate
of a bob muller we would all remember
the story of the Salem witch trials as
that of a heroic prosecutor who saved
the town from a group of very real and
very dangerous witches I went through
that love it because I didn't want to
step back because it is easy to lose
sight in the daily news deluge of just
what this investigation has uncovered so
far do you find yourself sometimes doing
the same thing wondering just just how
big of a scope this has been yeah I mean
it's hard you know it's really it's both
really complicated and really simple
it's really complicated in that there
are many different piles of scandal I
think probably one of the hardest jobs
inside of the special council's
investigative office is sort of what
pile to put crimes into you know those
crimes a I'm probably at this point it's
crimes a DES F then G de L then then M 2
O which is always the busiest and then
you know we we spend a lot of time
breaking down the intricacies of this
scandal but Adam sir were in the
Atlantic made a really important point
which i think is often lost which is yes
these are a bunch of different very big
scandals tied together but ultimately it
is one big story which
the corruption of the federal government
by Donald Trump and his associates and I
think I'm glad we're stepping back
because I think we do lose the forest
for the trees a little bit and I think
people watching the news lose the forest
for the trees a little bit because every
day brings a new you know we've all look
we're a midway through the second season
and now we're meeting the taxi King
what's he about what's his motivation is
the taxi King gonna be someone who's
here for a few seasons or is it like a
mid tier Sopranos villain who shows up
and then dies three episodes later we
don't know yet we don't know how
important the taxi King is gonna be well
let's let's talk about that Tommy there
were two big stories about Michael Cohen
in the news today
one is Lovett referenced his former
business partner known as the taxi king
of New York some of you may know him he
got himself a hundred year jail sentence
reduced to zero years for agreeing to
cooperate with New York prosecutors and
Robert Muller so he must have something
fairly valuable to offer and then we
learned today that Michael Cohen
received a secret payment of four
hundred thousand dollars to set up a
meeting between between the Ukrainian
president and Donald Trump we've all
worked in the White House obviously that
happens all the time
Tommy why is this a problem for Cohen
and possibly for Donald Trump sure
gene Friedman the taxi King Michael
Cohen business partner is in trouble for
tax evasion he's cooperating with
covering investigators we don't know if
the cooperation is specific to the
investigation into Cohen but it's a
decent rule of thumb that if your
business partner is cooperating with the
government because they're in deep deep
trouble
you're in trouble just like it's a
decent rule of thumb that when you're
the president United States in your
lawyer / fixer is targeted by Bob Muller
you're in some trouble now the second
piece of this the second story you
mentioned to me seems to be a much
bigger deal which is that Michael Cohen
took at least $400,000 to arrange a
meeting between
the president of Ukraine and Donald
Trump which first of all like that
should not be a hard meeting to arrange
you should meet with the president right
Ukraine they're an important country and
an important region you should take that
meeting but clearly that's lobbying and
to lobby for a foreign government you
have to register under a lock called the
foreign agents Registration Act or fara
and the fact that he didn't you think
his paperwork slipped through the crack
fact he didn't mean he committed a crime
and could get up to five years in jail
now coincidentally right after this
meeting occurred between the president
you crane and President Trump the
Ukrainian anti-corruption agency stopped
looking at the Paul Manafort who we all
know ran Trump's campaign with the
chairman of this campaign it's in
serious triple trouble so what a
coincidence
in this unending saga filled with
coincidences that lead to sketchy
Russian people and Michael Cohen and
Donald Trump by a throwaway my burner
phones
I forgot my favorite part of the story
is a BBC story today and a Ukrainian
official is quoted saying that they were
they were shocked by how dirty Cohen is
this is this is a country where the
President Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned
he nearly died with Agent Orange
derivatives so you guys are seeing some
 Alyssa I want to go back to what
were you talking about a global strategy
group poll out today and this is a
democratic group they found that 55% of
the American people support the
investigation but only 41% believe that
it has uncovered any crimes so this kind
of goes back to what we're saying like
why do you think that is is this is it
too confusing for people to follow what
do you think I mean look we like we're
getting ready for the show and we're
quizzing each other unlike what we know
and so if you know people who followed
the news all the time are
double and triple-checking that they
understand I mean look Lesley Stahl was
on TV a couple days ago saying that
Donald Trump said to her you know yeah I
say that you're crooked and I say that
you're corrupt because then when I when
when news is reported people don't
believe it because they think you're out
to get me and so I think that that's the
I mean if you guys like go back to when
we were in the White House imagine the
level of detail people would have had if
one of our interns had winked at a
Russian you know I mean and so it's like
and that's I just think it's it's so
much for people to comprehend who are
primarily focused on putting food on
their tables and what it means to their
family like this is secondary at best
liars and criminals and I think you
might wait to try to figure out this
horribly convoluted thing I don't
believe what you have to say anyway
right Donald Trump told me not to
believe you but I don't want to miss
this point that loved it made though
right because the theme in this entire
administration has been entitlement and
privilege run amuck mm-hmm this is what
happens when you think the rules do not
apply to you if the media rules run
apply to you the basic rules of like
truth and fact don't apply to you the
electoral rules don't apply to you can
just steal whatever election you want
the hare rules don't apply to you
because you know how I feel about his
hair like there are just there is I mean
this is you know white supremacy is a
hell of a drug that's all Britany I was
gonna ask like how do you think
Democrats and activists should be
talking about all of this because
there's been this big debate you know
originally people said voters actually
don't care about this voters care about
their health care and their jobs and in
justices and and in their lives every
day and the Russia thing is very far
away and now people are saying okay
there's the all these crimes that piled
up it's this massive corruption it you
know has its global in scope and our
Democrats not talking about it enough
like how do you think you connect this
with people I genuinely think it's just
our responsibility to keep telling the
truth
like the world will only be post truth
if we let it be I am determined never
ever ever ever ever to let that happen
yeah right so wait I mean to be very
honest I was not the most excited about
coming to New York City because we're in
Radio City Music Hall which is really
incredible I was most excited because
this is the only city where you could
put on a salsa party outside of a racist
lawyers and he's like I'm not a racist
they're like yeah what about the other
forty videos I mean this is like I said
Donald Trump has never faced
accountability right if you can't pay
his bills he just filed his bankruptcy
if he can't get a date he'll grab a
woman by the if you know if he can't win
he'll cheat and so it is our job to hold
them accountable so keep telling the
truth that's our job
yeah no I I agree with that I mean I
think that we can overthink these polls
and and what voters want to hear and
whatnot it's like the president United
States has now been involved in a
criminal enterprise his campaign
chairman his national security visor all
these people have pled guilty their son
you're like we have to help people don't
know about that we have to tell them
about that you know it does seem as if
there's now two major stories that we're
dealing with the first is the
investigation of Donald Trump which we
just talked about and the second is
Donald Trump's attempt to shut that
investigation down and that second story
has really kicked up in recent days
Trump and his allies have claims that
the FBI and the Obama White House were
spying on his 2016 campaign that they
were wiretapping him today that they
were planting evidence that they were
trying to set him up and this would all
be I know this would all be laughable
except they have an entire propaganda
network pushing this conspiracy and
Trump has now ordered the FBI and the
DOJ to meet with hustler publicans and
revealed top-secret information about
the investigation no Democrats invited
no Senate Republicans invited because
the Senate Republicans have been a
little too responsible just the craziest
of the crazy I got the not even the
craziest of the crazy we are
now with the place where trey gowdy is
the responsibility is the adults in the
room to make sure crazy Devin newness
doesn't go too far I mean John how much
time do we spend pushing back on this
side of the story how much do we worry
about it because I would rather go out
there talking about the actual crimes
that were committed but you see in at
least in the mainstream press now I see
an analysis in New York Times and Axios
in other places and they're like well
Donald Trump is winning the message war
now so I know maybe we don't maybe we
ignore it maybe I stopped debating
chemist Rassilon whilst you she's on
Twitter I'd like everybody who's here to
encourage my friend John to stop arguing
with people who are wrong on Twitter are
they wrong
yes can he solve it probably not you
know it's it's so many there are so many
different things we have to do it once
and it's really really hard I don't know
the answer I don't think anyone knows
the answer because part of the problem
is we are trying to solve a structural
problem that has gotten worse over 30
years with words right now in a critical
moment before an election the Republican
Party and conservatives have spent 30 30
years building an incredibly powerful
propaganda apparatus
it is dangerous it is disruptive it
works Fox News works the the billionaire
funded sites that run from the
Federalists to National Review to the
Weekly Standard they work they work in
part because they employ some serious
adults who are right-wing and who I
disagree with terribly who provide cover
for some of the most despicable and
deceptive people in politics they
launder the ideas they get them into the
public they get them onto CNN they get
them into the New York Times we can't
win that fight before 2018 so I don't
know what you do I agree though with
Britney and with John that that we can't
just cede the issue because Republicans
of 60
muddying the waters I think it's about I
I think the fact that that poll shows
that most people don't don't view there
has having been proven criminality you
know we're gonna watch a clip later
where you see this kind of propaganda at
work is a good is a bit of instruction
of what we have to do we need to get
back to basics you know we've talked
about getting back to basics around just
saying Donald Trump is corrupt Donald
Trump is dangerous Donald Trump is
chaotic and here's how it hurts you
right that one-two punch we also have to
get back down to basics around the
corruption I think Democrats need to
stop being too cute by half and stop
trying to be too smart
I'm glad Schiff is fighting this I'm
glad we have smart Democrats kind of
fighting on the tactics we need to have
a simple elegant statement which is
Donald Trump's campaign chair his
national security adviser have pled
guilty or charged with crimes this
corruption is hurting you we need to
have four or five key sentences that we
say over and over again Donald Trump's
corruption is extended to this branch
Donald Trump's corruption is accepted to
that branch and hit that over and over
again and stop worrying about the
minutiae and stop worrying about Devin
Nunez cuz I don't think we can fix that
today we have to figure out how so I
just want to I just want to give a brief
shout out to some minutia because you
disagree with me and I love you you're
right
you are right but the hypocrisy drives
me crazy I remember when we were at the
White House there were a series of
national security like leaks or pseudo
leaks like a lot of information about
the bin Laden operation was given out on
purpose but then some things came out
that were they were problematic it was a
really bad leak about an operation Yemen
that actually put at risk some
operations there was a very serious leak
about Iran and efforts to stop their
nuclear program and Republicans in the
Senate called for a special counsel to
investigate the leaks right now the
leaks are coming from the Intelligence
Committee on the house side House
Republicans Devin unis and these people
are putting out information where they
are naming sources that are trying to
help their country and help the FBI and
the CIA and it is just astounding like
it is astoundingly reckless
and they need to be called out on it but
like there is the referees have just
sort of forgotten but like all that's
come before I mean I go through this
myself sometimes it's like you can
either go through all of these
conspiracies point by point and try to
debunk them but let's step back and just
think about what they're trying to say
here they're trying to say that the
Obama administration in the deep state
wanted to sabotage Donald Trump's
campaign and spy on it so first of all
they did a very shitty job of doing that
he won the election also fabs before we
go any further why would anyone have
done that because no one thought Donald
Trump was gonna win we're in this mess
cuz James Comey was like when Hillary
wins I'll get in real trouble if I don't
say this now James so James Comey who's
been leading this entire spying
operation on Donald Trump's campaign
he's like what's what's the pinnacle of
this operation I know a week before the
election I'll announce that we've
reopened the investigation into Hillary
Clinton that's it that's how I'll get
home you're playing checkers tell me
like the motivations behind this whole
thing doesn't make any sense I mean I
think this is all about distraction he's
you know some days I don't know if I
should be offended that they are
spending this much time talking about
you know these investigations and making
up Spygate and all of these things right
or if I should be deeply thankful that
they don't have time to do more
governing because the governing they do
sucks yeah that's right i i've vacillate
between those two emotions all the time
and I find myself not willing to go deep
on this conversation because while this
conversation is happening which is
important also people's lives are being
ruined right like families are being
separated at the border trans kids are
being told that they're not people women
are being told that you have you can
regulate our uterus is more than you can
regulate guns like all of this stuff is
very old
and I'm thankful that you all are paying
attention with the details because like
I think got time to I listen to positive
the people for the news crew segment
where I learned all the other very
important things that aren't
you
Piper big pot today Dan big pod we're
gonna be talking to our friend chase a
lot happening we're gonna be talking to
our friend Jason Kander about the new
season of majority 54 that's exciting
we'll be talking to enemy Chettiyar of
the brennan center for justice about the
prison reform bill in congress right now
we're gonna talk about a little bump in
the road on the way to trump's Nobel
Peace Prize I'm gonna talk about the
Prezi knighted States referring to some
deported immigrants as animals and they
were also about 700 stories about the
investigation of Donald Trump and his
crime family yesterday so we will try to
sort through those dan how are you today
you have any updates very happy happy
mother bursaries today today is the
one-year anniversary of Bob Muller
coming on the scene well I was gonna say
and in celebration of that anniversary
we have Bob Muller right here in studio
when they'll be excited you would tell
actually I would like that on the show
I'd like him to focus on this job to get
this thing wrapped up so greetings from
the Bay Area where we spend our time
waiting for babies to come so there's
that any minute now

could get literally downstairs from
where Haley is so at any minute I may
have to run upstairs and indirectly pass
it off but don't even get to the Ponte
title be great pods I will miss you guys

proceeds from the pre-sale go to swing
West though you're buying the book
you're helping me feel better about
myself but you're also helping a very
important organization so by the book
your bull okay let's get to the news
dan I regret to inform you that if
Donald Trump I'm sorry Dan I regret to
inform you that Donald Trump may not
have a lock on the Nobel Peace Prize
after all on Tuesday night North Korea
issued a statement that said quote if
the u.s. is trying to drive us into a
corner to force our unilateral nuclear
abandonment we will no longer be
interested in such dialogue and cannot
but reconsider our proceeding to the
North Korea United States summit
surprise surprise
it looks like tweeting crazy at a
madman was not the magical solution to a
challenge that has bedeviled presidents
of both parties for decades dan what
have we learned here about diplomacy
from I think your us beaver did not read
the David Brooks column that yeah Donald
Trump with a brand new unorthodox view
of foreign policy where maybe he just
understood the - the quotes ugh better
than anyone else which was why he was
able to grant the release of two of a
handful of some Americans who were
kidnapped during his presidency with
would indeed be put aside the fact that
a dozen or so were released during
Obama's presidency and the whole thing
is I guess the thing I would say here is
everything is tupid the reaction that
how everyone like this is a very serious
foreign policy thing it was always going
to be solving this problem is gonna be a
long shot I think a meeting would be a
very good thing I think it is great that
these Americans were released but the
idea that we that this is now considered
this is on the Fox News running list of
Trump's accomplishment is nuclear
diplomacy with North Korea for a meeting
that has not yet happened a group of
members of Congress try to nominate
Trump from a Nobel Prize attending to
the Trump rally started chanting Nobel
while he was speaking for a meeting that
had not yet happened and had not
delivered a single change of consequence
the North Korean policy and and then and
then we already fast forwarded to do it
to a debate on the internet about
why won't liberals give him credit for a
North Korean diplomatic breakthrough we
already we already got to that debate
there hasn't been a meeting yet
people yeah it's just it's crazy like
this David Brooks column is the perfect
example of they never Trump since the
quote-unquote conservative Republican
who needs to find a way to make himself
fit in into a trumpets Republican Party
so this seems like the way to do it so
you rush off just because it's 800 words
in the air times at that age does not
mean it's not in just as vacuous as a
Twitter hot take from someone from some
anonymous Twitter user are in or with a
red hat avatar like that it just it like
let's take a deep breath slow down let's
see what happens before we try we're so
desperate to give Trump credit for
something because he's so bad at
everything else and we don't even wait
to see if he deserves credit for that
thing because almost always if you rush
to praise Trump for something you were
gonna end up looking stupid moments
later because it always ends that way
and this is even really about something
also just like is everyone swept through
complicated diplomacy for the last
several decades this was obviously good
so maybe just like keep the novela on
iceberg Eve minutes and see how this
plays out well it's I mean yeah it's a
couple things it's as you said a
consequence of the Washington media
having a fetish with balance every day
it's like we must we must try to you
know credit Trump with something because
we've been so tough on him for
everything else like in you know not to
mention the fact that you've been tough
on him because he's like a lying crazy
insane president so that's number one
it's this this you know we must find
something to praise Trump about every
day we're looking for it
and then number two it's a broader
problem which is you know in this news
environment
two main issues are we all have
collective amnesia we can never remember
what happened yesterday
and so like things just wash away and
new cycles in a matter of minutes and
the other problem we have is patients
like
everything has to be solved immediately
and so this summit is announced it seems
like we could have some kind of
potential breakthrough and everyone
rushes right to judgment about what
happened like here's the thing after
that statement we don't know the summit
could still happen and Trump could still
be successful I'm not saying now that
this statement means that it's all over
because I want to wait and see what the
 happens all we know so far is that
North Korea has not offered Trump
anything different than previous North
Korean regimes have offered previous US
presidents the only thing new so far as
the Trump has accepted the meeting with
the leader of North Korea so if that
meeting does happen let's see what
happens let's see you know Trump has
been promising denuclearization which
we've thought from the beginning is not
something that kim jeong-hoon is gonna
want to do because why is he why would
he give up his nuclear weapons why would
he give up all his nuclear weapons so
will there be some kind of progress or
breakthrough that's somewhere in between
him giving up all of his nuclear weapons
and him doing nothing the status quo
possibly but maybe we should all wait
and see before we start writing our
 tanks yeah here's a good first
take this is a good first step like
that's the way to approach the
scheduling of the meeting that's what it
is be patient they know it's not a noble
worthy achievement it doesn't tell you
really anything about Trump's foreign
policy acumen or his ability as
president whether you're right it's
about balance it is because like
function gate should have gotten credit
and we gave it to them here which is
should be notable because we don't do it
very often for getting a meeting on the
books and if the meeting goes well and
we make progress even if it is short of
the ultimate goal if we improve the
situation and so much inform whether
it's inspectors or some changes - like
missile technology or whatever it is we
should give them credit for it let's
just wait till something actually
happens the other thing that is that it
was really revealing about this incident
is that for as much as Trump and his
minions claim to hate elites and
the mainstream media in elite
institution what they truly create at
the end of the day is elite approval and
because that's like there is no more
globalist elitist approval than
getting European leaders to vote for you
to get the Nobel Prize is the ultimate
right when they want it so bad like that
ultimately so much of what drives like
this movement is an insecurity about not
getting away from what's why Trump cares
so much about what Maggie haver in the
New York Times it's why he wants the
Nobel Prize it will prove he will be
accepted in a club that he feels he is
not accepted in yes despite being crazy
nice babe that is exactly right it's
also why all these conservatives online
are all angry that liberals are too mean
to them and because of that you know
they're fueling Trump and everything it
is they are all desperate as much as
they'd like to on the elite media
and elites they are desperate for this
approval it's it you're right is the
basis for this whole movement there's
one other interesting dynamic at play
here in North Korea which is it seems
like what set the North Koreans off what
the statement was our new National
Security Advisor John Bolton who
proposed a quote Libya model for North
Korea a problem with that model is years
after Libya's Muammar Gaddafi gave up
his nuclear weapons he was captured and
killed so it seems like see like we from
the beginning we've known this that when
when Bolton arrived on the scene he
doesn't really he's not a big fan of
diplomacy do you think he's playing do
you think he's a the other thing I
should say is it was pretty great in the
statement that the North Koreans
released they said of Bolton we do not
hide a feeling of repugnance towards him
Sam is is Bolton trying to sabotage the
talks do you think I don't know I mean
who knows I like Bolton is
he is been a well credentialed foreign
policy troll bridge entire career he's
not someone who builds things he just
writes about destroying them in the
pages of the Wall Street Journal and so
I don't think he has any concept of
anything other than how to be
inflammatory in rhetoric and so now he's
in a position where he actually has to
do something and I mean ultimately this
is what happens when a president has no
coherent policy view on any issue other
than immigration if there's no Trump
vision or Trump doctrine that he's
trying to implement it's just sort of
what some guy who knows very little
about foreign policies think based on
what he saw on Fox & Friends the morning
is very hard to work for someone like
that so I think he probably has no idea
what he's supposed to do and no one in
the administration does because Trump
doesn't so it all sort of knows from
incoherent get to talk all Trump knows
is that he wants a deal and now the
world knows the Trump wants to deal and
Kim jong-un knows the Trump wants a deal
desperately and that's going to play to
the advantage of the North Koreans at
the negotiating table so our to the deal
man we shall see we shall see I want to
talk about the president's comments on
immigrants Wednesday during a White
House Roundtable about California's
refusal to force local police officers
to become deportation agents Trump
referred to some immigrants who'd been
deported as animals here's the full
context of what was said a sheriff from
Fresno was complaining about ice and she
said quote there could be an ms-13
member I know about if they don't reach
a certain threshold
I cannot tell ice about it Trump
responds we have people coming into the
country or trying to come in and we're
stopping a lot of them but we're taking
people out of the country you wouldn't
believe how bad these people are these
aren't people these are animals Dan
Trump people conservatives Republicans
are all saying the Trump was referring
specifically to ms-13 members that he's
called them that before which is true he
has called them animals before what do
you think about this whole thing
the problem is Trump has forfeited the
benefit of the doubt on almost every
issue but particularly the issue of
immigration like we have been the
trumpets have been trying to argue for
more than two years now about whether
you're trying to explain that when Trump
said rapists then he was not referring
to immigrants in Mexico fortunately but
she obviously was like right like this
state like here we give regardless which
I know is not a word I think by whatever
it is right now think about it is now
stop me but the weather in this instance
he would he was referring to sit with
ms-13 I think it's fairly irrelevant
because the idea of trying to dare white
Americans by demonizing immigrant of all
stripes refusing to distinguish between
the tiny percentage who are ms-13
members or criminals in the overwhelming
majority who come here looking for a
better life or who have been here for
years and are part of the community
Trump is nevertron a distinction between
the dreamers and members of ms-13 and we
know this because during the very brief
shutdown the exactly he did was compared
Democrats efforts to help the dreamers
with Democrats letting members ms-13
into this country and so I don't really
care about the specific instance what is
undeniably truth is that this is Trump's
message to American it is consistent
with how he describes immigrants it has
for his entire time on the national
stage here yeah this is the and it's not
just Trump it's the entire Republican
campaign message it's the central
message for 2018 and we know that
because it's been the message in just
about every race in 2017 it's where
they're putting all their money behind
their ads is to talk about ms-13 they're
running on ms-13 that's their issue
they're trying to say that all
undocumented immigrants are like ms-13
the conflation has been happening from
the beginning and also like a whatever
whatever Trump said or meant which i
think is ambiguous at best
at best just look at the policy it comes
that this whole Club the set of comments
come a few days after the White House
announced a new policy that attempts to
dissuade immigrants from crossing the
border by separating parents from their
children once they arrive and when the
White House chief of staff was asked
whether this policy was cruel and
heartless his response was quote the
children will be taken care of put into
foster care or whatever
darrel and who knows this issue better
than anyone at Vox points out that since
Trump took office ice has arrested forty
five thousand four hundred and thirty
six immigrants without criminal records
that's double that's up that that's up
forty percent I'm sorry
up to forty percent of the people I see
now des portes don't have criminal
records and that is double what was
happening during the Obama era so just
look at the actual policy never mind
what I'm saying he is he's trying to
scare people about immigrants he's
trying to say that the people in this
country are criminals when that's not
what the statistics say and they want to
focus on him as thirteen yeah of course
we want ms-13 gang members
arrested and deported out of the country
of course we want that but that's not
what they want they're all now they're
all saying like Oh Democrats are rushing
a rushing to the defense of ms-13 that's
what Democrats are doing right now by
pointing out the Trump just started
talking about people who are animals at
a press conference disease talking about
immigrants and deportations it's
ridiculous do you think this is a troll
s question but do you think we are once
again walking into a trap here as
Democrats yeah well I was gonna ask
about this because it's not that we're
walking into a trap necessarily it's
it's that we're going to have to deal
with this over and over again from now
until November Trump said a couple weeks
ago this sort of went under the radar
that he wants to shut the government
down in September over his border wall
if he doesn't get funding for the border
wall he is looking and Republicans are
looking for every opportunity they can
find to bring up immigration and to
conflate it with violence and gangs and
ms-13 and all the rest and so I don't
think the Democrats can just avoid that
because
they're good that's their game plan
that's their campaign and they're gonna
try to keep it in the news whether it's
something like this or whether it's
Trump threatening shut down the
government or whatever it is they're
gonna try to do this from now until
November so the question for us is not
should we respond or not it's how we're
gonna respond because I don't think we
can ignore it yeah I think that's right
I think it is weak we must call like if
the president urged States is advocating
racist views from a table in the White
House then we have to say something and
it's not an option to not this and the
question is where you go after that to
make sure that people have a reason to
vote for Democrats beyond just the fact
and then there's an important factor
beyond just the fact that we are ready
willing able to call out racism misogyny
xenophobia white nationalism and all of
the other dangerous ideologies that are
emanating from the president states what
has been next yeah well look I also
think we okay I think we've got to let
people know what exactly is happening
besides just waving it off as racist you
know because we can say that but like
let's let's actually talk about what's
going on here I mean the story from
Slate this morning that broke around the
same time as as everyone's been talking
about these comments ice recently
arrested a dreamer revoked his daca
status placed him in detention and
attempted to deport him claiming he was
a gang member and a federal judge just
ruled that ice was lying that they lied
about it that they actually tried to get
a false confession out of this young
person who was been in this country
since he was a child he lived in Seattle
I showed up at his house to arrest his
father who wasn't here it was here as an
undocumented immigrant and then said to
him we're gonna arrest you too and the
kid says well no here's my dock a work
permit I'm supposed to be here legally
it's fine and they said that doesn't
matter
and they ripped up the work permit and
they threw him in jail and they tried to
get a false confession out of him and a
federal judge had to rule there was
lying and they tried to deport this man
so like we don't actually have to be
going back and forth is whether what
Trump said or meant was racist or not
so were YouTube stars right now on
YouTube but nowhere else eat your heart
out akela
hey and your last livestream you made a
pie
yes I made up high and learn how to roll
out dough and fill it it was great was

do something a little different today
are we yeah
I'm everyone still asked you the
questions I'm just gonna ask you the
questions that they have already asked
but there's a lot of news we didn't read
today so we're gonna ask you questions
about your questions so Priyanka is here
to moderate our livestream she's also
the writer along with Bryan of what a
day the creek newsletter which is I have
to say best newsletter best newsletter
in the business by far you know no
you're welcome question tweet the stream
I already did cool we're already in it I
will let's go all right so we're kicking
off with a pretty hard-hitting question
um how does the rest of crooked media
survive Jon love it when something like
Yanni versus Laurel happens so there's
these things called noise cancelling
headphones that are pretty big fans of
feels like that the question wasn't for
me but at me so me why don't you yeah I
mean so I was out of the office I had a
meeting in Venice yesterday which pretty
heroic to go from West Hollywood to
Venice during the middle of the day for
him moving under the 405 but enough
about me Franco you was it with Bill
Gates you experienced this whole day I
just I got it via what a day and I heard
Laurel but Hanna heard yeni
remember and it was I feel like I have a
weird perspective on it because I did
hear both I started hearing Yanni then I
heard Laurel I kind of I'm only Laurel
right now but I hesitate to say that
like I feel like that's kind of
unpopular opinion
I heard Laurel I heard yeah anyone love
it heard it one time one time I got our
Instagram story somewhere yeah yeah
somewhere I think it just had came to
the speaker's in just the right way and
I heard Yanni you
it's yawning yawning its yanny and I
hear to you Annie and then also some
people were playing around with the
frequencies of it mm-hmm and then I
heard Yanni and then I heard Yanni for a
second in the regular one okay and it
was gone it was fleeting fleeting yeah
yeah it was it really it started off
small then I think loved it got ahold of
it in office and it sort of became
pandemonium balloon there was in every
part of the office there was like your
side and then you went over to the
intern side
it was just like running around with
this like sweet faraway well it was like
a wing someone very quickly suggested it
was a frequency issue and so then I
thought well if I if I run away from it
I can lower the frequency by kind of
Doppler affecting the whole thing but I
don't think I could run fast enough so
it still sounded like Laurel I think we
yeah we ran this one down yeah now about
net neutrality Senate just passed
resolution to reinstate title to net
neutrality rules what does this fight
look like in the house doesn't look good
yeah it doesn't look good it's great
that it got out of the Senate but I
think it's hard to imagine a path of it
getting out of the house yeah that's
kind of what I've been seeing yeah
you've been doing a lot of reading on
this today are you feeling us yeah
actually pessimistic as we are about the
house yes senator seemed to be really
excited and happy that you know this
happened today with them and they had
some bipartisan support some support
from Republicans too who wanted to
debate it and you know wanted to repeal
the rule or the change to the rules but
yeah it all the outlook that I've been
reading does not look so great for the
house yeah you know just you need
Boehner not just some I mean look
there's probably enough votes in the
house as this is sure on a number of
issues it's probably enough votes in the
house to save net neutrality but not
enough Republican votes to convince the
Republican leadership to bring it up
bring it up right okay well also we have
a lot of big stories today a lot of big
story today preview of a newsletter
that's why we got the large diet cokes
you know thanks to garage now so what in
the dust sorry sorry
can't get diet cokes sure I'm an intern
but I'm too busy - busy - busy honestly
you know what I was an intern once and
someone said to me get diet cokes you
know I did I said sure
I'm sure I'm not sorry I got a lot on my
plate right now unbelievable he did he
really did have to do so there are
some documents released today yeah what
in the documents what is in the document
about the Trump Tower meeting and how is
John jr. not indicted yet so there were
2500 pages of documents and I would be
lying if I pretended I have read close
to all of them but a headline out of
this early is that essentially Trump jr.
Donald Trump Jr's lawyers from the Trump
family found foundation the Trump family
organization jumped in and got involved
really early he was trying to coordinate
everyone's story which you know is not
the like most innocent vibe thing you
know it's a you know it's a great thing
about the truth it coordinates its the
other document I loved was the mooch
reaching out to Rob Goldstone or I
believe who coordinated the whole
meeting and Trump Tower with the Russian
layer you know just in case they wanted
to get together my friends yeah I think
he's the word envision and correctly
there's a lot of stupidity hmm great
they're all criminals
next question all right okay so the
connections between the Trump
Organization and ZTE Terry Haynes wants
to know if and how that violates the
emoluments clause
how can they be getting away with
something that directly benefits at real
Donald Trump yeah so basically this
story is Donald Trump we have oh and
Hyundai what's happening here
so basically the u.s. is in this you
know Trump manufactured trade war
there's a company called ZTE they
manufacture phones they've been
violating Paul what is its trade policy
sanctions because I'm on the North Korea
sanctions right but also they are a
company that we don't trust to make the
phones without yeah I mean there there's
a there's a review process of the
government under goes were you worried
about like critical infrastructure and
technology so there's a Chinese company
called Huawei that's been cited as you
know the Chinese government has
connected the companies so they could
put a backdoor into that technology that
allow their spy networks to get into it
so anyway Donald Trump steps in and says
we have to do everything we can to save
these ZTE jobs because because these
sanctions are coming down too hard on
the on the Chinese middle class out of
nowhere out of nowhere I have nowhere so
Sunday right yeah and just so clearly
something had I don't know crossed into
his field of vision somehow who knows so
he sends this out and then lo and behold
we find out that Donald Trump has just
within the day or before after gotten
what a five hundred million dollar loan
loan so does this violate the ammonia
Malia's clause Trump is violating the
emoluments cause every single day he's
doing it people also forget by the way
the emolia's Clause says foreign foreign
money or also this states so basically
the emoluments clause is being violated
left and right i my Hatters it's
enchanted adders your mom's clothes are
very very sad it's very much abused
almost as abused as the interstate
commerce clause to causes that have just
gotten the kicked out some great
clauses though but anyway yeah so he is
it seems like there won't be very many
consequences again because Republicans
in Congress do not want there to be
consequences I find that like I've been
thinking about this a lot that basically
it's so hard to understand Donald
Trump's motivations because there can be
political motivations for what he's
doing there could be personal corruption
motivations he could be blackmailed by
the Russians he could also have some
kind of vendetta or personal
relationship we don't understand so
basically like I've been trying to sort
Donald Trump's motivations into four
buckets which are he
Mystikal political ideological or
financial basically the corrupt ones and
basically we don't know so it's just
sort of look at those four and say
alright seems like there's some kind of
politics going on because there is
ongoing negotiations with China over our
kind of trade policy with China it seems
like he also has a personal financial
stake in this beyond that we really
don't know this is one of those want
weird bank-shot ones where it's it's a
project that the Trump Organization is
working on in Indonesia that got a five
hundred million dollar loan from an
entity backed by the Chinese government
so it helps explain why he would send
this weird ZTE tweet helps explain why
he would coddle the president of
Indonesia who is a horrific human rights
abuser and all-around awful
authoritarian guy so you know I think
your buckets are really good and a lot
of them you know I think this is one of
those moments where I imagine that the
corruption is deeper and more brazen
than we ever thought possible like
literal Michael cone you had a kickback
50% of that you know 1.2 million dollar
fee you got to fake Lobby me from
Novartis or whatever like everything
feels possible allegedly yes all right
on to the next one this one is from
Amanda she says I feel like we get ten
new breaking stories a day about crimes
connected to the Trump administration
Amanda that's correct
what percentage of those are at like
6:00 p.m. on Friday afternoon when
you're trying to catch a flight or like
maybe leave the office for eight a lot
of like an outsize number of them are
but she wants you to give it to us
straight do you think anything is gonna
come of any of this aside from me going
crazy trying to document and do you
think we as a country have become numb
to these revelations and that he'll get
away with it all that's a great question
things are already coming up these
things I think like you know don't be
disheartened like there is an ultimate
obviously there is an ultimate
consequence we want which is for Donald
Trump to no longer be president we don't
know what will lead to Donald Trump no
longer being president there are many
many positive concept positive steps
negative consequences for Donald Trump
and his goons that can happen before
that they're already happening we have
what I think it I don't even know it's
more than
dozen indictments at this point I don't
can keep track of all the indictments
you mostly ninety-nines we got the
Russians you have multiple people
pleading guilty or facing charges
you have ongoing Senate investigations
that seem at least semi legitimate you
have ongoing criminal investigations
both in New York and because of robert
muller you have a special counsel that
has has gotten incredible amounts of
information a testimony of breaking news
every day that's causing the White House
to respond just just today we got a
financial document disclosure from
Donald Trump saying that he did in fact
pay stormy Daniels 130,000 dollars oops
I was lying for six months so things are
coming of this we know a lot more every
day we know more you know we saw those
that Washington Post story a New York
Times story that happened around the
same time one that dove into Michael
cones finances one that douve into
Donald Trump's finances we are getting
further and further into the story and
like each of these revelations in the
special counsel and each of these news
stories kind of turn over one more
puzzle piece and we start to get a
better picture of what we're looking at
so things are coming of it you know it's
not as faster as consequential as you
want it to be but what is what is in his
life you know but for real like maybe
move ups in these deadlines it's like 2
p.m. Pacific time to write about it the
next day I think it's nice that you get
it and it's like all the day's news most
of the time well that's true all the
day's news most of the time newsletters
dog-eat-dog
crooked comm slash newsletters I just go
to quickie com something will pop up you
mean I didn't be able to close it
honestly till you sign up we're working
on that too the website it's a work in
progress we're a small company we're a
start-up we're doing the best we can we
don't have venture money all right we
don't have a pair leave a bathroom leave
it alone yeah you know we got we have we
have we have just we get you most of the
news from our office that has a working
bathroom most of it look a pipe exploded
it ruined the kitchen and then one
downstairs yeah so now they're drilling
down there a drill could start at any
moment because they are replacing all
the downstairs because of the flooding
that happened from upstairs the bottom
line is it's subscribed to what a day
someone needs to pave the bong store
that has been closed because of our pipe
well no one think of the head shop
Branka weights really fun having you
here so much great thanks
what did that alright mark wants to know
if you guys have anything to say about
Mark Warner and Geena Haspel I'm a
little bummed I'm a little bummed in
Mark Warner I'm a little bummed at
Democrats on the committee I'm sure Gina
Haspel will be good at being CIA
director knows how to lead the
organization has great experience
there's so many people you could choose
to do that job you don't need to pick
someone who literally oversaw a black
site
torture is wrong it's immoral it's
illegal as a stain on our history we
shouldn't be pulling back that legacy
and and having those individuals lead
our the CIA up I don't think
there's like if I were senator I don't
think there's anything Gina Haspel could
have said in those hearings that could
have changed my mind
I would have listened but I don't think
there's anything that could have gotten
me to vote yes however I do know
something that certainly would have
gotten people to vote no which is she
was asked the question was the program
work Kamala Harris
I think asked such a smart line of
questioning and just as also just
senators and members of Congress need to
learn to ask tough questions instead of
bloviating and issuing dumb melodramatic
speeches and what no one gives a
about your speeches I cannot
stand it when you have an important
writer and you're given seven minutes to
ask questions and you spend three of
them giving a speech that's fine ask a
question get some news think about it
there's lawyers everywhere sit around
with a group of lawyers come up with an
interesting line of question and make
some news not with the words you wrote
before the hearing but by getting
something out of the person sitting in
front of you so comma hearts did a great
job of doing that and I think you know
it was a one-two punch right it's step
one would you approve of doing things
that are immoral the answer is no and
step two was the torture program immoral
she refused to say so yeah she did
really let up on the questioning which I
thought was great really great stick to
it and make her answer right so I don't
know I actually don't understand why
Gina Haspel wouldn't answer that
question correctly she obviously knows
it was immoral or maybe she doesn't
which is worse I don't know what's worse
I know profusing to say it or actually
believing it but either way I thought it
was disqualifying and you know who
agrees with me John
 McCain and I don't understand
why more Democrats couldn't muster the
same moral fortitude of John McCain
because if that's not someone who can
give you the cover you need to make a
tough vote I don't know what is and you
people that have voted for him will get
nothing for it you should be next one
this is for Tommy about the alleged fall
with North Korea what are the smartest
next steps for the Trump administration
smartest dig a hole put up canned goods
and water in it and then have a little
tap code so if someone you know come
duct-tape trash bags like the hefty ones
no I mean like you know with the giant
caveat that no one knows unless you're
Kim jong-un the smart people I've talked
to you today think that it doesn't
necessarily seem like they're blowing up
the negotiations pun intended it seems
like they know that Trump really really
wants a deal he staked all his
credibility he's literally talking about
himself getting the Nobel Peace
Prize right so he is more invested in
this than they do and he also has his
team out there giving discord in
interviews on Sunday shows on the same
day about what they're asking for so
there probably is softening him up and
they're probably putting these military
exercises into the conversation for
things that are on the table at the
negotiations if and when they happen the
the smart folks I talked to think the
negotiations will happen it's just gonna
take maybe a little concession here or
Michael avenatti welcome to the show I
have to say when we started this podcast
I did not expect to be talking to the
lawyer to one of the presidents alleged
mistresses about hush money payments and
international bribery rackets but you
know 2018 here we are so when you
tweeted out information about all the
companies in foreign oligarchs who paid
Michael Cohen for access to Donald Trump
last week you promised that there'd be
more information to come so my questions
are what additional information do you
have what does it tell us about Cohen
and potentially about Trump and why do
you think it's important for all of us
to know this information well I'm not at
liberty at least today to describe all
of the evidence and all of the
information that we have and that we're
continuing to gather you know one of the
positive aspects of the media effort
that we've undertaken over the last
eight weeks John is that we are now seen
by many as the repository of information
and we are seen as a trusted source that
people can come to if they have
information that they believe should
come to light or should be run to ground
investigated etc and so I think that's
been a very positive thing for us
because with each passing day whether
it's Monday through Friday or Saturday
or Sunday we're acquiring more
information for use not only in our case
but also information that I think is
important for people to learn about and
be disclosed you know as it relates to
why I think the information we disclosed
last week is important as it relates to
Michael Cohen I mean there's a whole
host of reasons for that I mean first of
all he was never arrested lobbyists he
was never registered for an agent
there's no question at this point that
he was selling access to the President
to the highest office of the land we
don't know yet whether some of those
payments made their way to Donald Trump
or one of his organizations excuse me
the entire thing does not sound it
doesn't pass the smell test let's just
put it that way you hinted at Cohen's
payment to your client might have come
from a company linked to a rush
oligarch when you put something like
that out there are you doing it because
you have certain information that might
prove that that you just haven't
released yet or are you introducing sort
of a new public narrative about the case
what's what's the purpose behind that
well I want to be really clear we didn't
say that the money came from a company
that may have ties to a Russian oligarch
we said that the money came from a
company Columbus Nova that does have
ties to a Russian oligarch I mean
there's no question about that I think
that Columbus Nova has provided a number
of different narratives or responses and
was in response to what we released none
of which check out I think Mother Jones
did a pretty thorough job I think on
Friday of debunking a lot of the denials
where they're trying to now separate
Columbus Nova from the from the overseas
entity and from the Russian oligarch and
I don't think anything any of it really
passes any degree of scrutiny I mean
there's no question that there's
significant ties between that entity and
the Russian oligarch at this point so
since you released the memo you've been
calling on the Treasury Department to
release any suspicious activity reports
around Michael Cohen's financial
dealings do you know for a fact that
those suspicious activity reports exist
yes I do I know for a fact that there
are suspicious activity reports The Wall
Street Journal reported on at least one
of them I believe back in February or
March we know for a fact that there's
multiple others we don't know why the
Treasury Department will not release
them I understand that generally they're
confidential but the reason why they're
generally confidential is because they
don't want to tip off the target as to
their existence well in this case we
know that the targets Michael Cohen and
we know of their existence because of
among other reasons the Wall Street
Journal reported on it back in February
or March so that's not a valid reason
not to release them and this is a matter
of significant public concern tens of
millions of people have a desire to see
this information and look if the
information that we disclosed is
inaccurate or if Michael Cohen or the
president have information that suggests
that what we've said is inaccurate then
they should be wholly supportive of this
I
of mr. Trump's Treasury Department
releasing the stars they should also be
wholly supportive of the idea of
releasing his bank records and we're not
talking about a lot of bank records
we're talking about 14 or 15 months of
bank records on a single bank account
for essential consultants LLC well
there's a reason why they haven't
released that information and it's
because not only is it going to confirm
what we've already stated but it's going
to get far far worse for mr. Cohen and
likely mr. Trump and that's why this
information hasn't been released John
are you concerned that the Treasury's
Inspector General has launched an
investigation into how you have come to
receive this information do you feel
confident about how you got the
information in the first place well let
me say a couple things about that first
of all I have no problem with the
investigation we did not do anything
wrong we did not do anything illegal so
I'm not at all concerned about that but
what I am a little concerned about is
the way the investigation has been
reported you know a couple things first
of all the investigation there's no
confirmation that I'm under any
investigation for anything by the
Treasury Department or anyone else so
any suggestion to that is completely
false second of all there's no
suggestion that there's an investigation
into the leak of a SAR per se that has
not occurred what has what has been
confirmed I think by by Treasury is that
they have launched some sort of
investigation into something relating to
some of this information and that's
about it so I just think it's important
that that be reported accurately and
some of the other news organizations
haven't done that okay so let's talk
about over the weekend on Sunday you
tweeted a picture of Michael Cohen
Michael Flynn and former Qatari diplomat
Ahmad Al Rahma he meeting at Trump Tower
on December 12 2016 you then asked why
was Al ramaya meeting with Michael Cohen
and Michael slim and Michael Flynn and
why did he later brag about bribing
administration officials according to a
sworn declaration filed in court do you
know if there have been Qatari payments
to Cohen Flynn or other Trump associates
well unfortunately John I'm not at
liberty to answer that question but I
stand behind what we what I tweeted out
and I believe the Declaration that was
filed in court is accurate and I think
all of this raises some very very
serious questions relating to Michael
Cohen and exactly what he was doing in
his role I mean we got to remember that
Michael Cohen to the best of my
knowledge did not have a formal position
in connection with the transition never
had a formal position in connection with
the administration never had a security
clearance never registered as a lobbyist
never registered as a foreign agent so
what is he doing meeting these two
Qatari gentlemen in the lobby of Trump
Tower and clearly taking them upstairs
in the elevator and then they depart
about an hour and a half later Michael
Flynn is there that same day this seems
very suspicious I mean then I caught up
in Trump Tower to to purchase Christmas
gifts or to have lunch or dinner that's
clear how much do you think knowing what
you do that a lot of this wrongdoing is
centered around Cohen and how much how
much do you think Trump knows or knew
about what Cohen was doing I think any
suggestion right now or in the
foreseeable future that mr. Trump had no
idea what mr. Cohen was doing and mr.
Cohen was just off on his own doing his
own thing without any supervision or
knowledge by mr. Trump I think it's it's
complete nonsense John I mean this is a
this is a president who has stated
unequivocally in the past that you know
he likes to know what's going on at all
times he especially has a problem with
people making money on him without his
pre approval or knowledge and we've
heard that in many many circumstances
there's nothing to suggest that him and
mr. Cohen were not in regular
communication in fact just the opposite
is true there's a lot of evidence to
suggest that they did have regular
communication I mean the president did
not hesitate in early April and Air
Force One to refer the media and the
American people to his attorney Michael
Cohen for answers to questions relating
to the reimbursement payments which we
know those statements on Air Force One
now were flat-out lies
I think any suggestion that Michael Kohn
was off on his own doing his own thing
and the president never knew he's
complete nonsense and John you know I'll
tell you I think and I've been I've been
really firm in this prediction and I
stand by it today more than ever there's
no question in Michael Cohen's gonna be
indicted there's no question he's gonna
flip on the president and when he does
he's going to lay out I am confident in
great detail about what mr. Trump knew
when he knew it and what he did about so
you've seen all the same smoke that we
have coming out of the Moller
investigation you've probably seen a lot
more with the information that you have
where do you think the fire is and what
would you be looking into if you were
Robert Muller right now well I don't
want to presuppose that or put myself in
robert muller shoes because i got to
tell you those those are big shoes to
fill and i have a lot of respect for for
robert muller and his talents and the
talents of his team I mean these are
some very skilled prosecutors very
talented attorneys and I'm sure they're
doing an incredible job but I you know
let me tell you this I I think that
Russian collusion I think that that's a
very difficult thing to prove for a
variety of reasons including that a
number of the witnesses the vast
majority the witnesses are not on US
soil and are not subject to subpoena
power which is a real problem when
you're an attorney trying to prove a
case like that it doesn't mean it can't
be done but I just think that's a very
difficult case to prove there's it's a
very complicated situation in my view I
think that it's much more likely that
ultimately what's going to be proven are
are other crimes like bank fraud money
laundering wire fraud whether it relates
to the hundred and thirty thousand
dollar payment to my client or other
business dealings of Michael Cohen I I
think at the end of the day that's going
to be or those charges are going to be
much easier to prove and also much
easier to implicate the president and
that's my belief
there's a little story this morning you
threatened to take legal action against
the Daily Caller for potential
defamation according to tweets from one
of their reporters I always used that
word loosely with Daily Caller
that included screenshots of an email
extreme
you had with him do you think there's
story about you qualifies as defamation
what was going on with that story yeah
let me let me say a couple things so you
know not all attorneys are ethical
because there are attorneys and not all
reporters are journalists are ethical
and comply with journalistic standards
because they call themselves journalists
or reporters and you know your statement
I agree 100% with I mean look I don't
have a lot of respect for the Daily
Caller I don't think these are
journalists or reporters I think they're
hacks I think they come to stories with
a dedicated purpose and I think in this
instance everything they've written
they've come to they've come to write
for the purpose of taking shots at me
and my client and degrading us and
demeaning us and basically engaging in a
character assassination so you know look
I don't think there's anything wrong
with calling out a journalist or a
reporter when one believes that they
have engaged in improper reporting
disregarded standard journalistic
standards if you will and engaged in
basically unethical conduct I don't
think there's anything wrong with that
so and just like I would not if an
attorney was engaged in unethical
behavior or conduct I want it naturally
jump to their defense just because
they're a member of the bar without
knowing the facts and therefore I think
it's somewhat improper for other
journalists to immediately jump to
engage in this knee-jerk reaction and
jump to the defense of the Daily Caller
without looking at the story without
knowing all the facts so you've
obviously been on television a lot over
the last few weeks you've been arguing a
lot of your clients case in public what
is the rationale behind such a media
heavy strategy in this case well this is
not your average case I mean by any
stretch of the imagination and no and
and you know in cases you you handle
each case a little differently but
depending on where it's been you
depending on what the issues are
depending on the the public interest etc
and look I stand behind our strategy I
think our strategy has worked nearly
perfectly we have
we have forced them into making a series
of errors which have only strengthened
our case over the last eight weeks
because we've been so out front again
we're acquiring additional information
that assists our case that also assists
the American people and learning about
what really happened here you know I
understand they don't like our PR
strategy they'd like nothing more than
for us to just you know pack up and go
home for a while but we're not gonna do
that I mean what we're doing is working
and it's working really well now that
doesn't mean to suggest that it's always
going to work that well things can
change I mean this is a very dynamic
situation but right now I'm very pleased
on on the strategy we adopted and we're
gonna continue to use it until it breaks
you were telling people last week you
know the they were sending you info and
telling people again if they want to
help the cause they should send an info
what is your cause at this point is it
bigger than stormy Daniels case
individually is there something else
that you're after here it seems like you
know as you're talking more and more
about sort of all the entanglements
between Cohen and Trump it you know it's
it's beyond you know the NDA between
stormy Daniels and and Donald Trump here
are three primary goals John remain
invalidating the NDA seeking damages for
the defamatory statements of Michael
Cohen seeking damages for the defamatory
statements of Donald Trump and also
letting it be known that those that my
client statements were in fact true even
though Michael Cohen and mr. Trump
effectively called her a liar on
repeated occasions and then as an
ancillary I guess as an ancillary goal
ensuring that that the truth and the
facts are known to the American people
and laying out the evidence form that
may come into our possession and to the
extent that those that that evidence and
those facts lead to other repercussions
you know so be it let the chips fall
where they may people that are far more
powerful and far smarter than me and my
client will ultimately make those
decisions Michael avenatti thank you so
much if if you have more evidence and
information to share you're always free
to do so here
on pod save America we'll have you back
anytime thank you John appreciate it
very much
you
welcome to pod save America I'm John
Favreau
I'm John Lovett I'm Tommy Vitor today on
the pod we're gonna be talking about
Israel we're gonna be talking about
North Korea we're gonna be talking about
the White House and they're leaking
mocking people who are dying problem
there so I got to tell you there's a
problem you know there's not a problem
that's right and we're gonna get into
just which is which can't wait to find
out and later in the pod my interview
with the notoriously camera-shy Michael
avenatti how did you how did we get him
to do press a lawyer who's representing
actress stormy Daniels as if he needs an
introduction other Pods it says other
Pods love it or leave it
we had I heard there was a supercut
episode that's what it says here awesome
super cut episode of our live shows in
Baltimore and Columbus where we talked
about social media and Twitter with a
bunch of great panelists including
social media experts and researchers to
talk about the way social media is
changing our politics that show is
really really good and you can check it
out now people are loving it and then
also we're gonna we're doing it people
are loving it if they're wrong that's I
was doing just being up that's what we
do now we hype ourselves lie cheat and
hyper self and we have a live show in
Philly on Sunday and there are still a
few seats left
not many Tommy it's a Sunday we're doing
one Friday that will be out Saturday and
were doing another show Sunday love
relieve it never sleeps knows okay let's
talk about the news the United States
officially moved its Embassy in Israel
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem today I'm
gonna try that again Monday the United
States officially moved its embassy in
Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on
Monday reversing decades of American
foreign policy in a move that many
Middle East observers have called
inflammatory as it would take a crucial
piece of leverage off the table for
peace negotiations Tommy
how big of a deal is this move and why
do many people view it as divisive Tommy
give us the Netanyahu what where when
and why of this he has been planning
that line first second that was amazing
so they're two Cigna
to get events colliding this week sorry
Tommy are you with us done some
actual gargling mmm so there's two
significant events colliding this week
as you said John the on Monday the Trump
administration officially opened the new
u.s. embassy which had been relocated
sort of from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and
they slapped a plaque up on another old
building and they called it the new
embassy it is fraught to say the least
Jerusalem has enormous religious
historic significance both sides claim
it as their capital the Israelis and the
Palestinians so Jared and Ivanka flew
out manukan came they had a a ceremony
that kind of felt like a trump rally it
was also the 70th anniversary of
President Truman recognizing Israel's
independence so big day there but
meanwhile there is this horrific
violence in Gaza as part of ongoing
protests there reports of more than 50
dead in two thousand wounded it's hard
to verify these reports because they're
coming out of the Hamas government in
Gaza but that is obviously staggering
numbers they were organized and hijacked
by Hamas these protests which controlled
Gaza the air they are ostensibly about
the Palestinians demanding the right to
return to parts of Israel they're driven
out from or protesting the blockade of
Gaza but you know people were worried
that this is gonna get worse
so there's a lot happening here but part
of the reason that embassy being moved
is so fraught is because the status of
Jerusalem who controls it who has their
capital where is supposed to be decided
in negotiations between the two parties
of the Middle East peace process and and
many Palestinians feel like we're
essentially handing over a part of
Jerusalem that will likely end up being
that the Israel's capital no matter what
happens but they're feeling like okay
this is a big important piece of this
negotiation that we are recognizing by
moving the embassy there today what was
because what was the Obama
administration position on moving the
embassy every administration says
they're gonna move the embassy from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem as part of a campaign
promise and then everybody holds on
actually doing it because the
intelligence community the Arab
neighbors a whole bunch of parties were
concerned that it would lead to up
in protest violence bloodshed so we did
exactly that Obama said he would move
the embassy but ultimately never did
because there was concerns about
security and that in essentially more
importantly that it was a final status
issue that needed to be negotiated can
we talk about the violence in Gaza can
it does seem like you know you said that
Hamas obviously hijacked some of these
protests but it also seems like from
reports that Israelis were firing on
some unarmed protesters who were trying
to climb this fence yeah what
justification do Israelis give for
shooting and killing protesters in Gaza
who are unarmed yeah it's bad
you know the Tuesday of this week is is
a date for Palestinians they call the
Nakba which is reverse of the
catastrophe which marks the day in 1948
when all these Palestinians were driven
out of their homes and so these pallette
these protests have been going on for
for several weeks leading up to tomorrow
to recognize this day Hamas did hijack
it and they took it over and you know
what that the Israelis say is when you
have individuals storming the fence
trying to break into Israel that they
will use force in sort of escalating
fashion so there is tear gas there's
rubber bullets which don't really work
from long distances and then they have
been using live ammunition and
apparently their rules of engagement are
that you'd only use lethal force like
shoot for the head
when you see quote terrorist activity
whatever exactly that means and that if
it's shy of that they're shooting for
below the knees but you know it seems
like some people were shot in the
stomach getting shot in the stomach
getting shot in the adze been getting
shot in the thigh or knee and then going
to a hospital in Gaza you know your odds
aren't very good so this is you know
pretty horrific well it's also the
context to they're protesting some of
the protests were about the embassy move
some of the protests were also have been
going on for quite some time about
Israel's economic blockade of Gaza so
people in Gaza are essentially trapped
in this area right and there's an
economic blockade and so they're trying
to protest and now they're being shot at
yeah I mean the situation in Gaza is is
awful it's one of the most densely
populated places on earth there's no
work there's no jobs or sporadic
electricity the waters dirty
there's just no opportunity for these
people now Israel withdrew their forces
in 2005 but you know the UN still
classifies it as occupied because the
Israelis control you know the sea border
the land border the Egyptians control
their border it's rarely opened so they
restrict the movement of goods and
individuals so it's a it's a dire
situation in Gaza and it sort of been
forgotten by the international community
so Jared Kushner acknowledged the
violence in his remarks except he said
that the protesters being shot at are
quote part of the problem not the
solution these comments were not
included in the excerpts of his remarks
that were delivered to the press ahead
of time and then they were omitted in
the White House transcript afterwards
that doesn't seem normal does it no yeah
he can't just edit the transcript with
the parts that you dum-dum son-in-law
said because he was I mean do you member
when Obama would ad-lib back in the day
or even if we put out like a briefing
transcript from Josh earnest or somebody
else and and we had to edit something
that was a typo or was incorrect or
transcribed wrongly we would update it
with like a star indicating that we
changed the official transcript now
there's putting out transcripts there
that are omitting yeah better doctored
yeah it's um it's another one of those
small ways they're undermining the kind
of bedrock systems that live between
administrations I think one of the
hardest tasks for the administration
that follows Trump will be rebuilding
the apparatus for for sophisticated
honest rendering of events because it's
all been so broken I mean everything
from every press release having a bunch
of typos and and and mistakes all the
way to sending out incorrect transcript
to something that is um both incompetent
and just sort of a symptom of the way
this White House operates
well I got something worse oh now
because this entire episode isn't
up enough the Trump's also invited
evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress to
lead a prayer at the open becae opening
here's some comments from the highlight
reel from Robert Jeffress he called
Islam and Mormonism heresies from the
pit of hell he suggested that the
Catholic Church was led astray by Satan
said that gays live in a dirty and
miserable lifestyle said that Jews are
going to hell they also invited Robert
Hagee Jews going to hell yeah at the
happy opening of the embassy in
Jerusalem Jews are going to hell yeah
also Robert Haga Blair pastor the pastor
who famously said that in 2005 when
Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans it
was because God was punishing New
Orleans for hosting a gay pride parade
those are the people that were
representing the United States of
America abroad today giving benedictions
and opening prayers at the opening of
the Jerusalem embassy cannot think of
anything more disgusting did Joel Osteen
say no what happened just like I'm sure
to imagine like you know obviously with
Obama we went through the whole reverend
wright thing the first time they heard
about reverend wright's crazy comments
was Obama's announcement speech in
Springfield he was supposed to give the
benediction and immediately they said oh
no absolutely not now we're bringing
these people these two people who are
saying that Islam Judaism Mormonism
cults people going to hell we're
bringing them overseas
to represent the United States of
America what the is that it's again
there were so many ways in which our
system was protected by human shame and
by a desire to not make people too angry
or sad for no reason and if you remove
that if you remove any compunction about
elevating horrible people about caring
about what people said in the past about
having respect for gay people or Muslim
people or Catholics I really like that's
very old-fashioned to be bigoted against
Catholics some of these yeah I mean it's
it's it's real throwback but but but the
the lever is for saying this is wrong
having a concept having an effect by
saying this is wrong is someone inside
the White House has to give a yeah
these people don't give a and it's
not like it's just a bunch of godless
Democrats complaining about this you
have Mitt Romney saying a religious
bigot should not be giving the prayer
that opens the u.s. embassy in Jerusalem
but there is this professional class of
evangelical leader that has decided that
nothing Trump does or says matters
anymore
if he advances their agenda and other
fronts like there's a big profile in New
York Times I think it was this weekend
about a guy named David Brody who's like
the lead anchor for Christian broadcast
network yeah it's a guy who used to
hammer Democrats still does all the time
and now it talks about his cozy
relationship with Trump they get lunch
together he goes to briefings he gets
exclusive access to pence and never
asked any of the tough questions about
you know affairs with the porn star or
any of the things you would think that
the Christian broadcast news would care
about given their past coverage of save
Bill Clinton there's there's all I mean
we should also remember that we don't
have anyone prominent on our side who
we're bringing to events like that
they're saying like that but
sometimes when someone even makes a
minor comment that others deem offensive
on the left often we go into apology
mode say know that like after this
presidency no it's also just like we
need to really seriously think of when
we on our side when someone says
something that might be construed as
offensive what we actually decide to do
I mean you look at Mitt Romney saying
I'm glad Mitt Romney yeah good for
address but the number of Islamophobic
anti-muslim bigots anti-gay bigots that
populate this administration is
staggering and that hearing it's it's
interesting in that run of run of
bigotry from that guy the Muslim piece
is what we hear all the time
we've just decided that then that that
there's a certain class of Republican
has decided they don't need to point
that out every time when it's on their
side you know we've made this point
before imagine if somebody said this
about Jews or imagine if somebody said
this about well this government is guys
you get a one-way you get a ticket to
Israel yeah enjoy
I'm glad to be here I do believe that
Jews are going to hell but
congratulations on it but what I mean
what you'll be eventually be in hell but
right now you get to enjoy this
wonderful embassy oh it's a weird I mean
that is that view that you know we need
Israel to be controlled fully by the
Jewish people before that Christ can
return is as is a big strain of like
really fundamentalist Christian theology
and a big reason that there is an
enormous support for Israel it's is very
right we're gonna yeah where are things
now we're gonna convert you in the end
for now let's let's turn to North Korea
the White House announced last week the
president Trump will meet in Singapore
with North Korean head of state Kim
jong-un on June 12th who to discuss a
potential deal on North Korea's nuclear
program over the weekend National
Security Advisor John Bolton and
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that
the two sides were already in agreement
over what the ultimate objectives of the
meeting would be they both said that
Trump will push for quote complete
verifiable and irreversible
denuclearization but then Pompeyo said
the Trump would be pushing to make sure
that America is no longer held at risk
by North Korea's nuclear arsenal and
that he hopes that they get rid of their
chemical and biological weapons so it
does seem like Pompeo either he misspoke
or he's he has a different position than
Bolton in the administration what do you
make of this time there's been a lot of
Korean news like you know like any
engaged couple they finally did it they
picked a date so June 12th in Singapore
Trump Kim jong-un to two maniacs one
bucket of chicken like you were saying
it doesn't seem like the u.s. position
is sort of like coming into focus but
they're a little all over the place like
Trump has said North Korea needs to get
rid of this nuclear weapons period in
any deal Pompeyo seem to suggest they
might be able to keep their current
arsenal and that's real objective is
keeping them from striking the US only
that will really make our allies in
Japan and South Korea very happy we also
know that you know Kim said he will
dismantle his most prominent nuclear
test site Trump tweeted how smart and
gracious that was but many experts think
the thing basically caved in from you
know nuclear
ting so that it's no longer usable so
yeah disposable cameras and that's quite
the concession but it was also out there
acting like any economic support the
North Korea's gonna get is gonna be
private-sector businesses just like
rolling in I find that a little hard to
believe there will be any direct US
economic aid because Bolton is kind of
you know saying no but again I'm happy
this is happening yeah get it done guys
but little ways off from grande skim
lattes in in Pyongyang uh so I want to
ask like there's been some pundit REE
that is like why won't liberals give
Trump credit for all that he's done
around North Korea so far what has Kim
offered Trump that past North Korean
regimes haven't offered past presidents
what is new so far about what Kim has up
because we know he's offered the rest of
the meetings I just didn't take it we
know that they've disses they've
destroyed testing sites before right
nothing nothing crossing the border yeah
I mean look crossing the border to South
Korea having that conversation yeah you
know a wildly improved tone you there's
a lot of like atmospherics there that
are shockingly better than the status
quo five six seven years ago or 20 years
ago hundred twenty years ago but right I
mean there seems like there's been these
periods in the past where it seemed
hopeful and there's been a change of
tone and they've met in the North Korean
and South Korean leader has met yeah
that's why the whole conversation about
the Nobel Prize is so silly and
everything else cuz like we're just so
far ahead of actual what success should
look like which is them getting rid of
their nuclear weapons I mean that's the
whole point is that yeah so I was gonna
say what is a successful summit short of
them giving up all of their nuclear
weapons which seems would do you think
they will give up all of their nuclear
weapons feels unlikely to me so what is
there any success short of that them
giving up nuclear weapons probably I
think it's the only realistic successes
they have some sort of program or some
sort of weapons capacity or capability
that they hold onto is there a scenario
where they give up the capacity to
strike the United States but not South
Korea and then they still maintain some
of what I'm trying to figure out what
Pompeo is saying I guess you get rid of
their entire ICBM
program and call that a success I just
don't know how you could shift the
goalposts that much and call the success
or make your allies happy yeah I think
there's two things side by side one is
the fundamental situation which we
talked about before which is we've
created incentives and North Korea knows
those incentives which is if you want to
be a closed-off regime that tortures
your people and threatens your neighbors
having nuclear weapons is one way to
protect yourself and protect yourself
from foreign invasion protect yourself
from bombing protect yourself from
regime change protect yourself from
American foreign policy shifts you look
at Libya you look at Iraq you look now
at the around deal being torn up you
look at that and and it's hard to
imagine a set the incentives not being
there for kim jeong-hoon
to maintain nuclear weapons they're an
insurance policy against aggression they
are also ate a card you can play which
he's playing now I don't know that any
Barack Obama didn't change that George W
Bush didn't change that Bill Clinton
didn't change that Donald Trump didn't
change that and I don't know that there
I'll start it up again we're losing Dan
welcome to pod save America I'm John
Favreau
I'm Dan Tyler today on the pod we're
talking midterms and polling with the
whiz kid himself friend of the pod Harry
anton of CNN also on pod save the world
this week Tommy talked with cricket
contributor Ben Rhodes about Donald
Trump's decision to withdraw from the
Iran deal and about recent reports that
Iran deal opponents hired Israeli spies
to stock Ben and his family how about
that one dan I mean what a world they're
not dealing with good people still
haven't seen Congress take any action on
figuring out why Iran deal opponents
hired foreign spies to stalk Americans
who were in government think that would
be an interesting topic for them to look
into don't know why no one's doing
anything well I think it's Paul Ryan
flying around the country thirty million
dollar checks right middle in the middle
of the gray areas for campaign finance
law from Sheldon Davison so he's pretty
busy yeah he's also spending a lot of
time aiding and abetting Devon Eunice's
cover-up of Trump's crimes so you know
there's only so much so many hours in a
day for Paul Ryan before we get into
everything else there's obviously some
news today kim jeong-hoon released three
American hostages Trump went to greet
them in the middle of the night when
they came back at Andrews and then he
gave this very bizarre quote we want to
thank Kim Jong hoon who was really
excellent to these three incredible
people
was he excellent to these people that he
kidnapped and then put into forced labor
camps for a couple years for a year a
couple months sure sure if you ignore
the kidnapping that he was great I mean
look the first day it is great but the
super our home
you never efforts the Donald Trump for
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did you
do that
kudos to them kudos to them thank god
they're home thank God for their
families yeah unambiguously you're good
at it
I'm not sure Donald Trump needed to give
Kim jong-un the fives already on Airbnb
at the end of this so good yes I like
that yeah
I mean also like acting like this is I
mean you know the Obama administration
secured the release of two hostages from
North Korea in 2014 you know Bill
Clinton did before him like this is this
is something that happens Kim jong-un
has done this before the North Korean
regime regime has done this before has
released hostages to Americans I think
that's so far I mean you know we've said
this before it's good that Donald Trump
is going to talk with Kim Jong and
diplomacy is good we believe in
diplomacy we did when we were about
ministration we do today but I think
it's important to recognize that so far
North Korea has not done anything or
taken any steps that it has not taken
before in Prior administration's in
prior years so I believe that you know
today they announced that Donald Trump
and Kim jong-un would be meeting in
Singapore on June 12th that is the big
summit so you know hopefully there's
good outcome there but the big question
at the heart of all of this is still you
know will Kim jong-un give up his
nuclear program his nuclear weapons I
stopped trying to adapt and and that we
don't have any evidence that he'll do
that yet yeah I think that's exactly
right there is with the fact that this
meeting is happening first planned at
least is very good news I am for
diplomacy as the best path to solving
this challenge there's the devil
presidents of both parties for many
years like you said there's a lot of
work to do so should me keep the Nobel
on ice
I would probably for someone who
supports diplomacy I would probably
prefer that we sent someone to the
meeting who can answer the question how
to get to North Korea from South Korea
but we don't go to we don't go to
diplomacy you the president we have the
president we choose we go with the
president we have I guess or something
yeah again I mean 300 plus million
people in this country if you tried to
pick one to go to a summit with Kim Jong
hoon to try to achieve world peace and
get rid of nuclear weapons I think
Donald Trump would be at the very bottom
of the list but like Martin shkreli
Donald Trump there's just there's not
devyn newness maybe
you said Kanye West or Donald Trump
probably Kanye West probably Kanye West
yeah I think I would Jo it's a close
call yeah but anyway like you said but
we have Donald Trump so let's roll the
dice and see what we get okay
let's talk about let's talk about
Michael Cohen it seems as though the
president's lawyer has run afoul of the
law Dan yeah it's amazing this week we
learned that the slush fund he created
so that Donald Trump could pay off
stormy Daniels had more than one purpose
essential consultants LLC which I
believe is the first time the word
essential has been used in connection
with Michael Cohen was also used to
accept massive payments from giant
telecom companies drug companies and
Russian oligarchs who wanted access to
the President of the United States just
your standard stuff this information
appeared in a detailed 7 page document
that was posted on Twitter by stormy
Daniels camera-shy lawyer Michael
avenatti the information was later
confirmed by multiple news outlets and
we know it's true because the Treasury
Department has launched an investigation
into how avenatti gut Cohen's financial
records Dan obviously lots to unpack
here but what was your first reaction to
all of this news my first reaction was I
had to go home Wednesday night or
Tuesday night and like read for two
hours to figure out what the
happened because I didn't pay much
attention to the news that day and it's
a lot - it's a lot to pick through I
mean really there is so much it and
there is so much happening there is it
is there like the web is so tangled with
bad players just stupid activity crimes
crush it and you really have to like
step back in and and sort of step back
and sort of figure it out
I'd say a couple things about this one
it is pretty clear once again that we
are dealing with criminals but we are
not dealing with criminal masterminds
because the whole point of a shell
company you create is to create some
distance for yourself so then you
probably shouldn't use the same shell
company you use as your pornstar pay off
hush slush fund to run your
sketchy pay-for-play access though a
consulting business so rule number one
of slush funds no double-dipping level
of lazy stupidity lazy stupid
criminality Michael come in to have many
burner phones he could use to make
speaker calls and then forget to throw
them away as though that the Southern
District of New York can seize them at
the end of the day I mean it is it's why
they're called burner phones Michael
Cohen you're getting right here is from
the emergency bonus edition of last
week's pod that we had to ditch because
NBC got the story wrong so yeah I get to
do our burner jokes Z I think the other
thing here is it does like Michael Cohen
is sort of the rosetta stone to Trump's
crimes because as you sort of dig into
that you're dealing with it sort of
brings together potential money
laundering just rank corruption and
pay-for-play
Russian oligarchs providing money and
like this is this is why this Trump has
been such a lunatic ever since the
office is already because he knows that
all the bodies are buried here yeah so
let's unpack all this and let's start
with the Russian angle there's an
investment firm called Columbus Nova
which is the American subsidiary of
Renova Group which is a Russian
conglomerate founded by a Russian
oligarch with close ties to Putin named
Victor Vekselberg he was also tough so
Columbus Nova also paid Cohen eight
installments totaling five hundred
thousand dollars between January and
August of 2017 avenatti suggested that
the money may have helped cover the
hundred and thirty thousand dollars
stormy Daniels payment we don't know
that for sure Dan Viktor Vekselberg was
stopped at Dulles Airport months ago in
questioned by Robert Muller's
investigators last month the Treasury
Department placed him on a list of
Russians who've been sanctioned for
interfering in our election quite a
coincidence that he's involved no
coincidence Russians who interfere in
the election having
the personal and financial ties to charm
maybe maybe it's just a coincidence that
it happened to be that this Russian
oligarch was looking for the best most
essential consulting services available
in America and he scoured the waterfront
looking talking to all the big fire when
he came down to at the end after this
rigorous unbiased search with that
Michael Cohen was the man's into this
nebulous work for him
it's pretty wild and at some point I I
recognize that everyone is innocent till
proven guilty that we should be
skeptical but at some point the mountain
of coincidences gets so tall that you
just have to acknowledge that there are
more there is an incredible amount of
questionable conduct illegally Galla t
criminality that's at the root of all of
this it's just there are just too many
coincidences for this to be a
coincidence yeah and there's a couple
other interesting points here you know
that they're a little worried about this
because Columbus Nova said through an
attorney that it was never owned by a
foreign entity and yet renova group the
Russian conglomerate listed on their
website as one of their companies
Columbus Nova as late as November of
2017 and when you go there now it says
oh the websites under construction we
also know that Columbus Nova the
American subsidiary which is an
investment firm for some reason spent
2016 and 2017 registering websites for
white supremacists and alt-right groups
why were they doing why was an
investment for him doing that why were
they controlled by a Russian oligarch
why did they spend five hundred thousand
dollars on Michael Cohen's essential
consulting services and why was this all
done in a time period right before the
election and ended in the summer of 2017
right when the sanctions debate stopped
what what's going on here man John you
are so cynical about to behave I mean
affiliate illy ated old guard I just I
don't know I don't know Dan yeah
crazy that's what it is but it's so
obvious what is going on here
and it is but we can't say it we have to
like dance around it it's like the
stories in the paper over the weekend
there were the incredible investigative
reporting about the fact that Trump at a
time of incredibly low interest rates
and who instead of who instead of
borrowing money decided to break with
all real estate practice and just pour
massive amounts of cash of unknown
origin into real estate properties while
his son was saying that on in an
interview that all their money came from
Russia and we don't say what it is money
laundering like no one could say that
because that would somehow violate some
normal journalism it's pretty clear what
is going on here the only question is
will Bob Muller or the US Attorney's and
so district New York be able to find
sufficient evidence to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that a crime was
committed but let's not be naive about
what is happening I mean it it is so
light it's all happening before right
and yeah and it's also it's also
important to note that we always know a
fraction of what Muller knows and we
usually know it much later than what
when Muller found out so we know from
all these reports that Muller was
questioning this Russian oligarch months
ago we know that he has been looking
into essential LLC and looking at these
payments months ago we only know now
because of avenatti but but Muller's
known all of this for a long long time
so in addition to taking half a million
from Russian oligarchs and buying the
silence of the president's mistresses
essential consultant was also a massive
pay to pace pay to play slush fund Cohen
would basically go around to big
corporations with business before the
government and promised them access to
Donald Trump and his advisors in
exchange for large sums of money AT&T
was trying to push a merger through and
fight net neutrality rules so they paid
off Cohen a big drunk up a big drug
company called Novartis heard the Trump
promised to lower drug prices so they
paid off Cohen I guess first of all how
common is this because you know there is
this relationship in DC where a lot of
companies pay people they believe to be
close to a president to sort of get
advice and it falls short of the legal
definition of lobbying but it's clearly
trying to purchase some sort of
influence and access well I think you're
hearing from a lot of these of the
Washington hands and reporters who've
been around the block and dined at the
Capital Grille multiple time saying this
is just how things are done how things
are done is terrible first of all true
but it's also not really true because
yeah there is a lot of people a lot of
people who go around and oversell their
access to pretty naive corporations and
foreign entities about what they're
gonna be able to deliver and so that
does happen but what is different here
is a couple things one the amounts of
money we're talking about a pretty
extreme right late so I think to say
that Novartis II was who ended up paying
1.2 million dollars I believe over time
that that is an amount of money for one
individual that is pretty unheard of and
how what clinical lobbying is done
apparently it's apparently it's way way
more than Novartis paid any of their
lobbyists so you look through all their
lobbying records and even like the most
expensive lobbying firm that they hire
it's nothing compared to what they paid
Michael Cohen for one meeting so
that that's alarming her they suggest
something untoward second the realist
not just overlooked the fact that like
there is this great error between like
on the outskirts of lobbying which is
unregulated this should be really
regulated which is basically strategic
consulting where people with large
networks and great connection get quote
unquote political intelligence and share
it with companies but then but don't
technically advocate for a specific
policy or advocate on behalf of the
client and therefore they don't have to
register as lobbyists which means they
don't have to disclose things and they
sort of live in this sort of the shadows
of the DC employers game if some of
these reports are true that what Trump
what Cohen was promising was specific
meeting specific access to deliver on
specific requests
of the of these clients then he was
almost certainly lobbying in in
violation of the law now on the list of
crimes Michael Coleman is alleged to
have committed violating the lobbying
registration failing to register as a
lobbyist is probably pretty small but it
is a crime then we turn that over look
moderately significant crimes from close
associates of president estates in a
normal world that would be a gigantic
deal and it should be here - we can't
just sort of poopoo it because they
means he's not guilty of treason or
conspiracy against the United States or
the other crimes that people always she
may have committed um yeah I mean so
there's a question there's a legal
question which is how much legal trouble
is coming in which we just talked about
and also is Trump liable as well those
questions are did Trump know about what
Colin was doing was Trump getting any
money himself knowing that Trump doesn't
like when aids you know or people close
to him profit off of him and usually
likes to take a cut on his own there's a
lot of questions about you know whether
Trump he knew about this and B was
getting money himself so that seems like
that's you know that's the Trump
liability there's also a larger
political question here which is how
drained is this swamp right this
this this president you know up till
like the weeks before the election was
talking about Hillary Clinton being
bought off and draining the swamp in
Washington and it's become so
comical at this point that now we have
in the Trump administration the biggest
companies and richest can just
pay off Republicans to get tax cuts and
special favors while most people's
premiums are going up the cost of their
prescription drugs are going up eighteen
T's jacking up their phone bills their
internet isn't free anymore and you know
these people can't afford to pay a bribe
to some dumb mobster lawyer who's
friends with Donald Trump and they can't
afford to make huge donations to pay off
politicians and that's the government
right now and to me that seems like
that's something the Democrats can go
out there and run on what do you think
yeah that's exactly right Donald Trump
ran as a populist reformer and his
govern as a quote
 and Democrats have to make that
hate and I feel oh you know I was met I
was communicating with some reporters
the other day about this question like
do you think democratic message and the
answer is we and because we're not at a
point where Democrats are communicating
and paid messaging Digital Television to
voters right that's how you know what
the real message of and it's not what
there's not actually what they're saying
on Twitter right let's check the people
like what is what does it mean to
narrative there can end it they're going
to spend money we communicate to voters
what are their volunteers and Canvassers
saying people the doors and the phones
right like what what is that narrative I
and were little I think twisting around
the actual as a party because part of
the one of the overly simplistic
critique for the Democratic message in
2016 was you focus too much on Trump's
personal foible that not enough on
policy hmm and to me that I think there
are some merit of that for that point
for sure but it is not it's a false
choice right you have to weave a policy
narrative with an argument around the
characters and values of who you're
running against and that is not doesn't
mean have to all be about Trump's but
what is happening in Washington is all
tied together you leave attendance for a
long time the argument from Democrats
should be you're running against the
chaos in the corruption in Washington
and Wall Street and then you have like
literally a phone book that remembers on
a film that was some data points the
point that I got so I think that's when
this is this Cohen thing is one more
example of that if we should use it
because it says something about what is
happening in Washington and what rule
and why we need change and Democrats are
the change of time which we were not
last time so we can more
enthusiastically grasp that change
mantle than we were able to do - that
was good to me this is getting in the
media narrative - we talked about this a
on the line with me as ben rhoades you
guys know Ben he is the author of the
new book the world as it is which is
available to pre-order right now and is
out on June 12th and it will tell you
the story of the entire eight years of
the Obama White House including the Iran
deal which Donald Trump just exploded to
trigger and own libs like us Ben how
owned do you feel right now
I mean well the sad fact too though is
that like Trump I think has no
understanding of like what is actually
in the Iran deal and no plan for where
this is going
he's just doing this you know to own
Obama people he's just doing this
because Barack Obama negotiated this
deal and the fact that that is what is
motivating the president I had States on
the most serious issues we face it's
actually part of what is the most
angering about about this decision so
let's talk about the Iran deal was I
mean it was it was it was not just an
agreement right it was seven years of
putting pressure on Iran through
sanctions through regional diplomacy
through a variety of means to get all
our allies to work together to pressure
them to not continue to engage in these
nuclear activities not to continue
enriching uranium at a level that would
produce a nuclear weapon
who'd involve us the Europeans the UN
Security Council had to vote for these
sanctions right I mean this was like
this is a global effort yeah I mean you
know Trump today is talking about well
you know we'll just put on sanctions
again when in fact you just blew up the
International unity that we'd spent a
decade a cultivating it is necessary for
sanctions as you said Tommy to get Iran
to the negotiating table it took you
know five years of patient work with
Europe to get them to put in place an
oil embargo on Iranian oil on China
India Russia Japan South Korea all of
them to cooperate with our sanctions to
reduce their purchases running oil to
apply the pressure that brought Iran to
the table where we then spent two years
painstakingly negotiating a nuclear deal
that dramatically rolled back the
Iranian nuclear program that destroyed
the core of a reactor that could have
produced plutonium for nuclear weapon
that took out two-thirds of their
centrifuges and put them under
monitoring that got rid of 97% of their
stockpile you know that did put in place
inspections to verify that those things
were being done this took this isn't
like we've made a decision in one day
and he just got rid of it this is the
whole world all the major powers and our
closest allies working together for
seven years to achieve a deal that could
prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear
weapon and he just you know scrapped
that to have a photo-op
you know at the White House so yeah so
what happened is now been like what what
happens next it seems like the Europeans
are gonna try to encourage the Iranians
not to resume nuclear activities and and
I guess you know in exchange they'll try
to continue to encourage European
countries to keep doing business with
Iran but we want that come to a head if
the United States slaps back US
sanctions on Iran because then we'd have
to sanction European businesses that
work with them right yeah I mean there
are two fundamental problems here
one is Trump said he's going to reimpose
the sanctions that were relieved under
the deal to do that he would have to
sanction Europe or China or European or
Chinese entities in other words you know
we actually never enforced those
sanctions because we got those countries
to cooperate and work with us and so you
know he would essentially be sanctioning
some of our closest partners in the
world and potentially creating
significant economic negative
consequences from doing that they would
probably try to resist those sanctions
into the notion that you could
simultaneously have the Europeans trying
to stay in the deal but Trump
sanctioning them for anything that they
do in Iran that's not going to work and
the second point is the Iranians would
have to negotiate some better deal with
us and we just pulled out of a deal that
we negotiated that the u.s. is a party
to this is clearly going to embolden
hardliners in Iran who didn't like the
deal to begin with and it's far more
likely I think that you see Iran
beginning to walk away from the deal
then somehow them capitulating to
greater concession yeah
and I guess we should just again remind
people that there's no evidence to
suggest that Iran had come out of
compliance with the deal the IAEA
certified that they were meeting the the
rules rolled out in the in the deal
general mattis said the deal is in our
interest Mike Pompeo testified before
Congress very recently that Iran was not
cheating so there's no there's no
argument to be made that somehow Iran
forced his hand here right no they spent
and they spent two years you know you're
not searching for a rationale of Iranian
non-compliance and they didn't find it
yeah and and in part of what is so
absurd about this is not always Iran
complying with the deal this timing is
totally arbitrary right because there
was no Iranian violation Trump is just
randomly deciding to precipitate a
nuclear crisis an international crisis
rift with our allies rift with China and
Russia at the very time frankly that
he's already trying to negotiate thing
with North Korea so you know there there
is just there's no possible explanation
for him taking this action other than
some antipathy to everything that Obama
did or some desire to fulfill a campaign
promise you had our closest allies
working pleading with him not to do this
you had members of his own
administration including secretary
defense didn't want him to do this
you had the intelligence community
finding that Ryan was complying so he is
bucking did you know people in his own
administration people around the world
and then so doing creating a crisis you
know for no reason around an arbitrary
deadline the only folks that seem to
want him to do what he did today was
Netanyahu and his closest advisors I got
in some trouble last week for saying
that Netanyahu rolled out this new
intelligence that they'd found in an
effort to sort of work with the Trump
administration to create the impression
that Iran had violated the deal
zoomy to create the impression that Iran
had violated the deal
when in fact the documents didn't show
that people accused me of all kinds of
things but today but today Trump's use
again the pretend I'm sorry but today
Trump again say
Iran quote is pursuing nuclear weapons
incited Netanyahu's intelligence
presentation when in fact nothing in
that presentation showed that they were
pursuing those nuclear activities today
it showed past activities right yeah no
let's be clear that's a lie okay here's
why okay what Netanyahu put out was
stuff that Iran did many years ago when
they were pursuing a nuclear weapon that
is precisely why we put the deal in
place that the inspections and
verification regime under the Iran deal
is what prevents the scenario that
Netanyahu is pointing to in the past in
that that presentation by Netanyahu did
not amount to a violation of the deal at
all it's just the ancient history of how
we got to the deal in the first place
why Aaron's behavior is troubling in the
first place you take out inspectors you
take out monitoring suddenly once again
you don't have the ability to see what
Iran is doing you could be back in the
days of Netanyahu is pointing to when
you didn't have neuron deal so what's so
absurd about this whole set of arguments
is essentially the Iran deal solves the
problem that Netanyahu was identifying
in his presentation what they're doing
is getting rid of potentially the
constraints on Iran's program and the
inspections creating the exact scenario
that they were complaining about in that
presentation or you know that they were
saying or it's gonna happen in 10 or 15
years that that's going to happen now
yeah you know and until today you could
say okay until take you could have made
an argument that Trump was posturing in
an effort to get the Israelis to force
Iran to put in place some sort of
follow-on agreement that might have
limited their ballistic missile testing
or that somehow force them to stop
supporting bad actors in places like
Yemen or in Syria but all that leverage
is now gone unless I'm mistaken yeah
McCrone present McCrone of France
offered Trump a great lifeline he said
look I will negotiate on these other
issues that you're worried about
ballistic missiles some of the
provisions in the deal that expire in 10
years or 15 years the condition though
is keep the jcpoa the Iran deal in place
while I negotiate that because it makes
no sense to junk the deal
get rid of those constraints and go for
a different deal let's build from the
foundation of what's in the Iran deal
and Trump wouldn't even accept you know
that opening that McCrone offered him
and that's going to create a crisis with
their European allies that we haven't
seen since the invasion of Iraq I mean
the rift between the United States
France UK and Germany and the EU who are
all party to this deal as well you know
it risks being as severe as anything
we've seen since the 2003 run-up to the
Iraq war frustrated it's the point of
that it's sort of hard to articulate my
feelings in a reasonable way about this
what do you think happens next I mean
it's hard to predict well it yeah it's
gonna play out
you know it'll play out over some time
the Iranians could try to work within
the processes set up by the jcpoa to say
that the u.s. violated the deal they
could go to the UN they're there any
number of things that the Iranians could
do to try to claim the high ground here
blame us then there's the question of is
Trump going to impose these sanctions
and if he does does that mean as we
discuss it he's going to try to impose
sanctions on European entities that will
have to play out so that there will be a
messy you know a few months here but the
problem Tommy is that they keep making
these announcements as if they're not
long term consequences you know the long
term consequence here is if as that
plays out Iran starts resuming some of
its nuclear activity and the deal falls
apart then we could be faced with an
unconstrained Iranian nuclear program
that could lead to a point where the
Iranians are once again approaching the
ability to produce enough nuclear
material for a weapon and we have to
decide do we start a war with Iran to
stop them from getting that nuclear
weapon that's one very real possible
consequence but there are other
consequences this consistent trashing of
international agreements that the u.s.
is a party to like the Paris agreement
like TPP like the Iran deal is
undermining American credibility in all
of our efforts to try to achieve any
other international agreements if you're
sitting across the table in the United
States now you're thinking this is a
country that doesn't honor its
agreements that would be a backdrop to
the North Korea negotiations but also to
any number of other negotiations is
going to undermine our standing in the
world we look like the
outlier here the rest of the world
supports this deal certainly the major
powers that negotiated Russia China and
the Europeans we're now the outlier what
is the long-term consequence of the u.s.
consistently being outside of the
spectrum of views of our allies and the
other major powers on on leading and
consequential issues so I you know I and
that's not to mention the fact that the
Trump administration says he wants to
get tougher on Iranian behavior well we
just fractured the international unity
that you need in order to hold Iran
accountable not just on the nuclear
program but other things so he is
junking with this decision not just
potentially the constraints in the Iran
deal and not just the potential for a
conflict with Iran over its nuclear
program but he's setting back America's
alliances America's credibility to
negotiate agreements America's standing
in the world
and that all is going to have medium and
long-term consequences that we're going
to be living with for not just months
but years to come yeah and there's just
it's hard to overemphasize the fact that
they have no plan B in so many yeah and
no one presses them on that I mean you
heard at the end of the the news
conference someone was saying how does
this help the u.s. be more safe and
we're secure and he just wouldn't answer
that simple question well you know yeah
because you know some of the coverage
here is framed as you know fulfilling a
campaign promise or further undoing
Obama's legacy well guess what those
things don't matter in the world no like
what matters is what actually happened
you know and and I don't think anybody
for the Trump administration could
articulate for you what is going to
happen now no I don't think they cannot
say here's here's what our plan is our
plan is to do x and y and achieve Z
there they're just tearing things down
with no plan for what comes next and
that's an incredibly dangerous way to
approach something as serious as the
Iranian nuclear deal there any a nuclear
program but that kind of hostility to
anything that resembles in kind of
competent deliberate governance
cooperation with other countries you
know that the consequences of that
approach are going to be felt on this
issue and others you know for for a long
time because again if you're sitting in
in in London or Paris or Berlin or
Beijing you know or any number of places
around the world and you're looking at
this you know train wreck I mean you're
thinking like well is the United States
under Donald Trump a country that you
know I can rely on that I can make an
agreement with do I want to follow
America's leadership and frankly not
only those governments but the people in
those countries you know Trump is so
toxic and unpopular in Europe he
basically just thumbed his nose at our
key allies the people in those countries
are not going to want their governments
to cooperate with the United States and
that's going to make it harder for us to
get things done in the world so again
the and this is not just about like you
know being able to have you know Kelly
and Conway go on Fox News and say you
know he scrapped Iran deal kept his
promise and Obama's bad that doesn't
matter that's kind of irrelevant to what
is actually going to happen here yeah
they have no argument on the merits and
one of the ways you know they have no
argument on the merits is that someone
some shadowy entity
some reports say connected with the
Trump White House hired a private
investigating firm of a full of former
Israeli spies and members of the
military to go after you and Colin call
who is Vice President Biden's national
security adviser to try to you know dig
up dirt on people to destroy them
destroy their reputations in an effort
to undercut an argument at the Iran deal
because they have no argument on the
merits well like yeah a few points on
this I mean you know one if the Iran
deal is so bad why do you have to go you
know hire shadowy ex-mossad
types to dig up dirt on people to
discredit the Iran deal I think this is
like yeah it should be easy right but no
you don't have good arguments you don't
have the facts on your side so what
you're gonna you're gonna have some
Mossad cutouts like investigate me and
Colin calls undermine the Iran deal
second is what what a chilling new world
war if like when you get out of
government you know you could be faced
with like investigations to discredit
you by political opponents maybe you
know the people who
were actually in power right now whether
it's here in Israel like what what world
is that what does that suggest a public
servant you know that it been what does
that say about what they might be doing
with the NSA or the CIA or the massive
ways we had to surveil people through
the US government yeah no like I look I
I face these you know the the anti-iran
deal crowd is is really I mean I like I
faced a lot of stuff in government they
were constantly the most belligerent
personal you know vitriolic voices
attacking me or anybody associated Iran
deal but I had the notion that that
would then extend to like hiring people
to to spy on my family like it's so far
beyond the pale it visser AIT's like any
norm of behavior that you would expect I
mean maybe Nixon you know and as well
this darkest dreams might have hatched
such a scheme but you know it's a really
chilling thing that you know suddenly
what you you you your arguments that
you're waging and and media and social
media and politics aren't enough you
you're you're gonna hire people to dig
up dirt on people and the spy on
people's families like that's not that's
not a country we want to live in it's
it's not what you'd expect and in the
United States of America you know you
know you you might hear about that
happening in some authoritarian country
and think that that's a terrible thing
is the fact that that's happened here
now and it's connected to this whole you
know kind of weird belligerents towards
the Iran deal that is so outside of the
mainstream I mean you know it's a it's a
worrying direction for for our country
this is not a scenario where they all do
it all politicians are bad they all you
know take up dirt no no no this is
totally new this is so outside the
bounds of what's acceptable the FBI
should investigate this Congress should
hold hearings on what the hell happened
here and figure out if this is tied to
the Trump White House because if it is
that is a scandal that is massive
explosive and they need to get to the
bottom of it ya know if anybody in the
Trump White House is involved in in
contracting and spying on the families
of their predecessors like that and that
goes so far beyond you know anything
that we can
kind of wrap our minds around you know
in the fact that the black cube did the
Israeli entity involved in this you know
they denied it then they kind of
adjusted their denial now they're
they're putting on some story that like
a shipping dispute I mean I have very
little rigs I've known the shipping
industry Tommy I can assure you yeah but
you know what why is there some Israeli
entity involved in this you know
conspicuously obviously the Trump
administration the Netanyahu government
like eight the Iran deal and have been
attacking me for years like it shouldn't
spill over and look I take it right like
you know you're in government you expect
to get criticized and sometimes as a
criticism gonna be personal I didn't
like it but you know to cross that line
would be you know really chilling break
from any past precedent in our country
that I'm aware of
yeah from the good people at black cube
who tried to destroy the women who were
assaulted by Harvey Weinstein that's to
help the pedigree been depressing awful
day thank you for helping us understand
welcome to pod save America I'm John

were you we were in Pittsburgh I don't
care we were in Baltimore we recorded
some great shows we're gonna be howard
dean there that's the joke
we were gonna we were going to we're
gonna have a great show coming out this
Friday that will be a show about social
media we're gonna take the best of what
we recorded in Baltimore and in Columbus
we had some experts on social media and
how it influences politics we had Audrey

guests and she check it out
experts on social media huh yeah not you
don't respond to mentions random angry
mention this is that the we're not
responding to angry trolling mentions
anymore okay anyway well no nor were
using other apps nor other apps that's
rude or other milks that's for we
learned that too okay
quick update on the Trump crime family
the last we left Rudy Giuliani he was
confessing potential crimes to Sean
Hannity on live television specifically
that the president Michael Cohen may
have committed a felony by failing to
disclose a hush money payment to stormy
Daniels just days before the 2016
election in response Donald Trump told
reporters on Friday that Rudy wasn't
fully up to speed when he was on Hannity
and he would eventually quote get his
facts straight in response to that Rudy
decided to do more television interviews
in which he made more news one of those
he was on Fox I believe Friday night on
Janine's esteemed program and then on
Sunday he sat down with ABC's George
Stephanopoulos and I believe Michael has
a clip for us
you said hee hee hee this was a regular
arrangement he had with Michael Cohen
suited Michael Kahn make payments to
other women for the president I have no
knowledge of that but I would think if
it was necessary yes he made payments
for the president or he he conducted
business for the president which means
he had legal fees monies laid out and
expenditures which I have on my bills to
to my clients and are you confident that
his testimony and the stormy Daniels
payment won't contradict the President
and not in any way maggiore respect look
if it didn't contradict it at all they
somebody be lying - nailed it nailed it
I love Rudy saying about there again
I love Rudy saying I'm an expert on
campaign finance law no you're not but
I'm not an expert on the facts yet
there's 1.2 million documents I haven't
had time to review them all I mean
you've had time to say hey mr. Trump did
you pay Michael Cohen back when did you
do so when did you like - like three
irrelevant facts that he needed to know
before going on TV and making an ass of
himself
saying I haven't read the information
yet is not an acceptable excuse when you
are a child doing a book report in front
of the class it is definitely not a good
excuse where you are on you know a
Sunday show presidency lawyer to the
president it states you don't have to
nobody makes you go on Jorge step and
George Stephanopoulos doesn't come at
your house and remove you in the middle
of the night and make you do it you said
they call you and they said we'd love to
have you that render you should say
something like I can't I don't know
anything
is this how we practice law in the
United States now we just have lawyers
for a different client like Michael
avenatti and Rijal and you're just gonna
go on do every single show possible and
just argue the case in front of everyone
else
oh yeah yes John Giuliani's actual quote
was yeah my issue is getting up to speed
on the facts here I'm about halfway
living on a prayer you know think of my
brain is half full of information so so
basically so Rudy admitted that there
may have been other women paid to be
silent about the affairs they I was
Trump
was one little nugget he also said that
Trump may defy a subpoena from special
counsel Bob Muller to testify and that
Trump may ultimately choose to exert
fifth Amendment rights which protects
people from giving testimony that may
incriminate them well what's the
strategy here guys I know we say there's
not much of a strategy but what do we
think is going on in what is what is
Rudy's method to his madness here what
does what is Rudy interims doing where's
Rudy I mean I think that there's a meta
Trump big picture strategy which is he
knows he did the crimes he knows that
he's guilty of maybe a series of things
whether it's collusion whether it's
money laundering whether it God knows he
potentially probably thinks he's guilty
of things that he doesn't even know
about right I'm sure something wrong
there for what he's trying to do in all
his public messaging and they've stepped
it up with Rudy coming on board is just
make this a political fight and try to
undercut the credibility of the Moller
investigation undercut the credibility
of whatever was referred to Sdn why in
terms of Michael the investigation now
it's a Michael Cohen in New York he just
wants to attack all of it and and
continue to sort of build this antipathy
towards the FBI towards Comey towards
Muller to everyone involved so that if
the Congress is called on to make a
political judgment ie impeachment they
will side with the president because
their base wants them to do so yeah I
think two things I think one they're
socializing everyone to a bunch of
outlandish previous previously historic
decisions by the president like pleading
the fifth getting everybody comfortable
with it the other thing is you have this
guy Rudy he's combative he is good on
television if what you want is someone
fighting from trumps point right from
from that point of view but also he's
going on television and kind of hinting
at admitting to various things in
various ways they're contradictory but
he's throwing stuff out there and and
one thing that I think Trump did
throughout the presidential election is
this incredible quick move how quickly
things went from fake news to old news
right you deny it you denied you deny it
you kind of admit it in some convoluted
way and then the next thing you know in
July it again you deny it again and then
all of a sudden it's sort of been out
there semi denied for some time and then
the impressed moves on and everybody
moves on I mean there's only so many
days we're going to talk about the fact
that Rudy Giuliani conceded that Trump
not only paid stormy Daniels but that
his lawyer had basically a slush fund
for paying other women
that's a huge and extraordinary
admission and yet how many days are we
gonna spend talking about it for a very
much agree with Tommy's point that they
have settled on an argument and the
argument is bias and the reason they've
settled on bias like the FBI is biased
against them they're politically biased
they're all Obama holdovers they're all
Democrats right because they know that
this is sort of the media's soft spot
that the media cares about bias and
balance and they believe that they can
make a case that all these people from
Comey to Muller to the prosecutors at
the FBI that they're all against Trump
for political partisan reasons and that
so anything that they come out with
it's just partisan it's all just a
political fight just like the Democrats
in Congress just like the race against
Hillary Clinton it's almost like the New
York Times in the Washington Post it's
all politics and that's the way he
believes he can get around the fact that
he'd committed yeah normally lawyers
don't speak unless they know the answer
or the relevant facts normally you know
prosecutors or lawyers don't usually ask
questions that they don't know the
answer to
they are just flying by the seat of
their pants II mean there's reporting
that Trump won't tell anybody on his
team what maybe in Michael Cohen's
documents that were seized
so people are freaking out about that
but then you've Michael avenatti saying
that there was extensive communication
between Michael Cohen and the old lawyer
for stormy Daniels about the timing of
the hush payment and that it needed to
be made before the election which
clearly throws it squarely into the
realm of campaign finance question now
like smart rulers like Mark Elias who's
a really smart campaign finance layer
thinks there that they're in big trouble
regardless but it's just like that it's
a facts be damned situation they just
want the fight yeah and the reason that
they believe the reason that they're
trying to argue this out in the public
is they know there's a legal process
that's going on but they know at the end
of the day that Trump they believe the
Trump is immune from prosecution yeah
that he has
Pfeiffer said on the pod Thursday
immunity by congressional majority that
the Republicans will protect him from
impeachment that he can ultimately plead
the fifth and while the pleading the
fifth may get him some bad press for a
little while then he gets to move on you
know he can defy the subpoena the
Supreme Court can say it you have
to accept the subpoena you have to abide
by the subpoena and then he can just
plead the fifth and everyone will gasp
it'll be headlines for a couple days and
then it'll be like yet but I pled the
fifth and so now what are you gonna do
impeach me now
this is also we are of course saying
this in a world where he has not been
charged with any crimes the after we
talk about crimes like the crimes
specifically have not come to light in
the sense that Muller and his
investigators and his prosecutors have
not charged or indicted Trump or even
tried to indict Trump with anything yet
if these crimes come to light if actual
crimes come to light and they are proven
if more evidence comes to light it could
change things yeah I won't hold our
breath but it could change yeah I don't
think we know I we are still in this
sort of whatever what's the word not
purgatory but um
luminol Agra liminal space we're like we
got what the word your for the
middle space yeah it was Tommy I've yeah
I know it yeah haven't used it for
visiting it's a it's that word we we
nose with purgatory catholic catholicism
for theme of the Met Gala the point is
I'm sorry it is what were you talking
about
oh yeah the liminal space like we we
know a lot but not enough we don't know
what muller knows we don't know what's
coming
Trump knows more than we do though
there's gonna be a certain point I mean
one thing that I was thinking about over
the weekend too is like who knows more
than us Trump does Muller does Mike
Pence doesn't I'm not sure Rudy does you
know no I'm not Tony doesn't know what
Trump said the Lester Holt you know like
he doesn't know anything and you know
I'm sure like I put myself in the shoes
of like Rudy Giuliani reading the
stories that broke in the post and the
times over the weekend and he's not just
scratching his head
that seems very weird speaking of the
stories at random the times in the post
Washington Post ran a story this weekend
reporting that even though Trump
financed most of his real estate
projects through debt for most of his
career around 2005 2006 this began to
change and he started spending hundreds
of millions of dollars in cash for
projects including on 14 projects he
paid for in full without any financing
from any bakes the post piece doesn't
use the phrase money laundering but it
does paint a picture of a pretty sketchy
scene in which Donald Trump is moving
tons of money around the world on golf
courses and all kinds of other projects
without the Trump Organization able to
give a coherent explanation for where
the money was coming from or why they
suddenly preferred cash Eric Trump told
the Post that his father quote didn't
need to think about borrowing for every
transaction we invested in ourselves
this is the same Eric trump who four
years ago told a reporter that quote we
don't rely on American banks we have all
the funding we need out of Russia yeah
and another another normally not that
trustworthy individual who has a
relevant quote here was this is all
about money laundering Steve Bannon told
Michael Wolfe Mulder's path to
trump goes right through Paul Manafort
Don jr. and Jared goes through Bank in
all the Kushner so people in the
know suggest that the this cash came
from Russia or you know Russian sources
and that there was money laundering like
the crime is in plain sight again yeah
and it's also just Donald Trump has made
it clear throughout his career that he
likes to use borrowed money to make
investments because it's lower risk for
him he likes the idea you know that's
what happened when he bought the plaza I
think that was an maybe even reported in
this post story but but it's a it's a
sea change and how he conducted himself
he advocated for using debt because
there are tax advantages of doing
there's financial adventures to do it
and there's far less risk and then all
of a sudden as if there's some kind of
emergency they're spending huge and huge
sum vast sums of money all around the
world out of nowhere totally new
business practice for them I mean we
also know that in 2005 and 2006 there
was billions and trillions of dollars in
illegal money in Russia that Russia
Halla GOx and russian government
officials were trying to get out of the
country and they were looking for places
in the West to put this money and around
the same time Donald Trump and the Trump
Organization starts looking for
international financing with the Trump
kids and Michael Cohen so you could and
and sure enough you can imagine them
talking to the Russians and the Russians
saying we will give you alternative
financing was the transit is the term
used and and you don't have to you don't
have to tell anyone and so a bunch of
real estate projects could very well
have been funded by Russian money yeah
and in the Michael Cohen piece they
talked about how he flipped all these
buildings for you know all of a sudden
there were three times four times as
much as what he paid for them without
having put a lot of money into them
himself just a it's a small point and
it's a it's a broad point but making
millions of dollars legitimately is very
hard and it takes like sophisticated
people like Michael Cohen Eric Trump
Donald Trump jr. Donald Trump these
people are exactly as sophisticated and
intelligent as we think they are yeah
they did not crack the code for making
hundreds of millions of dollars they
just didn't and they certainly didn't
crack it in 2006
I mean I'm interesting what comes of
this because I also like right now you
know that all of these Trump pundits and
people at Fox never else are trying to
figure out how to explain away money
laundering is not a crime yeah or at
least is not a fair crime from Muller to
go after well he was there for cool even
though if it has to do with Russia by
the way and they've committed
what's a criminal activity in laundering
money then of course Russia could hold
that over them that's that's the whole
concern yeah I also just on the money
blackmail there's no help me that's
national security implications it
reminds me of what happens when insider
trading affects somebody in power which
is then all of a sudden there's this
whole group of people that kind of say
everybody does it
everybody's laundering money everybody
everybody's insider trading yeah
everybody's doing it so yeah that is
something gorgeous I really hope this
whole thing hinges on bozo Eric Trump
like hopping in a cart with a golf
reporter he's just copping up this
detail about getting all their money
from Russia I
but you but you need to your point love
it about these guys like aren't the
brightest bulbs in the tree I mean
Michael Cohen flipping real estate a
year or two later for like three four
times the price he paid for it that has
to raise a whole lot of eyebrows I mean
it's not that easy to make money on real
estate I don't believe I know aspart no
and neither is he because we saw
the other avenues of his sophisticated
business empire and they are crashing
into people with cars and they're making
insurance claims like actually MIT this
is the level of this isn't dumb we're
not dealing with Kaiser so say here you
know like this is Michael cone this is
this is this is the guy in the first ten
minutes of the mob movie not this is not
he doesn't make it to this is not gonna
make it to the end of Goodfellas yes
he's not DeNiro checking to see how many
blueberries are in the muffins you know
this isn't this is low-level you know
this is like calling cards and the other
this is like anyway it's just Michael
please know to trim so while we're on
the subject of Trump gunnery there were
also multiple reports this weekend about
how the same Israeli intelligence firm
that was once hired by Harvey Weinstein
to dig up dirt on his accusers was
apparently hired to dig up dirt on
former Obama administration officials
Colin call and crooked contributor Ben
Rhodes as well as their families in
order to discredit their support of the
Iran deal the Guardians reporting says
that aides to president Trump hired
these Israeli spies for the job ronan
pharaoh's new yorker ronan Pharaoh's New
Yorker article cites a source that says
it was a quote private-sector client
pursuing commercially a private sector
client pursuing commercial interested
related sanctions on Iran what do we
think about this guy's some scary
this is really chilling I mean you are a
black cube yeah you mean you're a
government official just literally doing
your job and like this isn't traditional
campaign app oh this isn't like quotes
and votes and financial ties like these
are people who are out to destroy your
life in any
they can whether it's personal
professional what emailed Ben's wife an
email Collins yeah and by the way
whatever spy genius thought the
way to get in Norris was telling her she
want to consult on a movie about all the
President's Men meet the West Wing
didn't build a very good psychological
profile and also I really the company
name was shell productions it's like if
you're making a shell company have a
brainstorm guys yeah shell company
we're from fake industries we're here to
in LA on Sunday and you can also hear
the full interview on Tommy's pod save
the world episode this week so check it
out you can also listen to keep it Kara
and Louis and Ira had a great episode
this week where they talked about this
entire Kanye West situation as well as
the Michelle wolf kerfuffle which I
think both things happened three or four
years ago but today Dan we begin with
quite an update on the United States
versus the Trump family crime syndicate
last night last night America's mayor
who turned into a raving lunatic Rudy
Giuliani decided to sit for an interview
with sean hannity as president Trump's
new outside counsel and boy did he knock
it out of the park
why don't we play a clip a clip from the
the interview with Sean I think rich has
won for us that money was not campaign
money sorry I'm giving you a fact now
that you don't know it's not campaign
money no campaign finance violation so
they funneled it through the law firm
funnel through law firm and the
president repaid it oh I didn't know he
did
there's no campaign finance law zero for
the press like every Sean so what this
decision was made by everybody everybody
was nervous about this from the very
beginning I wasn't I knew how much money
Donald Trump put into that campaign I
said 130 thousand ain't gonna do a
couple of checks $430 Rudy Rudy
[Laughter]
so Rudy Giuliani admitted on national
television that the president personally
repaid Michael Cohen for the hundred and
thirty thousand dollars he paid to keep
stormy Daniels quiet about their alleged
affair for those who haven't been paying
attention the president previously told
reporters he knew nothing about the
payment Dan what was he thinking here he
wasn't
I mean it is so I was watching the
basketball game that I went to dinner so
I was not unlike my usual practice I was
not watching Hannity live and you're
following the tweets and so as I was as
I saw what he said I assumed he was
answering a question about this very
topic a question as simple as did the
president now that's not what happened
it was a question on an entirely
different subject which then calls Rudy
Giuliani to just take a sharp right turn
and admit a bunch of crimes and tell the
American people that the president is
press secretary his attorneys have all
been lying for months and I mean it's
truly mind-boggling like we made jokes
about how absurd it was that Trump was
hiring Rudy Giuliani to be interviewed
to be part of his legal team but the
reality is so much more absurd than the
jokes made it's really mind-boggling
I mean I mean thank you do the
interviews
Rudy joannec you're listening we would
let you live stream rookie media
headquarters for six straight hours if
you want to just talk this keep don't
stop talking keep doing what you're
doing
someone pointed out a couple people
pointed out that the last time Rudy
Giuliani attempted to explain a
complicated clip the last time that Rudy
Giuliani tried to explain a complicated
legal matter on behalf of the president
it was when he said Donald Trump called
him up and said hey we got to do this
Muslim ban but how do we do it in a way
so it doesn't seem like a Muslim ban
basically and Rudy's comments were then
used by lawyers in court to argue that
Trump's Muslim ban was religiously
discriminatory and so he did such a good
job with that he was brought back and
then just stepped on many rakes starting
last night on Sean Hannity's program
until today on Fox and Friends so in
response to all this Rudy talked to a
couple different reporters and tried to
say that this whole thing was planned
he said the president was very pleased
we discussed this revelation in advance
does not expect to be fired with Swift
Robert costs are reported after talking
to does not expect to be fired my
favorite phrase what what more job
security can you hope for than to not to
be expected we fired so I guess the
question is is there a world where you
see that Rudy and the President did talk
about this in advance that he was going
to bring this up at some point and why
what what is the what is the upside to
Rudy Giuliani disclosing this
information to the public there there is
no world where they plan this out this
is idiotic if it's a bad idea it's
poorly executed every part it it drips
in stupidity and arrogant it's I mean
it's just it's so but there's there has
to have been some rationale in Rudy's
head for why he should do this which I
and I think it has to I think it goes to
the legality of or at least how they
interpret the campaign finance laws
which is it seems quite different than
how the laws are actually written they
believed that the problem with Michael
Cohen paying a hundred and thirty
thousand dollars for this was that he's
not supposed to make an in-kind
contribution that large because there
are campaign contribution limits and
thus if they announced that Trump
himself actually made the payment that's
okay because Trump is allowed to
contribute unlimited funds to his own
campaign what they have not realized is
that on the campaign limits contribution
limits that may be true but even if you
contribute money to your own campaign
you still have to report that money and
if you don't that's a violation and if
you willfully and knowingly don't report
that then that could be a felony and
they don't seem to have grasped that
part of the law
Rudy may have read the first page of a
legal memo prepared by an attorney but
he did not read the second page and so
it
so look there's something much bigger
though then can't they finance law which
we can get to but if you were to reverse
engineer strategies today like I there's
no strategy Rudi is not does not it not
an attorney he doesn't Rick Lee beat is
nothing being particularly sharp he the
reason he was talking is because there
was a camera in front of him which has
long been his habit and he he has verbal
diarrhea a legal strategy and if you
there were a strategy it is Muller the
the federal government this the it
within the context of the Cohen
investigation or the Muller and or
molars investigation to Trump they know
the truth so the truth is eventually
going to come out so you want to put it
out on your terms that if there were
competent people working on this
complicated problem that would be a way
much would happen this is not how you
would do it you would do it you would
come out with this was a well-organized
well-thought-out legal argument as to
why it was not a crime they did not do
that they mumbled some things and then
had no answers to the next 17 question
but eventually I think they know that
Muller knows this and they know that
from the questions and therefore
eventually it's gonna come out they
should put it on your own terms but on
your own terms isn't that rudy giuliani
babbling on sean hannity yeah not away
any comedy communication expression all
the do this well and there's also plenty
of evidence that they did not plan this
for at least the hannity interview
because hannity as you all heard on that
clip clearly caught off guard
oh-oh-oh
my only real disappointment is that the
camera was not on hannity when he
reacted so we can't see his face because
it's on Giuliani but you just hear
off-screen Hannity oh oh I didn't know
that so Hannity was surprised which
normally that would be that would you'd
expect the journalists asking the
questions to be surprised but since
Hannity is a shadow chief of staff for
the White House you thought that he
would have been probably read in on the
strategy before Giuliani who went on and
also a number
of White House aides or all telling
reporters this morning that they had no
idea this was going to happen so clearly
they also lied about it being a strategy
to do that
last night the heavy figures so great
because Hannity sitting there going I'm
here I'm doing my job I am doing a
propaganda for the president and the
others then he stumbled into journalism
is like what do I do
cut the camera so so after all that Rudy
wakes up this morning and thinks why
don't I go do Fox and Friends let's go
back and try to just step on another few
rakes so he goes he goes back on Fox and
Friends and I think we actually we have
a great clip of of what he said there -
you're saying that Stephanie Clifford
made these allegations told Donald
Trump's lawyer
welcome deny the public and denied them
and they said it wasn't true however
imagine if that came out on October 15th
2016 in the middle of the you know last
debate with Hillary clips or to make it
go away they they made this home he
didn't even ask Cohen did it Cohen made
it go away he did his job this is what
the mob talks like also so
here's the important thing about that
revelation the entire law whether they
broke the law now hinges on whether this
payment was made in a way to influence
the election and Rudy on Fox & Friends
was trying to say this had nothing to do
with politics it had to do with you know
protecting the first lady and the
president's own reputation etc etc and
then he says that imagine if this came
out during the debate which shows that
of course the payment was meant to
influence the election it was meant to
protect Donald Trump's reputation in the
last days of the 2016 election therefore
it was an in-kind contribution therefore
it should have been reported to the FEC
it was not therefore it is a felony if
felony committed by now Michael Cohen
and possibly the president noted States
and also we know that Michael Cohen
believes that he's probably
in legal trouble over this because a
couple days ago he pled the fifth in the
state he pled the fifth saying that he
did not want to speak about the stormy
Daniels thing because he did not want to
incriminate himself because he committed
crimes yes I mean it we should note as
many people on legal Twitter point out
that pleading the fifth does not mean
you're guilty it is your legal right
isn't it of course but you can do we
have to analyze this in the context of
everything else
mmm right which is this is the attorney
for the present state this it's mr.
there's a legal context there's also
political context and then there's also
just the rank hypocrisy everyone in the
Trump orbit making claiming that anyone
who pleaded the fifth was guilty which
was their argument about various people
related to the Hillary Clinton
investigation so everyone is
these people do not get the benefit of
the doubt at least in the court of
public opinion well the court of law can
say your doubt the there are some other
illegal elements here too that are worth
noting which is it's not just campaign
finance law because the president then
also according to this I get this from
the Twitter feed of Walter shop who was
the head of the office of government
ethics before he was there modestly
pushed out by the Trump administration
due to their anti ethics position is
that he also that if this was part of a
deal with Cohen then he owed Cohen money
which is a which is a liability that
should have been reported on his
financial disclosure form something that
you sign under penalty of perjury that
you're testing to that you know to be
true to the best of your abilities so
then Trump also lied on his on his plan
shows closure form so there are multiple
potential crimes here there is all of
which because we're enjoying I didn't
interview that we're now we're us though
Thank You Johnny for your first piece of
public service in 17 years and then this
morning Trump had three tweets that all
look like they were written by lawyers
except he spelled the word roll like
Giuliani's roll or stormy Daniels
roll as ro ll which was pretty funny so
even even his lawyers have typos but the
it's this very lawyerly statement where
he talked about how Cohen was paid out
of his retainer and this agreement was
made because stormy Daniels was leveling
false accusations about Trump and blah
blah blah blah blah it all seemed fairly
confusing and like it didn't fix
anything whatsoever yeah I mean the
tweets are just so great there's no like
Randa there never says witch-hunt
there's no exclamation point there's no
random parenthesis it's like it is a
sign that they realized that they truly
 this up and that someone who had
practice law in the last 17 years had to
do something to try to right the ship
hair like Giuliani did not write those
tweet he was too busy talking them Bob
cops of The Washington Post at 3:00 in
the morning so the question is like what
happens now I guess on the legal front
Muller and whatever prosecutors are
dealing with the Cohen case may or may
not move forward on additional charges
or certainly they got some new
information last night
and then I guess in the court of public
opinion I mean this morning Sarah
Huckabee Sanders was asked about this
why did the president lie to us for so
long and now she's using the excuse I
can't comment on ongoing litigation even
though that was not the case a few weeks
ago when she said that the president
knew nothing about these payments so
she's a straight shooter as we always
knew I mean it's just it seems as though
the White House has now been caught in
some pretty huge lies over this last
week in addition to lying about knowing
about the payments to stormy Daniels we
also had the story this week about
Trump's doctor president Trump's
longtime personal doctor Harold
Bernstein this week said the Trump
dictated to him what to write in a 2015
letter that stated he'd be quote the
healthiest individual ever elected to
the president which is the letter let me
tell you is a lot funnier when you have
in your mind that Trump actually
dictated the entire thing
Borenstein also said that trump's
bodyguard raided his office and
retrieved Trump's medical direct medical
wreck
this is pretty some pretty serious
allegations here right that they're not
allegations it's the truth I guess that
that the letter was phony about Trump's
health the trumps entire medical records
and that hold the clean bill of health
but his doctor gave him was completely
 during the campaign at the same
time his entire campaign was trying to
tell everyone that Hillary Clinton was
on her deathbed so two two pretty big
lies this week the lips are hungry
Sanders for a second because some people
furtherer as the press secretary I refer
to her as the martyr of American comedy
she it is she has gone out
she is the spokesperson for the for the
president states in the entire
government see is you and I know from
traveling with our press secretary
friends Jay Carney Robert Gibbs and Josh
earnest they are very prominent famous
people that everyone recognizes they are
supposed to speak to the country and
times of great crisis in need to brief
the country on what the president's
doing to respond to those crises and
needs and she has gone out and wide for
months about this now there are two ways
to think about this one is she was
telling the American public what the
president told her and I am willing to
believe that interpretation and if that
is the case two things
she is dangerously naive to believe that
someone with a long history of lying and
would not have given herself some wiggle
room here and so just repeating his lies
but if she even if she did believe it
then she should resign today in protest
because he made an absolute fool of her
in front of the nation in the world by
telling her by sending her out the lie
about this in any press secretary worth
their salt would resign over this or
which is also believable is that she
knew she was lying it didn't give a
because she does not believe the truth
is a thing that matters truth is
obstacle to a political means not an end
and I'm itself and this is like we
should not cross over this as a
political media culture like that the
New York Times who has done great
journalism so this is not in a Pulitzer
Prize when he journalism I'm told but
their Twitter account today said in
announcing and breaking the news that
Rudy Giuliani has now informed the
people that Trump this in line they said
based off Trump's tweets this morning
that President Trump reversed his
position on whether he knew about the
tape about whether he reversed his
position on whether he paid Michael
coming back yes position on cutting
Medicaid you reverse your position on
tax deductions this is a lie and there
is a look like there is a debate I have
strong feelings on other people feel the
other way about whether reporters should
call out lies like is it a lie when Paul
Ryan says that the tax cuts to pay for
selves I think so yes others would say I
know yes others are wrong but they would
say well he believes a different view
than you do right the you don't this is
a why this is just a why Trump knew he
paid Michael Cohen and he told the
people that he did full stop and don't
be afraid but there are some lies it has
to be called out and we're treating this
like it's a policy disagreement we can't
do that
hi I didn't rob the bank Oh what really
there's video of you actually robbing
the bank
oh I reverse my position on whether I
robbed the bank cool cool so they're all
liars the New York Times was afraid that
natural app and get in a limo in
TweetDeck or something I don't know yeah
no I'm sure the White House
Correspondents Association will release
a new statement how about how upset they
are that the administration has been
lying to them about the president's
health and whether he paid off
former mistresses hush money for the
last year that's probably something
they're gonna be very upset about I
don't know if that's maybe maybe it
still is in the spirit of unity with
which they held that dinner I've been
sitting on my White House Correspondents
Association dinner takes for a week now
and I'm not gonna let them out now
because there are more things that it's
got but I will make one point yes
is molest the lesson here and always is
do not associate yourself with Trump and
his minions because you will always end
up being embarrassed all those people
who rose is there how can be Sanders
defense because though Michelle wolf was
mean to her now
look foolish because she has been lying
to that which was at the crux of 98% of
Michelle Wolf's riff on Sarah her
clearance was she's a liar and we were
proved yet again that she is a liar
don't tweet don't feel the need to
appease them just keep your mouth shut
and you and you will find out once again
that they did something wrong well look
I'm sure because they're gross I'm sure
because they rose to her defense that
the White House isn't gonna call them
fake news anymore I'm sure they've you
know they all their embrace now by the
three - welcome to pod save America live
stream
someday we'll figure out a name for this
what should we call it I don't know
send us your takes and it takes take
industrial complex what we're gonna give
you some takes we're gonna answer some
questions a lot in the news today and
we'll start with some Russia's stuff ooh
Russia stuff okay Jim asks Thai
 cob that's it there's no
question Jim kara has a bit more of a
question around the same thing she says
what are your thoughts on the tyke what
are your thoughts on Ty Cobb quitting
and Trump hiring Emmitt flood who
represented Clinton during his
impeachment preparing for the inevitable
perhaps any think Tommy well you know
Donald Trump goes through lawyers like
the rest of us go through an analogy
that's funny yeah I'm really sick today
I haven't slept I don't feel good
so it's hard to go through lawyers a lot
you go through a lot of hard to tell
lubbers it's hard to tell how much of
this is churn it's just like it's a
nightmare working for this guy I mean Ty
Cobb statement was like he put off
orthopedic procedures which I don't know
I don't take him at face value that
seems significant I mean he's had
nothing but document review for the last
several months of his life there is a
sense that you know this is signaling a
shift to a far more combative approach
to the mahler investigation we'll see he
goes through lawyers like he goes
through mistresses oh that's a great one
there you go Elisha rewind the
livestream we just I had some time oh
it's life got it it's funny because last
month or the month before near times in
Washington Post of course reported that
Ty Cobb was gonna like Trump on a fire
tech hub they Trump honor to fire John
Dowd yeah tweeted and Jay Sekulow
complete fake news nothing I love my
team and now two of the three gun
apparently Ty Cobb was the lawyer on the
team who very much counseled cooperation
with Muller as much as possible Trump is
now not in a cooperative mood he doesn't
want to cooperate with Muller so I guess
he wants lawyers on his
who want to fight the mauler
investigation as opposed to cooperate
with it even though it's hard to know
that means I don't know what that
illegal contact yeah we were just
talking with us at lunch like this whole
the media now the big question is like
will Trump sit for an interview with
Muller or not to me this is like a
pretty simple question there's no way
that Trump is voluntarily gonna sit down
with Muller it sounds like at this point
he used to want oh now he doesn't really
knows these questions are out there his
team of lawyers continues to tell him
not to sit down but Muller if he doesn't
get Trump to voluntarily sit down it's
just gonna issue a subpoena right and
then Trump's either gonna comply with
the subpoena which Bill Clinton did and
that's why Bill Clinton sat for grand
jury testimony or Trump's go to not
comply with the subpoena in which case
mother's gonna take it to the Supreme
Court and then we're gonna get a Supreme
Court decision on whether Trump has to
comply with the subpoena or not right
there's weird like you can negotiate
some sort of middle ground which for
Bill Clinton was a videotaped deposition
to the grand jury that was done at the
White House not going to the courtroom I
don't know if in the long run they think
that was a good decision or not you've
heard himself so probably not it's like
lives on YouTube forever I mean I'm not
sure I'd want that out there or they
accused him of perjury John you don't
get it I'm not letting you do better
Lucas here so we'll see yet you look we
don't know what Muller knows although
the fact that like Trump's a lawyer
summary of what they believe to be the
49 questions Bob Muller will ask would
make me very nervous if I were them this
is a broad expansive Dinos yet deeply
unnerving investigation for Joe Charles
Reddington asks has anyone in the
history of government been more corrupt
than Scott Pruett he makes me ashamed to
be from Oklahoma but then again so did
the politics of this state good question
shot from Oklahoma great state yeah you
got the Thunder
you got fracking fracking related
earthquakes a couple things yeah look I
think there's probably people in the
history of government that have been
more corrupt than Scott Pruett but not
by a lot not by a lot there's now 11
separate investigations into Scott
Pruitt there's so many stories about
Scott wrote that I get annoyed when we
see them come up in the feed because I'm
like I don't know how to keep track of
all this I guess the thing today was the
the wife of the lobbyist was so that
this lobbyist wife rented out the
apartment to Pruitt for a discounted
rate and now we find out that Pruitt was
giving the lobbyists pals special
treatment or at the EPA giving them
positions at the EPA there was also some
lobbyists buddy he took with him on a
government trip to Morocco the lobbyists
planned his hundred thousand dollar trip
to Morocco which included a night in
Paris 16 grand for his airfare like it's
and then as a thank you the Moroccan
government hired the lobbyist friend as
a foreign agent who registered his
morning to get hired into his life so I
should note that uh Oklahoma had a
badass teacher walk out okay here's
Oklahoma that's a fourth thing put that
ahead of fracking related earthquakes
Scott Pruitt like I try to ask Jake
Tapper about this in our interview on
Monday which is Scott Prue does the
example of this person who's defied the
political laws of gravity like he has
had enough scandals to kill off an
entire cabinet let alone one guy kill
off I mean politically like make them
get fired but as somehow survived I
think he's probably survived because the
big fossil fuel backed industries like
lobbying associations the Koch brothers
they all want a mistakes he's kind of
doing their bidding although there's
also been reports that he's not really
very effectively doing their bidding so
it's hard to know what to believe here
but Trump should fired this guy done
month ago yeah I think the broad
contours of the prude scandal are he
used his public office for private gain
he wasted taxpayer dollars on for
himself like first-class travel and
hiring his own political cronies and
been making a sound proof phone
booth which I still can't get an
explanation at why what is it
why does he need sound proof everything
what does scott pruett talking about
that he doesn't want anyone to hear him
probably all of his crimes I just want
to note that Barry Sanders played at
Oklahoma State and the book The
Outsiders was set in
Oklahoma Pizza okay we really did thanks
Michael digging deep and let's not
forget also everyone in the EPA who was
a whistleblower who was trying to tell
Pruitt don't waste all this money don't
do all these corrupt things he fired so
he's also punishing people for trying to
catch him in his crime his goons are
like you better not say anything and
then he lied about it on Fox News is
blatantly lying it's not a great epa
administrator sucks it's nice anyway and
then deborah asses sort of a follow up
how can we help the crazy swamp
kleptocracy stories get more attention
keep talking about him keep talking
about them this will be a great thing I
think for various in indivisible groups
to organize around and create events
around I don't have the exact messaging
but like if you live in a state that's
not necessarily you know if you want to
appeal the local press and you want to
do an event about your groups
frustration with corruption in the Trump
administration I think that's a great
message it's a really smart idea will
and organize them around issues the
issues that in the policies that these
cabinet secretaries have an impact on
you know I mean there's a million awful
things happening at the EPA and while
those things are happening the EPA
administrators enriching himself
Ryan Zinke is like wasting taxpayer
money for you know private first class
flights and all that and he's
also trying to sell off all this public
land and you know Betsy DeVos is just
bad is bad because what's happening in
education in the country so close the
loops each of these cabinet secretaries
should be in charge of policy that
really affects people's lives in big
ways and they are not paying attention
to that policy instead they're just
corrupted enriching themselves so I
think we're gonna draw those draw those
lines
Katherine asks how crucial is joe
Manchin's West Virginia Senate seat for
Democrats what happens if it flips is
Don Blankenship actually a river monster
in a suit yes today it's very very
crucial mansions West Virginia see I
just ask you a couple questions about
the Blankenship thing so he called
McConnell's wife a China person the
China American no he said that
McConnell's
married to a woman whose father is a
wealthy China person and then he said so
he called him cocaine Mitch Cole Kane
Mitch and also when he was said when
someone who I am
hey maybe it's a slightly racist to call
someone kind a person he said no no I'm
an America / s'en there are Korea
persons and there are African persons
appear that he's a piece of look he
also ran to mine because of his
negligence people died he lunch pieces
and now he wants to be their senator
this guy's like an Avengers movie of
 like how pleased West Virginia
come on I know I mean he is he's not
winning in the primary right now and
again after Donald Trump I'm not one of
these people who's like I hope Don
Blankenship wins the briber because he's
so bad no one could know he should lose
and he should be out of politics forever
mansions West Virginia seat is
incredibly important we to to regain
control of the Senate we need to flip
two seats but that's only if we hold
every seat where a Democrat is up and
they are up in some of the toughest
states West Virginia Indiana Missouri
and Indiana and North Dakota those occur
and so we need mention if we if Manchin
loses then Democrats need to flip three
seats and we only have four targets of
seats to flip Arizona Nevada Tennessee
and Texas and so and it's gonna be hard
to do all four but we also have
basically four seats which are really
vulnerable West Virginia North Dakota
Indiana in Missouri and so we need we
need Joe Manchin in the Senate and look
Joe mentioned drives us crazy with some
of his positions but Joe mentioned voted
the right way when it came time to
Republicans trying to repeal the
Affordable Care Act
he voted the right way on opposing the
tax cut so he votes the right way and a
whole bunch of issues that are important
and he votes a bad way on other issues
and it seems like he's resisted like a
half dozen attempts to get him to come
into the Trump cabinet so yeah which is
good he's that our kids good we just we
need them someday if someone can run a
more progressive candidate in West
Virginia to be senator I'll be right
there I'll be all for that person you
don't know we got Joe Manchin you don't
love everyone at the table at
Thanksgiving but you you know you know
why they're there you appreciate them
that's right through their because they
have to because they're family that's
Joe
[Laughter]
David asked your favorite Democrats
running for Congress Senate and governor
maybe some names we don't hear that
often also your favorite Democratic
senators and vulnerable Senate seats
were running for that's a good question
as you know we love better O'Rourke
probably our favorite candidate cycle
running in Texas Stacey Abrams is
someone I'd like to talk about who's
been on the pod she's running for
governor in Georgia she would be the
first african-american woman governor in
the country in history
she's very exciting he's got a great
campaign going on there who else I hate
listing names because then I just get
yelled at for the people I didn't list
and I get told I'm problematic and then
to do better so I don't want to with
someone I'm very excited about the
candidates we have out there we met a
lot of the more excited me a lot more
yeah and once the primaries are over
we're gonna be able to get more of those
candidates on the pot we're trying not
to put our thumb on the scale and a lot
of these primaries because we know that
Democrats should make their own choices
and not do what we say but yeah it's a
good field I can do my favorite
Democratic senator and a vulnerable
Senate seat do it sherrod Brown yeah not
as vulnerable as before we just
mentioned like but you know Trump won
Ohio by quite a bit in 2016 but I love
sherrod cuz you know we've known him
forever
my wife worked for him but also he is in
a deep red state now he used to be a
swing state it's pretty red state honey
red but red and he is as progressive as
he's always been
he's not one of these senators who's
running towards the middle right towards
the center changing his positions cuz
he's in a tough race he is trying to win
this race being who he is which is
sherrod Brown a very progressive very
liberal senator which you know we
appreciate Claire McCaskill is great too
because she just yeah again someone who
I don't always agree with on policy but
always says what she thinks and says it
in plain blunt English which she's
trying we need more of that she tries
and she is who she is you know and so
appreciate that Stephanie asks messaging
why are Democrats so bad at it it was in
all caps there was an exclamation point
Stephanie come on
tune in for my podcast we're not coming
this summer John's gonna talk about this
whole lot
but I yeah I don't I look there's a
there's clearly a problem with messaging
breaking through some of that might be
Democrats who have been in Washington
too long who talk like they're on the
Senate floor all the time and they're
just reading their consultants
poll-tested speak and some of it is the
message is just not breaking through
because I was traveling circus every
single day and we can barely keep up
with the Trump news let alone what
Democrats are out there say yeah so
Democrats have two challenges one is to
make sure that they are speaking like
they are human beings and not robots and
the other is to figure out a way to have
that message break through yeah
the other thing to remember is in the
midterm election it's going to be a
referendum on Trump and then these
individual members or I'm sorry these
individual candidates and congressional
districts and Senate seats and whatever
else are gonna run a campaign tailored
to their constituents needs and
interests in their own states when we
get through 2018 when we start going to
a primary process then you're going to
start having like party focused
messengers out there sort of carrying a
broader message for the country and
that's when we all really need to
sharpen it and make sure it's improving
and it will break through because it has
to I mean they have to cover that way so
yeah and Kenneth s have follow-up there
I feel like the zeitgeist is losing
focus from day to day with all the crazy
 that's thrown our way I know I do
often can you talk about some pillars of
progressive messaging to help the
hashtag blue what if 2018
easy answer here health care and tax cut
yeah and if you look at a lot of these
campaigns you won't hear in the news
because the news is filled with Trump
craziness but if you look in a lot of
these campaigns whether it was the one
that was just run in Arizona whether it
was Connor lambs in Pennsylvania all of
these candidates whether they're
centrist left senator left are all
talking about health care and taxes hmm
and we had some real help with that this
week by Tom Price another disgraced
Trump cabinet secretary coming out and
saying that the repeal of the individual
mandate will make people pay more for
health care thanks for telling us that
now yeah price and Marco Rubio saying
that the corporate tax cut that they
passed isn't helping working people so
let's just let's pause there use that
let's pause on Marco for a minute Marco
 Rubio
found some intellectual honesty in a lot
it really yeah in a conversation with
the economist highfalutin Marco where he
admitted that the Ryan Trump tax cut did
not trickle down to workers almost very
very very few people have gotten bonuses
and most of it went to stock buybacks
which is when companies buy back a whole
bunch of their shares to help prop up
the price of their stock you know who
that benefits really rich people who own
a lot of stock not your average workers
so Marco admits something that is
self-evident if you look at the
statistics because financial reporters
and others have been you know detailing
this since the tax cut passed and then
today of course under pressure from
Republicans he walked back his blip of
candor because he is a spineless hack
said oh no I said that the the tax cut
was unbalanced good for the American
worker and but it just it could have
been a little better and so someone at
Politico wrote that out and what they
did to write this up was they used his
words they used his words in the
Economist and then they used his words
in the walk back and then a very cranky
Marco Rubio decided to tweet that story
out and say attacking the reporter yeah
tacking the reporter for being an intern
and then whining a whole bunch more
about why no one takes him seriously
which is self-evident at this point so
that takes care of our next question was
could you please give a few minute rant
about Rubio so we did that I'm ahead of
my time John Emily asks how about the
South man bail stuff this guy
let's let's dig into it let's start from
the beginning so he B Netanyahu so Bibi
Netanyahu first of all the Mossad the
Israeli intelligence agency figured out
that there was a warehouse full of
documents related to Iran's nuclear
program over the years historical
documents in a ballsy impressive brazen
successful intelligence operation they
went and they got them all and extracted
them and brought them back super badass
impressive good for them it's exactly
what you want the intelligence community
to do they went through those and then
net
Yahoo Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel
decided to do a big primetime
presentation like PowerPoint slides
whatever to detail what those documents
said now don't take my word for it
George Bush's CIA director Michael
Hayden called them basically nothing
Berger old news
not fake news old news and they're in
but the reason it's relevant is because
Netanyahu did this because the president
of France and the president of Germany
the leaders of France and Germany had
just been in Washington trying to
convince Trump to keep the Iran deal and
Jake Tapper welcome to plaid save
America okay I'm a little nervous
I will admit having been on the other
end welcome Thank You Tommy
welcome to Thunderdome oh no it's love
it's here what's gonna happen this is
your first time although you were a
frequent guest I'm keeping at 1,600 back
in the day I would I would appear I
can't believe we haven't had you on
punset marriage well I have an out here
I have an hour do I mean do we need to
provide for the listener any context
that I will just say that I was a huge
pain in your butts for eight to ten
years I don't know you're talking about
how we had very pleasant exchanges we
called you the softie go out there you
go yes Jake any any Trump administration
official listening who thinks Jake is
too mean to them just know that one time
Jake and I got an argument so heated
that someone looped in his wife to calm
us both down yeah they're under I mean
that's not including when Gibbs and I
were gonna meet each other outside by
the North long physical fight literally
was gonna win those when those emails
are fired
we were going to meet each other out by
this by the North Lawn yeah I think it's
who got the first one in honestly I
think it's a luck of the draw and I'll
say this Gibbs is meaner so I think he
might have won the fight he would have
just gone right in and hit in the face
before I did it could do anything all
bark no bite Robert do you think you
know that let's talk about the White
House Correspondents Dinner that ruined
America on Saturday um so the
Correspondents Association said when
they invited Michelle wolf that they
liked that she speaks truth to power and
then last night they put out a statement
saying that her monologue was not in the
spirit of their mission what did you
think of where'd you think of that
statement and what did you think of the
dinner I mean my general first of all
she made fun of me and nobody is out
there defending me which is very hurtful
she did a whole thing about me and what
what what well I think that I think it's
the kind of joke yeah she made fun of
you but she sort of singled you out as
someone she liked she wasn't as mean to
me as Obama was if that's what you mean
Obama's Joe would love it you mean
Lovitz joe Lovitz joke that Obama
with actually again similarly here it's
a little tough it's one really well I
really the first draft of the joke was
just it just said F Jake Tapper five
times
anylock knock the podium over and their
leader a magician I don't know how you
got Lovett to talk about it's a previous
correspondent speech triumph adrenalin
oh this is so I will let me say this I'm
not like the comedy police I'm not gonna
come in here and tell you which jokes
are laughed at which ones I thought
weren't appropriate some of them I
laughed at some of them I didn't but I
will say this I have been trying to have
on my show a conversation about decency
for the last two and a half three years
about what is appropriate to say in the
public sphere and what is not
appropriate to say in the public sphere
and the position the times I've like
taken positions on my show because I
don't take positions on tax reform or
immigration or the wall or North Korea
whatever stuff you guys take positions I
don't do that but I do try to take a
position on facts and I do try to take a
position on decency so we've been having
this conversation for two and a half
three years if the Trump White House and
Trump supporters in the media want to
have this conversation now about decency
I welcome them to the table but they've
got some catching up to do before we get
to a comedian at the White House
Correspondents Association dinner we
have discussions to have about the way
that women are talked about the way that
women women's faces are talked about
Carly fiorina's face about the way that
disabled people people with disabilities
are referred to just a few weeks ago the
president made a Driss of comment about
one of his own former aides with an
alcohol and drug dependency issue I mean
if we're gonna talk about decency I'm
all for it and and Michelle wolf can be
part of that conversation but there's
there's really there's really a big
backup of material before we get to that
yeah there's there's the I agree with
you on the decency to be like Trump
should apologize to surge Kowalewski
whom he made fun of for having a
disability because real denies it you
still deny so like there's that gas
legging that goes on but I think I think
one of the things that people love about
your show you're reporting is that
you're not a big euphemism guy you don't
sit up there and accuse people
dissembling or stating falsehoods you
say you're lying and I wish more
journalists did that I wish more people
spoke the
way Michelle Williams did at the
Correspondents Dinner oh sorry mister I
wish more journalist poked away Michelle
wolf dated the Correspondents Dinner and
spoke truth to power and and didn't
fudge it for us isn't that what we want
out of journalism is that what a First
Amendment event should celebrate yeah I
mean I think I think the lie reference
to Sara hander singer Sanders and the
smoky eye which I had to look up by the
way I don't know what I didn't know what
it was I got it's never any gay people
to put me you got it immediately you
know what a smoky eye was yes I knew
what a smoky eye was I didn't have any
friends in high school I found out what
a smoky little black just sort of a nice
you know what we'll do with it later
people tweeted Tommy what a smoky eye
it's like I'm like kind of like it's
just like a way of doing the makeup so
there's kind of like kind of dark around
the eye the smoky eye wasn't necessarily
the insult the insult was the Kardashian
the insult was the reference to aunt
Lydia on have you looked at a picture
aunt Lydia okay you don't think that she
was also making the comparison that they
look a little bit alike you don't think
that was part of it I think that was
part undoubted okay so and then also the
female softball coach I mean she was
look she thinks she was making jokes
about how Sarah Sanders looks I mean I
think she was more important where the
jokes she was making about how Sarah
Sanders conducts herself or I mean but
she was making jokes about how serious
and has lost Sarah Sanders looks I don't
know why we would pretend otherwise and
look I mean that's not my cup of tea but
at the same time again I find it
difficult to get upset about what a
comedian says in a dinner that you know
a couple million people watch versus a
tone that is being set nationally by the
President of the United States the van
Jones who you guys know and respect has
this thing he talks about about how a
president is a spiritual leader whether
he wants to be or not that he talks
about how John F Kennedy inspired people
to join the Peace Corps he talks about
how Ronald Reagan inspired people to go
to Wall Street I would add he probably
Reagan probably also inspired people to
join the military Barack Obama for all
the criticisms and tough coverage I
provider of Barack Obama there's no
question that he inspired millions of
people recruited for Isis
[Laughter]
just provided Fox and Friends their lead
to that no there's no way there's no way
that he didn't inspire millions of
people on on issues having to do with
race and issues of having to be a good
father and that sort of thing it's
inevitable it just is
presidents inspire people that way look
at the outpouring that Barbara Bush
people legitimately moved by Barbara
Bush and her being a tough broad I mean
that in the best possible way decades
before that was cool unacceptable even
if you didn't like what she stand for
whatever Donald Trump is a spiritual
leader and just the question is what is
the leadership should be where is he
where is he leading people what like
what is what is the example being said
and I see a lot of people being led and
have been a way that is indecent and his
mean I guess my my the most annoying
take from that dinner for me was that
you hate the dinner to begin with like
if you saw those jokes and you even find
them funny that's fine if you thought
some of them are too mean that's fine -
everyone's tellin everybody no big deal
sure leapin from that - like this gave
Donald Trump such a political gift
seemed a little odd to me well I mean I
think like do you think that like Trump
voters anywhere in the country they were
like on the edge and then they saw
Michelle wolf and like that's it now
it's really a fake news media because
this comedian got up there and told
jokes well I mean it's one of the things
that you get when you're outside of
Washington DC or if you still aren't
drinking the water which is which is
there is an over inflation of our own
importance and how much people are
actually paying attention to any of this
and the truth of the matter is that that
not very many people saw it not that
many people care the people don't bring
it up and you know at the end of the day
people are going about their business
and they care much more about you know
health care or the economy or jobs or
North Korea or whatever than they do
about a comedian and that's just that's
just true one way or the other and by
the way we do have this discussion every
year about whether or not so-and-so
comedian went too far every year we have
this discussion I mean Larry Wilmore the
guy last year I forget his name I'm
gonna yeah and and every year there's a
discussion of well they're under Bush
Colbert under Bush that was yeah people
like and then they overcorrected they
had
rich little the next year I was not good
yeah I mean I guess for me does a great
impression of people who are no longer
Larsen his Nixon is great you gotta give
them that I guess that's how I know
Nixon Wendell Willkie what a Haldeman he
does but I guess to me I was I think
there's this decency debate that also
feels shallow to me because it almost
feels like in the same way that you know
a pg-13 movie becomes an arm movie if
you say three times but you can
have the most vulgar and crass and
disgusting violence and issues in all of
it raised before you get to that R
rating and some of that room full of
people describing her using the word
 or an insulting joke about Tara
Huckabee Sanders as indecent Timmy feels
like a childish definition of indecent
right like that was my problem like okay
some jokes crossed the line but you
understand that that the conduct of
these people regardless of the words
they use even regardless of the insults
is indecent in a larger way like it
almost feels as though that room is not
capable of actually seeing the level
it's it's it almost like that that
attacking michelle wolf is to pretend we
live in a more decent world than we do
yeah i mean look i take your point and i
don't disagree that the idea that that
the word is being used is so
shocking today when the reason the word
has been mainstreamed in any degree to
any degree is because President Trump
was on tape saying that he would grab
women by the in because he was a
celebrity he could get away with it I
mean that that that is much more
shocking than the word the word
you know the word is a curse word or
whatever and you get in trying to make
sure my kids are if they're listening
that you know how to use that word but
but but but the ID but the act of
grabbing women even if he wasn't talking
about that body party if it's talking on
anybody part their shoulder whatever
that is offensive that is much more
offensive and I agree that there's a
forest for the trees things that happens
in Washington but it's eminently
predictable Conor lamb won an extremely
conservative district and I don't think
he ran as conservative or too
right as people think he did what
traditional double yeah western
Pennsylvania pro-union
pro-gun very heavy I mean pretty it's
either at the center of the party or
even left on economic issues especially
that type that type is very familiar to
Pennsylvanians the you know like a like
a Bob Casey Democrat conservative on a
lot of social issues but ultimately when
it comes to economic issues really about
unions and paychecks and that that is a
way to win but tell me who represents
that Joe Biden well I mean that's
exactly we're gonna have to see who runs
and what they say like I don't think all
these people's positions are fully
formed was not a person you're talking
about a platform you're talking about
will the democratic party have a set of
policies and a an agenda that appeals to
the people you're talking about that can
win in Pennsylvania and I think that's a
challenge but I think it's a solvable
challenge the only names that I've heard
that fit that and it's just it's early
yet but the only names that I hear that
they're like that are like sherrod Brown
who still has to where he has to win it
reelection first and maybe Bullock from
Montana and has Pennsylvania changed and
you're from Pennsylvania is Pennsylvania
changed that much since 2012 when Barack
Obama won there hano no like you know
and I think think of all of the
commentary back in oh eight when Obama
was losing to Hillary and the primary
and Pennsylvania when people like oh
he's never gonna win Pennsylvania well I
never thought that because it's because
but I then again I never thought that I
would I would live to see a Republican
win Pennsylvania again cuz I thought it
was I thought it was just trend I mean I
always have something I was nineteen
when a Republican I'm almost I'm forty
nine now I was nineteen when a
Republican last one Pennsylvania and
then Trump on it and and no it hasn't
changed that much it's just there are a
lot of you know this there are a lot of
working-class people who feel like
Washington is just shut them out for the
last 30 years and Obama may cling to
their guns and religion just repeating
the line the Hellfire Club you know what
it was the word cling that was the
problem yeah you can say it was not they
turned to he'll say that or they find
comfort
right anyway anyway but but I don't know
I mean but this is also the argument
when when people talk about talk to me
when when Hillary Clinton speaks in
India about how Donald Trump won and the
idea that like 200 American counties
that voted for Obama twice turned to
Donald Trump because there was like this
racial racist awakening is nonsense to
me and you end to you people to you guys
doing I think that I think that's too
easy I think that's too easy to say that
it's nonsense I think that that that
Donald Trump may have had the ability to
kind of reorganize voters and to make
racial grievance more salient and that
doesn't well he made explicit racial
appeals that Mitt Romney the John McCain
refused to make and so it is hard to
rerun an election with Trump as the
Republican candidate in O eight and
twelve I mean I you know but the
question is if you're talking about the
ten percent of the voters who switched
or whatever it is five percent of the
Verizon accounting where those people
switch from voting for Obama twice
because Mitt Romney and John McCain
refused to be racist and we're not
racist and suddenly this guy was racist
so they went from voting for Obama twice
to voting for a well so it's it's
complicated because it might not be a
completely race a lot of it is
anti-immigrant sentiment too and there I
think there were some people who voted
for Obama twice who still were
uncomfortable with immigration and too
many immigrants in this but because but
Obama was able to straddle the issue and
McCain and Romney didn't make a huge
deal of it and Trump did and this might
have activated that much again but it's
it's also like I think there's so many
different reasons for this all right
it's economic some of its racial if it's
anti-immigrant think to make it one
simple explanation right is but Hillary
Clinton those comments in India I think
were problematic because they did tend
to simplifying it to a degree and let me
just also say that the same day that
there was coverage of her her comments
in India there was that story about 4
million obama voters not voting right
and a third of them were black and like
that's your 80,000 vote margin right
there right and that's like the other
argument to what you're saying with
pennsylvania is like maybe the path is
to get someone that can drastically
boost turn
out in Philadelphia and other parts and
get the bass more excited and get
Millennials were excited I think it's a
bunch of ways we can do this I think we
the the focus of what happened last time
hasn't been entirely honest from white
working-class communities in places like
outside Pittsburgh and there's a other
pass to win that we're the margin you're
talking about because I mean Moe as you
know Obama lost most counties in
Pennsylvania he just won the most
populous but but Trump just drove up the
margins it would win counties 70/30 as
opposed you know that ones that Obama
lost 55 45 I tend to think it's gonna be
a mix between getting back some of the
people who voted for Obama in 8 and 12
and then didn't vote in 2016 who were
disproportionately young and
african-american and people of color and
women and getting back some of the Obama
Trump voters who are you know have less
polarizing racial attitudes than maybe
some other Trump voters yeah but wanted
but thought that Washington had sold
them out right I think so I think it's
some of but I think it's probably an
abuse um of both but Bhama thought that
Washington sold voters out on trade
deals I mean that was part of his I mean
I was airing o7o and I think I think an
anti Washington message is going to be
very important and for whichever
Democrat runs which is why I think you
know some of these governors some people
who haven't been in Washington long or
probably will see how about I will say
this I mean Donald Trump you know as you
guys know better than anyone you
underestimate him at your own peril I
mean he has political gifts in his
political skills and and he has a way of
becoming of being anti Washington I mean
it's always funny when presidents or
sitting senators or congressmen run
against Washington but Donald Trump yeah
you know that's been his whole thing
Washington's out to get him he hates it
the deep stayed all this stuff I mean
he's gonna lay a claim to that that's
gonna be a lot easier than Barack Obama
being anti Washington in 2012 yeah yeah
I think I think one of the big lessons
you know you all the ways of slicing and
dicing I think obviously important but
to me like stepping back whether it's
people who didn't turn out for Hillary
who otherwise would have or people who
switched from Obama to Trump I think one
of the lessons we took away from it
early on at least I did was we need to
stop saying that people feel left behind
and start saying that people are left
behind right and I think that Trump woke
people up to just how damaged
people's relationship to their
government
pod Jake Tapper Hellfire Club I feel
like that's a nickname for what the
Washington press corps is trying to do
to Michelle wolf yeah you got it
you got it Jake was here in studio
earlier today it was such a great
conversation it went a little long and
we're just gonna make it most of the pot
he was like a co-host today yeah we had
a great time with Jake well look it's
good to get a rookie broadcaster in the
room first Simon they that you know he's
a natural he was like a duck to water
yeah that Jake Tapper you know he could
uh he could relate to one of those
terribly offensive jokes about Sarah how
could be Sanders because Jake is famous
for throwing softballs isn't the joke
there that it's the opposite like yeah
so we're good we're good
he has tough questions so we're we're
not looks like a meadow we're not
Michelle wolfing you you got some
tickets to lover leave it everyone go in
the website oh yeah go to this is the
last chance to get tickets for the
Pittsburgh Baltimore and Columbus shows
that are this weekend they can be
awesome we're gonna do a special show
about social media and that'll be in
Columbus and in Baltimore and then we
have a great show lined up for
Pittsburgh too so get some tickets
I think Pittsburgh may be sold-out but I
don't know fantastic this weekend
weekend and we had an awesome love
relieve with Larry Wilmore and grace
Parra and Paul downs and Travis Hellwig
did a rant
neguin for Assad was there as delightful
delightful okay comedian Michelle wolf
destroyed journalism and really like the
Donald Trump on Saturday night by making
jokes about the fact that his White
House press secretary lies every day did
I pretty much get that right yeah sounds
about yeah come on so Michelle told some
jokes Michelle who was a guest I love
her leave it friend of the PAS friend of
the pot delightful delightful a
wonderful comedian incredibly funny
credibly talented we all just actually
watched it for the first time in the
office she made jokes about the press to
make jokes but reporters matrix but
Hillary Clinton about Democrats Trump
Trump's staff Kelly and Conway Sarah
Huckabee Sanders that was the subject of
all the consternation
so she makes these jokes the Trump jokes
and the Huckabee jokes they piss off
some Republican
it all sort of kicks off on Twitter
Saturday night with match slap the head
of CPAC who tweeted my wife Mercedes
slap and I walked out early from the
White House Correspondents Dinner enough
of elites mocking all of us he is a coke
brothers lobbyist who left ten minutes
early and then went to the after-party
which is actually just like a smart move
yeah get out of there early get to the
after parties Sean Spicer said it was a
disgrace who I intakes when he takes one
to know one
so that was all fine that that I also
respect of course they're gonna do that
but then all the reporters jumped in and
they were very upset Peter Baker said
unfortunately I don't think we advanced
the cause of journalism tonight Jeff
sell and he agreed it was an
embarrassment in the room and surely to
the audience at home Mika presents key
Andrea Mitchell said that Michelle wolf
owes an apology to sarah huckabee
sanders crystal is is very upset what
what do you guys make of all this I'm so
sick of us pretending that were shocked
by these jokes every single year look I
get it if you're if you know someone
personally even if you don't like them
and someone says something to them that
kind of is mean about their appearance
or whatnot it's totally fine to be
personally offended by that it is
ludicrous to pretend that this dinner is
about the First Amendment it is not it
is a Hollywood meets Washington
circle-jerk
of self-importance and coziness that is
long ago outlived its welcome in our
political space and you can't though say
that this is about the First Amendment
and then say but your joke was to mean
if you don't see the obvious
contradiction there you're an idiot and
on top of that like so okay if your
issue is you know we talked about this
with Jake as well if your issue is it's
basic decency and that Trump doesn't
treat people well and we should call him
out for it we should call this comedian
for doing so - that's fine by me but
like give me a break that we shouldn't
call it these people for lying brazenly
for a living every day and getting
famous and making money down the road
off it give me a goddamn break
yeah look it wasn't she spoke for 18
minutes and it's great was a tight set
sometimes people go too long too long
but I thought you know and so there's
this quiz oh it was crass or it was or
it was vulgar in some way well you know
she's talking about a vulgar and crass
administration we're talking about
pornstars which is talking about
grabbing people by the she is
using the words of the president that
deserved to be called out now and so
there was a bunch of right-wing people
that were like oh was vulgar and crafts
beyond measure okay guys give us a break
we know what you defend every single day
we know what Sean Spicer defended every
day the kind of personal attacks he look
about all these people are ridiculous
now if you want to isolate to Sara
Huckabee Sanders jokes that there is a
debate about whether they may have in
some way been at least partially
referencing her opinions is that that if
that is ultimately what we're talking
about an 18-minute set of jokes about
literally everyone democrat and
republican reporters and politicians
everybody and you want to say okay two
of these jokes to my mind may have gone
too far that's that's what we're gonna
debate for two days that's why the White
House Correspondents Association is
issuing an apology that's why Axios is
saying that Donald Trump won the evening
cuz you're saying maybe two jokes out of
what a hundred jokes may have in some
way reference a person's appearance a
woman who works for a person who insults
people based on their appearance every
single day yeah like here's
where it went over the line for me if
you do not like a joke that is fine if
you don't think a joke is funny no big
deal if you think a joke is mean that's
fine too everyone's entitled to their
opinion to say that joke wasn't funny
that jokes mean we're drives me
nuts is that we go from people offering
their opinions about the jokes to saying
that this is giving Trump a win that
this is not advancing the cause of
journalism when the was the last
time we advanced the cause of journalism
at a White House Correspondents Dinner
never it has never advance the cause of
dude didn't also um yeah right like in
some of the Trump some Trump officials
or the spouses of Trump officials
stormed out and said they were done
being mocked by elites you are the
elites yeah she was the comedian was
speaking on behalf of the rest of the
country that is sick of your lying
 and for journalists to rally
around them and not speaking truth and
to cling to their euphemisms drives me
crazy in like by the way Donald Trump
was in Michigan where he gave a ranting
hour and fifteen minute tirade where
they chanted lock her up and he
threatened to Burleigh
secret dirt on the united states senator
like there are more important things to
be offended about washington but yeah
we're on day seven of this idiocy I
can't it is so embarrassing for the
White House Correspondents Association
to have invited her to invited Michelle
wolf they knew her comedy they you can
see it on Netflix they know and
when they invited her they put out a
statement praising her truth to power
style and said and Margo tells that her
quote feminist edge make her the voice
right now and then last night this is
what the statement says the program was
meant to offer a unifying message about
our common commitment to a vigorous
press and and the speaker did not do the
speaker's message was not unifying it's
like well you are the press though it's
it's not the prep the press is job is
not to host an event that is
unifying their job is to report the
facts their goal is the truth their goal
is not unity their goal is not civility
and their goal is not to persuade
Republicans that their objective their
goal is to be objective this is the
difference is like they they cannot get
out of this mindset that their job is to
come off as balanced above all else
there's not their job when you have a
ganker truth when you have a gangrenous
limb the goal is not to unify with it is
to get it off it's the obsession you
know like it just goes to show that like
working the refs works we're
conservative Republicans have been
working the refs for decades now and
they have done a fantastic job because
in the reporters Minds all the time in
way too many Western reporters Minds is
this ideal like I have to be very
careful because I do not want to be seen
as biased that is that's the worst the
thing that offended me the most of this
weekend Rose scrolling through Twitter
or looking at their an email and and
someone just shoved a photo of the mooch
and Michael avenatti storm and Daniels's
lawyer or like with you know bumming
around together like one was like
holding the other and has fists up like
he was a boxer that chumminess that you
have an idiot who worked in Washington
for ten days before he got canned you
have a lawyer who's just like loves to
be on TV and they come together and they
find common ground at this celebration
of self-importance like that drives
me crazy that is why people hate
Washington it's not because someone told
a mean joke it is because it because P
it makes people at home
watch these cable news shows where
everyone's yelling at each other and
they yell at each other on cable and
these on these new shows and then they
see them at the correspondent Center and
they're all buddy-buddy no hospital so
it was the whole thing a act
like do you not really believe the
things that you're saying on TV because
you're all buddy-buddy z-- now it's also
uh Michelle wolf like okay she used some
vulgar language she made some vulgar
references that's actually it's not her
what she had her message what she was
addressing kind of the spirit of what
she said wasn't vulgar at all she had a
kind of you know there's a morality to
what she was saying there's a kind of an
ethic to her jokes about speaking truth
to power about pointing out hypocrisy
pointing out lies pointing out people
who are not serving their country who
are doing the wrong thing all the time
Washington right now is vulgar our
political culture is vulgar and crafts
and broken and disgusting it's
disgusting what's happening in
Washington is gross beyond measure every
single day and the fact that there's a
roomful of people who wanted to put on
tuxedos and nice dresses and pretend
that wasn't true for a night I'm sorry
that this comedian shook you from that
I'm sorry that that you wanted to
pretend that we were still in 2012 when
we had a president who was a decent
human being and you could take a joke
without losing his who was
respectable but we're not
I've been we've all been to the dinner
like there was a definitely time where I
thought okay there's some value to
bringing together people who wouldn't
necessarily talk and you like you have a
drink with the guy who works for Paul
Ryan or a reporter you don't know very
well and you like you connect on a
different level that actually makes that
next interaction you have on email or on
the phone better there's there's actual
value that there's not value to
Washington being perceived as or
actually circling the wagons and the way
Lovett said and defending itself it's
like this little organism that it's like
defending off reality at all costs and
it's just it should upset people and
just and one more note on handed Trump a
win a hand in trembling of know you go
 if any of voter out there it was
like you know what I was thinking about
voting against Donald Trump in 2020 but
then that comedian made fun of his press
secretary at the dinner with the
reporters and now I am for him I am for
Donald Trump that is the most
 patronizing view of voters in
this country coming from reporters who
think that this hands Donald Trump a
political win is how you know it's how
you launder kissing Sarah Huckabee
Sanders is ass through the guise of some
analysis that's based on no evidence you
think that little of voters they don't
need anything of voters they don't have
any opinion about it is a bunch of
people while it crystal ball always
these are all people are you talking
these are all people pretending to have
an opinion they're all looking around
and looking they're looking around and
thinking I know what I should think
right now it's not what they think maybe
they didn't like some of the jokes maybe
they didn't like the other dress the
notion that these people were offended
is made up it's nonsense
oh these poor people these poor people
they're there they're there their
delicate sensibilities they couldn't
handle the jokes they don't give a
they don't give a this is nonsense
and this is the White House
Correspondents Dinner is now a zombie it
died when Barack Obama left office and
then they then all of a sudden everybody
was sleeping in their beds and they
thought they were safe and then the
White House Correspondents Dinner cold
and grey and dead beat on the doors of
Washington to eat the brains of the
White House press corps and it succeeded
okay we got to do run these because then
we're just like them at a news
conference on Monday I'll talk about to
talk about Trump and Iran at a news
conference on Monday president Trump
said that killing the Iranian nuclear
deal would quote sent the right message
to North Korea right on the heels of a
weekend in which North and South Korea
took historic trap steps to come to an
agreement about the North's nuclear
program the same time today hold on
sorry same time today Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stepped up
pressure on that it states to pull out
of the nuclear deal he had a primetime
address on Israeli TV where he presented
what he called evidence of a secret
Iranian nuclear weapons program this was
to be evidence that Iran wasn't sticking
to the deal Tommy talked us through this
what's going so they so pretty
interesting that the Mossad and the
Israeli intelligence service managed to
get all these secret Iranian documents
out of Iran like good for them that's
impressive
essentially what they put forward
evidence of an Iranian nuclear program
years ago there was no evidence of
violations by Iran of the agreement
since the deal went into effect in early
2016 so it seems like this was a effort
to spin up oldish intelligence new
documents but sort of old news that
shows that you know they did intend to
have a nuclear program one point along
the line they haven't discarded the
know-how the manuals the knowledge if
they were to pick it up in the future
again but no he's trying to create cover
for Trump to pull out of the Iran
nuclear deal it seems pretty obvious to
me we'll see if it works and I think
most experts you see are like you know
impressive in one sense you know another
reason not to trust them but it doesn't
show that he's violated the spirit of
the deal how is how is killing the deal
sending the right message to North Korea
know that I mean it's up is down black
his wife you know it doesn't make any
sense
I don't know why you would cut a deal
with the United States after we told
another country that will no longer live
up to a deal that we had just made yeah
it does I mean I I don't see any
indication at this point that there's
any hope that Trump stays in this deal
neither he doesn't want to do it he
wants out he wanted out of Paris he
wants out of this these are the two he
came in he had an idea of what he wanted
to do he is not waiver from it for one
the only reason he's in there's people
that have managed to put him off and put
him off and distract him I don't know
with like a child mobile hanging above a
his bed but the mobile batteries are
running out and eventually he'll get
colicky and decide to pull out you need
like a nuclear battery and of course all
of this came after Trump received cheers
from supporters at a speech on Saturday
which they all chanted no bail no bail
that's true you know when Brock Obama
got a Nobel Peace Prize his reaction was
basically you've got to be
kidding me okay like he understood the
campaign you go to campaign but you
didn't have people chanting it at
rallies he was sort of embarrassed by it
and wrote a speech it was honestly kind
of scolding towards the know about
committee in response to you know
getting this thing prematurely the
notion that like let's just wait till
the negotiations are over we all want
this to work out but I mean Kim jong-un
6:8
ten months ago was tweeting or releasing
statements that he was gonna nuke us or
blow up Japan or you know burn the
planet to the ground now he's being
really nice do we think the now part of
this is sincere or then maybe he's being
a little duplicitous like they've done
every step along the way in the past you
know like seeing everyone leave to get
ahead of this insert Aki mutt Awards is
ridiculous I like that they were
chanting Nobel Nobel right before they
were chanting lock her up lock her up
about Hillary Clinton what
which I'm that's not offensive that the
president holds a rally by the way where
his supporters are cheering - chanting
to lock up his former political opponent
for totally cool down that's that's not
offensive at all Sarah Huckabee Sanders
joke though that was over-the-line the
joke jokes of all during the campaign
was like Oh God imagine nuclear
negotiations or the nuclear button being
under Donald Trump's you know finger
like his ego could destroy not one but
two nuclear agreements in the next
couple months this is a terrifying
situation when right now this is why it
would be great if the Correspondents
Association put a little more time
talking about you know should that
matter it's like President Trump has had
a news conference in over a year
let's also talk about that don't see a
lot of statements about that not
releasing the statements but the big
discussion now is reform how do we
reform the dinner next year look the
bottom line is I'm the one with the
dinner I'm the kind of person where when
I see a comedian making an appropriate
joke I speak out when I see the most
powerful human being on planet earth who
commands the most awesome military mind
in the history of the earth of Earth I
sometimes speak out you know I think
they're the same thing to compare one is
the president the others a comedian
equal footing to me I just take him as
him I don't like bullying from anybody
that's me the guy that doesn't like
a for everyone's enjoyment he is guilty
of crimes and if we had a Justice
Department that was doing their job
instead of Spencer mr. president you're
the Republican in charge a Republican
what I answered this all the time
because of the fact that they have this
witch hunt going on with people in the
Justice Department that shouldn't be
there they have a witch-hunt against the
President of the United States going on
I've taken the position and I don't have
to take this position and maybe I'll
change that I will not be involved with
the Justice Department I will wait till
this is over it's a total it's all lies
and it's a horrible thing that's going
on a horrible thing and yet I've
accomplished with all of this going on
more than any president in the first
year in our history even the enemies and
the haters admit that so so Donald Trump
at the beginning there was referring to
James Comey he you know threatened to
obstruct justice on national television
which is not something that you do every
day
during that rant he also admitted that
Michael Cohen did not represent him in
the stormy Daniels case I'm sorry
during that rant he also admitted that
Michael Cohen did represent him in the
stormy Daniels case he threatened Jon
Tester for raising questions about
Ronnie Jackson's qualifications he
bragged about his electoral vote he
yelled about the media and he hinted
that he may not have gotten his wife a
birthday gift Dan your thoughts I would
cite this as a historic moment in the
history of Fox News really this thing
first yes this is the first piece of
public service journalism Fox has ever
done they accidentally did it by just
allowing our unstable president to call
in and talk non-stop for what felt like
a decade a pillar is a half hour a half
hour so for a warrant for the world to
see why
how Donald Trump thing I would note that
before you fill out a form for a
retroactive Pulitzer poor Steve Doocy
they did try to encourage Donald Trump
to obstruct justice they did like why
aren't you obstructing justice mr. Trump
this is a opportunity for you but it's
your Justice Department you know you
could you could obstruct this justice
sir it mean it is it's a while it is
wild this man is our president it is
wild there is a news network like this
that exists in the world that the
president would call into I mean it is
it is amazing I mean it is really a bad
thing and this will be the thread that
ties Tonya trunk together is these are
two men who put their inside thoughts on
the outside yeah I mean at one point
they did ask him about Kanye because it
was all over Fox basically since the
whole tweet storm yesterday and Trump
said he starts talking about you know
black unemployment and doing his usual
riff on that and he said you know people
don't realize if you go back in the
Civil War it was the Republicans that
really did the thing I guess he was
trying to say that Abraham Lincoln as a
Republican was the president when
slavery ended just a little a little
history lesson for all you buffs out
there from Donald Trump who's a history
buff himself so yeah I mean it was it
was his usual crazy I think it's always
interesting when he calls in or he goes
on television or he does one of these
press conferences because we're so used
to his Twitter voice which is like all
caps ranting you know barely legible not
even sure it's in English half the time
but when he calls in and he was just
yelling the whole time and he wasn't
yelling with like an adversarial
reporter here these are his pals on Fox
and Friends and he's just screaming the
whole time he's like so angry and it's
like his thoughts just moved from one
thing to another so quickly he covered
so much ground in 30 minutes none of it
made any sense it's the I mean it is
sort of evidence that Twitter voice is
this true
Dennett voice it is whenever he whatever
pops into his head it is he is not many
people appear more angry on Twitter than
they are in real life
yeah that will try I'm one of them
equally angry yeah not an angry person
well for those of you who have been for
those of you have not met John outside
in sort of race he is one of the least
anger people I know I know yeah I know
yeah yeah no you're not a Yeller you are
in all caps per-user periodically right
Trump is a key Ben is that is truly
authentically Trump and that's actually
pretty scary
like it's not yeah performance art on
Twitter to rile up the base or send a
message to someone or send a signal to
his massive propaganda Network it is
just what he is actually thinking at the
moment and the things here thinking he
is thinking would be scary if it was
your uncle posting them on Facebook let
alone the president states posting them
on Twitter yeah there's no method to the
madness no one should ever think there
is there's no attempt to distract
there's no attempt to do anything it's
just you know stream-of-consciousness
all day long I do not want to spend too
much time on this at all because it is
so deeply annoying but let's talk about
Kanye after a long Twitter hiatus Kanye
spent Wednesday declaring his love for
Donald Trump while noting that he
doesn't necessarily agree with him on
everything he posted a photo of him
wearing a sign Magga hat he said that
nothing changed in Chicago for the eight
years that Obama was president Kim
Kardashian jumped in to defend and
explain her husband chance the rapper
and explicably jumped in to say that
black people don't have to be Democrats
of course we love chance here Donald
Trump replied very cool to Kanye Don jr.
navona got in on the action
 Anthony scare Moochie who we
learned from Holt this whole thing texts
with Kanye tweeted we are all one race
Kanye the human race and the rest of us
pinched ourselves but didn't wake up
welcome to hell
d-dan what are your thoughts I know
you've always been a fan of Kanye as as
I am of his music but have always
thought he's sort of a jackass
as Barack Obama was I mean
cool Brock Obama Kenya is a bit of a
jackass it I am a huge fan of Kanye's
music I have seen Kanye in concert maybe
six times I have listened to all of his
albums many many times I will most
certainly buy the two albums he has
coming out and the early stream the two
ideas coming out and from himself
and the three albums that he produced
that are coming out at the probably not
coincidentally it to be at the right
after this return to the spotlight but
the thing that says Malkani is me moat
Connie a symbol of coming music musical
lobs I don't know Connie is not a
beloved individual right he has been and
this is the one thing the chance the
rapper said after this after the Tweety
reference on Twitter which was this is
the same Kanye this is the Kanye who
interrupted Taylor Swift if the Kanye
who called who said the george w bush
didn't like black people and we just
have to accept in our culture two things
one that Connie is a jackass he
sometimes his jackass various things we
may find appealing
like when he yelled at george w bush
after katrina sometimes we may find it
amusing because it's on something more
generic like the Nike Adidas sneakers
battle or is we're desired to meet with
Mark Zuckerberg or Larry if you said
Larry's from Google but there's also
something broader about just this low
the fact that all of politic stop to
talk about Kanye and Trump and what they
say and then the cable segments that
launched and reaction to it the Twitter
storms and logs in reaction to it we
became obsessed with something that was
incredibly trivial because we have an
obsession in our country with celebrity
and kind of like what happened in 2016
huh exactly and Michael Cohen the
president's fixer involved under federal
investigation involved in a whole host
of things yesterday indicated that he
was going to plead the fifth
in the stormy Daniels case now in Venice
is Constitution all right do so but it
is a newsworthy thing that I a very
intense news consumer did not know for
hours because of Kanye and I don't know
I don't have a solution to the problem
of celebra in our politics but we should
at least recognize what it is is that we
are always distracted by the shiny
things and in 2016 we as a culture got
distracted by the shiny thing that is
Donald Trump and missed some very real
things that affected our but our
election our policy all of that week we
we we valued the stunts this we've
invested the style of the substance and
it's very it's like this was another
object lesson that we had not if the
culture learned a lot 2015 yet look I I
now understand now that we run a quasi
media company I now understand what
media companies and and reporters and
editors go through when they try to make
decisions about what to talk about
because we sort of all had this debate
here yesterday when we were writing up
the newsletter and we're like did we put
it at the top do we put it somewhere
down in the middle like well everyone's
talking about it but then if we're
talking about it we're contributing to
everyone talking about it as you and I
are doing right now so it's really hard
to figure out how to cover these things
and how to talk about it because they do
get so much attention and I would say
that even as most most journalists and
most political observers are wrestling
with that question on the right like
this blanketed Fox News all day
yesterday after it happened but it's
interesting like all the maggot roles on
Fox and Twitter were ecstatic that a
black celebrity liked Donald Trump
purely because they thought it would
upset liberals this was the whole thing
this is all they cared about they don't
care right issues and come up policies
it's like just own the libs so you can
get more followers you can book more Fox
hits so you can get your own Fox show so
you can run for presidents you can own
the libs more this is like their whole
this is their reason for being on the
right and I do think that like if we as
a culture we're very vulnerable
- celebrity sort of taking it over but
you realize like this Republican Party
Trump's Republican Party they don't have
it's not even like Paul Ryan in his
obsession with tax cuts like he's got
something that wakes him up in the
morning that's policy-related we all
hate it but he's got it the Trump's
Republican Party and the one you see on
Fox News and everything else there are
no issues there are no beliefs there are
no ideology it's just like everything
they do is to piss off liberals and
whatever they can do to do that and to
troll people they will pursue that yes
that's exactly right and I think we have
a tendencies and I mean me in particular
sometimes you yell and you're like why
is why is the media covering this yes
and you get with the media but that is
act and I've done that many times so let
this be part of my apology tour is it's
not the media's fault
the media is often a reflection of the
culture right now their job is not to
feed you spinach their job is to feed
you things that you will read and listen
to and be interested in and the hope is
you'll be interested in serious things
and so of course they're gonna cover
County because we're interested in Kanye
this is it is as much the public's
fathers as the media's fault the
politicians fault for talking about this
to any matter we're all part of the
problem here and it's you can try to
switch we can turn off sending her
Democrats it's the sort of understand
how to fix - we're sometimes of spinach
party and how do we succeed in a culture
that doesn't want spinach how do you
take what we care about and are serious
about how do we make that interesting in
a world that is fueled by retweets and
likes and clicks and I don't have the
right answer to that but it is if we do
not get better at making our message
viral without sacrificing who we are
what we stand for we're gonna struggle
in 2020 because the Republicans are a
whit under Trump like Paul Ryan initial
caller are not good in this uh but Trump
has built an outrage machine and we have
to build something that
an outrage machine but succeeds in the
same environment that values outrage
yeah and I've said this before but I
think on the right one of the main
drivers is is fear and anger and I don't
think we should emulate that on the left
I think the way that we get people move
in and get people organized and
activated is with both humor and
inspiration especially inspiration and
that sort of our antidote to their side
I don't think we should mimic them but
you know it's also some errands like
well we don't when the whole Oprah thing
happened right everyone's like we don't
we can't have our own celebrity to their
celebrity well you know what there's a
big difference between Oprah
Winfrey and Donald Trump and Kanye West
because she knows what the hell she's
talking about and she's brilliant right
so it's not even like it's not just easy
enough to say no celebrities anywhere
because I do think people who are widely
recognized to have a large following
could potentially be good leaders but it
has to do with like are your values in
the right place do you know what you're
talking about do you have the base of
knowledge and policy and everything else
to actually you know articulate a
coherent and inspiring message and I
think that could come from someone who
is just you know who's gone up through
public service their whole life and
who's been an elected official and it
can also come from someone who's outside
of politics like I don't actually think
it's the resume specifically that's
gonna tell us who that person is but
it's actually what they say and what
their message is and what they know
right that's right Donald Trump's
greatest blog not he's a celebrity no it
is the thing it is his greatest flaw or
the characteristic that originally made
him a celebrity it is vacuous Ness
jackassery everything you heard on Fox &
Friends this morning just listen to that
that those are his greatest flaws
everything he said there it's not like
yeah and so maybe I not don't nominate
someone like oh but it's not we need our
own Trump's but let's get the rock or
Oprah no or I don't know someone that
someone similar but it's also not if we
have a celebrity it doesn't celebrities
have a problem in the key isn't that the
characteristic of a candidate that is
the problem the culture's obsession with
celebrity that good Forrest
extends far beyond politics is a broader
thing that we should be aware of and
think about and look at because it's not
just the obsession with Kanye's tweets
it's also the obsession with the
Kardashians or the Real Housewives or
it's an obsession with with right it's
an obsession with the trivial and the
sensational over the substantive and you
know and and what really matters to
people's lives I think that's what it is
and celebrity can sometimes be a
stand-in for what's trivial and
sensational but I think what you said to
it is a that the problem we have is that
you know we need people to eat the
vegetables but people only want the
people only want the dessert well we
could talk about that forever and we
will again I'm sure but we should talk
about dr. Ronnie Jackson who formally
withdrew his name for consideration to
lead the Department of Veterans Affairs
this morning this comes after Senate
Democrats and the Veterans Affairs
Committee released a list of allegations
against traction that included drinking
on the job over prescribing medication
and overseeing a hostile work
environment
so look a lot of people have tweeted us
about this asked us this question
because way back in January when dr.
Jackson gave that report on Donald
Trump's health because he's Donald
Trump's personal physician number of us
in the Obama world said we know dr. roni
he had been our doctor and you know
thought he was a great guy and a good
doctor later when he was first nominated
for the VA I think pretty universally in
Obama world we said still liked him
still think he was a good doctor none of
us think he was qualified to lead the VA
and then all these allegations come out
and people who were like well did you
guys see any of that when you were
working with him and the truth is I
hadn't I mean like I my experience with
him was when I got to the White House
President had a different doctor dr.
Coleman and then dr. roni was sort of in
charge of being a doctor to the senior
staff and sort of you know helping rub
the White House met
unit so I was a patient of his and I
think he's great doctor took care of me
I had some medical issues when I first
got there in 2009-2010 and he took
excellent care of me and then when I was
on foreign trips see him on the plane
with him in the van
said hi he was always very polite very
nice I never saw him drunk never some
drinking but you know if a lot of these
allegations are coming out from people
on the medical staff who worked with him
and worked for him and you can't
discount those allegations it's very
possible that the allegations may be
true even though a lot of us who dealt
with them you know have limited
experiences with him except when he was
our doctor had different experiences you
know so it's very possible that the
allegations could be true I just don't
know yeah that's right I think like as
was pointed out by many people that I
tweeted something nice about dr. Jackson
back in January saying he was a really
good guy and a been an excellent doctor
he took her care of me and he was an
excellent doctor took great care of me
as we talked about I had serious health
issues he oversaw my care I'm incredibly
grateful to that I saw him be truly kind
individual to a lot of people and I told
this Romans podcast before but there was
a friend of ours who was a White House
staff of us whose father had a heart
attack in Illinois and it was very
serious and we were on a trip to
Illinois right after that and during his
off time dr. Jackson went and met with
the doctor went to the hospital where
our friend's father was and met with a
doctor to make sure that he was that our
friend's father was getting the care
that he needed now that is so far beyond
the duties of the White House doctor was
just being a good friend and colleague
and person and I always thought that
that was an incredible thing that this
doctor doctor did for this person who
was not above dr. Jackson on the food
chain I wish you perform just someone
that he spent time with and I thought
that was really that meant 11 a lot to
that person to a lot of us who were
friends with him the now always you said
I can only speak to the two what I saw
write to someone I tried
with and someone that was my doctor and
those experiences were always good now
these other allegations are troubling
and I think it's important to get to the
bottom of them they were some reporter
asked me the other day you know was this
like an open secret well you know kids
that happen yeah times I get it's not
love it talks to Kelley Fisher a teacher
who's helping to organize the teacher
walkout in Arizona this week she was
cool
we just talked there you go it's real
time I was gonna say how was love it or
leave it this weekend uh we did we we
had a we had the Minneapolis show which
was a show we did about an issue it
wasn't it wasn't sort of tied to the
weekly news and it was a great
conversation about fake news and
propaganda and misinformation and it
meant that I didn't record a show on
Friday which meant I had a weekend off
and so I ate basically I did a food tour
of the worst restaurants a person can
eat at multiple times it's placement for
tonight
I did not I did not play or that I
didn't escape room where I ran into some
friends at the pod cool anyway go check
it out it's called love it or leave it
it's a podcast can somebody shake shack
and Taco Bell in a day when they're
thirty five the answer is yes delicious
what did you get a Taco Bell I got a box
that came with a chalupa a burrito and a
taco and I got a softshell taco steak
taco and I got a double decker taco
supreme great being in the office with
you later in the pod we'll also be
talking to crooked media's own Priyanka
Arab Andy who writes what a day our
newsletter which is a hit our hit
newsletter and she's gonna be giving us
a little preview of what's in the
newsletter we're just gonna be talking
about it makes Axios look like one of
those drum lesons things they put up at
a coffee shop you know sure okay or
whatever guys let's talk about Donald
Trump's efforts to bring about peace in
our time so he planted a tree John he
did this week French president Emmanuel
macron and German Chancellor Angela
Merkel are in Washington Trump has
invited McCrone for the first state
dinner of his presidency to which no
congressional Democrats were invited as
a very nice school idea or press or
press normally you invited a couple
reporters maybe a columnist maybe
someone who agrees with you maybe your
best bud Sean Hannity why didn't you get
that know who's coming just a bunch of
like reddit trolls I don't know yeah so
what you do is in Pepe Mass oh well I'm
here for I'm here for state dinner I'm I
am Here I am American local person here
to enjoy state dinner with
French person and that president from
good president so wonderful the DC press
has been very focused on the personal
relationship between Trump and McCrone
which is supposedly quite good macron
calls him a friend Trump wrote him a
love note last July in the margin of a
New York Times article maybe yeah and
usually Manuel I love you and usually
with with Trump like he doesn't like it
when somebody stays over especially the
first time but like he was like no no
don't go don't go let's just say maybe
you can watch something on Netflix axia
Axios ran a piece over the weekend
describing McCrone as a person who runs
quote a master class in soothing Trump
just a weird phrase and slate asked can
McCrone flatter Trump into giving him
what he wants uh Tommy why do you think
they're pals and how much do you think
it actually matters like has McCrone
gotten anything out of this relationship
can we just stipulate that you don't
need to take a master class to learn how
to flatter Donald Trump you need to pay
ninety bucks to Aaron Sorkin to watch
half of the videos before you abandon it
all you need to do is kiss his ass you
know I think it's probably a savvy move
I mean my car owns one of the few
European leaders that made a decision
early on just to flatter him despite the
domestic political cost of being
associated with someone that's so toxic
so you know he gave him a dinner at the
Eiffel Tower he showed him a big
military parade which he's gonna night
now try to emulate they trade love notes
apparently they say nice things so a
Merkel is generally more wary but that's
understandable she's been on the scene
longer he made that really awkward
surveillance joke about how they both
been spied on by Obama despite half of
it being not true Germany has a good
reason to fear a nationalist want to be
strongmen right so there's a chance
there there's a legacy there there's
reasons why they both don't like him I
do think it's not hard to build a
psychological profile Donald Trump and
figure out what you want microns had
done it pretty well we'll see if there's
a backlash to the stories about how he's
been played but I mean ultimately like
Donald Trump's not gonna be there for
you if you need something he doesn't
want to do so yeah enjoy while you can
but it didn't go so well for the
committee to save America I don't know
that it's gonna go like no one's going
to really no one has proven that they
can influence Donald Trump through
flattery in any way that gets a good
result except like the Saudi so if you
if you're a strong if you bring him
there and you have pop and circumstance
and you roll out the red carpet and all
you want him to do is not tell you what
to do that might work but if you're
gonna go there and say hey don't screw
up the Iran deal stay in Syria
don't start a trade war with your up
like that's gonna be a little tougher
sell for a microt John what do you think
you're writing some notes down and you
brought some papers I the people
organizing his paper for dramatic effect
love it's very proud he was the problem
that maze makes a noise love it has read
the news today but he's read the news
that was printed out on pieces of paper
and he's taken notes love it
your thoughts thanks for your question
John so I would say two things one no
human being on earth has a good
relationship with Donald Trump there's
no such thing as a good relationship
with Donald Trump you might have an
effective but it's not a good relation
it's not like Don Trump is not a human
being with whom you can have a good
relationship no one he loves has a good
relationship with him no and he hates a
good saying that it doesn't work that
way he's not capable of having them I
mean brought Barack Obama is President
had leaders he'd prefer to talk to
leaders he didn't and that might have a
different I might make a difference in
the margins right
maybe we I remember you know you could
be outside the oval and there'd be like
oh he's on a call with this person it's
gonna be longer because he doesn't hate
talking to this right and that may
affect their working relationship it can
make a difference at the margins but
ultimately national interests I mean
it's all these people who claim to be
hard and realist and then turn around
and write articles about how there's
like a new bromance which is ridiculous
if McCormack Ron is good at pretending
to like Donald Trump more power to him
you know that's what he should do it's
not true it's a hard thing as I write a
story it's just and also it's just a
reality of we're in a situation where we
watch foreign leaders manipulate our
president and talk about how best so get
waters it's embarrassing to get one over
on him you know if you know it's like
what conversation do we feel like we
feel more welcoming the one between
Trump and somebody or between Merkel and
and and Makran laughing about it what a
what a dumb we put in the White
House also by the ways we're
pulling for the foreign leader to pull
one over on him right oh yeah he does
that means you know maybe he convinces
him to get back in the pirate Paris
climate agreement or maybe he convinces
him not to pull out of the Iran deal or
maybe you know it's like their
objectives are usually aligned more with
the American public than trumps yeah and
also I think the problem is you know we
there was sort of it's like a little bit
of a contradiction right we talked about
how oh if you do pomp and circumstance
and make him feel good he'll kind of go
along with what you want but you're
right in pointing out that long term the
committee to save America and others
who've claimed to use their influence
and personal relationships to make a
difference haven't made that much of a
difference and I think it's in part
because he's basically a fascist
goldfish and so you know ya macron can
maybe impress upon him the the the
importance of the Iran deal but he's
gonna forget and then he's gonna talk to
John Bolton for a week after macron goes
back to Paris
Trump decided to attack the Mayor of
London after there was a terrorist
attack on his cities that he's not a
stable person to say the least
both McCrone and Merkel will be trying
to convince Trump not to pull out of the
Iran deal
last week bob corker said Trump's gonna
do it we talked about Seoul on Thursday
but I wanted to hear from you about this
Tommy it seems like everyone in the
world except for Bibi Netanyahu and the
Republican Party wants to preserve the
Iran deal yeah what happens if Trump
pulls out and how dangerous is it well
right now the Iran deal is essentially
put restrictions on their nuclear
program and the deadline to to recertify
that they are that they're following the
letter of the deal is May 12th so if
Trump doesn't agree to certify that they
are complying with the sanctions I'm
sorry if Trump doesn't agree to certify
that they're complying with the Iran
deal they could put sanctions back on
Iran which means that all the
restrictions all the IAEA monitoring the
the reduction of centrifuges that are
enriching nuclear material the amount of
nuclear material they can enrich will
all go back to where they were before in
fact the Iranians are saying that if
they put you at sanctions on us we
actually will increase our enrichment
program so things will get increasingly
dangerous they'll be closer to a nuclear
weapon and there will be no the world
won't be with us there will be no
increase in safety for us
there's no upside to this Trump only
dislikes it because he dislikes Obama so
yeah Trump peering out of the Iran deal
is giving Iran a green light to go build
nuclear weapons right I mean we are
screwing it up we will be the reason it
is now non-existent we will be the ones
out of compliance with the agreement
generally and the rest of the world is
not with us on this in the IAEA the
international monitoring program that
keeps an eye on all this stuff has
certified I believe ten times that
they're still complying with the deal so
it will also send a message to North
Korea and all these other rogue states
so we don't live up to our agreements
and in there right like trumps come let
me just start that Eon trumps concern
with the Iran deal or what's not in it
is legitimate he wants he doesn't like
the fact that the there's a sunset in
the deal that will make it end after 10
or 15 years he doesn't like the fact
that there aren't limits on their tests
on ballistic missiles he doesn't like
the fact you can't always get access to
certain military sites exactly when you
want them to testing that's all fine but
like a lot of those issues you know they
had to be negotiated and a lot of those
issues are not relevant to a nuclear
deal like if the United States all of a
sudden some trading partner came to us
and said hey our bilateral trade deal
now means that you guys can't test some
sort kind of ICBM we say what the hell
you talking about
yeah well it's also like sure you want a
limit on ballistic missile testing sure
you want something longer than a 10
years and say well go prove that you can
get that kind of deal go work on it
that's the whole point like can you get
that that was the whole problem with the
criticism of the of Obama's deal in the
first place it's like yeah we all want
those things but you negotiate and you
compromise to get something better not
something perfect and and you can make
an argument that says all right John
Kerry was too thirsty for deal Obama
wanted a deal the Iranians knew it they
took advantage and the deal wasn't as
favorable as another one we would have
negotiated whatever you want to make a
claim like that that's mine but that's
not the deal we have this is the deal we
have which is why people like bob corker
who were resistant to it are now saying
it's important to keep it in place
because regardless of whether you
believe there could have been some
fantasy of a better deal this is the
deal we have right I mean the other
piece of this too it's it's um if Trump
ends up staying in the deal for a little
while longer fine but this feels like
one of those issues where
the all the people around him all the
smart smarter people semi-reasonable
serious people who are trying to get him
to not pull out they're all kind of like
putting their fingers in the dike trying
to stop him from doing what he wants to
do this feels like something eventually
will burst he wants out he's not gonna
stop wanting out complete off for a
month you could put it off for six
months whatever but uh same thing with
Paris yeah it's exactly like Paris
another one of the his complaints is
that the Iranians are you know doing bad
things in Syria and they're funding a
rebel group in Yemen and like again it's
like yes the Obama administration had
the same exact concerns with those
things but there's no reason to tear up
the Iranian nuclear deal which is about
nuclear weapons to get those things
dealt with it's just it's not really a
point of leverage and he's going about
it in a stupid way it's just it's so
self-defeating let's move from one
potential nuclear disaster to another
North Korea Kim Jong Un's said this
weekend he would suspend nuclear and
missile tests north Korea has apparently
dropped its demand that the u.s. removed
troops from South Korea as a condition
for giving up nuclear weapons and North
and South Korea are set to meet this
week how big of a deal is this has Trump
tweeted his way to peace so the
reporting on this is all over the bass
know what to think Trump claimed that
North Korea had agreed to do
denuclearize but that's not true they
said they would essentially suspend
nuclear tests and suspend ICBM tests
ahead of the summit so they would
suspend testing of nuclear what they
done this before they paused before of
freezes it's not it's it's
unless you take some very concrete steps
it's a easily reversible thing like hey
we didn't test a ICBM today we literally
just not testing it is not succeeding
exactly doesn't mean they're not going
to continue their nuclear weapons
program but the North has for a very
long time said that its idea of
denuclearization is essentially they'll
get rid of their nuclear weapons if we
remove all its troops from the Korean
Peninsula and we get rid of our sort of
nuclear umbrella or our policy of
protecting South Korea and Japan so
that's a big lift and what Kim jong-un
is saying is essentially Trump
apparently according the Wall Street
Journal is going to say to him you have
to dismantle your nuclear arsenal before
you get sanctions relief
it's not as sanctions relief for a
freeze of nuclear and missile nuclear
tests and missile tests which is what
happened before we've given them you
know the they've said that they'll it's
called a freeze for freeze will freeze
they freeze testing and we will freeze
sanctions or give them sort of relief on
you know grain subsidies or where the
hell it would be and then they just do
it anyway so that was where Bob Gates
would always say you can't buy the same
horse twice I'm not gonna fooled again
that was his big beef with this whole
thing actually
Trump's like I've sold the same
apartment 50 times right to Michael Kohn
you seen I'm I do business there trying
to get away with good pickup after loved
his joke I would say you know the one I
agree that I was actually kind of hard
to figure out what's true and what's not
which is always true with Trump right
you're like okay is Trump lying is he
ostentatiously mischaracterizing with
some kind of purpose is the purpose to
ferry Korea lying they lie along they
lied to so it's a bunch of people lying
but then I am I feeling about it was
that it actually doesn't really matter
because it doesn't it doesn't actually
the difference between a lie in the
truth in this case about what they're
saying they're willing to give up is all
just posturing anyway ultimately this is
about a bunch of kind of markers people
are setting down before talks begin and
before you know the contours of whatever
a deal would be could what would before
we learn what the contours of an
eventual deal could possibly look like
at some point in the future I have to
say like you know coming away from this
I I sort of coming around to saying I we
don't know and I think we should be
humble about North Korea specifically
because I do not believe right now that
the Trump administration is doing very
poorly and certainly not doing worse
than an Obama administration or a Bush
administration or a Clinton
sorry I'm hitting the table again it's
doing worse than a an Obama
administration or Clinton ministration
or a Bush administration I think it has
it's the chaos and nonsense of Trump but
ultimately what we're talking about is a
seemingly intractable problem and there
does seem like there is real movement
and that that is something no there's
sort of I mean they're not doing worse
but this confusion that we're talking
about right now is why you sort out the
terms of what these head--oh state level
talks are
b-before you have the talks and if Trump
really thinks he's gonna go into this
thing in charm Kim jong-un out of his
nuclear weapons which he views is the
most critical thing he has he's
forgetting the fact that this is a dude
who like you know he murders senior
officials who piss him off by shooting
them with anti-aircraft guns he saw like
a trap used as like a as like a cool
back so to your point like there have
been you know during the Clinton
administration there were high-level
meetings and there was a temporary
freeze that they cheated on the certain
during the Bush administration as well
there were six-party talks that happen
in the Obama administration so we're in
this cycle a sort of boom and bust of
activity I'm really really glad that
they're pushing for more activity I
support it but like they're just so far
ahead of themselves in terms of claiming
success right yeah I'm I'm not gonna buy
the same horse toys John won't be buying
John saw that horse is that I are you
own that horse that's my heart every
time in the troubled ministration so far
it seems like they are doing something a
little different and reasonable we went
through this with the whole dreamers
debate to maybe this is like normal and
he's gonna actually get a deal on this
whatever and then like they end up
disappointing and he goes crazy now this
is obviously on a much bigger scale with
much higher stakes but I find myself
just looking at the whole thing to be
like yeah cool it's good so far but this
whole thing I could fall apart
any second so I hope that like way down
the road I can look back and be like
yeah they did good I would love to be
a pod about the the Democratic Party and
look I think over the last couple days
we fixed everything nothing is wrong
with the Democratic Party it is perfect
perfect that's otherwise in the trainer
no I mean just to explain a little more
like the reason that I wanted to do this
is we have been all over the country in
the last year live shows marches
get-out-the-vote events and we've met
all these activists and organizers and
first-time voters and first time
candidates who are energized and excited
and they're mostly young and women and
people of color and it's so inspiring
and we also get and you've gotten this
too we also get the same questions
everywhere we go which is what should
our message be what issue should we
focus on like how do we avoid a repeat
of 2016 and you know we don't talk about
that enough on this podcast and the four
of us don't have all the answers to
those questions so I thought why not do
a 15 episode limited series on the
Democratic Party it's about learning
from our past mistakes and building for
the future and I talked to people about
the Obama years
I talked to Hillary staffers like our
friend Jen Palmieri and Bernie staffers
like Becky bond and fat Shakir about
2016
I talked to Adam serwer and Simone
Sanders and Marsha chattel and about
race in America
I talked to Rebecca Trey stirrer and
others about the challenges that women
candidates face I talked to leftists and
liberal policy people about the economy
and immigration activists and foreign
policy experts and I know to everyone
from the DNC chair Tom Perez and Keith
Ellison to state party chairs to
first-time candidates like Danica Rome
and Jennifer Carroll Foy about
organizing and winning and you know I
did a few focus groups which was really
fun and then I figured you know what is
a way to hear from even more people I
figured I'd ask everyone to call in and
give their thoughts about the party and
I phrase the question what's wrong and
how do we fix it because
we don't tend to learn a lot from only
congratulating ourselves about what's
going right and I also think that we're
confident enough as a party to engage in
a little self-reflection and here's the
good news stand like 90 percent of the
hundreds and hundreds of voicemails that
we're getting are positive and
constructive and hopeful about the
future of the party you know there's
only a few profanities here and there
and it's really inspiring it's really
inspiring and getting all these
voicemails has been wonderful and it
makes me want to work even harder to
kick the out of Republicans in
November so again call in and if you
want to call in and say nothing's wrong
with the party at all we'd love to hear
that too that's totally okay but you
know we want to hear from everyone and
basically help us tell a story about a
party that is finding its way out of the
wilderness that's that's what this
podcast is about so please do yes one
can we just stipulate that Jon Favreau
and everyone about this podcast believes
the report the Democrats are a much
better than party in the Republicans
they have better ideals that are
candidates better people better
integrity all of the above yeah and what
is so it's not like some of the
criticism has been somehow you're
seeding the arguing that the Republicans
are better that's not it I think you
know and I clearly I'm doing this
 podcast for a year and a half
now and I get I get like I understand
for people who may not have as much
context as what what Alti we've talked
to all the issues worked on people will
just respond to the initial tweet right
that Democrats are tired of getting
kicked around the party itself if you're
someone who has worked really hard for
Democratic Party for a long time you've
been under assault for a while and not
just from Republicans but also from
within our party because there are you
know a lot of them Bernie some of the
rhetoric on the brady election was about
the state of the democratic party and so
people little raw nerves and people are
upset about but I think it's important
remember that this is largely about
hosting a conversation about what is
working in the party and what hasn't
worked in the past and how we fix in the
future because if we are right on the
issues there are more Democratic leaning
voters and our Republican voters yet
Republicans control all levers of the
government right and that is something
that should be examined and thought
about it so but if people are I think
people should listen to it right and see
how they feel and if there if it still
bothers and afterwards that's one thing
I don't think it will but it's I think
it's a very constructive good thing I'm
really glad you're doing it I'm glad
you're the one who tweeted about it I'm
a yeah they're there of course I know
there are on nerves on all sides of this
debate
I guess my thought is you can either let
that be and then say because there's Ron
nerves no one's gonna talk about it
we're all just gonna be in our own
little silos and be upset about it and
ignore the other people's opinions or
you can say all right we're gonna dive
in and have a conversation about it and
the reason that I wanted to do it is
because I was like I hope it can have a
conversation that is constructive and
interesting and where people aren't like
yelling all the time but they're saying
like no I believe that's wrong for this
reason and I realized that's way too
much to hope on Twitter but I'm thinking
that through this pot and look this
podcast is not going to fix it it's not
going to fix all of our problems and
it's gonna have a lot of shortcomings
and failings on this podcast I tried to
talk to almost a hundred people but
that's not gonna be enough there's other
points of view that it's not going to
capture and so part of what I want to do
when this actually comes out is have one
episode come out you know at the
beginning of the week and then sort of
like field questions from people at the
end of the week so we have more we
constantly have more voices talking
about this and look there's a sec the
segment of the criticism is for people
who are like you know and a lot of our
friends in DC who are working really
hard at the DNC and the DL CC and all
these committees I think they're
thinking like god we're working really
hard to get democrats elected and we
don't need to be doing a bunch of
navel-gazing right now absolutely we
don't need to be doing much of
navel-gazing but i think as we're
working to get these democrats elected
as we're out there with the organizers
and the activists and the people who are
fighting everyday you know they need to
know and they're asking for you know
what is the mess
what should we focus on and if people in
individual races and individual states
and local communities can start sharing
what they're doing right with other
people in other places across the
country and we can get voters this
information and listeners to this
podcast information then that's just
that's going to be helpful you know I
really believe that so check it out okay
quick update on the tribe I'm sorry let
me try that again
okay quick update on the Trump crime
syndicate the the present United States
is now being compared to a mob boss by
his own lawyers here's Jay Goldberg new
character new character in the story Jay
Goldberg who represented Donald Trump
back in the 90s and 2000's through his
divorce proceedings who now Trump has
gone back to it for advice apparently
recently and here's Jay Goldberg talking
to the Wall Street Journal about how he
warned Trump that Michael Cohen might
flip on him quote the mob was broken by
Sammy the bull Gravano caving in out of
the prospect of a jail sentence and
here's the mooch on MSNBC Wednesday
quote if you said to me and I had to
flip a coin which is not how this works
if you said to me and I had to flip a
coin is Cohen going to turn on President
Trump I would say no Dan what about
these statements seems amiss to you well
it seems like the Trump closest
supporters and friends and tend a
10-year communication structures all
bullies and just assume the Trump is
committed many many crimes and the
question is that were those crimes
committed the question is will anyone
tell the Fed about those crimes and then
will Trump States any legal jeopardy as
opposed to another approach which is
just let's pick up you know back in the
envelope idea here would be I would
encourage Michael Cohen to be fully
forthcoming because I know Donald Trump
did nothing wrong and the sooner we can
wrap up this investigation that better
the
the teaser will be for Donald Trump to
focus all his attention on making
America great again but that's not the
person to take it like taking a slightly
different one you and I have worked in
communications for a long time I don't
think you need to be a communications
expert a communications professional to
say that maybe the best answer is no no
I mean he has nothing to flip him on you
know he's just he hasn't President did
nothing wrong he has nothing to worry
about it doesn't seem like a tough
answer it says a lot about not just
about Trump's crimes but about sort of
them the media coverage political
narrative around Trump right because it
is the pressed also I mean this is it's
like this our point is also before
nothing ever is the press no it's not
this is not a monolithic thing but the
question really is it what did Trump do
wrong or if Trump kid did things wrong
Big KRIT committed crimes that's not the
question the press is asking the
question is will under what
circumstances will Trump face either
political or legal repercussions for the
things we already know he did right and
that's just a very different way in
which we've ever talked about a
president before is because everything
that involves around whether it's you
know potential collusion and the Moller
investigation or an array of
particularly sketchy behavior and
criminality and the microcode
investigation is well Trump's poll
numbers haven't moved once all year so
his voters clearly don't care or well
they're not to be able to prove anything
because Cohen's not gonna flip therefore
we shouldn't care like we should
actually care about a president
committing crimes either in office in
search of that office or before they
decided to run for that office whether
they go to jail or not whether they lose
it whether the poll numbers drop or not
like that is an actual thing that should
be the biggest scandal in America and
we're sort of scoring it like it's a mid
season baseball game yeah if the
president noted States is guilty of
crimes it is the biggest scandal in
American history certainly for the
presidency certainly in politics and
I just it is worrisome because like the
media by the nature of the media always
goes to what's new what's gonna happen
what's next
and look the word normalize has been
overused you know ever since the end of
2016 but it is almost like everyone has
internalized that yeah he's probably a
criminal including his own people as
they go on TV and talk about him
everyone has internalized this and so
should crimes be revealed should the
president be charged with anything
should impeachment charges ever be
brought should the crime simply just be
reported on your right that the next
phase of the story is going to be what
happens and if Democrats don't have a
majority then maybe Republicans won't
impeach him or kind of sitting president
be tried in office and there'll be all
these questions and we're gonna sort of
blow past the idea then no no no he and
his associates were just charged with
whatever they might be charged with and
it's it's very worrisome very worrisome
to say the least
so what one action that someone is
taking to head this off the Attorney
General for the state of New York Eric
Schneiderman wants to change the state's
law so that he can bring criminal
charges against aids to Donald Trump who
get pardons from Donald Trump he
basically wants to change the state's
double jeopardy law that currently
protects people from being tried for the
same crime twice
he wants to add an exemption for
presidential pardons since you know
particularly since the sku deliberate
Scootie murder particularly since these
Scooter Libby pardon it seems quite
clear that Trump may once again abuse
the presidential pardon power to pardon
Michael Cohen or Paul Manafort are any
of these unsavory characters who are
under investigation and indictment do we
think this law will pass and if so do
you think it will influence Michael
Cohen on what he decides to do next I
think I might have what is contrary
take on this now I have I'm not an
attorney I have not been a law school
but I have seen on several occasions the
movie double jeopardy with Ashley judge
okay was wrongly convicted of a murder
well then you're good too
yes she's framed for murder and then
goes out I believe to murder someone
knowing she can't go to jail for it
but I am skeptical like double like
double jeopardy exists for a reason
yeah and I'm not positive than
empowering the state to just because we
have one president who may be selling
pardons for his freedom does that mean
that we should change the rule because
you could be in a world where Barack
Obama commuted sentences or pardon
people or for drug offenses that were
well beyond the what should have
happened because of mandatory minimums
or sentencing guidelines or whatever
else and then you have the Republican
governor of a state then prosecuting
those people again out of spite and so
I'm not sure this is the like in the
world the best thing the best thing for
the world to do to increase the power of
the state to put people in jail or
easily but of course if Trump this
pardons everyone it gets off with that
would be quickly frustrated by that so
for usual Trump is sort of up ending
what progressives think we should do
because we have never confronted someone
as corrupt and unwilling to adhere to
the basic norms of American governing as
that'll Trump
yeah it's a very good point I would
encourage all of our legal friends of
the pod to please out let us know what
they think about that because I actually
I you know I I don't know you make a
very good point about you know future
presidencies and and pardons and what
you know AG's and state legislatures and
particularly red states might do when a
progressive president pardons a bunch of
people in commute sentences that's
worrisome as well now a wall a wall
passed by a by I don't know a second
branch of government they felt a need to
check the power of an unbridled
executive could pass a law that would
say that the you cannot use the part
our investigation into yourself or
something like that now that may not
pass constitutional muster but that is
something but you could you could test
that as opposed to testing a broader law
that sort of erodes the idea of double
jeopardy in the American legal system
well dan that's a great segue to our
next topic Mitch McConnell so as Trump's
associates you know openly muse about
his lawyer flipping on him Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said
this week that he will not allow a vote
on bipartisan legislation that would
protect Special Counsel but that would
protect Special Counsel robert muller
mcconnell says it's not necessary
because there haven't been any
indications the Trump might fire Muller
except I guess for all of the
president's public statements Dan the
bills got Republican support why won't
McConnell let it come to the floor for a
vote well in a weird display of heroism
chuck Grassley said he was in continue
to move it through the the Judiciary
Committee nicely put sort of like throw
the hot potato to Mitch McConnell now
we'll see if he actually follow through
with that McConnell is a pretty good way
getting Republican senators to bend the
knee and do what he wants so we'll see
if it actually happens but I found that
to be an actually encouraging sign that
you have some number of Republicans who
are breaking with recent pattern and
trying to do the right thing for the
country so kudos I think like this is
all about 2018 Republican turnout which
is if the Republican Senate if Mitch
McConnell were allow would were to allow
the Senate to pass a bill that is
obviously going nowhere because Paul
Ryan's showing that do anything but if
he were to allow the Republican Senate
to pass the bill it was seen as pro law
enforcement in anti-trump which are
actually two sides that they are
actually after this idea then you can
see a world where the the Trump voters
in states like Indiana and North Dakota
Missouri West Virginia that the
Republicans need to potentially flip
though maintain control the Senate stay
home and so I think he is doing like
Mitch McConnell's
entire life view is party before country
he cares only about the accumulation of
power for himself
public and party and so what is best for
the publican party here in the short
term in the short term is to help aid
and abet the criminality of Donald Trump
it is in the long term that you would
probably save like maybe doing the right
thing would we're happy but miss Mitch
McConnell does not believe that doing
the right thing is there is reason
enough to do something I think there's a
good analogy like you know what Paul
Ryan is to passing tax cuts and gutting
Medicare at all costs Mitch McConnell is
to confirming right-wing judges and that
seems like he wants to control the
Senate to continue confirming Trump's
unqualified extremist judges and
hopefully also put another one or two
Supreme Court justices on the bench by
the end of trumps term and he has
decided that no amount of corruption no
amount of crimes from Donald Trump will
stop him from doing that and so he will
do whatever it takes to cling to power
and to hang on to a Republican majority
in the Senate and you know he's pretty
open about that Paul right this is where
we go back to our Paul Ryan Mitch
McCullen Paul Ryan likes to like pretend
he's a good guy and he like cares about
poverty or whatever he cares about Mitch
McConnell is just like you know he's out
there saying Oh putting Gorsuch on the
bench and you know blocking stealing a
Supreme Court seat that's one of the
proudest moments of my life
he doesn't he just doesn't really give a
 now really really really bad really
bad I just sometimes I sometimes look I
feel bad because we attacked Paul Ryan
so much and we attacked on Trump so much
we don't spend enough time on how purely
evil Mitch McConnell is he's just he's
not a great guy now some good news on
the Republican side of the Senate is you
know what you said about Chuck Grassley
you know Thom Tillis
all and tell us what you think I'll be
looking forward to hearing from you
we're jazz John we're jazz we're just as
let's do it
we're just the pod there we go oh really
stepped on our gas thing yeah no I think
we got it
we were still just mmm all right let's
get to the news uh last night ABC News
air George Stephanopoulos his interview
with James Comey who is just six feet
eight inches of pure moral rectitude
he's actually 5-1 it's one foot seven
and it's all made of how good he
is the former FBI director a Republican
said the Donald Trump is morally unfit
to hold office that he lies all the time
and that it's possible that the Russians
had material that could be used to
blackmail him he also defended his
actions in the Clinton email
investigation which we can all agree
were perfect guys did anything surprise
you about this interview it's so funny
to be we live in a world in which the
answer to the question about an FBI
director saying the president is morally
unfit and may be compromised by a
foreign government as a real snoozefest
yeah I like the factual I guess the tone
in the language surprised me a little
bit like there was nothing new factually
right I thought it was particularly like
I was sort of there was a bit of there's
a bit of snake and Comey like when he
said look I'm not one of those guys who
says Trump has dementia that he's like
as a failing brain I think he has
above-average intelligence and then goes
on to criticize him for being an immoral
president and that's why it's like
you're leaving with repeating the charge
that is the thing you're then saying you
don't believe it's a little gross I
think like there weren't a lot of new
facts in this interview there weren't in
the letter or the memos that he leaked
what drove me crazy was the fact that he
was willing to render judgments on
literally everything but his own conduct
and like there didn't they didn't feel
like there was much introspection
closest he got was saying you know I
have problems with my ego I'm always
worried about that like am i listening
to others when I'm making decisions or
I'm just doing stuff myself and so he
that's what he threw out there is like
the him do
wrong stuff yeah don't you think so I I
have there's been one question that that
James Comey has answered in the past
that answered again last night that has
always been the focus of my ire which is
if you knew that a letter like Donald
Trump would you still send it you're
talking about the famous October 28th
letter about yeah Anthony Weiner's
laptop which was somehow became a thing
in the election in 2016 as we all
remember Anthony Weiner thanks again
thanks again Anthony thanks for the
memories the yeah the sim where's Tommy
going Tommy's taking off his clothes oh
my goodness
dear diary it's hot in here you never
really would happen in the studio today
so so come--the so Comey said to
Stephanopoulos it's um it's a mink eat
something so Comey said to
Stephanopoulos something similar to what
he said in the hearing which basically
he would do the same thing over again
yeah uh and he basically said he would
do literally everything he did open it
yeah which is incredible so I was really
stuck in this and John and Tommy saw me
kind of working through my thoughts out
loud in the room because I was just like
so frustrated because finger pointing
imagine the conductor was all sticks so
here's here's what I was working out all
right
so Comey said he sent the letter in part
because he expected Hillary Clinton to
win and that if he hadn't sent it if the
facts came out after Hillary became
president it would make her election
last legitimate but then he also said he
couldn't not send the letter because
then that would have been allowing
politics to interfere with the FBI even
though sending letter he's admitting is
for political reasons but okay so that's
confusing but put that aside it's
important to put it aside so he sends
the letter because he wants to have sent
it after Hillary wins but he'd still
send the letter even if the letter means
she lost so not sending a letter means
she wins and therefore he should have
sent it but sending it means she loses
so therefore he should not have sent it
and the reason I think that this is
ridiculous this is on the SAT yeah no no
but so it's it's you kind of get this is
to me the kind of this is where you find
why James Comey made such a big mistake
it's sort of the like
logical fallacy at the heart of what
he's doing because he can't just admit
that he never should have sent that
letter and he never should have revealed
one investigation but not the other
because I think Comey sincerely believes
in his mission he sincerely believes
these are the values that he's trying to
espouse but what's clear when he says
that he would have sent it anyway even
though the only reason he sent it was to
have sent it had Hillary won is because
he's not trying to be ethical he's
trying to seem ethical and that is the
fundamental flaw of what James Comey did
at every step of this is I don't want to
I have one was revealing lines from the
interview was he said you know one of my
kids shared a tweet that's become one of
my favorite tweets and it said that
Comey is such a political hack I just
can't figure out which party and I
really took that as a compliment
that yeah that that is the clash tag No
Labels I was gonna say it's it is it's
this very Washington elite mindset that
you get from people in government that
you get from the media that we saw in
2016 and it's it the problem is not just
that everyone assumed Hillary would win
the problem is that because everyone
assumed Hillary would win the political
immediately decided that they would be
extra tough on her to prove how
nonpartisan they are because they all
celebrate balance as the highest virtue
more than truth more than anything else
they must be balanced and what that
means is the people on the right no
matter how low they go no matter how
much they lie they can count on the fact
that if they work the refs hard enough
they will damage the other side yes on
top of that like he also says that the
fact that both sides hate him now is an
illustration of the polarization of our
times
no the Hillary people hate you because
you broke DOJ guidelines intervene in an
election just days before it happened
and maybe tipped it to Donald Trump the
most unfit president to ever hold the
office the Trump people hate you
because he savages you by name over and
over and over again because he tried to
obstruct justice
with you and now is mad at you like
their that's not the same yeah the Trump
people don't like you because they were
afraid you were gonna expose his rampant
criminality you know that's a different
thing they from the Clinton people
criticized you for your conduct and the
outcome it cause which is Trump being
president yeah and like and by the way
just because he made a
gigantic mistake in the Clinton email
investigation doesn't mean that the
criticisms from the Republicans that
he's some like lying hack slimeball are
correct
no is that no he was he fell victim to
this mindset that he must be all you
said he must appear ethical and he took
even though he said he didn't want to
take politics into consideration even
though he said the one rule he's tried
to obey is to not do anything that will
impact an election he said that he's
other than the interview multiple times
but he said in this case the only option
was to either reveal or conceal this
letter his things over a year when that
was not the option the option could have
been its DOJ policy not to do anything
that will impact an election right
before an election and then after the
election if she won all he had to do was
say by the way we looked at some emails
we didn't find anything and that was
that and if they did find something then
they could say at the time we didn't
want to do anything to impact the
election because we didn't know it was
in the or we hadn't figured out yeah
exactly figure it out first
and by the way James Comey uh you're
gonna have to eat you like as the Joker
would say you're gonna to break your one
rule because you didn't tell us about
the Trump investigation the many Trump
investigations the many the many
different facets of his above his crimes
I will say I thought he was persuasive
on why he didn't why it was a little
different on the Trump investigation
because it was a counter-intel
investigation involved involving some
Americans that you didn't want to reveal
and actually revealing the investigation
and who they were would have compromised
the investigation itself and the Hillary
investigation was a public referral from
the Inspector General so it was already
public and he couldn't avoid it but all
of that is parsing you said you didn't
want to be political but you chose in
the week before an election a letter is
unfuckin forgivable in every way and so
and so it's in it so I I don't you know
James Comey said this other thing in the
interview where he talked about he said
there was once a day when people were
afraid of going to hell if they took an
oath in the name of God and violated it
we've drifted away from that day and so
in its place has to be a fear that if
you lie and government can prove it
beyond a reasonable doubt they will
prosecute you in order to send a message
you must tell the truth that matters
enormously oh boy it's self righteous
it's the way in which James Comey is
frustrated but what I appreciate about
James Comey is I
believe he is sincerely grappling with
what he sees as a culture that doesn't
value the truth a culture that wrote
about that yes he is absolutely right
about that I'm like we've talked about
it we did not you put in terms of God we
put in terms of shame but like I believe
James Comey is a good person I also
believe we should that he was in a
difficult position a difficult position
created by Hillary Clinton and a
difficult position created by Donald
Trump two people who were under
investigation I just believe it is
obvious in hindsight that his fears
about partisanship he got in his own
head and he completely bashed it and
mishandled it and he's the only person
who can't admit it because to admit it
would to be concedes would be to concede
something so grand and so big about his
role in history that uh it's you know
it's he can possibly do it if to admit
it is to say that everything you ever
did led you to make this terrible
decision that caused one of the greatest
political emergencies in American
history
I got another small thing that was
interesting from the interview was he
said the Trump refuses to criticize
Putin even in private even in private
getting corroborated by other officials
and other stories yeah I don't even get
that one like that was like okay all
right Putin's got something on Trump
does he think he's in the Oval what's
going on how what are you afraid of
buddy to me it was just like a pathology
trumped like thinking that if anyone
believed that the election was somehow
illegitimate and that he didn't win the
popular vote and all the crazy things he
lies he believes about himself that
bothers me I mean what one thing there's
really interesting he talked about was
the dinner they had how essentially was
a trumpian monologue which I always
assumed was the case right it was just
like Trump spouting random lies at the
FBI director he doesn't really know and
Comey just sort of sitting there and
having to listen to it and like I could
get how weird and how that could get you
into a weird head space - the one thing
I thought was pretty interesting that
Comey did concede was I credit him for
he conceded that pledging honest loyalty
in the infamous meeting where Trump
tried to demand loyalty from him was a
mistake and could have been
misinterpreted I thought that was
actually kind of a a good thing to be
honest about I was always interesting
how tough he was on Rosenstein
Rosenstein look for his role in firing
him I said that Rosenstein acted
dishonorably
and but then he said that he didn't
think Verizon sign would carry out the
order to fire Muller because he's trying
to restore some of his professional
reputation which is sort of a comments I
mean I could see that but I guess is
that Tommy's point it's like oh like you
know Robert Muller
I'm sorry Robert Muller is James coming
without the no James Comey
James Comey is in the balcony kind of
like keeping a keeping a little count of
balcony what are you in a baseball thing
mezzanine bleachers he's in the bleacher
socks balcony I'm at the Opera you know
when you keep but you keep score yeah
during his shirts game with no way the
point is he's up there being like Oh
rods worried about his reputation and Oh
Hillary had this it's like he's this
pilgrim in an unholy land meanwhile what
is this book man yes it's just an effort
to restore your reputation actly
exactly one of them like there's some
little lies in there that just annoyed
me like he says the one like when he put
out his memos after Trump tweeted you
better hope I don't have tapes Comey had
his buddy release memo as he'd taken at
the time he said that the reason he had
his buddy leak them is because he didn't
want to say yes and talked to one
reporter and then tell the rest of the
reporters that were at his driveway that
he couldn't talk to them I thought that
was just such a ludicrous effort of
concocting some moral reason for his
choice that it just it like undercut
half the rest of it now the classic
Comey frankly all this aside like I
don't I don't like Jim Comey very much I
don't hate him I do think like like you
that he's a decent person I think he's
terrible political judgment I think his
letter indisputably impacted the
election I'm also reminded that Bill
Clinton's meeting with Loretta Lynch was
such a mistake and there's such a
massive inflection point and like
whether or not it was spun up to
something that it should have been oh my
god I also was not thinking he was not
thinking very well there you know no
real really screwed the pooch on that
one yeah but I also you know to your
point that in the interview he talks
about that bedside moment with Ashcroft
and which is fascinating which is
fascinating you should go read the
transcript about it but um it's also
James came James Comey is also the
person who stood up for principle there
and so I what I do what I also
think is wrong is because James Comey
has caused this disaster I think it
could be too easy to dismiss him
outright and I do think it's important
that we maintain a complicated view of
James James Comey yeah look we talk all
the time about voters as pundits now
it's also something that infects like
bureaucrats and law enforcement
officials and other people in government
like when you be when you see the world
like a pundit does and you start judging
based on politics and you let the
politics in your head you're not gonna
make a very good decision yeah that's I
think that's a James Comey stopping FBI
director and became a pundit and it may
cause downfall of our country Jim Comey
drafted a letter because he went to 538
and figured out we're good million that
means he did see Nate Silver saying that
that letter did cause the outcome you
know here as well Stephanopoulos brought
it up to him he said Nate Silver was a
pretty compelling case for why it cost
the election and what Comey he said
something righteous I don't know he said
I only read the printed page let's talk
about Michael Cohen because it was a
very tough day in court fourteen crime a
federal judge rejected an attempt by
President Trump and Michael Cohen to
block prosecutors from reviewing
documents and communications that the
FBI took from Cohen's office and hotel
room the judge also forced Cohen to
reveal the name of the one client he had
tried to keep secret and that client is
longtime friend of the pod Sean Hannity
he surely not the Sean Hannity from
telling the very one the same let's uh
let's bring out the corkboard in that
red string here where does Hannity where
does he fit into this puzzle guys what
what why he's the piece that the dog got
and you didn't need anyway in terms of
the puzzle we like we know Michael cones
not a real lawyer he's a weird fixer it
does we implies taxicab medallions and
those other strange businesses the two
pieces of business he did that are
relevant here are essentially hush
payments to a very senior RNC official
and for Donald Trump we don't know what
Sean what he did what we don't know what
work he did for Sean but I mean I just
might sound good Michael Cohen is a
lawyer in the same way Sean Hannity as a
journalist right by the way like all
these people
Twitter now were like Sean Hannity going
to recuse himself from talking about
Michael Cohen what is this club I'm like
ya know up until today I thought handy
was a real straight-shooter that the
James Comey a Fox News they call him
recuse himself was he gonna sus wearing
out would talk about and Fox News
punishing him because he's a
psycho who goes on the air every night
and says whatever the hell he was he
said that he said that Hillary was in
cahoots with Whitey Bulger
we're all so disappointed that Sean
Hannity even revealed to her that he was
using Jones legal services they talk on
the phone every night yeah oh I'm so
disappointed it's so revealing to that
know what literally no human being on
earth was like you know it's just like
oh yeah I guess that makes sense moving
on sure Sean Hannity's explanation is oh
I think once I gave him $10 and super
real estate advisor and that he must
have taken that as attorney-client
privilege ya know yeah yeah that's what
you do when you submit submit documents
to court well so how screwed are Michael
Cohen and Donald Trump to be things like
what why works so hard to keep federal
prosecutors from even reviewing the
information seized in the FBI raid
before they could review it first I
don't know I mean Donald Trump doesn't
email who knows what written documents
he has I think what we know is that
Donald Trump has a business empire that
is built on working with a whole bunch
of corrupt people around the world it is
a total shell game like why I don't I
don't think he's actually successful
businessman I think he's likely engaged
in potentially criminal activities via
his businesses and Michael Cohen would
have the receipt
we also know that Michael Cohen's not a
very good lawyer he's incredibly stupid
he created these shell LLC's to make
these payments and use the same one over
and over again and that's how he got
buzz a hush money payments yeah he's not
a scrupulous individual he's not like
the understatement of the pot not a
scrupulous individual you know I was
also thinking like the Weinstein
all right dan this is it this is a huge
day for you on the pod not just because
you announced that you and Holly are
going to become parents for the first
time not just because you announced your
upcoming book but because yesterday
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan announced
that he will not seek re-election in
November the obituaries have all been
written the takes have all been taken
but Friends of the pod all over the
world have been waiting patiently to
hear from their favorite Paul Ryan hater
Dan give us your reaction well many
people have been calling for a ranch
don't don't give in don't give in to the
rent yet
don't act like you like when you get to
the end zone act like you've been there
before
look it is Paul Ryan is as responsible
for Donald Trump being president as any
person walking the planet today with the
possible exceptions of Vladimir Putin
and Jim Comey and because it's important
to remember that you know they're all
these they're been all these cakes which
say you know Paul Ryan's Republican
Party is gone it's been replaced by
Donald Trump's that's not what happened
what happened was people like Paul Ryan
were willing to cater to and coddle the
racist and within that within the
Republican Party in order to try to win
votes and they did that for so long that
before they knew it Donald Trump became
president and when Donald Trump was
running around spouting racist birther
conspiracies against Barack Obama did
Paul Ryan stand up and tell him to stop
nope all Ryan quietly fungus hung is
Paul Ryan quietly herded his sad eyes
and hopes for votes that would come from
that and so Paul Ryan leaving is great
it makes me happy
it's I'm glad he's leaving with his tail
between his legs and being exposed by
most people as the absolute fraud that
he is but we cannot he is not a victim
of what happened to the Republican Party
is the cause of what happened to the
Republican Party and that should not be
forgotten as we show in the next many
month
bidding him a long joyful
and I would also know many people have
said boys can be so boring we're gonna
miss these Paul Ryan ran far as we know
Paul Ryan's gonna be here until January
and he is gonna continue to protect kids
up to to protect want to obstruct
justice to enable corruption you get all
the things that piss you off that Paul
Ryan for another nine months so it's not
over yet yeah I am I found myself too
angry about Trump and Muller and
Rosenstein and like the Republican Party
you know just protecting and protecting
him and obstructing justice yesterday to
really have a lot of feelings about the
Paul Ryan thing like it's great that
he's gone it's great that he's leaving
but like I don't know he's doing it he's
just it's I guess I would have been more
upset if a lot of the takes yesterday a
lot of the pieces yesterday were saying
you know oh poor Paul Ryan and he was a
victim stuff like that I actually think
people people handled this pretty well
the media handled is pretty well
yesterday like Paul Ryan history will
not be kind to Paul Ryan and from
everything that I read yesterday from
maybe like 90% of the things I read
yesterday history is already not being
very kind to Paul Ryan and so I I think
that everyone most people in the media
have this exactly right what his role
has been in this entire Trump presidency
which is to enable the man at every step
because because not because like I have
come to I don't I don't think that it's
because Paul Ryan is some coward it's
because Paul Ryan since he entered
public life cares about one thing above
everything else he wants to empty the
federal treasury and give it to rich
people so that and then as a result make
sure that health care and education
programs are cut for everyone else
I mean he's told us as a million times
he talked about how in college when they
were around the keg you're dreaming of
you know cutting Medicare
he famously divided the country into
makers and takers people who make money
make a living and people who just take
from the government something that he
later apologized for but only because he
felt like he had to he really believes
in the makers takers thing and he was
willing to enable Donald Trump and
protect Donald Trump so that he could
achieve his goal of drastically cutting
the size of government cutting Medicare
which he didn't end up doing cutting
Medicaid but also passing a huge tax cut
for rich people this is what gets him up
in the morning this is what he wanted to
do and he decided early on that he would
tolerate the racism he would tolerate
the corruption he would tolerate the
attacks on the rule of law he would
tolerate this awful president and the
sexual harassment and the assault and
all this because he thought if
he pissed Trump off maybe he wouldn't
get this tax cut cast if he pissed Trump
off that maybe it would be harder for
him to achieve his legislative goals and
his legislative goals which are what he
believes is most important for the
country he genuinely believes the giving
tax cuts to millionaires and
billionaires and cutting Medicare and
Social Security in health care is the
best thing for the country
that's what Paul Ryan believes and so he
was like I will withstand anything to
get this done and that that's that is
the story of Paul Ryan speakership and
Paul Ryan's time in public life that is
a that is not a particularly generous
take on Paul Ryan but I think it's an
overly generous take on Paul Ryan it
would be the one place where I differ
with you which is Paul Ryan believes
Paul Ryan has been theoretically has
beliefs theoretically hmm but those
beliefs are in service of the party not
the country and like Obama was president
Paul Ryan was standing on the wall
screaming about a potential Greek like
debt crisis that would crush generation
and then he gets in power and we're
humpin control all the levers to cover
for the first time enough first thing he
does is pass a tax cut that would add a
trillion dollars to the deficit and what
don't
there was a way in which Paul Ryan if he
was sincere about his and Randy and Jack
Kemp Ian keg party believes Oh Kudo
oh but he's not sir he's not serious
about the deficit part yeah no that's oh
that was all a lie this whole idea that
he was like what seriously worried about
debts and deficit is a complete
lie what he used that as again as an
excuse to cut government down to its
bare bones I mean what you know the
famous quote from Grover Norquist like
we need to shrink government down to the
size where it can be drown in a bathtub
like that's what Paul Ryan believes in
he doesn't give a about deficits
and debt and all that kind of he
just he just put that out there during
the Obama presidency because what he
really wants is to just give huge tax
cuts to rich people to cut government
down to its bare bones and just have it
get out of the way he doesn't believe
that government should be helping
everyone he believes that people should
be helping themselves he is a survival
of the fittest Darwinian believer - it's
to his core that's what he believes I
think that's right the other point I
want to make is there was a way to be
for starving government to bathtub
drowning size and still stand up for the
rule of law yeah that's right against
corruption or or even express some
measure of concern about Trump's
behavior Paul Ryan's natural instinct is
he's basically RNC Chairman not Speaker
of the House and so he could very easily
his bed more strongly I don't think you
should fire Bob Muller but even capable
of saying that because that feels too
disloyal to the party and so when I like
over the last like this teen or so years
maybe before but as long as I've been
paying super close attention or Republic
to politics and butting heads with
Republicans is what defines the
Republican Party is boil tea to party
over country and Paul Ryan is the
absolutely Bob any of that he was born
in a college were at a college
Republicans test-tube hatched by call
road and it's been put in place to try
to push the Republican Party forward and
he decided that the to be loyal to Trump
instead of loyal to the kind
and that will be his legacy yeah I found
something interesting that Tim Alberta
wrote in Politico he told the story
about how on election night in 2016
Ryan was expecting a trump defeat and he
planned to deliver a speech that night
if Trump lost where he denounced Trump's
racially polarizing agenda as a
political dead end in a portrayal of
conservatism Zhai deals and instead when
Trump won Ryan just folded the speech
back into his jacket pocket
and that was that and and he just made
it he did he made a decision there that
when Trump won the only way see if Trump
had lost and he was facing a president
Hillary Clinton
Ryan would have been able to say yeah we
don't want Trump's racism that was just
a stain on our party and we're past that
now we need to get back to cutting taxes
for rich people and cutting Medicare and
Social Security we need to get back to
that but with Trump winning the
presidency instead he said if I and
now I actually have a chance to get
these things done and my only chance to
get them done is to make sure I kiss
this guy's ass every single day and
protect him at all costs and make sure
that I don't criticize him because then
people in my own caucus in the house
will kick me out of the speakership and
so it I don't care I don't care
about any of this I need to get I
need to get my legislative agenda passed
it's it's like he's like an ideological
zealot I mean that's the it's just the
ideology is you know the tiniest
government possible people invest why I
hate Paul Ryan more than hey much more
Howell and if you can make a real
argument for with Mitch McConnell is bad
he is incredibly effective at times I
mean there would probably be no more
consequential thing than a senate leader
has done other than block Merrick
garland Supreme Court even steel of
Supreme Court's beat from Barack Obama
and give it to a Supreme Court
appointment at the O Supreme Court
appointment for Barack Obama and give it
the dollar shop but that was amazing
consequential but what bothers me so
much about Bryan is Ryan thinks he's the
good guy in what's happening here he
does McConnell knows
McConnell has one ideology and that is
the accumulation of power at any and all
costs and he is he is comfortable with
that most of his staffers are
comfortable that they have decided that
they are the night king in this play
Paul Ryan thinks he's a good guy and
it's just me he has made so many moral
compromises in this he's made something
wrong compromises in order to justify
his ideological means that he has
completely lost track of who he is or
why he's doing what he's doing and he
knows Donald Trump is an absolute cloud
who should not be present at space he is
just too afraid to say that and that is
the mark of ultimate cowardice in my
dear exquisite presidential leadership
that's how he described Donald Trump
never forget that quote exquisite
presidential leadership look at the
Trump presidency this week look at the
headlines and think to yourself how
someone can bring themselves to call
this exquisite presidential leadership
that's Paul Ryan's legacy right there
why did he do this why did he do it now
dan do you have any thoughts on that I I
think he mean this has been a everyone
that's known this was coming
Matt fuller tuffington Post wrote a
story about this long time ago which was
DeMolay denied by everyone Ryan a
politican Alberta Politico wrote another
story which they Brian's people swore
and said was incorrect and wrong and
turned out to be absolutely correct and
so I think this was a little just giving
some voice to what people already knew
was true and it was beginning I think
was getting incredibly awkward within
the Republican caucus because Steve
Scalise and Kevin McCarthy the two
people who who want this job we're
already starting to organize their
campaigns behind his back and this is
essentially what Senator Harry Reid did
on the Democratic side which was he
announced he was retiring but stayed on
his leader until he retired and that
worked very well that was very clear and
I think Paul Ryan who looks at the
mirror and he's a good leader when is
she's good he should be saying
and confident fuckstick gonna follow
that model it is much less likely to
work in the Republican caucus because
there was a clear everyone had agreed
essentially on who carry replacement is
going to be Chuck Schumer and there was
no such agreement in the Republican
Party over who's gonna replace Ryan yeah
apparently Ryan has sort of stepped into
this this morning and said the he
doesn't expect that Scalise will run
against McCarthy for leader which is
sort of a signal to Scalise that maybe
he shouldn't which I thought was
interesting so you don't think that
Ryan's was doing this to spend more time
with his kids look I'm not gonna cry I'm
sure he wants to spend more time I'm
sure that's true not yeah who does it
like who doesn't want to spend more time
with their kids when they're flying back
and forth from DC yeah but I also think
if Donald Trump wasn't president if he
was Speaker of the House with a
president who was more ideologically in
tune with Paul Ryan without any of the
craziness of Donald Trump and he had a
chance to get entitlement reform done
and it didn't look like you know
Republicans were gonna lose the house
maybe he would have stuck around a
couple more years and then went home to
spend more time with his kids Oh
completely you know this is about the
fact that Republicans are he thinks that
there's a very very good chance
Republicans are with the house and he
does not want to be Minority Leader West
Tonka's president in part because as
Speaker he can somehow convince himself
that he's able to sleep at night by
saying he's trying to pass these
conservative principles the job of the
Minority Leader while Trump is president
if Republicans from the minority will be
to obstruct justice every single day OB
two-block investigations of the cover-up
for him and I presume he doesn't want
that job although they probably pretty
good at it cuz it's not that different
the what he's doing right now
no but it's it's like it's back to what
I was said at the beginning you're right
he doesn't he doesn't want that job
because there is no chance in that job
of actually getting his agenda passed
right I love that he'd told POLITICO he
hinted he quote he hinted at continuing
his work on curing poverty how's that
going
I've been going well for you curing
poverty cool that's there some crazy
ideas on carrying poverty from Paul Ryan
I didn't know I didn't know that giving
a trillion dollars to the largest
corporations and United States was gonna
cure poverty but who knows he also ruled
out out of the box thinker yeah that
that is true he ruled out running for
office again and ya know like you said
look 46:46 Republican House members have
announced they're not running again that
is a huge number of retirements someone
asked the the chair of the Congressional
the Republican Congressional Committee
if there'd be more retirements and he
said no no no more than ten more than
ten additional retirement and if there
were ten additional retirements that
would be 20% of all House Republicans
retiring so they don't feel too good
about 2018 I don't think was a huge
political winner you know we were told
there was an it's good sorry you can get
us Dennis I'm sorry Dennis Ross
he's never of Congress from a lean
Republican district in Florida midnight
yesterday but really think how to kiss
penises Davis because he like was all
teed up to go to announce his
resignation and then Paul Ryan decides
up and the whole new cycle all yeah not
great for him and he's from a seat in
Florida that's fairly conservative but
you know in a big wave election we would
have a chance at his seat and then Ryan
seat was moved from you know safe for
likely Republican to toss up or lean
Republican and all the different all the
different predictions so you know good
news for our friend iron stache
Randy Bryce of course he does have a
primary challenger Kathy Myers but and
so but good news for you know any
Democrat trying to run for Paul Ryan's
seat and yeah so we'll see
did you see you see the rumor that
Reince Priebus may yes that primary
because the problem is it's Paul vielen
I'm
who is too much of a white supremacist
that break board had to get rid of him
it's the current Republican candidate
and that's it do you know that news and
that rumor was that was broken here on
the pot save America live stream
yesterday by Paul Ryan's daughter Erin
Ryan no I do think it was completely
messed up to Paul Ryan did that whole
announcement and never everything Karen
and I recognizes I recognize it's
complicated because a relationship with
us but it seemed weird to just build
that family business out street like
that okay we're gonna move on from Paul
Ryan because we could be talking about
that all day if we wanted but there is a
a looming constitutional crisis in our
country here's how it all started on
Monday the US Attorney's Office for the
Southern District of New York executed
search warrants at the office in hotel
room of Trump's longtime personal lawyer
Michael Cohen where they seized business
records emails and documents related to
several topics payments to stormy
Daniels and another woman Trump had an
affair with Karen McDougal
communications around the Access
Hollywood tape evidence that they tried
to suppress damaging information about
Trump during the 2016 election and so
much more the reports are that the
United States Attorney's Office is
pursuing charges against Cohen for bank
fraud wire fraud and campaign violations
campaign fund sorry reports are that the
US Attorney's Office is pursuing charges
of bank fraud wire fraud and campaign
finance violations against Cohen
that means the bank fraud violation
would be if Cohen took out a loan from a
bank in order to pay stormy Daniels but
lied to the bank about what the loan was
for that would be bank fraud Trump's
Deputy Attorney General rod Rosenstein
signed off on the raid in order to get a
search warrant though prosecutors had to
convince a federal judge so you've had a
judge that signed off on the search
warrant
you had a Trump's deputy attorney
general that he appointed rod Rosenstein
and a whole bunch of other people prove
this and in order to do this they need
it to have overwhelming Evan
that there was criminal conduct by
Michael Cohen here Donald Trump reacted
to the news like any innocent man would
by having a complete meltdown on
national television during a national
security meeting about a potential
strike on Syria he called the criminal
we're doing this do do that unless you
so now we're live we're live here at pod
save America I'm John Favreau
they know I am and we have with us Paul
Ryan's daughter yes his real daughter
Erin Ryan uh commenting on her dad's
sudden retirement from Congress Paul
Ryan will not be seeking re-election in
2018 he will step down from as Speaker
of the House after the election also
probably because they will lose yeah he
he didn't want to be a weekend dad when
he was in the minority he wanted to be
he wanted to be a Taco Tuesdays he said
that only when you're Speaker it's no
biggie I've been playing this all
morning for that we have a statement
from noted Ryan hater Dan Pfeiffer Dan
sent in the statement he couldn't be
here today Paul Ryan may leave Congress
but the stain of his cowardice and
complicity will remain also congrats to
Brendan buck on his new role as a
crooked media contributor subtle
statement from Dan waters warm Brendan
do we have initial thoughts on this a
Paul Ryan family member let's talk he's
literally my father as we've as we've
been over before one thing you know and
I was kind of doing some research before
this cuz I I was feeling very gloaty
like almost overcome with the desire to
just be like yeah I learned in
researching for this that Paul Ryan used
to be a salesman for Oscar Mayer and
once got to drive the Wienermobile which
is my very favorite Paul Ryan fact
besides the fact that he is taking time
off from screwing everybody else's
family to spend time with his own family
surprising fact I don't even know I
think every target fits yeah I think
every car Paul Ryan is in is a
Wienermobile it just it reinforced
everything about Paul Ryan that I hate
like the guy all along you you look at
him in his eyes and you see how pained
he is about Donald Trump defending
racism in charlottesville and being a
big
anti Muslim president and during the
campaign Paul Ryan would say things like
when Donald Trump describes a judge as
being incapable of ruling on him fairly
because he's a Mexican that's a quote
Paul Ryan said that's a textbook example
of racism but when when Donald Trump got
power Paul Ryan lost the ability to
point out obvious facts now we know that
all along he's been a massive coward in
the face of this like rising fascist
president we have with no stakes he knew
he was gonna retire it didn't matter if
he remained a speaker it didn't matter
if he was re-elected he could have stood
up and had some guts and done these
things all along but he just didn't want
to he won his tax cut I'm like
that's all we that's what we know about
his character it's it's made me think
that maybe we were wrong all this time
and that Paul Ryan is not a coward and
that Paul Ryan is Marco Rubio would say
knew exactly what he was doing all along
that what was really important to him
was passing a tax cut for rich people
and that was way more important to him
than standing up to racism when Donald
Trump was racist than helping the
dreamers like he said he wanted to do in
his heart all these things he could have
done knowing that he probably was going
to retire and that it didn't matter if
he had to keep his job yeah I put the
DREAM Act on the floor it would have
passed with the majority could have
protected Bob Muller from firing didn't
do that could have not let Devin unas
run a counter investigation against the
FBI and the Department of Justice but he
let that happen and oh for a while
you're like well maybe he let that
happen because he was afraid because he
wanted to keep the House Majority
because he wanted to keep his job but
really he's just kind of shitty guy
mm-hmm and he also he also could have
allowed bills that would have forced
Donald Trump to release his tax returns
could have bailed out and they didn't
because of him
he he is like the worst kind of shitty
guy because he was shitty but he was
also a little inept because he didn't
get all the things done that he wanted
to get done like if he were actually
better at evil he would have gotten in
addition to getting his like precious
tax cuts he would have been able to
dismantle Medicaid dismantle Medicare
but he didn't do those things because
he's not good enough at being the sort
of piece of that he wishes he was
and and that to me gives me a little bit
of comfort but at the same time makes me
angry like he's
so he's such a benign like good speech
giver that at first you're like why am i
why am i angry at this man but then the
more you think about it the more it's
like oh my god here's another thing that
I was thinking about today he I think
it's honorable for somebody to want to
spend more time with their family of
course good for him but he is also
somebody who's advocated for cutting
programs that help other people who need
help raising their families so like poor
kids are supposed to somehow raise
themselves but his kids need a mom and a
dad around to give them the time that
they need Paul Rep Paul Ryan gets to
retire at 48 years old and everyone else
has to retire way past 65 yeah because
he wants to dismantle Social Security
and Medicare and make them work longer
he sucks
he's convinced the entire DC pundit and
like press infrastructure that he is a
wonk that he's someone key thoughtful
guy he's never actually shown an
original thought that wasn't slashing
taxes and slashing services for
individuals and like that's not an
honorable thing that's not a wonky thing
it's not a thoughtful or new or
especially exciting policy prescription
that's what big interests have wanted
all along and like I don't understand
why we treat this guy like he's sort of
above the rest I guess is because you
know the bar is set by like Blake
Farenthold like running around in his
pajamas sexually harassing literally
everyone he comes encounter with so I
get yes Paul Ryan is better than that
piece of garbage but enough of this
guy's go away there's a great point like
emptying the United States Treasury
giving it all to rich people in
corporations so that you can cut all the
other programs that are helping people
it's not super wonky that's a pretty
easy thing to figure out I don't know if
you need like a policy degree to push
that agenda pretty simple to figure out
pretty simple to understand just wants
to cut government give it to rich people
yeah have you ever been in a
conversation with somebody where you're
like oh nobody's ever told you that
you're an idiot I feel like he's he's
been able to live
[Laughter]
through his whole career being touted as
this walk and I think he's as much a
wonk as he as a person who's finished a
marathon in under three hours which is
to say that he hasn't finished a
marathon in under three hours and he
isn't along he's not that smart of a guy
it is interesting though to talk about
why he was seen as a wonk you know in
the Obama presidency when everyone in DC
was very upset that Barack Obama did not
balance the budget did not have fiscal
responsibility you know did not reach
out to Republicans to do bipartisan
they needed some hero on the other side
of the aisle and they couldn't have the
people who are yelling you lie or being
outwardly racist towards President Obama
right they needed someone young and
good-looking and like I'm all I'm Paul
Ryan I'm just here to I got my numbers
and my calculator and I'm just trying to
fix the budget and I'm a real hero and
I'm amazed he's good with the Washington
press corps his staff had great
relationships with the Washington press
corps and so because of that they've
made him this hero but maybe
he's not like the other Republicans
maybe he's maybe he's thoughtful you
know and it just shows how easily the DC
press occurs often fooled yeah and I
think it's also the DC press corps and
I'm from New York so I guess I'm part of
the problem but I think that people
really love to construct narratives
where they don't necessarily exist one
person will have an idea and someone
else would be like well that feels
narratively comfortable instead of it
being factually true and then they'll
just run that all the way to the end
zone
all of a sudden you get there and you're
like wait a second this never was the
case this is just a narrative that
everybody agreed was true and it never
never was so Elijah yelling and barking
at us to get to some questions get to
some questions knocking yeah you can
hear him
Carmen Yeager asks in the larger scheme
what does this mean I rhymed who would
take over his role as Majority /
hopefully Minority Leader is that person
going to be even worse than Paul Ryan
yeah probably yeah probably my Kevin
Kevin McCarthy or congressman Scalise
who's very extreme in a whole lot of
ways mm-hmm yeah or it could just be
like a Breitbart social media editor
that they just find yelling it at ethnic
people somewhere perhaps just a Russian
maaaa 29 with 20 followers yeah and with
like 15 letters at the end well funny
you should say that because the the
frontrunner to replace him in his
district Karen McKinnon raises this guy
named Paul nailin who was so extreme he
used to be one of Breitbart Slyke
right-wing darlings but the dude is like
a literal Nazi post memes all the time
showing like Jews in the Oval Office
announced by Breitbart Wisconsin Nazi
which dude what's that wrong side you
were on the wrong side of the
mason-dixon slept like what are you what
are you Confederate Nazi stuff that's
come on Dave no well there was like I'm
from the north part of the state so not
not Ryan's district I'm from the
district that is represented by Sean
Duffy who used of real-world overt and
lumberjack of real world fame who is
like Paul Ryan but stupider somehow but
one thing that I that I can assure
listeners viewers whatever they're not a
ton of Nazis in Wisconsin that's not a
very good common thing so he's like it
not only is a Breitbart pariah
self-funding wealthy Nazis which he
apparently is one too yes like raising
his own but he's like a Bond villain TV
aged scary even Paul Ryan's political
operation put out a statement attacking
him today they don't want him to win
that seat but so the filing deadline in
Wisconsin and the Wisconsin first
District where Paul Ryan which Paul Ryan
represents is June so probably a couple
other Republicans there will jump in
this race they weren't gonna jump in
before because rights from that district
I feel like Reince Priebus is oh my god
I don't know that would be please run
right from this but they did get in the
arena the cook Political Report you know
Chris Paul although all the political
rankings out there moved the seat now
from safe Republican or likely
Republican to toss-up or lean
Republicans so very good news for iron
stache Randy Bryce he's also got an
opponent as well in the primary Cathy
Meyers so there it's much more likely
the Democrats win this seat back to the
leadership question though yeah so it's
McCarthy versus Scalise probably
McCarthy probably has the lead there
McCarthy of course if you want a real
Trump apologist this is a guy who picks
out Trump's favorite starbursts what was
the color Kevin McCarthy was also too
stupid to be able to hide the fact that
the Benghazi investigations were about
hurting Hillary in the election he went
out and said look look what we did to
her with you know with all these
investigations I mean he was so him
handed and stupid politically that he
actually maybe could help us so I think
that's fine Katie to us how do you think
this change is taking back the house I
don't think it changes taking back the
house really I think it's just it's
another retirement which is which is
great and so now we could possibly get
Paul Ryan's seat back I think it does
though it takes a big time fundraiser
off the field and I do think it this is
sending a message in the signal to all
these corporate donors who like sprinkle
some to the winners but give a little to
the people they think will be the losers
just like stay in the game that they
need to hedge their bets big time away
from Republicans I also think that he
that Paul Ryan for some people in the
party who were maybe starting to be
pushed toward the edge by Trump were
reassured by his presence as the like
I'm an adult in the room which was just
kind of cosplay of being the adult he's
like sorta you know if you kind of turn
the TV way down and you only almost hear
what words he's saying he looks like he
might have some confidence and might be
a normal person and I'd imagined that
suburban voters like suburban white
women for instance who usually vote
Republican might not be as a shirt
reassured by a party that doesn't have
somebody like Paul Ryan that's one less
reassuring guy that is that is that
something comfortable to them yeah you
got to imagine to that other members of
the Republican House caucus that were
weighing retirement now that they see
Paul Ryan heading for the exits it might
make their decision there's a finite
number of lobbying jobs on K Street so
you got to get in line I just want to
flag that Travis how wig from our team
says yellows oranges
are the best so who Travis Peka Peka
pretty nice knowing you pal
John Kanaan's asked do you think he I
seen that to Paul Ryan not Travis wants
to run for president in 2020 or beyond
yeah I think once you're on the ticket
he was the vice presidential nominee
once you get the taste I want to get the
tastes yeah it's like um anyway you know
what I was going for once you get the
taste he probably wants to run again
best of luck
great there was not any there was zero
constituency for Paul Ryan in the
leadership role in the house because the
parties moved so crazy to the right
imagine him running in Iowa do you think
he will join a cannabis organization a
cannabis company like our the last
Speaker of the House John Boehner did
today in other speaker news that story
that is a great story John Boehner is
good now John Boehner is Don John
banners daughter is actually married to
a man who was born in Jamaica and had a
minor pot charge on his record they I
think they married in like 2013 or
something which I think is like totally
cool yeah no judgment whatsoever but I
just think it's funny that he's sort of
changing like as soon as Dick Cheney had
a member of his family that that was not
a straight person he came around on LGBT
issues now Boehner has sort of become
like oh yeah real human beings are
affected by marijuana laws what that's
crazy so let's I'm I would love to
brainstorm like how like how could Paul
Ryan be affect maybe he'll get to know
someone or someone his family will marry
someone who's on Medicare or Social
Security yeah that'd be good yeah maybe
one of his children will graduate from
high school and want to be in a job that
doesn't necessarily have insurance it
comes with it maybe they want to be an
actor creative a writer or something
like that
maybe he'll knows he'll run into someone
who makes minimum wage yeah maybe maybe
he'll it might run into a person in
Wisconsin who makes minimum wage
we're all very wealthy do you think he
john bainer accidentally ate the wrong
gummy bear over Christmas when urine was
like whoa well that would make me want
to make this a resolution like would
make me be like no nobody's yeah I read
a bit I've read that as well oh yeah
someone said let's talk about Syria
please I don't know who it is but I
think that's that's for you Tommy
Robin finished ed says there he goes
I don't know what is there to say I
think Trump's deliberating right now
with the steady hand of John Bolton at
the tiller I mean like we just step back
we'll make this a broad conversation I
mean the fact that they brought they
brought the pool into I think the
Cabinet Room to get a video of his
deliberation with his national security
team about what to do after a horrific
chemical weapons attack and his response
was just to pop off about Muller so that
I think speaks to how distracted he is
he also canceled his trip to a major
summit in Latin America that is it like
you just take yourself off the
battlefield there you're missing out on
enormous security conversations that are
important Barack Obama when we started
the Libya operation launched strikes
from Brazil we were there literally
launching missiles from Brazil I mean
that's not like to say the whole thing
went perfectly but you need to be able
to walk and chew gum at the same time
let's be honest he didn't he cancelled
the summit not because of Syria
at home and tweet and watch boxing go
golfing been like make sure he could see
the news on the right time zone yeah I
mean like I just hope the press corps
this time doesn't get so you know this
is the moment you have debated by a few
missile strikes on an abandoned runway
what I noticed there's news say that
that Russian military is moving into the
town where there was the purported
chemical weapons attack why do you think
that's happening to mop up keep people
out of there do whatever they can to
cover dogs are complicit but you also
have Trump tweeting like completely
crazy things at Putin about how the very
smart bombs and missiles are gonna fly
and you can't stop them I mean we've
escalated from talking to Kim don't
talking to Kim jong-un to Putin
it's a dangerous game here also the
thing about missiles kind of directly
contradicts what Donald Trump thinks we
can do with missile defense like he
thinks he couldn't shoot missiles down
from the sky but nobody could shoot our
meals down from the sky which is an
insane separable it was also a crazy set
of tweets right next to each other one
where he's talking about watch out
Russia we're gonna shoot your missile
you know and then the next tweet is like
you know all this bad blood with Russia
it's all the fault of the corrupted
grass and Bob Muller blamed imagine that
Russia in turf America Paul Ryan news
like sort of took precedence over this
but like he's Donald Trump is talking
about the country that interfered with
our elections that attacked us and he's
saying it's actually the Democrats fault
FBI's fault look it's not invading
Ukraine it's not supporting a guy who's
gassing his people it's Bob Muller I
think what's what I guess the silver
lining of this is when we have a
president who isn't Donald Trump every
time they go back to a boring norm we
will experience it as a new feeling like
oh dad to eat a crab ething at the
President of Mexico about his daughter
what we're seeing right yeah oh my stars
he did attend a thing that every other
president before Donald Trump attended
and didn't cancel the weekend so he
could play golf and he angered tweet at
Fox News like it'll be nice to
rediscover the norms was really will be
done she bowls us is there any
possibility that the bipartisan bill to
have the firing of special counsel
expeditiously reviewed will get any
I'm ready welcome to pod save America
I'm John Favreau
I'm John love entire vitor on the pod
today we'll have Tommy's interview with
community activist Barry Axios about the
protests in Sacramento over the shooting
of Stephan Clarke then later we'll be
talking to Anna Marie Cox about the
brand-new season of with friends like
these will be in Florida later this week
there are still some tickets available
one or two just one or two for clear for
clear water from Miami Miami and for
Orlando listen you're on the fence about
coming to love it or leave it in Miami I
want you to know that if you're worried
about being able to get good seats
put that worry out of mind what's in the
news John anyway the news we're
recording this by the way I should just
talk about the elephant in the room
we're recording this on Monday evening
it's an experiment to see what it would
be like to discover we don't like
recording on Monday evenings I'm having
a great time so yeah love it has just
love it has been in a fit today I don't
know about this evening recording has
been hanging over my head it cast a pall
over the whole day anyway let's start
with the news so we haven't had a
full-blown Trump Twitter meltdown in a
while but we were treated to one on
Easter Sunday that has basically lasted
through right before we started this
podcast he was still tweeting
about immigration hey John a couple of
minutes ago hey John just Johnny an
nominations hey John
have you heard the good news that's an
Easter an Easter thing stop dating is
gonna be a Christian sort of crickets
after that joke what joke
so in this tweet storm that started on
Easter Trump attacked some of his old
favorites got Amazon the FBI the
Department of Justice CNN MSNBC but the
real focus was immigration it seems as
if the president United States was
triggered by a Fox and Friends segment
about hundreds of people from Central
America who were traveling through
Mexico to seek asylum in the United
States Trump said they're coming to take
advantage of daca which is extra stupid
because
a he canceled daca and B daca only
applies to the children of immigrants
who've been here since 2007 he was
confronted with this conundrum today
during the Easter Egg Roll when cNN's
Jim Acosta yelled to him but mr.
president didn't you kill daca and then
Trump just stared at him and didn't say
anything so why is Trump suddenly so
upset about immigration I mean there's
lots of Fox and Friends segments usually
they lead him to tweet something and
then he moves on but this has really
stuck with him now for 48 hours yeah I
mean what we should the the the piece in
question was about a caravan of folks
from Central America Muslim from
Honduras with a group called people
Without Borders going north through
Central America it's an annual journey
this happens every year threatening
awareness about people who are seeking
asylum from government oppression or
horrible crime mostly from organized
crime and so Fox and Friends rather than
calling these people asylum seekers
called them a small army of migrants
marching towards the United States so
that is starts with just horrific racist
framing they accused the Mexican
government of being complicit in this
what this stems from though as seemingly
a concerted effort from the High
Priestess on down of the Mogga movement
and Coulter Sean Hannity Jean Pierre Oh
Lou Dobbs to attack him on immigration
because he has not yet built a wall
because he's an idiot and doesn't know
how to legislate and get anything out of
Congress and they rolled him in the
omnibus bill I mean let yeah let's
unpack that let's let's start with the
High Priestess of the mock movement
because she is not too happy Ann
Coulter's sat down with Frank Bruni of
the New York Times for an interview
where she basically said that Trump not
building the wall would be more of a
betrayal than implementing the
principles of the communist manifesto
she said that there's a new category of
voters now called former Trump errs and
this should be terrifying to the
president
she's now counting herself almost is a
former Trump or unless he surprises her
builds the wall the conundrum of course
is that he probably will not be able to
build the wall love it what do you think
it's interesting so first of all it's
always surprising to see what like so
when Ann Coulter turns her sort of evil
mechanical mind towards attacking
someone we disagree with it's
interesting to see cuz oh she is good at
this right she is good at this like even
just saying there's a new category of
people former Trumpets it's a persuasive
interesting way of framing things I you
know Trump to me I think there's two
things going on I think one all this
news about people being angry about him
that immigration has clearly gone to him
it got to him before it's why he
threatened to veto the Omnibus was in
part because people were anger angry his
you know the Huckabee's of the world
were angry at him about the wall funding
so he was definitely looking for
something to latch on to he also is very
good about attaching himself to kind of
bite-sized versions of giant
controversies in part because he knows
it's effective and partly also that's
the biggest amount of information he can
process so so this is one of those great
perfectly built Trump things right it's
easily understandable here these people
they're coming towards him I'm trying to
start a scary image and so it's a place
for him to reassert himself with these
hardliners and remind them that he's on
their side and so he sees no downside to
it so he's enjoying it and by the way
it's all icky
it's all like he's this is not an
example where it's like he just passed a
corporate tax bill and now he's screwing
up his message or he just gave a State
of the Union where he didn't
himself so now he's stepping on this
message it's been basically two weeks of
Muller and stormy Daniels so whatever
let her rip you know rage away you know
it's interesting though it's this would
have been the perfect story for Trump
the 2011 leader of the birther movement
as he is outside of government outside
of politics and just someone tweeting
and yelling about everything yeah you
can see the frustration where now he's
President of the United States and all
he can do is he can talk about the story
then he's like Congress act build wall
dhaka cancelled like he doesn't he
doesn't have any levers to pull because
he is not very good at this job I mean
he he had a chance to he had a chance to
the wall at one point Chuck Schumer put
the wall on the table if all
Trump was willing to do was to offer the
dreamers a path to citizenship and he
didn't take it because Stephen Miller
told him no no that deals not good
enough we need cuts to legal immigration
in addition to getting the wall you kid
to the wall and because he scuttled that
deal because Trump said no now he's come
to realize he's never getting the wall
because he doesn't have the votes in
Congress to get the wall and he thinks
that the military is gonna do it on
their own and so you got defense
secretary Jim mattis drawing up all
kinds of options for him basically just
to placate him because the military
can't do the Pentagon can't do this on
their own right yeah it's a even even if
you take that I don't even accept that
excuse that oh he didn't want to do the
deal because Stephen Miller talked him
out of it the thing that you hear from
all these stories about what it's like
to be in this White House is ultimately
Trump is extremely indecisive yeah and
deciding to make a deal like I I wanna
come back to it when when he was talking
about the Omnibus he made a snaky remark
about Obama he said Obama even signed a
bigger one and then he added a sentence
which was and I bet he wasn't too happy
about it and it's the only time I've
ever seen Donald Trump had not
acknowledged the fact that Barack Obama
has an interior life but also but even
putting that aside it's a reminder of
the fact that he's facing these
presidential decisions and deciding to
say it's a screw Stephen Miller go
against Paul Ryan go to Chuck Schumer
and say I'll give you your I'll give you
daca you give me 25 billion it's the
decision only a president can make
there's no one who's gonna tell him yes
or no it's a final moment where it comes
to him and I don't think he's up for it
I don't think I don't think in that
moment he could make that kind of a deal
just real quick on the on the high
priestess Trump's immigration plans are
basically plagiarized from her book
which was called adios America the less
plan to turn our country into a
third-world hellhole
catchy title she is she's vile she
settles hate for a living because to
admit she's playing Trump brilliant here
she knows where the leverage is she
knows how to play him shows how to play
the New York Times the article was a
little chummy for my taste and like when
she comes out and says well we loved
from because he doesn't care about the
opinions of Manhattan's sophisticates as
a New Canaan High School
and Cornell University grad currently
living in New York I nearly threw up
onto the keyboard of my laptop but to
your point like she'd like these people
are coming at him hard and he is now in
charge and he is no more leverage
anywhere legislatively and Paul Ryan
ignored him everyone in Gordon but but
she's not that's also correct like I
know that she's a hypocrite it doesn't
actually care but that does speak to it
is true that he has kind of refused to
do the things that he does seem to be
kind of captured by the Paul Ryan's that
tell him the things he cannot do in a
way that Ann Coulter thought he might be
the one person who wouldn't be captured
by that group she I mean her point is
basically he could cheat I think she
said in the thing he could she could
literally slip I think she said in the
interview that Trump could sell Trump
products from the oval office if he got
the wall built like they literally care
about nothing else
and because he's failed to do that
central promise they're losing these and
he's getting that I mean the Washington
Post that he was privately grousing that
his supporters are gonna start getting
pissed that he didn't build the wall a
bunch of his guests at mar-a-lago
brought it up over the weekend
like you said Tommy Jeanine Pirro Sean
Hannity former Fox executive bill Cheyne
was there pause for a moment and just
recognize that what you just said is
very terrible I do know that
what a horrible cocktail party those are
the people that are giving him advice
standing in the corner with a drink
being like there is no movement is so
lame oh my god I don't want to leave
this person out though yeah The Daily
Beast has a fantastic story about Lou
Dobbs and how he was he's been on
speaker phone in the Oval Office during
meetings because this is a great what
sets Dobbs apart is the degree to which
the president views him as a political
and populism Godfather The Magus
Socrates to Trump's Plato let's just be
clear for a second no one in history has
ever looked up to Lou Dobbs
he was like an also-ran to CNN idiot he
was a birther didn't leave Healy he was
Jewish and then he left the dock during
the heat during the dot-com bubble
he ran space.com that was like one of
the things he
and then now he's relegated to Fox
Business he's like the triple a ball of
a fox right where he floats trial
balloons like the US Marshal should
arrest Obama if he criticizes Trump
because that's not appropriate like he's
just some crazy old lunatic who gets
patched into Oval Office phone calls now
it does seem pretty clear though that we
are going to because this is what the
base this is what gets the base up in
the morning at least the Mogga base and
Ann Coulter and those people they that
all of these candidates are going out
Republican candidates are going to run
on immigration and be talking about
immigration and trying to find not just
not talking about the policy but trying
to find these stories you know these
vivid stories of caravans or ms-13 or
gangs and they want to run on this from
now until November and I guess the
question is what did Democrats do what
happens with daca there's a Bloomberg
story today Jackie Rosen in Nevada said
she's discussing it in her race everyday
obviously there's a big population of
dreamers in Nevada Ted Cruz on the other
hand in Texas is also discussing it in
his race everyday thinking that it will
energize his base to talk about how he
stood stood against it so what do you
guys think the proposing that we use
military funds take away military funds
to build the wall that ad writes itself
like you imagine images of guns in body
armor and tanks being literally ripped
out of the hands of US service members
the fact that they think that
immigration is a more salient issue for
their racist base is instructive I would
like to see Democrats use that to fight
on the other thing they're tannic though
it is the AP reported there's some
people close to Trump suggested creating
a GoFundMe for the wall which is just so
perfectly stupid I wish Dan were here
today to talk more about it all four
guys but like you know I think this
issue were like daca is a great thing
for Democrats to talk about because it
is such a wildly popular issue but I do
think there is some risk more broadly
for Democrats on immigration yeah you
know I think we shouldn't be afraid to
talk about it when we're talking about
immigration I don't know that I would
make that the heart of what we're
talking about right now I'm much more
interested you know Jonathan Chait wrote
this piece about corruption I don't know
if I'd make corruption the centerpiece
of it versus health care the economy
whatever but
I certainly don't think we should be
afraid of saying that Donald Trump made
a whole bunch of promise as an
immigration couldn't keep a single one
of them refused to help these kids
didn't get as well didn't get anything
done didn't solve a compromise didn't
address the problem and that's it and I
don't mean to be than that look I still
we always like what should they talk
there's a whole bunch of things
Democratic and eights are going to talk
about now I think that there's a reason
that helping the dreamers polls at 70 80
90 % and Democrats can feel confident
going out there even if you are running
in a state that doesn't have a big
dreamer population saying young people
who are here who were brought here
through no fault of their own who were
working who were in college were
studying they deserve to have a chance
to become US citizens and they deserve
not to be deported back to countries
that they've never lived in before I
think that is a fairly popular message
and I don't think anyone should feel
afraid of it Yeah right like should you
run on health care should run encryption
yeah of course you should you should
emphasize all those things I mean I
think the corruption issue is
interesting because I just think it
leaves something off I think we should
talk about Trump's corruption and the
administration's corruption all day long
but we need to make sure every time we
talk about it we connect it to those
policies that are actually affecting
people's lives thank you if you're
technically connected to tax cuts you
connected to all these things that are
having you know he's yeah he's doing
this for him here's how it's hurting him
right like Scott Pruett is in a you know
in a house for $50 a month or whatever
he's paying for his room with a subway
Club Card meanwhile the and meanwhile
the lobbyist whose house that he's in
he's renting from got their project
improve at EPA and that's screwing
people over that you have to finish
drawing the line yeah I know it's like a
12th order political issue but it is
like again and again and again Mexico is
like our biggest trading partner they're
our close ally and security and economic
and cultural ways he's just rupturing
the relationship day after day tweet
after tweet I mean I think it fixed it
the foreign minister had to respond that
like this inaccurate news report should
not serve to question the cooperation
between the two countries it's a big
deal to keep kicking allies in the teeth
for no reason when you're wrong and for
naked political purposes I think that's
and I might say the world point no I
think it's a big it's a it's a big issue
because someday down the line we are
going to need allies to work
with us on something that has to do with
the security of the American people how
to safety the American people and at
some point they're going to say off
because we have been treated so badly by
you're starting to see an end litical
systems they in they're running against
him now and that's not just like a
foreign policy nerd point that's a like
that's gonna hit people at home insert a
point and also we're just so a mesh
toons are the Trump drama Dhaka is
incredibly important immigration is a
huge and growing problem that needs to
be addressed the fact that we have
millions and millions of people who have
to live in the shadows in this country
because we haven't given them any kind
of path to legalization is a huge
problem right there are huge immigration
problems we need to address that we've
been trying to address for basically 30
years and now this debate has been
reduced to border wall versus daca kids
and we can't even get that piece of it
done yeah
and that that's a good point is that it
is that is way too small of a debate
okay every Democrat should not be also
not be afraid of saying our immigration
system is badly broken and it has been
for a long time and we need to fix it
somehow and that includes daca that
includes legal immigration that includes
border security includes like all kind
of interior enforcement and what the
 Isis doing which is awful and
there's a whole bunch of things and by
the way figuring out a way to talk about
border security confidently in a way
that doesn't abandon the core compassion
and principles of Democrats right I
think right now
Democrats are skittish to even talk
about border security at all because
it's become a trump issue but border
security is gonna be part of any answer
to this and so finding a new way has to
be and finding a new way to talk about
this where we are extremely critical of
ice
we were extremely convicted critical of
policies to rip a Malay apart well fine
and by the way recognize that there's an
argument about American workers who feel
as though immigration doesn't help them
like finding ways at that to talk about
immigration as a way of talking about
how to help American workers
undocumented people securing the border
getting all of that into a language that
doesn't alienate Democrats who are
afraid of people capitulating to Trump I
think is a really hard problem and and
we're already okay welcome to pod save
America I'm Jon Favreau I'm Dan Pfeiffer
later in the pod will be talking with
our good friend former Hillary Clinton
campaign communications director
Jennifer Palmieri who's written a new
book called dear madam president an open
letter to the women who will run the
world there's still some tickets to our
Florida shows we'll be there next week
check it out on Comm slash events for
POD schedule we are trying something new
den where we actually are going to
record monday's pod monday night and put
it out Tuesday morning first thing
because we are reclaiming our Sundays I
know you've done that for a year and a
half now so I'm happy for you guys yeah
we're gonna test it out we'll see if
everyone freaks out also that works
because our normal Thursday pod next

restaurant has a bottomless mimosa
Sunday brunch and invest in it in West
Hollywood
yeah that's that's what I'll be doing
Sunday no I'll actually be going my
parents for Easter okay so I haven't
talked to you since the March for our
lives last weekend but I saw on Twitter
that you spoke at the March in San
Francisco how was that I mean I did it
was very nice of them to invite me to do
it
and it was almost entirely students and
then a couple politicians and one
podcaster who were sort of interesting a
little bit about our experiences in the
battle for fur gun for gun control and
introducing the student and so it was
really a wonderful experience the people
the students I met there were just
unbelievable the discussion was very
broad-based in a way that I think it's
important that it just wasn't just about
shootings in schools like parkland it
was about gun violence writ large about
police shootings about just I mean just
the
you know there are a lot of people who
were representing organizations or who
who were in schools or communities who
have to live with gun violence every day
but it doesn't make she and then in the
New York Times or I must have EC or
whatever else and people were fired up
in a but in an inspirational way like it
was not anger yeah and this this has
been the trend I've seen with every
march or protests we've been to is it'd
be so easy to be angry and about it the
people is really like this joyousness of
being together to push or something real
is really it was it was a really special
experience at my parents and toe Holly
was there it was wonderful yeah I was
talking with Lovett about that too
because he was saying like it's a good
place for everyone who's been so angry
about everything to show up but I was
saying you don't see that anger at the
March like you saw in 2010 with some of
the Tea Party rallies you know like the
Tea Party town halls and rallies were
not like joyous peaceful gatherings
there's a lot of angry people that rose
yelling on TV and I didn't see that at
the Women's March I didn't see that at
the March for our lives we should talk
about some of the reaction to the March
first of all it drove all of the worst
people in politics absolutely insane so
yet Congressman Steve King from Iowa
noted racist attacked Emma Gonzales for
wearing a Cuban flag on her jacket Erick
Erickson at red state spread false
rumors at friend of the pod David hog
wasn't actually at the school during the
shooting which he later had to correct
and Laura Ingraham mocked hog for not
getting accepted to his favorite
colleges last night
she mocked a 17 year old shooting
survivor for not getting into college
because she doesn't like his political
views I wish that was a joke I see these
attacks is sort of evidence that the
Parkland students are winning and that
the people in right wing entertainment
really don't know how to deal with it
what do you think I mean there are a
couple of things that play here first
Nate Silver had a tweet this morning
that said something to the effect of
look it's not that the Parkland kids
have been spot on everything they've
done there's been some things they've
said that it's been off tone or maybe
not exactly right in the moment but the
fact that they are so good at political
communication they're as good
application as pundants and put up and
cable hosted political operatives we've
been doing this for years it's
threatening to those people and which is
why they they act the way they do right
and so if you've spent years toiling
away in the Fox News greenroom now
working your way up from the five to Fox
and Friends to Ingram angle and then all
of a sudden some kid walks out of high
school and is good is good at being a
pundit as you are that's probably
threatening the other thing is that the
incentives structure in Trump's
Republican Party is to be as big an
 as possible that's how you get
clique that's how you get attention if
they get a presidential pat on the back
and so people are trying they what they
want to appeal to not just trumpet the
people they trumped appeal to and you
get that by being an not by
being understanding or thoughtful and
that's how people like learning are gosh
a miss to begin with and you're right it
is if you watch the panic in the eyes
the nra and dana loesch they can feel
the political terrain shifting
underneath them and the only way they
know how to react is to lash out in ad
hominem attacks against high school kids
and so it's a sign of everything that's
that is wrong about political industry
everything that's wrong with her with
the Republican Party a conservative
movement and everything that is right
about where where the politics on guns
is going in this country it's like high
school not just high school students
high school students who have survived a
school shooting like I just I can't put
myself in the minds of these people like
there's one of the Parkland students
this young man named Kyle he's much more
Republican in his positions on gun
control and he's been out there speaking
as well and obviously like I don't agree
with a lot of the policies he's pushing
but I can't imagine in a million years
going online and starting to yell about
this kid and criticize him
especially because of what he's just
been through you know like I don't I
don't understand these people like well
you know what what what brings them to
think to themselves like yeah it's a
good idea to spend my like eric erickson
looks like obsessed with
everything that David Hogg says and does
you look at his Twitter feed and like
it's all about David hog all the time
like what is with the weird obsession
with these high school students you know
I just I don't understand it it like
there's an important point you make
about this kid Kyle which is it is okay
like you don't have to you don't have to
pretend to agree with emma gonzales or
kirk cameron county or david hager
anyone wait you can have a nurse Kenan
should be a debate about their points
they've inserted themselves into a
national debate and they are not immune
from criticism or disagreement about
what they're saying but they are in the
arena that is fair and that goes for
people on the other side as well by what
they have not I mean it's just you're a
new era it's it takes a special kind of
 to decide that the way to
respond to that it's not substantive but
you try to tear them down it just it is
it mean it's why we have Trump this is
exactly there is a there is a market for
being an in the Republican Party
and easy Bo responding to the
marketplace yeah there's a sickness and
it is a sickness that is much more
prevalent on one side right now one
interesting reaction to the March came
from a retired Supreme Court Justice
John Paul Stevens who wrote an op-ed in
the New York Times calling for the
repeal of the Second Amendment
this led Donald Trump to tweet in all
caps the Second Amendment will never be
repealed and then Chuck Schumer
immediately said that's not the
Democrats position repealing an
amendment a constitutional amendment
requires a two-thirds majority vote in a
house in the Senate or a constitutional
convention called by two-thirds of state
legislatures dan how likely is this to
happen it is impossible it's not going
to so why do we think students did this
he I mean even this is making a I don't
to be honest on the answer but I think
he's making a point that
uh that it were not for I guess I put
this way I am confused by here at this
point because it conflicts with his
dissent in the Supreme Court decision
that held that the second amendment
meant that people had a right to bear
arms yeah in the way in which we
commonly think about it this is DC
versus Heller and and Sanders in the
dissent and the majority won and so here
there are couple things that I thought
Matt Iglesias a Vox had a good point
about this Democrats don't have to
repeal the Second Amendment there's
actually a lot of gun control that we
can pass that the Supreme Court has
essentially held is consistent with the
Second Amendment an assault weapons ban
limit on high-capacity clips no open
carry yeah I know if we carry universal
background checks because in Scalia's
opinion and Heller he makes it clear
that this is the right to bear arms is
not an unlimited right but it's also
worth noting that prior to he'll her if
there was real disagreement about
whether the specific wording of Second
Amendment as a related to the right to
bear arms as part of a well-regulated
militia meant that people can own
handguns had a had a constitutional
right to own a handgun own a rifle
whatever that is and it was only in a
5-4 Court decision that held that up to
that point it'd been as I understand it
an untested yeah constitutional question
and so we actually don't need to repeal
the Second Amendment we should pass a
whole bunch of laws that have broad
bipartisan support in this country that
are consistent with the Second Amendment
as interpreted in this Heller decision
and I would frankly like to see a
Supreme Court arguing for Supreme Court
I'd like to see Democrats arguing that
if elected to the presidency we will
appoint Supreme Court justice who who
will do a certain set of things
including overturned statistician I did
but also overturn the Heller decision
totally agree that like now a couple
people were saying that Stephens by
writing that uh Pat is trying to you
know move the Overton Window here which
you know III could see that too but at
the very least I do think Matt Iglesias
is point that in DC there are all
these very strict gun laws that pass
muster constitutional muster even based
on that that Heller opinion so it should
not stop us from trying to in the
meantime push for a number of very
restrictive gun laws the next steps for
March for our lives students are
organizing a town hall for our lives in
pushing every single member of Congress
to host a town hall during the next
congressional recess that is Saturday
April 7th they're trying to organize
members of Congress to hold town halls
and then I think recesses extends to the
8th and 9th as well so be on the lookout
for that and we will we'll get you guys
details about what's happening there as
we get them let's let's move on to the
president's mounting legal problems
which now spanned from obstructing the
investigation into the Russian attack on
our elections to paying hush money to
adult film actress stormy Daniels there
are a few stories over the last couple
of days on this the New York Times
reports that trumps former lawyer John
Dowd discussed Trump issuing pardons to
Paul Manafort and Mike Flynn with their
lawyers while they were under
investigation last year this raises the
question of whether Dowd promised them
pardons in exchange for not cooperating
with Muller Flynn of course already is
cooperating with Muller he pled guilty
mana for it has thus far refused ban
does this seem like the typical
aboveboard legal maneuver you see from
lawyers with innocent clients John Dowd
it's sort of like the attorney who
represented everyone in the Barksdale
crew from the wire yet he as you can
possibly be and this also answers the
question that people have been wondering
which is why has mana port not cut a
deal yeah he has been he's facing so
much jail time and he's gonna so much
money in lawyers cost people give in
metaphors age many people speculate that
he will spend the rest of his life in
jail as convicted in the crimes he has
been a Kiki's
and it he seems very guilty he just
knows what we have read instead he seems
super guilty so why would he not if
given the chance to reduce his debt and
significantly not turn on the person who
fired him in an embarrassing way for a
racist blogger or Steve Bannon and Kelly
and Kelly
so that's always been a mystery to me
like didn't was why was he like what is
it why does he think he would win this
case and the answer maybe and this is
irresponsible speculation on my part but
maybe that he's waiting he's holding on
to a perm and then he would not go to
jail at all I mean it may be
irresponsible speculation but it's also
sort of the obvious most obvious
explanation that you'd imagine because
like you know Trump has pardoned people
that don't deserve pardons before
Sheriff Joe Arpaio the pardon power is
pretty expansive now you can't use a
pardon for corrupt reasons and certainly
preventing people from cooperating
against the man cooperating with the man
who's investigating you for crimes seems
like a corrupt reason but my question
this whole thing was like what is
stopping Trump from just waiting Muller
out and pardoning everyone maybe nothing
you know that's this debt I mean
everyone's very focused on will Trump
fire Muller
but Trump may decide that firing Muller
may be too much of a headache and he
might as well just wait him out knowing
that if he pardons everyone
or if Muller releases a report or at
least releases a report just to Congress
saying that Trump deserves impeachment
no one will do anything because the
Republicans have protected him every
step of the way up to this point that
hid the real interesting obstruction of
justice - sure and adventure for Toronto
is the entire mother now before he
reports before he would send a report to
Congress which details the many crimes
which you and your coterie of
criminals has committed or do you wait
till Muller has already done it and then
pardoned everyone involved but I guess I
don't know what a Trump can pardon him
stuff and the probably untested
proposition yeah I don't think he can I
don't think he can pardon himself I
think at some point he has to you know
lean on his goons in Congress to help
him out here and to say you know the FBI
is corrupt and Muller's group is corrupt
and this is fake news and blah blah blah
and they just sort of wait it out now
you know if Democrats take back Congress
in November this is a little more
problematic for him but as we've said
before you still you could get an
impeachment in the house if it comes to
that but you get to the Senate and you
know you need something like 66 67 votes
and we certainly don't have that in the
Democratic Party and I don't know that
we can get there with even the
Republicans who have expressed grave
concern about Trump and his yeah so
that's an issue I mean it does it does
seem like Trump's a little more nervous
than usual here about Muller Politico
has a story about how Trump's media
goons are unleashing opposition research
on Muller now on Tuesday night Bob
Muller filed a statement in court that
says former Trump aide current
cooperating witness Rick Gates was in
contact during the final weeks of the
2016 campaign with a business associate
of his sorry with a business associate
of his who was tied to Russian
intelligence and the theft of the DNC
emails that was pretty crazy huh now why
do we think Molly did that and you we
had gone back to December of 2016 and we
laid out the set of things that have
happened since then and one of them was
that trump's deputy campaign manager
transition official and overall
republican insider had been in touch
with a have been in touch with a russian
intelligence official
that was we were like case closed done
Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have gone
to the White House and told Trump to
resign but instead it's on like page C
12 because of all the other crazy
that's happening I know it's like it
happened late Tuesday night and so I
didn't even see it until Wednesday
morning yesterday and then we were all
on to the next thing but I'm like wait a
minute wait a minute what the his
business associate was Russian
intelligence was former Russian
intelligence who still had ties what do
we think they were talking about in
those final weeks of the campaign who
knows this is worth I think that this
sort of does and I think this can play
into the stormy Daniels conversation is
like it no one saw that story I mean we
are obsessive news consumers we are
consuming it on Twitter
we are texting about it we are posting
it slack about it we live for that is
basically or just I mean you're actually
you're actually in media mobile and we
barely noticed it and so you know voters
did notice a like no one knows this
happened you've been if you if you
polled reporter many of them would know
what happened because they were covering
other things also worthwhile thing
they're also probably doesn't matter the
voters don't know it yeah
know it let's just like let them older
jus his like what matters did his mother
knows it Moeller knows it but I think
Muller was doing it and making it public
and filing it well I saw some people
speculate about this that one of the
reasons he was filing the statement was
to send man afford a message that it's
time to cooperate because look what we
have
like Muller's keeps trying to show some
of his cards to manna for it in order to
pressure him to flip which you know
could be true or not but I know it's
funny when you said that we didn't
notice it even Brian boiler editor of
crooked comm who I'm pretty sure has
like a bulletin board up in his office
with like red string connecting all the
different players investigation even
Brian didn't know it I found it under
someone's tweet and was sending it
around yesterday yes also if something
weird that happened on Tuesday which was
Chris Coons senator Chris Coons
from Delaware and US Senator Tom Tillis
put out a statement calling for the
protection of Bob Muller just out of the
blue and I don't know if there's
something afoot where they're a little
more nervous than usual the Trump's are
gonna make a move but I thought that was
pretty weird
yeah I agree that they're we don't know
anything but it is it suggests that at
we are very lucky on the pod today to
have former vice president of the United
States Joe Biden with us it's great to
be with you John it really is
you guys have an enormous success it's
amazing well thank you
it is amazing no no no I'm serious did
you ever think that you'd have this kind
of following for a podcast I mean you
guys are it's really amazing it's
important anyway thank you thank you
thank you
um so we want to start with something
serious you've recently challenged
Donald Trump to a fight you know it's
important that we get the messaging
around this right so we did want to run
a few of the names that we were
considering for the fight by you and you
just you stopped me when you feel like
we've hit a winner
Scranton squabble look nagas saga 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue
the Donny Joe Donnybrook the big
duel or Sparra lago i think they're all
good guys but what i did say was the way
this came up and I shouldn't have said
what I said I shouldn't have brought it
up again because I don't wanna get down
in the mosh pit with this guy what I did
say back when he was running when he
made these comments about being able to
grab women in their private places and
so on and so forth all that I was asked
during the campaign whether or not do I
regret not being able to debate Trump
and I said you know if we were in high
school and I did this again I said if we
were in high school and he said that the
presence of my sister I would take him
behind the gym now the idea that I would
actually physically get in a contest
with the president of United States or
anybody else now is not what I said
and it is not what this was about but I
should have just left it alone but look
guys I was you you guys know me
one of the passions of my life is ending
violence against women and I was on a
campus talking about how how men on
campuses have an obligation to protect
women have an obligation not to engage
in degrading talk have an obligation to
step up and women have an obligation
when one of their classmates is abused
to be able to help them get help
know what to do speak out speak up and
that's what when the president I did
this and you guys were part of it it's
on us that's what it was about she was
in the context of talking about the
abuse of women and the truth of the
matter is I find the the behavior the
talk vulgar I find it too grainy and I
think what it does it does encourage the
minority element of a male population to
think it's okay to engage in the
behavior the president talks about so
that was a context and I did say I used
again in high school I never ever at any
time said I would like to personally
physically etc and but but it is I I
think it's important to continue to make
the point women are entitled to be
treated with respect dammit and it's
about time we men stand up we got to be
part of the solution and there's a lot
of really good men matter of fact I'm
going up in New York and I'm presenting
awards that we came out of the the it's
on us campaign for women and men who
were heroes who step in and stop people
from doing what they're doing in the
context of this was I said any
fraternity brother who sees one of his
brothers with a freshman girl who's
drunk start to walk up the stairs with
that young woman if they don't walk over
and say not in my house not in my house
there are coward now maybe the guys 250
pounds and you're 150 pounds you don't
have to confront them physically but you
have to say to everybody look what
Charly's do
she got a step up that was the context
and but I shouldn't have said it I
shouldn't have repeated what I had said
during the campaign about if we were in
high school so sir right now
John Bolton is getting read into the
most sensitive intelligence we have
covert action programs war plans you're
putting your hands over your face what
do you think about Trump making John
Bolton a national security adviser and
more broadly the conventional wisdom a
month ago was that McMaster Tillerson
maddis were restraining Trump do you
think that was true then and are we in
deep trouble now with Bolton and Pompeyo
going to state look you know youyou sat
in that situation room with me there
with the president and over eight years
we spent thousand hours in that room the
most sensitive material that is
available on the planet it's discussed
in that room and I got to remind
everybody why there is a thing called a
national security adviser
the national security adviser started
back in the 40s but it really came into
its own in the Kennedy administration
because he thought he was ill served in
the Cuban Missile Crisis was to have one
person who had the capacity to read in
everybody not to not to be an editor but
to say this is mr. president this is
what the State Department says just what
the Defense Department's was the DI the
DNI says this is what the CIA says
that's what defense intelligence says
this is what and so everybody's view is
brought in on critical issues of life
and death and national security and I
held extensive hearings as framer in the
Foreign Relations Committee when John
Bolton was seeking to be nominated as
the UN Ambassador and I can document for
you that Bolton has two modus operandi
when he was a state what he would do is
he would shade
intelligence to move it in the direction
where he wanted to go
you could not there is many instances
for him giving a not completely
straightforward analysis of what the
intelligence said secondly anyone who
disagreed with him he tried to get rid
of him yeah I mean that's in the record
and that's why Republicans joined me and
defeated him defeated him in the
committee mm-hmm now he got recess
appointed right by President Bush but
there was a reason for that
the single worst place in the world to
have John Bolton I mean is in Syria is
it the place where it's requires
somebody who will not impose their view
will make sure the president knows every
perspective in his government or her
government and then will recommend to
the president mr. president I think
States writer I think defense is right
or whatever but it is not to cut off
access and this guy is a history of
cutting off access to points of view
that don't agree with him so it is a
virtual disaster and it's the way it is
totally inconsistent with the reason why
it was set up to have a national
security adviser and one of the first
issues they'll take up is likely to be
North Korea back in January you are
asked if you agree with Mike Mullen who
said that the US has never been closer
to a nuclear war with North Korea
you agreed has your assessment changed
since President Trump agreed to talks
with Kim jong-un do you think that was
the right decision
look let me say first of all I agree
with Mullen at the time because all the
rhetoric was escalating yeah and what
Admiral Mullen who you worked with as
well and you know how highly regarded he
is across the spectrum and is about as a
political as you possibly get Admiral
Mullen and I were worried it turned out
by the same thing I was my dad used to
have an expression
only war that's worse than worse than
one that's intended is one that's
unintended the escalatory language with
a guy who is as our former boss would
say you know banging a spoon on a high
chair for attention who is smart like a
fox but is I wash I can't get into class
of information about the profile them
but but is may or may not be stable they
are not may or may not react to threats
and insults with a man who let's assume
his intentions are all good our
president who knows virtually nothing
about foreign policy doesn't know the
background I don't believe has had time
and it's understand we didn't he was you
know it was a businessman but I wish
he'd listened more to people around him
and and to not fully understand that
without South Korea without Japan and
without some modus vivendi with China
and some motifs of ending with Russia
this going long route is could be
disastrous in a misunderstanding now I
think we have to give the president
credit for saying that he's willing to
sit down and talk I think that makes
sense if if he it's not like a business
of negotiation for building a new hunter
story tower it's a different deal here
and so what presidents Democrat
Republican have historically done when
they've had dramatic breakthroughs like
let's say he sits down and they agreed
to a pause and everything and what
usually happens that is you turn into
this and not a single meeting this
requires a process and so you turn it
over to the most informed and the best
minds in your government
to figure out how do you work out what
would be the elements in agreement so my
question and I don't expect it hits
earth and he shouldn't have to is what
is his endgame what does he think
constitutes a good agreement what does
he think that is number one number two
is he going to be able to and does he
have the right people to coordinate and
and and work with the Japanese the South
Koreans are friends so that we don't end
up as being the odd man out and trying
to do something North Korea and thirdly
I think it's really important that we
understand that and I hope he
understands that this is a process the
idea I can't think of I when I got to
United States and as a 29 year old kid
not a joke the reason I ran for the
Senate was showed I could not win but
the governor seat they showed I could
have won and people why don't you run
for governor well the reason I didn't
run for governor is because of my my
overarching interest in foreign policy
and so when I got on the Foreign
Relations committees youngest man ever
on that committee and appointed when I
was you know and never happened when I
was 32 years old I knew the only way you
could have any impact the only game in
town was us-soviet relations and the
only game and that was arms control and
national security strategic weapons so I
spent a lot of time a lot of time trying
to master that field I mean working like
the devil with some really really good
people or my seniors and I know how much
work it took for me to able to get my
head around all of this I don't know I
don't doubt the president Trump is has a
high IQ that he's bright that he's well
educated but that's not enough you have
to be substantively informed but he's
not at all well it appears everything
I've seen so far he's not so you know my
dear god rest her soul my mother would
say hope
brings a turtle maybe he is really gone
de I don't want to what I don't want to
do is jinx this for him and say it's a
failure if I were advising a Democratic
president as I did advise a Democratic
president I'd advise them to try to
engage in discussions if you had a
willing partner saying okay I'm willing
to sit down and actually talk about the
whole deal we never got there
because he never was willing to and now
now Kim is saying okay I'm willing to
talk well there should be talks but I
pray to God that he is been serious
enough to make sure that he has really
informed people with him and he knows at
the front end what his objective is but
see here's I don't want to do my
instinct is you know for Democrats
particularly say well this guy knows
nothing this guy is a bad guy this guy
is the president the note he's doing
what's he and just just dumped all over
what he's trying to do well you know
this is a moment where there's a
possibility of getting something good to
happen but it takes a awful lot of
really really really really hard work
and a lot of luck yeah and so I don't
want to condemn it but I don't I I'm not
I'm not betting my second mortgage I
want to talk a little bit about the
state of our politics you're the one oh
bomber would always send to make deals
with Republicans in Congress we've
always had good relationships with a lot
of the Senate Republicans did I call you
go ahead I look at this party in 2018
the Republican Party Mitch McConnell
held a Supreme Court seat open for a
year he refused to sign on to a
bipartisan statement that Russia was
attacking our election before the
election happened friends of yours in
the Senate like Lindsey Graham some of
trumps biggest enablers they're not
protecting Muller at what point do you
say I can't reason with these people the
only thing I can do is
to feed them what is that line well I
think you have to say both I think you
have to say I got to continue to try to
raise them as long as they're in power
and if they continue the path to GUI and
I'm gonna try to defeat them so it's not
either-or John you know you and I know
and I used to remember a lot of the new
guys that commands a lot of really
really bright new people that the
president brought in what an incredible
president he was but they brought in
there was you you'd often hear me say
John you know you can't assume all these
guys are idiots up there because a lot
of our team knew thought well you know
congressman they can't be very smart I
remember getting a bunch together I
think you remember I pointed out that
that the collective IQ of these guys is
pretty high even on the house side no by
the way by the way let me give you a
factoid when Newt Gingrich took over the
Congress in the 90s everybody said
they're all a bunch of idiots guess what
85% of those people that advanced degree
some IB institutions smartass but it
shows that brains don't provide judgment
right okay I remember having a debate
with the what the gym with the Chief
Justice Supreme Court Rehnquist when
there's a tradition where the Judiciary
Committee Chairman goes up and sits for
an hour before the budget has passed
with the chairman with the court so they
can they can gracefully lobby for what
they need we need a new building we need
a new this we need to do that and they
wanted a pay raise and I said I was one
of the few that supported a pay raise if
we didn't have the guts to raise our pay
we should have been raised in the pay of
the courts and he started off and he
said I can understand why why the public
doesn't support the congressmen for
making having a parents but we deserve
it and I said that's not a way to get
this done she and he sat there and he
was very up and I said look chief I said
you think you're above politics but I
said if I'm not mistaken
you work for the Republican Party you
campaign for this job you challenge
people in lyon whether they were
qualified to vote i said i didn't ask
anybody except the people I didn't go to
any an interest group to get me elected
and I said in chief I'm the only one and
I was the only one I think I to this day
was the only one who had the unredacted
FBI files because all my colleagues
trusted me and I never once revealed a
single thing only one I think in history
not positive that and I said so I know
every one of the judges I hope I preside
over 520 of them I said I will match the
collective and IQ the average IQ of the
United States Senate against the court
we had seven Rhodes Scholars 14 Marshall
scholars we had over 40 people graduate
at number one in the class I said so
come on chief you all ain't that smart
no but I'm serious there's this thing
yeah and so what I'm trying to say I'm
out of when your your question John is
that if you notice even when I went up
to try to work things out the most
important thing it's okay to disagree
with their judgment and say I'm against
you I'm gonna work against you but what
we do too often we in this town is we
question motive we say the reason you're
doing the do is because you're either
stupid or you're in the pocket of this
or you are you are not ethical or you're
not a religious man a woman etc when you
do that you can never get to go you can
never get to an agreement so I start
over there so I think you're an ugly son
and by the way the way and I really
think that you are an obnoxious person
but let's see if we can work this out
that's the Trump style well it is it is
this style that's why he's not working
much out right right that's my point
yeah and so the thing you watch me do
John everybody up there knew I respect
to them and I never questioned their
motive but I went after the judgment as
hard as anybody and our administration
ever did so to answer your question it's
okay
me too to go after in terms of
challenging Mitch's judgment on the
courts and say why he's ruining the
system why he's undermining the Khan
which I did but without saying the
reason you're doing that is because
you're worried that if you hold these
series the Koch brothers are going to
come in and put ten million dollars into
your race which might have been true I
called 12 members of the Republican
Party
I have long relationships with when they
wouldn't hear oh wow what was absolutely
unimpeachable guy that we picked to be a
Supreme Court justice
all but one acknowledged what they were
doing was wrong
privately they all said no you don't
understand you you don't understand
if I go ahead and call for the assyrians
I'm gonna get challenged from the right
they're gonna pour millions of dollars
into my race look at what's happened
John Republicans only knew loose from
the right not the left yeah and
Democrats only lose from the left not
the right
so that's why the bad news about
unlimited spending and gerrymandering is
guess what both parties are moving
towards the polls the edges now I
respect people have those views but tell
me guys how can you possibly meet the
needs of the American people without
reaching a consensus our whole system
requires a consensus not my way or the
highway that purity test there are
certain principles and by the way you've
watched me I'm going to say some
outrageous I have never ever ever ever
voted for anything I thought was wrong
even when it has cost me dearly at home
in the middle of us most single most
extensive busing order in all of the
United States history in my state I
voted against an amendment in a deciding
vote to keep they allow the course to
keep busing as a remedy because there's
certain things worth losing over but so
that's not about me there's a lot of
people have done that my generic point
is this is you've got to be able to talk
and now you know for example why
when I go out and I speak to the
Democratic caucus I've done a lot of
campaigns and I talk about you have to
you have to compromise you have to
compromise a principle but you got a
compromise on getting the really
critical things the American people need
done you can't get it all well you know
I get a lot of pushback from the new
left in the Democratic Party and by the
way I take a back seat to no one and on
my liberal credentials
I was rated to you the 4th to the 7th
most liberal senator in a 36 years I was
there remind everybody I'm the guy that
came out for gay marriage I'm the guy
that well I'm the guy you know it's like
but uh it seems like we are closer than
ever to a genuine constitutional crisis
where the President of the United States
tries to shut down an investigation of
which he himself is a target an
investigation into a potential criminal
conspiracy between Donald Trump his
associates and foreign agents that has
already led to 19 indictments five
guilty pleas including the president's
former national security adviser his
former campaign manager and two other
campaign aides and the crisis part comes
if and when the Republicans who were in
Congress do absolutely nothing this so
let's start from the beginning
this the events unfolded over the
weekend they began Friday night
paint us a picture John on Friday night
Jeff Sessions fired deputy FBI director
Andrew McCabe a few days before McCabe
was scheduled to retire which would deny
him his pension and other benefits
sessions said that an internal report
found that McCabe wasn't honest about a
conversation he authorized between FBI
officials and a journalist in an
interview with The New York Times McCabe
responded the idea that I was dishonest
is just wrong this is part of an effort
to discredit me as a witness how big of
a deal is this which part the fact that
he was fired uh it's incredibly
vindictive and cruel and was clearly a
setup from the very beginning I mean so
let's just
we should stipulate that we don't know
what McCabe did wrong exactly or if he
did anything wrong because because this
Inspector General report has not been
released yet we know that he was allowed
to authorize communications with
reporters the allegation is that when he
was asked about it as part of a broader
investigation into the way the Clinton
Foundation issue was investigated he
misled them which is really weird to
think that he would mislead them about
something so easy to verify and
important but we don't have this report
yet but like the the the standard he's
being held to is not did he leak or not
that's not the question the question is
whether he was honest about whether he
authorized this communication with
journalists and so if Trump or anyone in
the White House was held to that same
ethical standard they would all be fired
they would not they would be gone yeah
so we don't know what's in the report
but it doesn't really matter because of
the way Trump conducts himself it will
not be possible for anyone to actually
believe
this report was conducted fair no matter
what is in that right like either no
there's no that the I saw some sort of
conservatives on Twitter being like a
lot of a lot of people confident that
this is some kind of a political act
when they haven't read the IG report
okay guys first of all we think it's a
coincidence that this happened Friday
night two days before his pension
exactly he was gonna get his pension
when Donald Trump has been his has been
hankering for this guy to be fired that
a pension for months his son his idiot
son was tweeting about it and Donald
Trump jr. doesn't pick things up for it
doesn't have his own ideas he gets them
from his dad or from the same idiot
sources that his dad get his information
there are some facts of you and ask you
to react okay here's some facts for you
John December nineteenth McCabe
testifies behind doors close doors of
the house Intel committee and
corroborates commis account of his
meeting with Trump that leaked
immediately and then shortly after the
DOJ Inspector General decided to
expedite the portion of this
investigation that directly related to
McCabe a couple days later Trump tweeted
the FBI director Andrew McCabe is racing
the clock to retire with full benefits
ninety days to go do you think it was
coincident well this was then fired in a
rush this report I was gonna say McCabe
statement there where he said this is a
part of an effort to discredit me as a
witness let's remember McCabe is one of
the few people whom Comey told about all
the times the Trump tried to obstruct
justice yeah the loyalty pledge all the
other is to Flynn yeah and so
McCabe becomes a pretty powerful witness
and an obstruction case and so if they
can say well McCabe's actually a liar he
was fired because he didn't tell the
truth James Comey also a liar he was
fired because he didn't tell the truth
now they can start discrediting all the
witnesses they could prove that Trump
obstructed justice I know by the way now
he's got a vendetta because we fired him
for cause and he's you know he's
actually suing me like how you trust
this guy this guy that's not suing me I
mean he's just he's just a crazy
disgruntled guy exactly right the other
thing we know is McCabe took notes
he's got memos just like Jim Comey's got
memos they think memos
Trump Ramon's call him the fake memos
now can we call them the fake memo you
can do it everyone go ahead I believe
Devin newness has already taken that
term but go ahead
McCabe has lawyered up so this is
interesting so then over the weekend
Trump goes on Twitter
to celebrate McCabe's firing attacks
James Comey is a corrupt liar and says
for the first time that the Muller probe
should never have been started a
sentiment that was echoed by his lawyer
John Dowd who emailed The Daily Beast to
say that he hoped the Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein would shut down
Muller's investigation and did he quote
from like Finnegan's Wake but do we
think John dad was just wasted on st.
Patrick's Day and firing off emails to a
cast of characters that he's got on his
legal team is between Ty Cobb and John
Dowd and all of them they're all pretty
weird they're good lawyers almost as if
they're the smartest and most
sophisticated lawyers are not interested
they took an ass on this one so here's
the question why now
what has finally pushed Trump over the
edge I guess the only advice that his
lawyers have all given him or one of the
most peace most important pieces of
advice they've given him is whatever you
do don't say Muller's name don't call
for the firing and somehow and all this
time Trump has taken their advice until
this weekend yeah I mean the one thing
we know is that in recent weeks Muller
has begun seeking Trump Organization
financial information yeah and but but
but but what sir he's he subpoenaed
Trump Organization for documents related
to its efforts to build a Trump Tower in
Moscow specifically that seems
interesting but what's what's been the
leaks the way the leaks have been
happening they don't seem to be coming
from the Moller side they seem to come
from other people being asked about it
or from the Trump side or from elsewhere
from witnesses so we're always a bit
behind right we find out about things
weeks after the fact so it's not clear
what happened this weekend but it's very
clear that Trump has been agitating
because of these subpoenas so there's a
couple other things I think you
mentioned love it the subpoenas for the
Trump Organization documents it was also
reported that Muller sent the White
House a list of questions for Trump for
when he interviews Trump that has got
them a little nervous those questions
are reportedly focused on not just the
campaign but during the White House on
obstruction specifically with Trump's
relationship with James Comey and
Trump's relationship
Flynn so that's gotten them all nervous
and then there's the other Washington
parlor game like Trump is free to do
whatever he wants now he feels loose
because now he has no one controlling
him cuz hopes gone and Gary cones gone
he doesn't give a about John Kelly
anymore and so it's Trump Unleashed you
know because he was really reserved up
until now the reserved guy he's gonna
he's unbuttoned his top collar finally I
don't know it's hard to get inside that
addled brain it is amazing though that
he is now actively attacking Muller by
name via tweet and in the Washington
Post did a great piece of where they
they did a they did a quick scrub of the
tweet where he said the mole approach
had never been started blah blah blah
ends with calling it a witch hunt and
they detailed five major inaccuracies in
just one tweet which is just remarkable
because the guy is like he's flailing in
such an incredibly embarrassing way
because I think of the questions we're
talking about yeah like their their
argument their defense that Trump
shouldn't sit down with Muller's team is
that they're setting quote of perjury
trap so you're saying no no no we'll
give you the questions that advance will
tell you the things were gonna ask their
substantive their fact-based we're not
trying to trap you into lying to us and
that is scared him more than almost
anything else so far I mean the whole
idea of a perjury trap is so funny
I know don't lie my client tends to lie
a lot and by sitting down with you you
might get him to do so by asking him a
question it's like calling a bank a
robbery trap with the reaction to all
this there's a lot of people very
incensed on Twitter over this over the
weekend what are you talking about
Twitter it's not really usually the
picture of calm oh man a lot of people
crossing the delaware twitter this
weekend you know just standing at the
front of that ship paddling across the
Delaware for the guys but I want to talk
about one tweet from someone who is is
not sanctimonious loose in our
experience former CIA director John
Brennan hears of the tweet and this was
about Trump's tweet celebrating the cave
McCabe's firing quote when the full
extent of your venality moral turpitude
and political corruption becomes known
you will take your rightful place as the
disgraced demagogue and the dustbin of
history
you may scapegoat Andy McCabe but you
will not destroy America America will
triumph over you now you guys have to
like no John Brennan and have worked
with John Brennan to understand how
unusual that seems meantime you worked
with him closely yeah the funny thing
about John is those are words he
actually uses in conversations like I
think a lot of people were like oh you
know thesaurus.com over there well he is
we're doing
he loves that kind of language but yeah
John I think John's an institutionalist
nonpartisan guy yeah I think he is
rightly incredibly upset at the
incessant attacks on law enforcement and
people like Andy McCabe and and just the
you know the immorality and lack of care
about you know the people trying to keep
us safe
but also he's seen underlying
intelligence he's doing some of it yeah
but I also think that he's seen
underlying intelligence I also think to
myself think of the that John
Brennan has seen as the DES former
director of the CIA and he always he's
like a picture of calm when you see him
in the White House you know he's good
like he's running the bin Laden
operation there's a million things going
on and now he's Thomas Paine on Twitter
now yeah seasoned as as you get that
that sort of worried me a little bit
watch so let's talk about the Republican
reaction which was a little different so
here's the good we had Lindsey Graham
saying that the firing mulher would be
the beginning of the end of trumps
presidency we had Jeff Flake saying it's
a massive red line that can't be crossed
we've got trey gowdy trey Gowdy welcome
to the resistance saying saying Trump
should leave Muller alone what just I
don't wanna move past trey Gowdy for one
second because what a parallel
universe we're living in trey gowdy
who politicized the Benghazi
investigation like his life depended on
it who made it his mission to bring down
Hillary Clinton with misleading
endless investigations for him newness
has gone too far
and the Republican failure to stand up
to Trump's attacks on Muller have gone
too far that we have crossed Trey
Gowdy's line tells you something that
tells you just how broken the Republican
response is sorry these guys finding a
conscience when they retire though
can you please have a conscience while
you're still in office while you're
running for re-election yeah not
possible children well for from Paul
Ryan we just got a spokesperson Ashley
strong went on the record and said
Miller should be able to do his job as
Paul Ryan has always believed no no John
you you're you're not you're not saying
it properly it's Paul Ryan believes then
to complete his work he's long believed
that it's important that the
investigation be allowed to continue all
of them have the power literally just to
protect Muller's job yeah they could put
forward legislation that makes this a
moot point Trump is trying to politicize
it Trump is the one out there
politicizing it he's saying this is a
bunch of Democrats this is a partisan
witch hunt
never mind that Bob Muller's a
Republican rod Rosen Stein was appointed
by Donald Trump he's making this thing
about party which is ludicrous sorry I
need the table
well and he's testing them right Trump
is testing the Republican side doing
this and I think I mean Sam Stein made
this point over the weekend but the
bigger story here is not Trump's
reactions and his tweets and stuff like
that we're all used to that that's all
crazy-like the bigger story here is the
fact that he's coming close to this line
yes and the Republicans are just doing
nothing like me and then Paul Ryan at
least Paul Ryan in this instance had a
spokesperson come out and say something
 nothing from Mitch McConnell not
a word not a word no one expects it for
him because he's the most Craven sad
little coward in in Congress but why
would Trump expect anything less from
them these are the people who watch the
excess hollywood tape and and came out
and made statements like how could i
look my daughter in the eye again if i
supported this man Jay Finn Chaffetz you
failed Fox News Blackey now and then
they and then they supported him or Ted
Cruz who had his wife insulted and then
went in phonebank for the guy the next
day he knows their moral midgets and
they're not gonna do anything so yeah I
agree with all of that it is interesting
though that they felt the White House
Trump felt compelled to put out a
statement I don't know a Saturday or
Sunday from the lawyer saying Trump has
not discussed is not considering you
know Ty Cobb yesterday said Trump is not
considering firing Moeller not
considering were discussing firing
Muller right so they did feel somehow
that was a lie well obvious is a lie is
considering it on Twitter but
it's interesting that what it's always
fascinating to me when the
rules somehow apply like what what was
happening on the White House that they
felt I'm sure to say that this is a
personality difference between Ty Cobb
and John doubt remember Ty Cobb has
always been the one who's telling Trump
yeah the whole thing's gonna end by
Thanksgiving the whole thing's gonna end
by Christmas don't worry about it Ty
Cobb keeps keeping things from Trump to
make sure that Trump doesn't go crazy
and fire Muller so ty Cobbs strategy is
to not it's Alette Muller do his job but
that is not John Dowd strategy that is
not the rest of them the rest go get a
steak at BLT and just hash it out
they're all they're all on board with
this because there was a story in
Politico this morning that was like in
the midterms all of these senators that
are up or that want to flip states in
the midterms they all want Trump
campaigning with them they want Trump
coming to all their states Dean Heller
is gonna want it you know all the other
people they're all they want they're
gonna be with Trump in 2018 so like
they're not gonna stand up to him also
he has he has there was a great story in
the New York Times I think Saturday or
Sunday about how Trump immediately
killed off this vaunted Steve ban and
insurrection with primary candidates
running in places like Nevada and
everywhere else like they're all gone
Trump has just taken them out he's still
a potent force in a Republican primary I
mean he is a nice party he's an
incredibly popular Republican who
espouses positions and ideas that the
base really likes and he there's no the
idea that he's not like there's no he's
not a Republican he's Trump he is now
the leader of the publican party that is
fundamentally why Paul Ryan Mitch
McConnell Dean Heller all these guys are
scared of him because he is big loves
him he's Hawk stick to us and we forget
that he's not he's not succeeding
despite what the Republican Party stands
for he is what the Republican Party
stands yeah so how would this happen how
did this go down if if Trump wants so
Trump can't fire Muller directly what
Trump can do is he can order rod Rosen
Stein the Deputy Attorney General to
fire
Mahler as of a couple weeks ago whereas
in science ed I see no reason to fire
him he should do his job which is
important because even even even Trump
needs a cause he needs an explanation
he can't just
to fight he has to have he has to be
fired for cause so he could try to order
rod to do this Rosen sign could resign
and then if he resigned it would fall to
the Solicitor General
Noel Francisco who was a former Bush DOJ
lawyer to then have to do it so this
basically is like what happened in
Watergate with Saturn and a Saturday
night massacre where Nixon ended up
firing a few people who decided not to
do it until finally I think Robert Bork
did it yeah
so everybody so then the question is so
the question is what can we do Tommy you
mentioned there's already bipartisan
legislation out there to protect smaller
there's a couple different bills in the
Senate it seems like a we should push
for that Adam Schiff over the weekend
called for if Muller does get fired
immediately passing an Independent
Counsel law to reinstate Muller if it
happens there has also been some talk
the government is going to run out of
money again at the end of this week
we're back to a possible shutdown and
once again Paul Ryan needs Democratic
votes in the house to pass a funding
bill because the freedom caucus doesn't
like to keep the government running and
pass anything and so the question is
should Democrats demand that some kind
of legislation to protect Muller
be attached to this government funding
bill I think it's a good idea
what is the downside right you guys say
push for it right Paul Ryan thinks this
is important investigation that should
continue trey Gowdy says this is not
about Donald Trump this is about Russian
interference like there is all the
political cover in the world to put
forward something that is bipartisan and
should be supported by every single
person in Congress we know they won't
because they're partisan hacks and
that's what this is really about but yes
yeah there's no argument against it
right it's like we don't need to be
protected because Muller hasn't been
fired oh yeah but so then but it doesn't
in April we've got tickets for shows in
Clearwater Miami in Orlando there's also
going to be a love it or leave it show

that's awesome it was great to see all
the students through the walk out
yesterday I was a pretty amazing thing
to say especially young people I even
saw on Twitter of these elementary
school kids who had prepared press
packets for the reporters who came look
look like written in pet Britney invent
clothes really yeah I've never made a
press bagging so we had an election
Tuesday the much-talked-about special
election vacant congressional district
in Pennsylvania finally happened after
many hours of milk counting it were on
Wednesday the media outlet near Times
others called the election for Connor
Lam a marine and first-time candidate
running running in it winning a district
that Trump won by 20 points in 2016 by
the massive margin of 600 some votes or
0.2 percentage point 2 percent what did
you guys think what was your reaction
when this happened was it relief was it
excitement was it who cares because this
districts going away in a few in a few
months yeah I mean I it's funny I once I
saw how close it was I stopped caring
because
that's all that matter right we showed
that we could swing a 20-point district
I mean as the night wore on we realized
was going to be decided by a few hundred
votes and that it might go into a
recount it might not we learned
everything we needed to learn you know
Republicans in the house learned
everything they needed to learn
Democrats on the campaign trail learned
everything they needed to learn this
districts not gonna exist anymore but it
it's it's incredibly exciting and it's
exciting to know that we have the
possibility to flip districts this red
because as many people have pointed out
if districts like this flip we're
talking about you know a 300 seat
majority is possible yeah it is we're
all election junkies so we couldn't help
but watch the stupid New York Times
needle and all the returns and all the
you know Steve Kornacki on TV doing math
on his iPhone so it was exciting to see
but you know the fact that it was close
as a victory for Democrats and the fact
that Republicans pulled out all the
stops they sent pence
they sent Donald Trump they made a firm
closing argument and and they're calling
lamb a unicorn they're saying he's some
exceptional candidate that you know ran
like a Republican ran like Trump that's
not really true I mean this is a
replicable win in a whole bunch of
districts that we didn't think we're
winnable he's a he's a good candidate
but like you know this guy didn't
personally kill bin Laden right he was a
he was a military background as a
prosecutor this is something we can do
again over and over again so I think
it's a it's a great sign for Democrats I
logically had the exact same view that
loved it did which is this does not
matter if we're close then then we know
momentum is on our side we know we have
real potential to take the house back
and do very well up and down the ballot
in 2018 but as the night went on I got
close I started caring more because I
kept thinking about just the idea of the
absurd response like gloating from
Republicans the Trump Tweed I was petty
in my music logically ambivalent but
emotionally very it no it's also it's um
we're sick of moral victories you know
and it was nice to watch Republicans try
to claim a moral victory after we had
done it a few times after Asaf and other
races that were closed that
how well we could do that but that
actually didn't result in picking up any
seats dan everyone's talking about a
wave election do you think that that is
a good thing because everyone wants to
back and be a winner and so we could
maybe recruit better candidates and
raise more money or do you worry about
complacency and expectation center
setting and re-energizing the sort of
Trump vote I worry about this idea that
it's done and we're taking the house
back and therefore people odd with the
way to think about it is in order to
take the house back we need people who
either who vote in presidential
elections and don't put in midterms to
vote in this midterm or have not
previously voted and have become engaged
because of Trump to vote in this midterm
and if it seems like it's a done deal
when people's votes aren't going to
matter then view those are the people
most likely to fall off first but I
think you there will be some stuff
around the margins that's beneficial of
the idea of a wave because in terms of
money from you know some of these
business donors or corporate pacts with
which I wouldn't take money from if it
was me but for those Democrats that do
they'll they'll start hedging their bets
right they won't just get Republicans
because they want to head in so the
Democratic majority but I do worry about
complacency and I do think the
complacency is part of what one of the
many problems we haven't seen that but
if felt was bet that people thought it
was over so why wait in the line for
hours and that is easier to decide not
to vote rational action it isn't
presidential so I do have some concerns
okay yeah we don't have to drive home
for people that this was six hundred and
forty votes incredibly close everything
we did mattered millions and millions of
dollars were spent on both sides to eke
out this win and it took everyone doing
everything possible to make it happen
and then that will be true in a lot of
districts like this in the fall
districts that will make the difference
between Paul Ryan holding on to that
gavel and us taking it from his hands
which is sadly makes me so excited it
just gets me out of bed every morning
just thinking about that moment where he
just puts that gavel down for the last
time and we say that doesn't belong to
you anymore
yeah it's worth noting that
another special election coming up in
just about five weeks in Arizona that
the congressional district in Arizona
congressional district district in
Arizona which like this seat in
Pennsylvania is been vacated because
Republicans who had to resign over in a
sexual in a sex scandal and that that
district now there's some Arizona can be
harder than Pennsylvania for some
reasons but that was a district it only
did what that was
Trump won by 21 points so it's
essentially the same political dynamics
so something that we thought we had no
shot at when Trent Franks resigned a few
months ago we there could be a real shot
here we there's a good candidate who won
the primary a couple weeks ago there so
that's something to keep an eye on it's
exciting
now so Republicans have known for weeks
that ton rule and winning was a
possibility
and they've known certainly for weeks
that Connor Atlanta was going to do much
better than anyone ever expected
Democrat to do in 18min district so they
had an opportunity to get there talking
together think about their spin prepare
for how they were going to explain to
the media pundits donors voters why this
happened and I think they did it then I
think they got it done yeah they got me
I believe them let me give you some of
my favorite examples of how they spun
this on election night just only
reported that according to Republicans
who are watching the results of the
White House
they were pleased because this isn't a
blowout for now will happily take it I
also really enjoy cathy McMorris Rodgers
who is a member of the Republican
leadership in the house who said we
aren't even in full momentum on tax
reform yet okay what is that what did
you got what do you have any favorite
examples of horrible spin and what you
think of it were you sold on the
Republican take I mean look paul ryan
going out there and saying that he run
as a conservative was pretty hard to
bear I mean look the thing that they
can't avoid is they tried to run a tax
cut message they tried to run ads around
the corporate tax cuts
that Paul Ryan says was it said as an
election winner and they had to pull
them down and just throw against
the wall to see what six in the final
days because people just weren't buying
it to me that is the that is the most
devastating an important lesson of this
race because that is their signature
achievement it is their only major
legislative achievement it is what the
conservative intellectual pundits the
the ones that were supposed to take
seriously said were the only was the
only way Republicans were going to be
able to keep the house and maybe keep
the Senate is by having this
accomplishment they can go running
around the country and tout and then of
course they try to make this thing about
corporate tax cuts it doesn't work and
now all of a sudden it's about ms-13 and
immigration and Connor Lam is a Pelosi
liberal but he's also not liberal enough
on the $15 minimum wage and unions and
none of it worked if you are if you are
in a chain bloodred 20 plus Trump
district and you are pulling down ads in
the final we in the final days because
nothing's working that is a very very
disheartening sign for you if you're
Paul Ryan yeah I love that these guys
went into their Republican caucus
meetings and just put their heads in the
sand and and pretended like nothing went
wrong I mean they're they're one
legislative accomplishment was this tax
cut it did not work they pulled down ads
Connor Lam explicitly ran against it so
you know that would make me very worried
about replicating that message in future
races there are efforts to make Nancy
Pelosi the boogeyman and to scare people
away from Lam because of his potential
association with her did not work the
president coming to town multiple times
to a district he'd won by 20 points
didn't work so I would be very worried
that all of my bullets had been fired
and there's not much left for of
November if I were them but again
they're all just sort of you know
spinning their little yarns here and
saying whatever their donors need to
hear yeah I mean the sorry Dan gone this
reminds me of one of the main reasons
I'm really happy cutter land one which
is if we had to live in a world where
Donald Trump jr. who claimed that his
photo-op of the giant chocolate bunny
the final day of voting had kicked the
race and Rick sturckow in favor I don't
know that I could have lived in America
much longer yeah yeah look they can
point to the fact that you know they can
point to the fact that Connor Lam came
out in favor of the tower
Trump proposed right which meant that
his efforts to use tariffs to kind of
swing this rake backfired because Connor
Lam joined sherrod Brown and being in
favor of them they can point to that
they can point to the fact that Connor
Lam ran away from Nancy Pelosi right
they have that but beyond that I mean
this is a candidate who ran on unions he
ran on Obamacare he ran against the
corporate tax cuts he run for medical
marijuana he ran on some core Democratic
liberal economic issues so they just
this notion that he was a conservative
or they ran as a Republican just doesn't
pass the laugh test it's just not it's
it's spent at you know you're in a good
place when you're just when you're when
you're when you're seeing Republicans
try to spin something and you just quote
it and you're just like look at this
this is awesome yeah because you you
they just don't have anything to say
this is such a devastating loss for them
the the argument that he is probe gun
which was touted at by Paul Ryan by
increases people by everyone on Fox News
it's bolide by the fact that the NRA
jumped in with a huge buy right before
him to defeat this quote-unquote pro-gun
candidate yep and it's a lesson to every
Democrat who thinks they can take a
couple of votes and like keep the NRA
out of their district no you cannot they
are Republican organization they don't
give a about your votes they will
vote you out
yeah and they like Connor line came out
in favor of background checks but I
think he was squishing on some of the
other issues and you know I don't know
whether or not that's a good strategy
but what's clear is the NRA is gonna
come after you whether you're just for
background checks or you're for
background checks banning bump sucks
raising the the age on buying things
like ar-15s and it's a lesson for
Democrats there are these core
common-sense gun control measures that
you should be in favor of because it's
what your Democratic base wants and the
NRA is coming at you whether you're for
these specific things one way or another
the NRA if you came out for repeal of
the Second Amendment and a national gun
confiscation program the NRA was been
just as much money you mean the FISA
bill yes I've done in every pot that one
yeah different build it do you know how
much do you think the Republicans know
their spin is like
today a hundred percent I mean you're
seeing like Jonathan Martin who's a
great reporter New York Times who is
like as well sourced in the Republican
circles and people like him are tweeting
that boy the on the record and off the
record conversations about this race are
real different I don't know why a
journalist wouldn't go in there and just
screw a bunch of sources and report out
the off-the-record stuff but these guys
know they're full of yeah it's
almost disappointing I would like them
to believe their own spin a little bit
more I mean you can't help right you
can't help but let the spin seep into
your brain just a little bit and it's
probably hard for them to truly
reconcile like the fact that this loss
is so unspinning means that their
circumstances are quite unspinning and I
think it's probably hard for a lot of
these Republicans who look at their life
outside of Congress as when they're not
excited to go back to and to truly
accept just how hard it will be for a
lot of these guys to keep their seats
but yeah it seems like they probably
know I hope they don't fully know I hope
they're buying their own I mean it
gained a tiny bit you've been in this
position after like the 2010 midterms
the work everything is behind we will go
on we all soldier on yeah okay well I
was actually thinking about how we felt
about the house at this point in 2010
now we've there were a couple
there were the special elections
actually had gone in the Democrats favor
and that was most because they were in
more favorable districts and Republican
10 really got their together in
terms of like field organizing
understanding data okay so we had a big
structural advantage so I mean we were a
little deluded like we knew was a very
real possibility that we would look that
we could lose the house but we were
grasping at straws everywhere to
convince ourselves that there was still
it was still up you know coin flip or we
still had a shot and how many signs did
we lose din okay oh you know so many was
it 60 is it positive that's 60 there was
so many yeah it was not good I do wonder
like I think probably the operatives
know how this is going and I like that
quote unquote more politically savvy
[Music]
members of the Republican House but they
basically
a Fox News bubble and that's why they
believe Romney was gonna win that's why
even Republican House members who have
access to 538 believe that Romney was
gonna win up until you know they were
they were spiritually with Karl Rove
trying to argue the the Ohio results I'm
Megan Kelly Trump even Trump's like hey
why isn't anyone paying more attention
to the Rasmussen poll like the most
cooked republican-leaning poll out there
live you guys are delusional from the
top down yeah you know we were holy that
has mediocre political standing exactly
but no but look this is again like Trump
winning is this Black Swan event that
prevented certain kinds of reckonings
and one of the reckonings that was
supposed to happen is propaganda stops
working when it bumps up against the
real world and had they lost and face
the consequences of that loss they would
have seen that FoxNews sent them down a
bad path because it misinformed people
doesn't just misinformed people about
policy and misinformed people about
politics if you're watching something
that's saying every day
why Connor Lang can't win why such a bad
candidate while Republicans should hold
the House by Democrats can't get their
 together and then you lose the
house that tells you that your
information isn't reliable so these guys
have been coasting for such a long time
in an information bubble that hasn't
been popped because of our failure to
win elections yeah and you can see this
in some of the online responses from
sort of the nagging knuckleheads which
is well the polls say and Hillary was
going to win too
and so it becomes it's a security
blanket ah Wow if you were let's pretend
like we listened to bizarro world and
you worked you were a tax cutting racism
excusing House GOP eight how would you
would you would you have tried to spin
this in any way would you have a
different approach to this I mean I
think you kinda have to do the Baghdad
Bob thing if you're a press guy in front
of the in front of the cameras but you
know then I would take the first uper
over to the White House and try have a
conversation with their political office
and see if there's anything we could do
differently to shake things up by yeah I
actually think if I I don't know that I
didn't agree with that I think that you
that the best thing you could do is say
this is the wake of hall the wake-up
call that House Republicans needed is a
tough loss and in a district we should
have won and the good news is we're
taking our lessons from this and we're
not going to be complacent and we're
gonna use everything we learn from this
to make sure we keep the house right
that's that I think is a but like what
is that message okay then what what do
you do I don't know I don't want to work
with these people I want to leave I'm
gonna go take a job at pharmacogenes
yeah
new problems none of them are gonna vote
for anything right like there's no
they're floating today there might be
there are thousands and thousands of
important jobs in the federal government
that have a direct impact on people's
lives and he is filling them with the
absolute worst people exhibit a ben
Carson our friend ben Carson
there's so much promise it's so much our
expectations for Ben Carson were so high
and he has managed to just not meet them
he's considering replacing
anti-discrimination language in the
mission statement of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development this
follows what happened in February where
the US Citizenship and Immigration
Services Department removed the phrase
nation of immigrants from its mission
statement I love what will people hear
these things for the first time if you
cannot be clear on the fact that as you
are running the Department of Housing
and Urban Development that I don't know
people shouldn't be discriminated
against then maybe you shouldn't
actually have that job on the US USCIS
which is the US Citizenship and
Immigration Services changing their
mission what stood out to me was yes
that they took out a nation of
immigrants but even more so was what it
was replaced with and so I just want to
read really quickly white people rule
the mission of it now is protecting
American securing the homeland and
aren't on honoring our values that part
protecting Americans is what really
stands out to me because it's like who
are we protecting Americans from and
it's immigrants right that's that's
that's the most tolerant part to me
because it reinforces this notion that
immigrants are bad for the prosperity
and for the safety of America and if you
look at this mission statement change
with what was leaked from the Justice
Department
strategic plan which is also really
funny to me because part of the new
strategic plan of the Justice Department
is to prevent leaking but having
something apart what they're saying in
the strategic plan from the Justice
Department is that they want to restore
the rule of law and they want to do that
by preventing crime and they
specifically again named
13 so all of this is to say that the way
that we're gonna prevent a crime and the
way that we're going to prevent
terrorism in the United States is by
keeping immigrants out and that's really
problematic because it shows up as
Britney was saying in actual policy
right that's what we're seeing more
people getting deported that's what
we're seeing more people in detention
center we're seeing eight-year-old kids
in jail and those detention
centers are more and more becoming
for-profit detention centers that our
tax dollars are paying like we are
paying to detain and separate families
and we have to pay a lot of attention to
what Jeff Sessions is doing because that
man is dangerous
yes spent his entire life his entire
life his entire career criminalizing
people of color taking away protections
from people of color and we have to be
very village and for what he is doing
because he is baby the view of
ice is their job is to deport people and
it's like and if you're a hammer
everything looks like a nail and so I
think there is a lot to be said for
thinking about it if we make it the next
two and a half years and every
Democratic president to fundamentally
think about taking that agency down to
the ground floor and rebuilding it back
up in a way that is more consistent with
the values of how we should think about
immigrants in this country the
government is so big and sprawling in
the in the White House can't control
every piece of what's going on we tried
we tried and it doesn't work they do not
like it when you do that but even in
foreign policy national security you you
you set out like broad principles and
guidance and then people act on those
and so that's a critical piece of this
puzzle but then when you have a pressing
you knighted States who goes in front of
a bunch of cops and says you know smash
their heads into the door on the way in
it's no big deal
that sends a whole other message that's
just as up that leads to people
you know acting in ways that are totally
inappropriate and violent in some of
these rates that John was talking about
so like it is it is the bad the evilness
of Donald Trump is filtering down
throughout the government in a
frightening way or perhaps it's exposing
the evilness that was already isolate a
lot of Republicans they pick Paul Ryan
out of a hat if you will
[Laughter]
there were twelve Paul Ryan's in one
Michigan right and what they'll do is
they'll talk about how we're a nation of
immigrants and values and they'll go
speak it at naturalization ceremony in
their district and they'll pretend to
believe in a better ideal of America and
then they'll go pass a bunch of policies
and kill immigration reform do violence
other things Donald Trump is at least
brought a level of transparency to the
 Durio of the Republican Party
right he's not pretending he doesn't
speak in that he is just like this is
what we're gonna put a sign up that says
we're these people who are have
been outed for being birthers and it
like the press treats it like that was
the bug not the feature of why they got
hired and our people who don't go
through Senate confirmation they're just
hired like senior advisor for HUD if
somebody can just get hired off the
street so we're not gonna solve that
don't way to solve that problems get the
birth around the White House the but in
the context of actual confirmations yes
it will only take 50 votes but so are we
gonna live in a world where we're for
the next two years Democrat ever state
the Senate back they're going to block
every single Trump nominee or are they
gonna do a better level of vetting or a
better what more scrutiny into the
credit of the Senate Democrats who have
a limited lever here they've pushed
really hard they have held these people
up in in in the process of holding them
up not holding them for the purpose of
structure they're making sure they turn
their paperwork on time and when they
turn the paperwork in we realize that
they lied about things on the resume
they have potential criminal problems
huge financial conflicts of interest and
so that they should continue to do that
and if we actually got in charge of the
committee's then we could do that with
even greater diligence and discipline
what this segment just taught me is that
here's what the future is we're gonna
drill away all of our natural resources
on our best land which will probably
speed up the climate change that the
head of the EPA swears isn't happening
which will worsen environments for kids
living in substandard housing which HUD
apparently doesn't care about anymore
which means that kids actually won't be
able to go out of those neighbor
because thanks to Betsy we probably
won't be able to afford to go to college
and since that can't happen that means
that them along with all of the
immigrants that this administration is
trying to detain will be making license
plates and coffee cups in the private
prisons that Jefferson Beauregarde
sessions wants to put us all in so
that's the future if we don't win this
and they won't have health care and they
won't have them I'm also really
encouraged by these dreamers because
they are still in Washington like if you
go to the halls of Congress on Monday
they will be there and they're not going
to go anywhere until they are heard and
that is an amazing thing they have a
mazy agency a lot of people will
sometimes say if they don't have a voice
like no they actually have an incredibly
powerful voice and they're not just
using it for themselves because yes daca
is is a huge issue right now it's a huge
problem that Congress didn't do anything
even though an overwhelming majority of
Americans support dreamers but there's
also other things going on with
immigration outsider dreamers right
people are still getting deported people
are still getting detained all the
things I mentioned earlier and dreamers
are saying we don't just want a solution
for us we want a solution that includes
our parents that includes the rest of
our community and we don't want to hurt
and we don't and we don't want to hurt
our community by having a law that
protects us and so we have to respect
that and we have to respect that they
don't want to stay here if it means that
their parents are not going to be here
and where we go from here they're gonna
continue to be in Washington we need to
continue to call a Congress every single
day and tell our representatives that we
want them to protect dreamers and you
know what's really frustrating when I
think about parkland and when I think
about the dreamers is that the thing
that Congress chose to take up after the
March 5th deadline and after Parkland
was legislation to deregulate banks I
mean how does that make any sense and by
the way like Tommy and I had a little
Twitter back-and-forth about why I don't
think necessarily the regulations are
like the worst thing in the world for
other reasons maybe we can talk about
later but what is appalling about it is
that
is the thing that Congress chose to take
action on where there is no urgency to
deregulate banks it's not helping the
majority of Americans so we need to
remind them of that we need to remind
them that we know we know what you guys
are working on we don't like it and we
want you to refocus sometimes Democrats
we get technocratic and we talk about
800,000 kids and numbers and statistics
and contributions to GDP in taxes and
the Republicans tell a scary story about
ms-13 and fear and racism and they
appeal to these emotions I think we need
to do a better job of telling stories of
individual contributions of dreamers who
are serving as teachers and in the
military and doing extraordinary things
for our country and our justice American
they are American and and and tell that
story in a way that touches people
because like we know that that works you
can reach people if you appeal to
emotion and appeal the better instincts
and sort of drown out the Donald Trump
arguments that are out yeah that's
exactly all right time because
Republicans win when people are afraid
and Democrats women people are inspired
yeah I make all these calls I knock on
doors I'm still not sure anything's
gonna change
well the dreamers aren't sure of that
either the Parkland students aren't sure
that either the little lobbyists who
went to the halls of Congress aren't
sure that either and yet they go every
single day and they're still there and
they fight because they know that like
if they do it enough but like you said
change comes suddenly after it comes you
know not at all so I think it's a long
fight you know when I think about the
dreamers and daca the reason daca was
even enacted they forced President
Obama's hands to do something it was
them that who made it happen and it's an
it is them who's going to make
immigration reform happen Dean Heller
said this because he's basically in that
interview later he was like yeah and if
Kennedy retires that is the thing that
will gin up the Republican base for the
midterms because right now they're not
energized and the Democrats are and so
if only we have a Supreme Court
retirement then we'll be ready to go and
I sort of think that the Democratic base
needs to be energized if there's a
Supreme Court vacancy
[Applause]
and look if if we take the Senate back
and then there is a Supreme Court
vacancy and Donald Trump nominates
another Neel Gorsuch then Democrats have
the ability to do what Mitch McConnell
did to Merrick garland but I think the
question is will enough Democrats vote
to do that and I don't think we know
that yet and I think it was it goes to
the question of why and should Democrats
why don't Democrats care as much about
3/4 Republicans there's not a good
answer that because they should and
we'll look at two issues we are one
Supreme Court seat away from losing the
woman's right to choose in this country
right and we walk around here talking
about the Second Amendment as if for 200
years we have thought that the
Constitution said that you can buy a
handgun more easily than you can buy
cold medicine and that is not true that
is only a Supreme Court decision as
recent as 2008 and it was a 5-4 decision
and so a different Supreme Court may
look at that differently and say when
the when the founders said we needed to
have weapon arms in order to have a
well-regulated militia they didn't mean
you get to have a gun in your school and
think about this it's another 5-4
decision was Citizens United
a different Supreme Court with justices
picked by progressives can take money
out of politics they can put the cokes
out of business and so we should care
about this more than they should because
the Republicans are benefiting from the
status quo with the Supreme Court and we
the opportunity to change it and so we
have to care we have to get fired up
about it the Supreme Court just ruled
that immigrants in detention do not have
they don't have the right to a a bail
hearing so they can stay in detention
indefinitely that is something that just
happened from the Supreme Court a couple
of weeks ago this daca issue it is going
to go up to the Supreme Court the
Supreme Court didn't rule that daca can
can live the Supreme Court said it has
to go through the normal legal process
so it has to go through Appeals but
is eventually going to make it to the
Supreme Court so if we really are
serious that we care about all of these
issues then we need to care about who is
in the Supreme Court as well
gerrymandering the right to organize the
ability to regulate carbon pollution
these are all issues that could end up
coming between the before the Supreme
Court and why we should care incredibly
if there is a vacancy in this I do think
you know from President Obama's
perspective I thought he had enormous
respect for the men and women serving
when he made decisions about not sending
them into Wars there were a horrific
disastrous idea to begin with you know I
think like I don't know why I don't know
why Democrats are scared to say that as
often as they should I don't know why we
let ourselves you know there's let the
debate be about toughness and and be
about you know acting like a war in
North Korea would somehow be something
simple and wouldn't be a horrific cost
to our US military so I think we need to
make the pitch to these men and women
that we care deeply about them I think
part of that pitch is to fix the VA
because it has been a horribly
functioning agency for a long long time
and Barack Obama tried a number of
things to reform it and we didn't get it
done so we need to keep working on it
well what you guys I think Democrats
since 9/11 have been caught in this trap
where they think that somehow the only
way to be right on national security is
to sound and act as tough as Republicans
and that somehow that means that they
have to be pro-war all the time because
that kind of thinking and that kind of
fear from Democrats is why we ended up
in Iraq in the first place and why so
many Democrats ended up voting for the
Iraq war and I think we learned that
from Barack Obama like who came along
and was opposed to the Iraq war and said
that like you know he's not gonna have
his patriotism questioned because of
that and he's not gonna have him selphie
called weak because of that and that
like it's it's much more important to
have a smart foreign policy than should
just have like a fake tough foreign
so I did that like I think Democrats are
still I don't know if they've totally
learned the lessons of Iraq I think they
still have that fear that they have to
be sound tough on national security but
I know that Obama always thought that
was foolish and you know most people in
the White House did how we care for
folks when they come home is is really
where we need to be focusing our energy
right because you I can hear what you
say but I'm always going to believe in
who you are about how you treat me and
if we are not actually providing
pathways to good jobs and strong health
care and the kind of supports that
military families need then then it's
hard to actually give any rhetoric
that's going to make folks in our and
our armed services feel like we support
them
so that's the one that that keeps me up
at night when I think about you know how
we've come through the last year and I
think okay the courts have held up
remarkably well I think we've seen and
we're going to talk about this this sort
of new activism rebirth of activism in
this country which is you know really
hopeful we've seen Democrats already win
some special elections and so that's
hopeful
right yep that's perfect it'll take it
but then I think like what is and I
think to myself because you know as you
said Sam and as that the man we worked
for always reminded us like we've been
through worse before and we've come out
okay but what is head what has changed
between now between then and now is this
the march of technology and specifically
how it relates to the way we get
information and share information and
and the changing of the media and so now
we have a media that moves at lightning
speed it's fractured it's polarized we
have 30 to 40 percent of our population
that is getting most of their
information about the world from a
propaganda outlet like Fox or talk radio
or sites like Breitbart and you know Sam
as you note in your essay this makes us
particularly vulnerable to foreign
interference like we saw from Russia in
the election but also I mean it just it
sort of splits us apart in a whole bunch
of different ways and what I can't
figure out is like we can organize our
side and we can inspire our side but if
we really want to sort of break the or
or heal the divide in this country I
don't know how we reach a lot of the
folks in this country who are like
dealing with this misinformation and
consuming this misinformation every
single day okay
tell you a little story so Samantha and
I were in some town that we don't live
in and we were talking to someone who
was a very enthusiastic Trump supporter
and as he spoke he's a veteran and he
has agent was as an agent orange victim
and and is very sick and has been sick
and his reason he's a trump supporter as
he said Trump promises to help the vets
and he
said I don't know if he's going to help
us but there's a chance and he said I
just don't think that's true of
Secretary Clinton and there was nothing
awful about this guy is just a good guy
who had his life took a tough turn and
as you spoke I was thinking of him and
for him the problem isn't mostly that
he's listening to Breitbart he maybe is
but the problem is mostly it feels no
one is listening to him and there's a
way that you John in your work in
government and your work now speak to
him and there are Democrats or
Republicans who aren't let's say
Breitbart people are hateful people who
can i think listen first and then talk
to him so if you have a candidate who is
not showing a kind of deep respect for
patriotic values in a way that is kind
of foremost that's that's a problem for
this guy and there are ways of
communicating once you get a kind of
thick sense of what is leaning people to
certain directions it can be President
Trump it can be senator Cruz that maybe
is produced by media stuff or may be
produced by hearing Democrats or let's
say moderate Republicans or conservative
Republicans who have no hate in their
hearts who aren't tailoring their talk
in a way that suggests they've seen this
guy I think that's true up to a point
cast but you know you you're the one who
wrote years ago you know a warning of
echo chambers and selection bias and the
way in which we filter out you know the
opinions initially but now it's like as
facts and opinions that don't comport
with our predisposition so let's say one
turns against or believes that a certain
political figure is not of their taste
you know how does one in this media
environment you know experience
serendipity and and bump into
information
or the perspective of somebody from a
different political party that you know
and the kind of leadership that you're
describing that kind of language that
meets somebody where they are I think it
did John's right with with 30 to 40
percent of people you know get getting
their information and these unmediated
platforms the ability to select out you
know information from people that you
either because your parents had that
view or because you you heard somebody
who didn't like and and you know decided
to to tune them out or because you heard
somebody on the other side of the aisle
that you did like and decided to tune
them and their brethren in I mean so
this is where you know I John one of the
things that gives me hope in this area
is that you know so far our Facebook and
some of these other companies have tried
a few different things you know tagging
things right you know bid now
introducing more transparency about
let's say the sources of their revenue
or the sources of their ads for example
certainly social media users a year plus
after Russian interference and you know
and and sort of Breitbart lies together
you know put a lot of misinformation
into the ether with all of the coverage
that has existed including of the
various investigations you know social
media users I'm certainly a more
vigilant social media user than I was a
year and a half ago and I you know what
I've thought of myself as visually as
vigilant back there and I just what
didn't realize just how much how many
robots were generating the content that
I was looking at in social media so in
some ways we could give ourselves a
little bit of a break I mean and this is
also a bit of an indictment it's
actually quite recent that that you know
people have really turned their their
minds and their resources to thinking
through this question like we were we
were collectively and certainly the
companies were super complacent and
motivated by you know how to make the
company bigger and not much to do with
the the state of our democracy or
thought that making the company bigger
would necessarily advance the health and
welfare of our democracy like so into a
kind of triumphalist narrative well
that's gone and you know is this really
going to be the only
problem that super-smart you know
technical and you know humanists people
who throw their their time and money and
ingenuity to can't solve you know I have
to believe that that even though we
haven't cracked the code so far that
we're gonna find some way out of this
but it is it does undergird so many of
the other of the other challenges we've
it's sort of like the bottom of the
pyramid you know if we give if the
foundation remains this fissured you
know and is contested then one can I ask
you a question did the two of you get
maybe 9700 luggage ads in the last few
days on Facebook where's that because I
happen to look at three luggage as
myself and they kind of noticed that or
did everyone get that sign did not get
those luggage ads nor did oh okay that's
a point for your concern you know we we
always talk about that here it's like
you know Facebook who you know they've
been trying to tell us like no no no
this doesn't really have that much of an
influence it was only this much money
spent it was only this many ads and it's
like oh so this is a company that it's
now telling us that ads and persuasive
message don't have influence and don't
persuade yet that's pretty much the
business model and and when they say
they're hoping that there's an echo
chamber where none of the people who buy
their ads are listening to their claims
don't really work but look I mean I I I
think we can you know a yell about
Facebook and pressure these companies to
do better you know the other alternative
is an actual regulatory structure at
some point for some of these companies
because you know as much as they don't
like thinking of themselves as media
companies but they like to think of
themselves as platforms they are media
companies they are how people are
getting their news but I think there's
also what we were just talking about
like for this to work it requires an
engaged informed citizenry and so we all
have to take some responsibility too
because a lot of there's a lot of people
who just aren't you know they aren't as
selective or as careful as other people
in how they find their news how they
consume their news and
you know you can't always blame them
people are busy they're working multiple
jobs they're just trying to stay afloat
here and you know how do we make sure
that we have you know a country where
people are you know watching out for
this stuff yes so there's individuals
there's information providers and then
there's the platforms and themselves and
the platforms in facebook in particular
you know they've tried a few things on
their newsfeed to counteract this
problem and the fact that they have
tried more than one thing that's
extremely positive and the hope is you
know you can algorithm people Hauge
rhythm isn't a verb yet it should be you
can algorithm people into a little
cocoon of you know Breitbart ISM or
Sanders ISM where they're just seeing
their own stuff and they know enough to
be able to do that or you can do a news
feed and here are just two ideas
Samantha's word of serendipity you can
have something where you know there's
just serendipitous provision of stuff so
you're a supporter of politician X but
you're gonna see some stuff that
politician X doesn't like very much and
all of us have had moments where we see
something that doesn't fit with what we
usually think and which might be a topic
might be about a country it might be a
point of view and we think oh gosh and
that might change our view or maybe on
that issue it might change our whole
life and they can do that with I'm
a-gettin serendipity in there so if the
instruction was for social media
providers go big on serendipity or have
a thought experiment what would you do
if you did that then you can see
something it would be real progress or
here's another idea go big on lots of
views not like lots of clicks and lots
of different viewpoints so that you're
not algorithm din to you know this is
the person who thinks Star Wars is
really the only important thing and the
only thing you need to focus on is who
actually is a Sith Lord and I'm getting
a little exotic here I understand that
but they can do that but instead of
doing that just provide you with lots of
different points of view and not only
about Star Wars so if your internal
Trump supporter let's say you can see
stuff from lots of different points
of you that are not you know substance
list accusations to the effect that
maybe his hair isn't perfect or
something but isn't substantive less
accusations about something unimportant
but something the substantive and real
and then key then that can from which
people can learn things so that expands
her own expanding people's horizons is
something that's completely doable
technologically but the direction in
which the algorithms have been pointing
until the very recent pass is exactly
the opposite it's horizon narrowing Sam
you just gave this fantastic lecture at
Stanford called resistors in dark times
would you talk a little bit about that
lecture and sort of your your the
thought process that went into writing
it absolutely well I have noticed that
notwithstanding the incredible
outpouring domestically of people
getting involved in politics for the
first time or young people listening to
pod save America and you know seeking
your direction John and and those of you
know Tommy and Dan and John about where
to go you know women taking up the the
baton and and throwing making himself
vulnerable by by going back to where
they went to high school and running for
office I mean there's this incredible
outpouring on the one hand and yet of
course people are many people that I
know and you know are very unhappy and
very worried there's a reason that 1984
George Orwell's 1984 his back on the
bestseller list there's a reason that
cast is done the book called can it
happened here authoritarianism in
America this is not a book he probably
would have thought to do two years ago
posing these questions and there's a
there's a deep unease and even people
who are activated I think have this
sensation or recipe for myself that that
sort of nothing we do is commensurate to
the prospect of deporting dreamers you
know nothing we do is commensurate to
pulling out of the Paris treaty
you know when member states of the
United Nations are sinking underwater
and when whole American cities are
overrun like like nothing
some mayor does or some governor's or
some activists do and so we just with
the problem of Trump and what Trump does
next to anything that any of us can do
as individuals that gap is demoralizing
even if we look and see that 38 special
elections you know have been flipped
from Republican to Democrat even as we
see you know the courts defend daca and
you know transgender people serving in
our military even as we hail our
institutions hail our activism so what I
decided to do was to go back to other
dark periods along lines of what we did
in the beginning of this conversation
you know look at japanese-american
internment look at McCarthyism look at
the early days of the AIDS epidemic and
instead of looking at the at the bleak
you know federal government actions or
lack of action in the case of the AIDS
epidemic and the Reagan administration
to look at people who notwithstanding
these big huge harms inflicted from
above stood up and didn't make huge
change by standing up but did their part
and and began to turn but very very
slowly and in in their time they would
have thought you know not even
successfully but but if you look back
you know began to turn the tide of
public opinion and show that resistance
was possible so some examples here you
know when when japanese-americans were
interned when FDR one of our great
presidents you know signed this
completely hateful and unjustified
executive order requiring
japanese-americans
to be interned one of the consequences
of that was that high school and college
students had to be interned and had to
give up their education
and so a group of Americans came along
and decided you know what this is
you know these are young people they're
not a threat there's no even a Roosevelt
justified his internment policy under
the rubric of military necessity in the
wake of Pearl Harbor there was no
evidence that japanese-americans
constituted a threat Eleanor Roosevelt
by the way disagreed with her husband
and with with the policy of the
administration and was very sympathetic
also to the plight particularly of these
young people along of course with their
parents and others who were interned
but a bunch of Americans came along and
said you know this is we have
to find a way to ensure that even if we
can't save everybody and we can't ensure
that the rights of these people are
protected when public opinion is
massively tilted against
japanese-americans notwithstanding the
fact that they've done nothing wrong so
we can't solve this whole problem but
let's see if we can just take a subset
of this problem and find a way to move
these japanese-americans from the
western coast into the interior of the
country so they can go to college and
and sure enough and it was churches
banding together just private citizens
you know if they succeeded in convincing
a university you know in the heart of
America to take a Japanese American they
then had to go and try to find some
sympathetic bureaucrat in Washington to
provide you know basically travel papers
for people to move from these camps then
they'd have to convince
japanese-americans to leave their
families and their parents and
grandparents in these camps and actually
leave and and invest in the idea that
America was a place where they could
build their future that was hard and yet
while the internment again is one of the
ghastly chapters of our history four
thousand young people were placed
because of the activism and the
relentlessness of people who just
wouldn't let it die the other example I
use is from the McCarthy period it's so
hard to remember now how hard it was for
everything from actors and Hollywood
producers you know to teachers educators
everyone to stand up and defend freedom
of association and freedom of belief
people were just cowed it was terrifying
I had no idea it was that bad hard right
it's because we're in our own bleak
period it's hard to remember just how
terrified people were and yet the head
of the University of Chicago Hutchins
decided that he was not going to go
along with you know buying into the
premise that what you believed was
itself disqualifying that you you know
that you shouldn't he was basically
saying you shouldn't have to take a
loyalty oath this is American this is
America and and so what he did when
summoned before one of these committees
is he said you know I'm I'm not I'm not
buying into the premise like my teachers
my students
are gonna get to believe what they want
to believe they're going to get to
associate in the way that they want to
associate you know other elite
universities you had university
presidents saying you know there will
not be a witch-hunt
because there are no witches here there
are no communists on our campus and what
Hutchins did and standing up is he
created a space then for his faculty and
his students to stand with him he showed
the way that you could actually stand up
to these guys and the whole effort in
Illinois which was like a sort of
subsidiary of the national effort of the
house on American Affairs Committee fell
apart
and in the last example just because it
is I think really heartening to go back
and see these again modest examples of
people defying the odds and just taking
matters into their own hands involved
the AIDS epidemic people don't remember
again that Ronald Reagan didn't even say
the word aids you know until 1987 when
tens of thousands of people had already
been infected and so many people were
dying and loved ones just watching in
despair not only as their as their most
beloved you know companions were passing
away but as the government was refusing
even to talk about it to allocate
funding to test drugs to invest at all
in finding a solution and so what a
group of activists led by you know
famously by Larry Kramer did was they
decided the only way we're going to be
able to battle this bureaucracy that's
in complete denial and it frankly
doesn't care about the LGBT community at
all and indeed you know in some churches
are saying that this is you know they
had it coming in effect what we're gonna
have to do is we're gonna have to make
ourselves expert we're gonna have to
master the FDA drug approval process
we're gonna have to understand the
science of HIV and the new drugs that
are used to bring down viral counts you
know we're gonna basically just have to
make us more experts than the
bureaucrats and even then the scientists
applaud today we have the Atlantic's

opera love it that was yours oh love it
it's a great joke thank you for using it
love it use it as the title for our beta
newsletter last night and I figured why
waste it just among the small group of
people who got that news yeah this is
content for more than friends and family
so anyway I want to talk about Hicks I
want to talk about Jared I want to talk
about sessions let's do it big night in
the boardroom yesterday
Trump is reportedly angrier than ever
and he might do something crazy like
slap tariffs on foreign steel have we
heard what he's and more angry than ever
before more anger than ever before
anybody he's an angry dick he's got an
itchy tariff the idea that you would
change America's international economic
policy because you're bad about that and
everyone's reporting this today like
it's completely normal like oh he's
really pissed he might do those by
herodotus he's mad at my dinner was
terrible raised interest rates what are
you talking about
happening it's absurd it's absurd the
the other thing that was part of this
Trump fit of pique coverage is dangerous
moment Trump has lost the people closest
to him he's steaming and wandering
around the building all alone
yeah and it's all everyone who's
competent professionals who always
pulled him back from the brink yeah
without Lewandowski and said Gorka
around the man's loose his former
bodyguard is the other one thank you
yeah where's Keith Schiller he's just
like just being paid out of a slush fund
from the RNC right now okay
great White House let's start with hope
who quit yesterday after being one of
trumps closest and longest-serving aides
as well as his fifth communications
director
the White House is publicly and
privately telling reporters that Hicks
had been considering leaving for several
months but she ultimately picked the day
after admitting to the House
Intelligence Committee that she told
white lies for the president's guys
coincidence what do we think
do we care I so Maggie Haberman was was
argue with people about this on Twitter
saying yet the hearing the day before
hope left was not the reason she decided
to leave
I believe Maggie because I'm positive
that hoped he'd up this story with
Maggie days and days in advance of that
hearing occurring so on that literal
question it's true but I mean one hope
should be smart enough as White House
communications director to know that you
probably should announce the day you're
leaving after you spend nine hours
testifying in front of a congressional
committee to of course the Muller stuff
is under girding all of this it sounds
like the most miserable place in the
world to work in this administration
it's a tough job anyway but she's under
real legal risk real serious legal risk
and I would want out of there too
because every day she hears Donald Trump
talking about hating sessions or
whatever she's further exposed yeah
yeah I would say whether or not it's a
specific coincidence around her
testimony before the House Intelligence
Committee what is not a coincidence is
that every single day she has worked as
communications director for this
president has been some combination of
personal scandal professional scandal or
legal scandal that has gotten worse and
worse and worse that has gotten worse
and worse and worse the other thing as
part of this hope coverage we've just
been bugging me is
uh there is something inherently sexist
in the way she is covered that because
she is young and pretty and a woman
there's this baseline assumption that
she lacks agency that she is like I've
just a that she doesn't have the same
power or authority or responsibility as
a man and that she's just a passenger
you know as part of on this on the Trump
criminality train but she's not and so
even if there is this baseline sexism in
the way that she's discussed publicly
her legal culpability is not affected by
the fact that coverage doesn't treat a
young woman as being as responsible as a
man yeah yeah I mean let's let's
remember it was only about a month ago
that former Trump legal team spokesman
mark Corallo quit and said that one of
the reasons he left is because he
believed that hope may have obstructed
justice when she said that the Don jr.
emails from the meeting the the you know
if it's what you say I love it
especially later in the summer emails
you know thoroughly when she told
everyone those emails will never get out
so not to worry so continue to write a
statement with the president knighted
States aboard Air Force One saying that
the meeting was about adoption so she is
possibly in legal jeopardy for that in
additional hours and there's no love it
was saying it's weird that she's always
described as the person who understands
him the best the person who had his best
interests at heart a true believer in a
world where you have true believers in
like gross DC operators like the Gary
cones and the mooch and the Spicer's
I'll take them over the people that see
him talking about like Charlottesville
or the Muslim ban and think you know at
heart he's a good guy he's trying to do
the right thing I'm in it for the right
reasons the right reasons are deeply
 up and if she doesn't get that I
don't know what to do for her here yeah
I will say it is um they have no you
know she's like a daughter she's part of
the family I will say there's nothing
more familial inside of Trump world than
then saying out loud or putting in an
email no one will ever find out about
this that is a that is almost hereditary
to what these people do
also like at least at least for Ivanka
you can say she hasn't chosen to be part
of the family she's just part of the
family and said hopes chosen to be part
of this family now she thinks it's
 great yeah it's like one thing
to be born into Scientology but you
signed up Freddie went in and took the
courses Trump's an to her he
like Cory Lewandowski put in his book
that Trump would make her steam his
suits while they were on when they were
on the road that's not a cute funny
quirky anecdote from the trail that's a
weird thing to do to the young like late
20s female staffer on your plane he also
apparently trip also told Cory or told
hope that she was quote the best piece
of tail Lewandowski ever had that was in
the Michael Wolfe book that's a
disgusting thing to say to someone who
is called your second daughter so it's
all weird also CNN also has an unnamed
Trump Ella who said that Trump was
pissed about the white lies comment
quote Trump asked Hicks after the
testimony how she could be so stupid and
that was apparently the final straw for
hope Hicks that was apparently the final
straw for hope Hicks so I mean I think
it could be true that what Maggie said
that you know months ago hope was first
considering leaving and then there were
certain things in the last couple weeks
that sort of pushed her over the edge I
don't know why everyone exit the hope
exit timing doesn't matter this doesn't
matter at all apparently CNN said that
Muller's team is also asking about hope
Hicks coming to the New York Times two
days after the election when she said
we're not aware of any campaign reps
that were in touch with any foreign
entities before yesterday which we now
know is not necessarily true was that a
white liar was it bigger who knows who
knows what I hope there's no such thing
as a white lie at the White House I'm
sorry there's no such thing as a white
lie you're you're the person for the
president knighted States as we've
learned Bob Muller makes all lies free
big deal yeah they were even when
they're not lies that will land you in a
massive criminal probe big goes to the
heart of the foundations of American
democracy it is still not okay to lie to
reporters on behalf of the president
yeah so we'll we'll see hope again in
the reunion episode but for now they'll
be interested you'll be on Big Brother
she'll be on Big Brother with Omarosa
all right next guys hate to tell you
this but I think our friend Jared isn't
a lot of trouble
so in the last 48 hours the White House
chief of staff has stripped away his top
security top-secret security clearance
he lost his PR person in the Washington
Post ran a story about how foreign
officials have talked about how to get
whatever they want out of Jared by
taking advantage of the fact that he's
billions of dollars in debt probably has
been business interest in their
countries and is generally a
 that was all topped by last
night's New York Times story that
revealed jared met multiple times in the
White House with leaders of at least two
financial institutions that then made
large loans to Kushner's family real
estate business that he still partially
owns my first question what does this
mean for Middle East peace we'll get
there later I mean start Apollo Global
Management lent him a hundred and eighty
four million dollars after taking a
meeting with Jared Jared apparently
floated the CEO a job opportunity by the
CEO I mean the like the utter lack of
judgment it takes to take this meeting
and to allow this loan to go through as
a staggering can you guys imagine Dan
Pfeiffer who had Jared's job taking a
meeting and then to accepting 184
million dollar loan to like fund his
trust the process
t-shirt scheme it's a craziest thing
I've ever heard and then the kosher
company statement said kosher companies
did not have any conversations nor
interaction with the White House
visitors mentioned in the time story
okay so then the loans magically
appeared yeah Jared greased them or
something happened here there's a loan
so many coincidences in this White House
yeah so there's there's two part there's
two sides to corruption
there's here's how it helped Jared and
here's how it hurt the rest of us it's
pretty clear how this helped Jared right
Jared's businesses are in serious
problem you know he bought a building on
Fifth Avenue and he couldn't make it
work he's got a lot of debts he's racing
around the world to try to refinance and
finance his debt fine that's clearly
what he's doing here but but how does it
hurt the rest of us Donald Trump did an
about-face on a carried interest
loophole that benefits all of these
people that Jared has been seeking money
from and it was actually remarkable when
Trump flipped on this right if you
he was one of the people on the cam he
was a populist and he was like we're
gonna make sure that these you know
these wealthy Wall Street types they
don't pay a lower tax rate than then
teachers right that's the sort of the
argument that was always part of the
plant and then it just never was part of
the plant it never went into Trump's tax
plan and so what happened well they have
to get the money from elsewhere so it
means means higher taxes for
middle-class people it means fewer
deductions for normal people all because
there was a culture in the White House
which jarred clearly could not piss
these people off because he was so
desperate so it's it's funny though in
this in this Trump White House you're
like who is the culprit for the flip on
the carried interest loophole
could it be Jared meeting with financial
institutions could it be the fact that
he has a head of Goldman Sachs running
as economically could it be Paul Ryan
Mitch McConnell who laughed when they
heard about the caricatures I guess
no we're never gonna do that corruption
clue it's Murder on the Orient Express
they are the carried interest loophole
they all did it spoiler there's there's
a lot of focus on like so it's you know
Jerry loses security clearance is he
gonna step down is he gonna stay is he
mad at John Kelly's John Kelly mad at
him but like all that aside it seems
like Jared could be in some real legal
trouble with with Bob Muller here you
know I mean and Marcy wheeler wrote a
piece in The New York Times asking a
chair it's gonna be the next indictment
on a conspiracy to defraud America
charge which is the charge of choice for
Bob Waller and it's just so predictable
yet this is why you don't go into a
White House job without just getting rid
of all your companies and business
interests and why you when you have
massive debts it's seen as a liability
for say a security clearance process or
you know like these things are all
disclosed yeah yeah I mean just there's
so many pieces of this well that are
hard to understand we can't trust any
decision that these people make you know
there was a story that Rick Perry is
jetting off to meet with the Saudis
because that we're gonna help the
Saturday's get nuclear nuclear reactor
so when it's in a big problem well how
does this fit in with Donald Trump's
business interests how does this fit in
with with Jerry Kushner's business
interests did any of this stuff come up
come up when when Jared was going over
to Saudi Arabia when we know that these
are some of the people he's seeking
loans from to buoy up his business so he
doesn't run out of
while he sit in the West Wing I mean
remember mana 4 and gates were charged
with the conspiracy it was in that in
the guise of pursuing foreign policy on
behalf of the United States they were
actually serving the interests of
themselves and foreign governments and
that is that now what Jared's involved
in is the Washington Post story - like
he has been conducting foreign policy
both before the administration started
during transition and since then and the
question is if he was doing that in the
guise of helping America but actually
helping his own family's interests or
helping a foreign interest because all
these other countries now think they can
trick him then he's going to be in
really big truck and we already
know that his sister was out there
Hawking visas for a $500,000 investment
no immigration in the United States
unless you can pay Jared that's a clear
policy we want to cut immigration except
if you have $500,000 and you're a
Chinese investor who wants to pay the
Kushner's off then welcome come here you
are not a should whole country man
scenario unbelievable it's just on the
security clearance thing Tommy likes oh
we haven't talked about this yet can he
can he do his job without a security
clearance was he ever doing his job I
don't think so I mean like as far as I
can tell his job are he's in the Middle
East peace envoy lol he deals with he
feels like relations with Mexico which
is a big security relationship he deals
with China in some form or fashion and
he's like a floating bigshot advisor who
likes to go to the PDB and demand
intelligence if you've been downgraded
from a tea SSCI clearance a sensitive
compartmented information clearance to a
secret level you can't do any of those
things you can certainly go into a room
and have a negotiation and talk about
you know technical details but most of
the time when you go into negotiation
with any country you've been given every
piece of intelligence about the person
you're meeting with what they've been
saying what their position is what they
think their position is like ways to
convince them and if Jared can't access
that stuff it's a huge problem well this
is a bit you know look this is like The
Princess Bride jared is a master and
basically what he's gonna show all of us
is that he can do this left handed he
doesn't need the information he's a he's
a gut guy this is a guy that sits across
from a table he sees inside of our
adversaries and he knows what they want
he knows how to get them what they
while getting America what America track
record of success absolutely I mean this
is a person every phase of his life but
every phase in his life he has defied
the naysayers defied expectation that is
true and irate that it's true you know
just one more point on Jared I do in
some way feel bad for him because none
of this would have happened if he hadn't
had the resources to buy a spot in
Harvard which ultimately led him on a
path to be in positions where he was too
stupid and ill-equipped to do the crimes
he needed to do and get away with them
wasn't so damn arrogant could've just
stayed out of the White House stayed on
the outside a bit of grifting little
schmuck not on the government dime and
gotten away with all this yeah he could
have been the guy trying to get 500k for
visas in China and then gone gonna gone
to the US Open and whatever the hell he
likes he needed more he needed more our
beloved attorney general Jeffrey
Beauregard Sessions the third is
besieged once again yesterday the
President of the United States called
him disgraceful via tweet and attacked
sessions for not investigating the
Justice Department that is investigating
Donald Trump The Washington Post says
that Trump derisively refers to sessions
as mr. Magoo because he is elderly and
bumbly I laugh so much news happened on
Wednesday that the Trump tweeted about
sessions in the morning sort of sort of
faded away by the end of the day seems
like a pretty big deal though guys he's
like possibly a bigger deal than hope
Hicks leaving of course who can forget
the episode of mr. Magoo where he tried
to stop civil rights groups from helping
black people vote oh really the position
of voting for Jesse it's funny like okay
Trump calls him disgraceful in a tweet
and then Jeff's section goes out to
dinner with hot rod Rosenstein and the
number three the do generally yeah in
the whole DC establishment it's like
look at this burn it's a signal signal
maybe this is dissing they're
telling Trump that this is what he used
to do he doesn't care he's an irrational
actor and this he's gonna you know spout
off and fire over the he was
fire apparently such sessions hit back
and in the DC term by like releasing a
statement that was like I will continue
to do my job with integrity but then the
here we are lovers would have been here
but he he had a bad pokeball okay it
turns out turns out when you purchase
the cheapest fish possible delay to your
door with an ice cream scoop and then
allow it to sit in a prius for a half an
hour sometimes bad things happen so here
but we're here you win
before we'll take a bunch of questions
we should start by talking about the
spectacle in the Cabinet Room and the
White House just now Trump Democratic
lawmakers Republican lawmakers they were
all talking about gun control and it was
as if it was the first moment Trump had
ever heard anything about gun control
policy Impala yeah
the look at his face is like a freshman
philosophy class so yours like holy
mind-blowing he is as we always say the
low information voters president blank
slate
the press is us you know this it was
very interesting event if you think his
words have any meaning which I don't we
all remember the the extraordinary hour
he spent talking to lawmakers about daca
right which resulted in him changing his
position 15 times getting overruled by
his own staff like Stephen Miller and
doing nothing
but yeah he started by saying he loves
the daca recipients and and just today
his campaign is selling American
dreamers hats so he really came a long
way on that one yeah it's so offensive
but at this event he said things like we
should take away the guns first and do
you a due process second which is the
literal nra fever dream mass
confiscation of guns Donald Trump cool
remember that one
he told Dianne Feinstein to work with
Manchin and Toomey on their background
checks legislation to a set add a new
assault weapons ban to it which is that
would be big news pretty big thing he
said he's gonna deal with bump stocks
don't even waste your time writing up
bum paragraphs will get rid of bum stuff
get heard of um sucks so that's good
raising the age yeah you talk about
raising the age for purchasing long guns
from 21 to 18 which is something that
had been floated and then walked back
via Axios
I believe by a lot of because because
Republicans in Congress I mean the point
of all this is Trump you know a bunch of
Democratic lawmakers in the meeting
suggested what sounds like common-sense
gun control measures to President Trump
and because they sound like common sense
and he is just a low information voters
who doesn't pay attention to politics
and gets his news from Fox which isn't
really news at all he stood there and
said he sat there and said sure yeah
that all sounds great let's do it yeah I
mean specifically what could happen here
is you know he was talking to Pat Toomey
Republican senator from Pennsylvania joe
Manchin democratic senator from West
Virginia
they had a bill in 2013 after Newtown
after the shooting at Sandy Hook that
Barack Obama pushed very heavily for
Toomey's a very conservative Senator
Manchin is pretty conservative himself
and that was comprehensive universal
background checks still probably not as
far as some of us would have liked for
it to go on background checks but pretty
strong basically closes the gun show
loophole where a lot of people buy guns
on the internet or at gun shows and make
sure that they are subject to background
checks as well
so Trump today is basically telling them
what what happened to your bill why
didn't get why didn't you get your bill
done
didn't you guys mentioned you had a bill
at one point the only hope we have of
Trump backing gun control laws is if he
thinks he can do something that Obama
didn't get done and talk about
which is clearly which is what he
thought and I mean everyone write him a
letter saying you only you can do this
sir Obama could never get this done what
was so amazing about him saying that in
that meeting though is those
snakes John Cornyn and Marco Rubio are
on either side of Donald Trump two
people who voted against manchin-toomey
in 2013 so everyone knows in 2013 when
manchin-toomey tried to pass this bill
it got 55 votes in the Senate it was
five short of 60 we had very few
Republicans except for Toomey McCain
maybe a couple others who voted for the
bill most every Democrat voted for it
except for Heidi Heitkamp and a few
other Democratic senators who are not
there anymore so we got really close to
60 votes but just about every Republican
in the Senate was against it so
most people think nothing comes to this
meeting nothing happens the White House
will probably walk back
Trump's comments and/or you know
McConnell Ryan and other Senate people
will say and house people will say no
way we can pass this right yeah I mean
like John Cornyn is the most cynical
person in the Senate he's disgusting so
he's probably already you know thinking
through ways to make sure this proposal
never sees the light of day Paul Ryan
has already punted from and said the
Senate should start any legislative
movements so whatever but anyway it's
pressure on them it's pressure on
Republicans to do something which is
nice it's nice when Trump the distances
himself from these guys especially when
we're going to be running against these
clowns in the midterms he also he told
Steve Scalise when Scalise was talking
about concealed carry reciprocity no way
just said said forget that don't put it
in the bill which is it was just great
because it's an awful idea where if your
state has super strong gun laws someone
who got a permit in a state with very
weak gun laws which says you can have a
gun no matter if you're a domestic
abusers stock or teenager or whatever
you have to recognize a permit from
another state so would be an awful idea
but Trump excuse kelis was like yeah
let's put it in the bill with background
checks and Trump like now now it'll
never pass weird it was a weird it was
good TV but like you know keeps guessing
keeps you guessing no one no one get too
excited all right let's take some
questions
we got Kim Fritz asks what's the status
on daca go for it it does not look like
it is passing in the house or the Senate
right now because Paul Ryan refuses to
put anything on the floor that would
protect the dreamers unless it also cuts
legal immigration to this country to its
lowest levels since the early 1900s and
of course we fell about 5 or 6 votes
short of passing something that our
compromise that would have protected
dreamers in the Senate so where are we
basically another court ruled last week
that so the Supreme Court last week
decided they're not going to take a doc
a case right now which means that as of
right now the March 5th deadline that we
had talked about for so long is no
longer operable because the court
have said that while we wait for this
lawsuit about daca about Trump ending
daca to move through the courts people
can go apply for work permits so if you
are a dreamer if you were someone who
could qualify for daca right now and and
your permit is running out you should go
apply for another permit right now
because right now they're in limbo
because the court has not decided this
and it doesn't seem like the Supreme
Court will decide this for a while so
we're basically waiting for an appeals
court right now so this is something
like you know Trump's probably excited
about this in the Republicans because
they don't have to do anything now
they're not gonna get held responsible
and they don't have to deport anyone and
get the for that but also dreamers
aren't protected by law right yeah so
that's where it is right now
now that deal JD's Scholten who was
running against Steve King in Iowa we
love that Democrat running against Steve
King how do Democrats in the Midwest
combat the coastal urban stereotypes hmm
Tommy what do you think you know let me
say about this or urban stereotype when
you were there a couple thoughts one
Steve King is one of the worst people in
the world certainly all of Washington
he's overtly racist well he has been for
a long time the the Republican Party was
racist before Donald Trump he said that
al Qaeda would dance in the streets when
Barack Obama was elected the fact that
they never discussed himself from that
piece of garbage says a lot about the
party and kind of cloud the path for
where we are today I spent a lot of time
in southwestern Iowa it's rural it's
different than Los Angeles or Atlanta or
Chicago so I you know I don't know that
there's there's some truth to the rural
urban divide like it's it there are
different places with different people
and I don't think that there's
necessarily a need to combat stereotypes
or like personal views that Democrats in
Boston are different than Democrats in
southwest Iowa I think you have to run a
race on issues that reflect the values
of your district and run strong and be
honest but will you believe in and fight
it out yeah remember Obama was used to
say to us like that when he would go
down to
southern Illinois mm-hmm which yeah and
and in Iowa in the early days and he
said you know I met people and I met
people who are Republicans and people in
rural areas and and they liked me
because it wasn't the caricature of me
that they saw on Fox News or that they
saw in the media and they didn't know
that caricature yet you know if your
candidate running you just got to go out
and meet people and don't worry about
like what's on the news in national
stereo JD's not gonna get a lot of Trump
fans voting for him not getting a lot of
Steve King vans but there's a lot of
reasonable people that are living their
lives that want government to do a
better job that might you go meet those
people and you show them who you are and
then you'd have to worry about the
stereotypes Mia asks I've seen a lot of
people assert that Obama didn't do
anything about guns when he was in
office how would you respond to people
didn't make that argument haha I would
respond with political realities which
are that Obama really really tried to
push common sense gun reform legislation
multiple times
Manchin mentioned to me was the last one
yeah and to the people who say well why
didn't he do it in oh nine when the
passed the Affordable Care Act just
because you have 60 votes to support
healthcare legislation doesn't mean you
have 60 votes to support gun control he
did not it's just a reality the way we
get where we want to be on this is to
win more elections it's the only way we
had a sigh I went back and looked this
up because I was thinking about this the
other day we had a 60 vote 60 votes in
the Senate from April 2009 until
February of 2010 because if we had to
wait for Arlen Specter to change parties
right then we had to wait for Al
Franken's election to be decided because
it wasn't until summer right and then
Ted Kennedy passed away and Scott Brown
won the seat so it was it was in the
middle of healthcare in the middle of
saving the economy and you know and we
still like Mark Pryor and like all these
senators he's been not never doing
control but the first time there was a
mass shooting on Obama's watch around in
Tucson when Gabby Giffords was shot from
that moment on and that was 2011 maybe
he pushed gun control all the time as
much as he could he ended up as also
signing 23 executive actions on gun
control as well when Congress would
anything but I always say like
manchin-toomey you get you get joe
manchin who literally like ran for
office running an ad where he shot a
copy of the climate change bill if you
have him and pat toomey conservative
Senator from western Pennsylvania
pushing gun control legislation and that
doesn't work and if that's still too
liberal for some people it's not Barack
Obama's problem now that if those two
guys are passing I can't get gun control
done like I you know it's a Republican
Party that's bought and sold by the NRA
and a bunch of Democrats were scared
shitless of gun voters and the NRA
pushing them to vote against them and we
have to fix both of those problems Anna
asks what's the deal with Jeff Sessions
asking the Inspector General to
investigate FISA abuses is this a result
of the newness memo I don't know it's
probably the results it's a good very
good question it's probably the result
of broad-based political pressure on
sessions from as president's twitter
feed to notorious devin Eunice's
various memos and other verbal diarrhea
that he spews on the body politic on a
daily basis it was interesting that
Trump doesn't think that it's sufficient
sorry good taking him on it this morning
like for Jeff Sessions you know yet you
know that this was something quite I'd
love sessions was like this is
completely Devin newness is
kind of crazy but I've got to keep Trump
off my ass so I might as well send an
investor and best inspector general to
go and and investigate this and then
he'll go off for months and then that'll
be that right and I'm just hammered him
on it yeah didn't didn't save him at all
Josh Collins asks what advice do you
give high school students like me who
are considering walking out but might
face pics resigning and Tanya and Elijah
and Melanie just giving us their
breaking news sounds to the best of
their ability in every White House
there's some staffer that's close with
the principal and their job is to walk
into meetings and say things like you
know I think we gotta just let Trump be
Trump you know I mean that's the key to
all our message
hoe pick sounds like the greatest Trump
in a blur in the entire building who
would only give him good news who could
do no wrong in his eyes she was not
qualified before the campaign started
she's not qualified now saying that you
tell little white lies for the president
United States is a outrageous comment to
provide to a House or Senate Oversight
Committee I think it was her house so
good is that's pretty that's pretty
crazy
also I wonder if she's in some trouble
too I mean more you know as as the
ultimate yes person to Donald Trump and
they're looking into obstruction she was
there helping with the statement that
Trump tried to draft aboard Air Force
One saying that the meeting with Don
junior and the Russians and was actually
about adoptions which of course it was
not covering up for dumb Donald with his
dad the anthology nice evening so she
could she could be in some trouble could
be in some serious well anyway
that's we'll keep you up-to-date on that
breaking news because that's what we do
all right so Josh Collins asked what
advice to give to high school students
like me who considering walking out but
might face consequences he is I'm
imagine referring to the National
walkout that a lot of high school
students are planning to protest gun
violence and the failure of Congress to
do anything about gun violence I think
it's in April 20th I don't know what do
you think Tommy I mean this is easy to
say and harder to do but walk out you
know what you you're when you're thirty
years from now when you're thinking back
about that day I can remember we learned
in class you no matter if you stood up
for something you care about talk to
your parents about it see what they
think I know some schools skip that
stuff walk out some schools our
superintendents have said you know
three-day suspension some of said it's
okay three days off yeah yeah yeah you
have to figure out you have to do what's
right for you but like think about in
during the civil rights movement in the
60s all those students who participated
in the Montgomery bus boycotts who sat
at lunch counters like you know students
have led the way on a lot of these
social movements forever and it's not
easy when you go do this and when you
protest and when you boycott things like
their end up being consequences to it
and that's why you do it to make it
disruptive and because it's difficult
and so it's never going to be easy to do
something like this there's always going
to be consequences
to it but if it's really important to
you and you believe in it you should do
it you know what Josh Collins your good
guy we support you no matter what you do
probably got them in trouble in advance
now at oh here we go Tommy hmm please
spend stable genius Megan asks please
spend a couple of minutes dunking on
perennial coward Marco Rubio and his
dumb tweets absolutely uh-oh you know
what someone said just do like a
30-minute kushnir burn - maybe we can do
both of these right you know start with
Marco time with Marco I have his tweet
from this morning so I'd like to just
start with why I hate Marco Rubio great
it's because he is the epitome of a
politician who thinks that style Trump's
substance and then he can walk in and be
slick and be friendly and that he
deserves points for that in Washington
look no further than the CNN Town Hall
where he went
he seemed reasonable and empathetic and
friendly but then he wouldn't he would
look these kids in the eye and tell them
essentially that he would do nothing to
stop gun violence nothing to prevent
further violence in their schools when
they're telling them they're scared to
go back to class so he is a political
coward and worse he's a political coward
who thinks that his brand of politics
where you know you just have to be
friendly he's somehow more important and
civility is somehow more important than
what you actually do and he complains
when he's criticized by the media and by
Democrats for his lack of action and
John why are his claims of for civility
so this morning you tweeted the debate
after Parkland reminds us we the people
don't really like each other very much
we smear those refused to agree with us
we claim a judeo-christian heritage but
celebrate arrogance and boasting and
worst of all we've infected the next
generation with the same disease smears
well what the I mean what a downer
from someone who's supposed to be a
United States Senator he's also like
attacking a whole generation of being
like arrogant Wilson but but all that
aside Marco Rubio and his campaign spent
a year in 2016 accusing Barack Obama of
intentionally trying to destroy America
and then he made a bunch of dick jokes
about Donald
on stage at a debate so that's that's
Marco Rubio until until he was until his
career was ended on stage by Chris
Christie who was not turned out to be
the most impressive politician of the
bunch so Marco Rubio desperately wants
to be viewed as someone who was
reasonable who was a solid Republican
but also listens to the other side and
could bring the country together and is
young in a new generation except he has
never taken any position or done any
politics that reflects that desire to be
seen as reasonable you've got to do
something to get to earn that right but
one time he stepped out was on
immigration reform then he got slapped
once right by the right wing of the
party and he has never tried to do a
goddamn thing since and that was the
bravest thing I did coward he actually
did step out on immigration reform and
once I'm with the student movement for
gun safety and let's start with some
brand new poll numbers from CNN back in
October after the mass shooting in Las
Vegas 52% of the American people said
they supported stricter gun laws that
number is now 70% it is the highest
level since December of 1993 after the
gun control legislation known as the
Brady Bill was signed into law by Bill
Clinton among people in gun owning
households I thought this is an
interesting number
57% want stricter gun laws amazing uh
63% support a ban on high-capacity ammo
magazines that's up from 54% in October
and 57% support a ban on the manufacture
sale and possession of semi-automatic
weapons such as the air 15 that is up
from 49% in October guys we did not see
these numbers move after Vegas we
haven't seen in this high in 25 years
what is going on here everyone wants to
say that this time is different because
you want it to be because you see these
high school kids on TV in agony begging
the adults do something but these
numbers bear out the fact that something
is different we have a chance here and
you know 6 and 10 Americans in the ABC
poll think Congress and the president
aren't doing enough to prevent mass
shootings 77 percent want more effective
mental health screenings so like there
is a lot of political support that could
get behind something smart that Congress
puts forward so we have to kid the
pressure on right now yeah I mean it's
important remember right the NRA talks
about their 5 million members or their 7
million members or whatever the number
is it's inflated but regardless that's
still a tiny subset of the whatever 17
18 million gun owning households in the
country and the vast majority of those
people who are not signed up for what
the NRA is or is becoming aren't on
board for the kind of extremist
maximalist position that the NRA has
taken so I think that's a reason for
hope I think the debate is changing I
don't I don't know why you know other
the only thing you can point to is the
kits because they've kept it in the news
they've kept it is that mean they kept
about poll numbers jump all over the
place don't you get like overly excited
about this but what it goes to
is the poll numbers haven't moved after
other mass shootings as much they moved
a little bit after Sandy Hook and then
faded away but they move poll numbers
move and public opinion moves when
people go out there and make the
argument and keep things in the news and
people and and people protest and people
go to the streets and people you know
boycott things like it sometimes and I
think this is a good lesson for
Democratic politicians too is because
sometimes when you believe that nothing
can happen legislatively or that the
politics are too tough you're just like
well I might as well not talk about this
because if I talk about it it's like
pushing a boulder up a hill anyway well
these kids don't give a about that
yeah they also has no good they also
have something that Democratic
politicians have not been able to wrest
the microphone away from Donald Trump
only that's right protests have right if
you look at what has been effective over
the past two years it's been the
protests after the the the women's
marches it has been protest at the
airport it has been these kits so one
lesson here is in a TV medium in a in a
presidency defined by television protest
is an effective way to make your point
over the long haul which is why I think
kids have been more effective at making
this argument that even people that are
committed to this issue like Chris
Murphy and other senators because they
don't have the ability to keep the
attention of the media they don't yes
and you know what the NRA knows that
they're losing and you know how you know
that because they're sending out Dana
Loesch and Wayne LaPierre to try to make
the argument about the media they're
saying the mainstream media loves mass
shootings they're doing what Trump does
which try to make it about elites and
fake news and liberalism it's a garbage
disgusting disgraceful thing to say
about the press but we shouldn't get
chased down that rabbit hole we should
keep talking about the need for
common-sense gun safety laws because the
data shows that if there are fewer guns
out there fewer people get shot it
sounds pretty simple but people dispute
this all the time yeah let's go to that
point the other you know enemy they have
now is Broward County Sheriff Scott
Israel blue lives matter John whose
Department had received multiple calls
about the shooter and his deputy Scott
Peterson resigned after the revelation
that he chose not to enter the school
while the shooter was inside Trump our
president this morning said he'd have
run in there even without a gun
seems like it would've been difficult
without once purrs but hey Kindergarten
Cop was a movie okay there was an actual
cop there with a gun who didn't do
anything because it's hard and scary and
terrifying the situation tell you that
we should armed teachers now as a
panacea so I can't believe were well
we're Republican yet they wanted both
sides of this thing and they want to say
Democrats are being so soft on this
sheriff now and both look you know there
should be a full investigation of what
the happened and that services and
anyone who was responsible who didn't do
their job what they were supposed to be
doing obviously should be punished and
they should be asking themselves instead
of just figuring out exactly who to
blame they should figure what the
do we need to do in the Broward County
Sheriff's Office so that next time you
get multiple calls about someone this
dead never happens again yeah of course
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk
about gun laws - yeah it huh the
kid had a knife we wouldn't have had
that many lives lost if the kid hadn't
maybe just a handgun we wouldnt have had
that many lives lost so like give me a
 break we're not gonna win some
issue we're now gonna have to make it
about you know all about the Broward
County Sheriff we should just be
Commodore position yeah it seems like
there were way too many red flags it
seems like they screwed up a bunch that
guy didn't go in it seems like the law
enforcement screwed up in in stopping
this at every single step of the way
yeah absolutely it seems pretty clear
that that happened what does that have
to do with having millions and millions
of ar-15s in in circulation in reach of
troubled kids that exist in 100% of
places in America every day armed
security guards there were in the
Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas and nothing
happened and they were all the
hypocrisy of every time there is an
unarmed African Americans shot we we
chant blue lives matter and in this
instance because this guy came out in
the chair came out opposed the NRA his
position they are now pounding him it is
notable yeah that said yes we should
figure out what the hell went wrong and
figured out but we should at a federal
level and even at a state level we
should focus on building the movement
infrastructure needed to pass gun
control it's also it's like the NRA can
make their point that that we need
better mental health screening even
though they've never supported the
background checks and what-have-you
they can make the point that this should
have been stopped by this Sheriff's
Department
okay how how high do we want those
stakes to be right it's right it's now
we've now said okay it is now on local
law enforcement to find these kids if
they don't they don't make it bomb
threat anymore they don't show up at
school with a knife
no no they can kill dozens of people
that is the stakes we were putting on
every single Police Department in the
country yeah
and it's and it's completely unnecessary
so it's not just poll numbers that are
moving more than a dozen companies most
of the rental car companies Delta United
have now cut ties with the NRA saying
they would end the partnership programs
where they offered certain discounts to
NRA members conservatives are very upset
about this guys probably it's a very
upset you know I said what if companies
started boycotting Planned Parenthood
what would you do and also you know some
analysts reporters have questioned this
I saw Andrew Kaczynski's an excellent
reporter on CNN say I don't know if this
will have the intended effect those on
the Left want the campaign is to make
the NRA toxic to corporations but it
will also probably harden the views of
millions of law-abiding gun owners who
see the NRA is their voice seemed pretty
hardened those views yeah right I mean
like it's a reflection of the fact in
2016 people care about corporate values
and I personally think that that's a
good thing
corporations as soulless money vacuums
hasn't necessarily worked out for us
over time I there may be instances where
there's a boycott that I don't love but
like this is a reflection of where
consumers are and it's also I think it's
useful to show the NRA isn't all
powerful and to be able to pick these
corporations off one by one and get them
to walk away from it and funny to watch
you know huffy conservatives who mocked
Democrats are being snowflakes get upset
that they have to switch from United the
Delta and give me a break so it's it's
about it's about what the NRA has turned
into - it is not a it's not a gun
fellowship group been awash called it on
Twitter they write it is look at their
 ads go to NRA TV they it they
are they are the most it's not even good
to call them partisan they are basically
they're inciting they're trying to
incite violence they are trying to make
one half of America hate the other half
of America and say to people because you
hate them so much because those people
are hate you so much and are coming
after you Hollywood liberals brocco bomb
all the rest of them you should probably
buy some guns because
by the way the bun gun manufacturers or
who we really work for and that's what
we want to do that's what they are let's
be honest it's also I would want to be
associated with that if your company
it's also about separating the facts and
substance of the debate over gun control
from gun control measures if if if a
debate is about the facts and substance
of gun ownership and gun control there's
quite reasonable compromises you can
reach that people can have arsenals in
their homes and continue to enjoy
hunting and shooting in all the ways in
which they enjoy using guns while
putting in some common-sense reforms
they that wouldn't be seen as a defeat
for them but they need to make every
single act of gun control a partisan
defeat that's something that is a that
attacks they are kind of token that's
why that's why they need to make sure a
ar-15s are kept in circulation because
now it's not just about sort of the
balance between freedom and
responsibility it's about this thing as
a symbol of freedom that's the first
thing the second thing is those even
those conservatives I think couldn't
really articulate why they were bothered
by the fact that the NRA was losing
these discounts right basically the
equivalent like triple-a discounts not
that big a deal matter they don't really
matter I also a lot of these guys these
conservatives these conservatives on
Twitter like just columnists in DC who
have the same capacity for for firing
guns is like I do for bobsledding right
they don't have any connection to this
but they need to they want to be mad
about it because it's basically saying
the NRA isn't a normal group anymore
that there's a certain point which I
don't mind if you know this is about you
know Planned Parenthood and has
partnerships with with with Airlines
some conservatives groups have
partnerships with with corporations I
don't have a problem with that what this
is saying is the NRA no longer deserves
to be treated like a respectable
respectable organization that can have
discounts and and and little little
little uh promotions with with
restaurants and what-have-you because
their behavior now crosses a line into
something that is completely
unacceptable to our society and that is
the part that they can't accept they go
out there they said the media loves mass
shootings they say you know the it's
it's absurd they're not a just
and not even a lobbying organization
anymore and their solution to the
problem of 17 kids getting shot is one
designed to have hundreds of thousands
of more guns
just two armed teachers it's the
maximalist cynical position and we
should just call for what is and also by
the way I know that was also one of
those dumb debates not had the people
railing about this had no idea that they
were NRA discount nobody knew they were
NRA discounts at Hertz rent-a-car and
then about a half the NRA members had no
idea they were Hertz there's a discount
Hertz rent-a-car and now these guys are
on Twitter being like well I guess I'll
have to go to enterprise now so I I will
never oh you know what I want to also
ask these conservatives about these
boycotts that they declared on Twitter
what do you keep a list
bull-fucking-shit two years from now
you're gonna remember that you tweeted
during this thing give me a break
nobody's remember any of this
nobody the number of people if people
were cutting to the extent they claim to
be boycotting on Twitter the economy
would grind to help we'd be trading in
oranges Sean Hannity throwing the keurig
out the window so where else can we
apply pressure you know people are
trying to pressure Amazon Apple TV and
other video streaming sources and
platforms to stop carrying and our a TV
great rate keep doing it again go watch
the has with Dana version some
of the other ones they're scary as hell
and and where else can we apply pressure
some people talked about banks Bank of
America has said that they're gonna look
at their relationships with some gun
manufacturers other they said it in the
most careful corporate PR way so who
knows what will happen there and gun Mac
you know Dan talk to this on Thursday
pods sorry Dan talked about this on
Thursday's plot gun manufacturers
themselves I mean the the big enemy here
is not because the NRA ultimately is not
representing gun owners they are
representing gun manufacturers they want
to try to sell more guns and it is gun
manufacturers that we should be putting
pressure on in this we should try to cut
off their sources of funding and all the
other stuff that's that's what we're
that's the big goal quick shout out to
Think Progress and sleeping giants who
have done incredible work calling out
these companies and starting movements
to get people to pressure them you keep
it up let's talk about legislation so in
Florida Rick Scott wants to pass a law
raising the minimum age to buy any
firearm from eighteen to twenty one
strengthen rules to keep weapons away
from people with mental health problems
domestic abusers and stalkers prospects
of this he is disagreeing with the
legislature in Florida over a few things
he Scott doesn't want a three day
waiting period well
hhor-- does Scott doesn't want armed
teachers broke from Trump on this the
legislature the legislature does so the
plan isn't enough but it breaks from the
NRA and Trump Trump in the Republican
Congress meanwhile are most likely to
consider the corn and Murphy bill that
we've talked about that gives States
incentives to submit criminal conviction
records to the federal background check
system ol will any of this get done guys
you know I don't think we know
I think the future isn't written I hope
so I think it is possible I just want
one point on these uh the arming
teachers thing I I don't think there's
been an issue like this in a very long
time where it's one of those things
where everybody stops in their tracks
and goes hey this is crazy yeah are you
talking about what do you mean armed
teachers because it's almost like one of
those things I think that can shake even
hardened partisans out of their out of
their kind of whatever their their
foxholes people just what do you what do
you mean my kids teachers gonna have a
gun in the classroom I think that I mean
that calling other people is a little
disconcerting I am done I am very
skeptical at this point we have to be so
skeptical about Policy Polling because I
really believe that the number of people
answering the phones are the kind of
people that are going to take their side
too so I I just does one thing the other
thing just is um one sign of hope is
Marco Rubio in that Town Hall changing
his mind on the fly because Marco Rubio
doesn't do anything unless Marco Rubio
believes it's in his political interest
so I think Marco Rubio is has his finger
in the wind and he hears high-capacity
magazines he thinks about raising the
age he thinks about background checks
and I think his shift represents where
Republicans are gonna be you know it's
interesting that Florida is is taking
some of these steps because there's an
amazing piece in The New Yorker this
week about the NRA a chief lobbyist in
Florida and this person is one of the
most powerful individuals in the entire
state of Florida literally writing
legislation for lawmakers pushing
massive contributions towards
independent expenditures and Florida's
become a petri dish where concealed
carry or stain your ground laws are
first passed and then they're moved to
different states on a state level which
is a lot easier than creating new
federal laws so if we can you know you
know show that the NRA is not invincible
in Florida of all places where there is
a crazy Republican legislature I think
that could benefit in ways and ripple
out over time in ways that aren't
totally apparent right now ya know I am
for all of these sort of like
half-measures incremental measures
passing we should push for them because
you know you build off small victories I
do think we should be like that the gun
safety move it should be clear on a few
of the big goals that we want you know
it's or Democrats running for office
right it's banned semi-automatic weapons
bring back the assault weapons ban yeah
universal background checks if not a gun
license some states have you have to get
a gun license which is an even more
extensive background check and it's more
stringent and then a ban on
high-capacity ammo three things assault
weapons ban high-capacity ammo gun
licenses and those are big significant
gun measures and maybe we don't get
those for ten years but maybe we start
in the states like you said maybe the
states become laboratories for if we win
back some of these governorships in 2018
and we went back some state legislatures
and we start passing them there so I
just I think we need to keep these like
with like a big three big couple policy
initiatives as a North Star here that we
keep pushing for also everywhere you
pass them they save lives right every
time and then you have that evidence
yeah every single time that's happened
in Connecticut after Sandy Hook we see
welcome to plod save America I'm John
Favreau
I'm I'm John Lovett
I'm Tommy Vitor on the show today we'll
be talking to the host of with friends
like these Anna Marie Cox about her trip
to the Conservative Political Action
Conference known CPAC also she thought
it was just a dream John but then when
she woke up there was sand in her bed
[Music]
guys don't forget to sign up for what a
day what a day you're even getting the
drafts you had a great newsletter so
it's our newsletter that we think and
hope is launching next week it's out of
beta its releasing on time bunch of
betas reading it right now no big deal
but it's um we're very excited about
this so sign up for the newsletter guys
if you haven't already everyone else is
doing it you're gonna be the it's just
must like the cash out the numbers are
pretty big it's the fact anyway we hope
you enjoy it oh how was speaking of love
and I was loved or leave it we had a
fantastic lover leave it in Sacramento
with Mayor Michael Tubbs friend of the
pod hmm Jenny yang Maria and Alicia
Garza who is one of the co-creators of
black lives matter it was a surprisingly
uplifting show even they were covering
some dark stuff and look we talked about
black panther we talked about the need
for a gay superhero and there's a bit of
a dispute as to whether or not people
like James Baldwin and everyday heroes
count and they don't because James
Baldwin might have been great but he
didn't shoot lasers out of his eyes hey
you know II mean so we had some of that
discussion come here an unassailable
point you know one of the things I love
about pod save-the-world the fantastic
show I host on a weekly basis is that
there's some stuff I know about already
and then sometimes I have to dig into an
issue that I knew nothing about and I
learn a ton and it blows my mind this is
one of those examples about jeans denim
types of denim
there's about Luke raft of corruption
scandals that Bibi Netanyahu thing
trouble bribes to stuff involving
submarines you will not it is
unfathomable how much trouble he's in
his family is in and what it could mean
politically unfortunately there's not a
great silver lining for what compete
politically the Israeli government
use this or move to the right in a way
that is uh I don't think good for Israel
I don't think it's good for us interest
it's certainly not good for the peace
process but listen to the episode Nathon
Guttman fills us in on everything
happening over there and it's funny
about it so check that man the bribing
of the press to try to get the good
press coverage no one told me that was
an option John I was hooked for chumps
like this recipe is pretty cool I
learned a lot from this episode and I
also was listening to it thinking like
if there wasn't a president Trump this
might be one of the bigger stories in
the world in international politics
right and the parallels between B B's
response and his party's response and
the way it broke down the partisan lines
in Israel is so similar to the u.s. so
there's a lot we can learn yeah okay
let's get to the news once I put the
student movement for gun safety and
let's start with some brand new poll
numbers from CNN back in October after
the mass shooting in Las Vegas 52% of
the American people said they supported
stricter gun laws that number is now 70%

57% want stricter gun laws amazing uh
63% support a ban on high-capacity ammo

and 57% support a ban on the manufacture
sale and possession of semi-automatic
weapons such as the air 15 that is up
from 49% in October guys we did not see
these numbers move after Vegas we
haven't seen in this high in 25 years

say that this time is different because
you want it to be because you see these
high school kids on TV in agony begging

mass shootings 77% want more effective
mental health screenings so like there
is a lot of political support that could
get behind something smart that Congress
puts forward so we have to get the
pressure on right now yeah I mean it's
important remember right the NRA talks
about there
million members or they're seven million
members or whatever the number is it's
inflated but regardless that's still a
tiny subset of the whatever 17 18
million gun-owning households in the
country and the vast majority of those
people who are not signed up for what
the NRA is or is becoming aren't on

maximalist position that the NRA has

don't I don't know why you know other
the only thing you can point to is the

they've kept it is poll that mean they
kept about poll numbers jump all over
the place don't you get like overly
excited about this but what it goes to
show is the poll numbers haven't moved
after other mass shootings as much they
moved a little bit after Sandy Hook and
then faded away but they move poll
numbers move and public opinion moves
when people go out there and make the
argument and keep things in the news and
people and people protest and people go
to the streets and people you know
boycott things like it sometimes and I
think this is a good lesson for
Democratic politicians too is because
sometimes when you believe that nothing
can happen legislatively or that the
politics are too tough you're just like
well I might as well not talk about this
because if I talk about it's like
pushing a boulder up a hill anyway well
these kids don't give a about that
yeah they also has no but they also have
something that Democratic politicians
have not been able to wrest the
microphone away from Donald Trump only
that's right protests have right if you
look at what has been effective over the
past two years it's been the protests

hole we should keep talking about the
need for common-sense gun safety laws
because the data shows that if there are
fewer guns out there fewer people get
shot it sounds pretty simple but people
dispute this all the time yeah let's go
to that point the other you know enemy
they have now is Broward County Sheriff
Scott Israel blue lives matter John
whose Department had received multiple
calls about the shooter and his deputy
Scott Peterson resigned after the
revelation that he chose not to enter
the school while the shooter was inside
Trump our president this morning said
he'd have run in there even without a
gun
seems like it would have been difficult
when Spurs but hey Kindergarten Cop was
a movie okay there was an actual cop
there with a gun who didn't do anything
because it's hard and scary and
terrifying the situation tell you that
we should arm teachers now as a panacea
so I can't believe where well we
Republic a ting it they want it both
sides this thing and they want to say
Democrats are being so soft on this
sheriff now and Bob look you know there
should be a full investigation of what
the happened and that shows and
anyone who was responsible who didn't do
their job what they were supposed to be

they should be asking themselves instead
of just figuring out exactly who to

do we need to do in the Broward County
Sheriff's Office so that next time you
get multiple calls about someone this
never happens again yeah of course but
that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk
about gun laws - yeah there's
not a kid home with a kid had a knife we
wouldn't have had that many lives lost
if the kid had maybe just a handgun we
would've had that many lives lost so
like give me a break we're not
gonna win some issue we're now gonna
have to make it about you know all about
the Broward County Sheriff we should
just be Commodore position yeah it seems
like there were way too many red flags
it seems like they screwed up a bunch

100% of places in America every day
armed security guards there were in the
Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas and nothing
happened
 the hypocrisy of every time
there is an unarmed African Americans
shot we we chant blue lives matter and
in this instance because this guy came
out and the chair came out opposed the
NRA s position they are now pounding him
it is notable yeah that said yes we
should figure out what the hell went
wrong and figured out but we should at a
federal level and even at a state level
we should focus on building the movement
infrastructure needed to pass gun
control it says also it's like the NRA
can make their point that that we need
better mental health screening even
though they never supported the
background check someone have you they
can make the point that this should have
been stopped by this Sheriff's
Department okay how how high do we want
those stakes to be right it's right it's
now we've now said okay it is now on
local law enforcement to find these kids
if they don't they don't make it bomb
threat anymore they don't show up at
school with a knife no no they can kill
dozens of people that is the stakes we
were putting on every single Police
Department in the country
yeah and it's and it's completely
unnecessary so it's not just poll
numbers that are moving more than a
dozen companies most of the rental car
companies Delta United have now cut ties
with the NRA saying they would end the
partnership programs where they offered
certain discounts to NRA members
conservatives are very upset about this
guys Republicans are very upset you know
I said what if companies started
boycotting Planned Parenthood what would
you do and also you know some analyst
reporters have questioned this I saw
Andrew Kozinski's an excellent report on
CNN say I don't know if this will have
the intended effect those on the left
want the campaign is to make the NR a
toxic to corporations but it will also
probably harden the views of millions of
law-abiding gun owners who see the NRA
is their voice seemed pretty hardened
those views yeah right I mean like it's
a reflection of the fact in 2016 people
care about corporate values and I
personally think that that's a good
thing
corporations as soulless money vacuums
hasn't necessarily worked out for us
over time I'd there may be instances
where there's a boycott that I don't
love but like this is a reflection of
where consumers are and it's also I
think it's useful to show the NRA isn't
all powerful and to be able to pick
these core
operations off one-by-one and get them
to walk away from it and funny to watch
you know huffy conservatives who mocked
Democrats are being snowflakes get upset
that they have to switch from United the
Delta and give me a break
so it's it's about it's about what the
NRA has turned into too it is not a it's
not a gun fellowship group called it on
Twitter they write it is look at their
 hats go to NRA TV it they are
they are the most it's not even good to
call them partisan they are basically
they're inciting they're trying to
incite violence they are trying to make
one half of America hate the other half
of America and say to people because you
hate them so much because those people
are hate you so much and are coming
after you Hollywood liberals brocco bomb
all the rest of them you should probably
buy some guns because by the way the but
gun manufacturers or who we've really
worked for yeah and that's what we want
to do that's what they are let's be
honest it's also I wouldn't want to be
associated with that if you're a company
it's also about separating the facts and
substance of the debate over gun control
from gun control measures if if if a
debate is about the facts and substance
of gun ownership and gun control there's
quite reasonable compromises you can
reach that people can have arsenals in
their homes and continue to enjoy
hunting and shooting and all the ways in
which they enjoy using guns while
putting in some common-sense reforms
that wouldn't be seen as a defeat for
them but they need to make every single
act of gun control a partisan defeat
that's something that is a that attacks
they are kind of token that's why that's
why they need to make sure a ar-15s are
kept in circulation because now it's not
just about sort of the balance between
freedom and responsibility it's about
this thing as a symbol of freedom that's
the first thing the second thing is
those even those conservatives I think
couldn't didn't really articulate why
they were bothered by the fact that the
NRA was losing these discounts right
basically the equivalent like triple-a
discounts nothing to get do matter they
don't really matter I also a lot of
these guys these conservatives these
conservatives on Twitter like just
columnist in DC who have the same
capacity for firing guns as like I do
for bobsledding right they don't have
any connection to this but they need to
they want to be mad about it because
it's basically saying the NRA isn't a
normal group anymore that there's a
certain point which I don't mind if you
know this is about you know Planned
Parenthood and has partnerships with
with
with Airlines some conservatives groups
have partnerships with with corporations
I don't have a problem with that what
this is saying is the NRA no longer
deserves to be treated like a
respectable respectable organization
that can have discounts and and and
little little little promotions with
with restaurants and what-have-you
because their behavior now crosses a
line into something that is completely
unacceptable to our society and that is
the part that they can't accept they go
out there they said the media loves mass
shootings they say you know the it's
it's absurd they're not a just
don't even a lobbying organization
anymore and their solution to the
problem of 17 kids getting shot is one
designed to have hundreds of thousands
of more guns purchased two armed
teachers it's the maximalist cynical
position and we should just call for
what is and also by the way I know that
was also one of those dumb debates not
had the people railing about this had no
idea that they were NRA discount nobody
knew they were NRA discounts at Hertz
rent-a-car and then about a half the NRA
members had no idea they were Hertz
there that discount Hertz rent-a-car and
now these guys are on Twitter being like
well I guess I'll have to go to
enterprise now sorry I will never oh you
know what I want to also ask these
conservatives about these boycotts that
they've declared on Twitter what do you
keep a list
bull-fucking-shit two years from now
you're gonna remember that you tweeted
during this thing give me a break
nobody's remember any of this nobody in
the number of people if people were
cutting to the extent they claim to be
boycotting on Twitter the economy would
grind to help we'd be trading in oranges
Sean Hannity throwing the keurig out the
window so where else can we apply
pressure you know people are trying to
pressure Amazon Apple TV and other video
streaming sources and platforms to stop
carrying and our a TV great keep doing
it again go watch the has with
Dana wash and some of the other ones
they're scary as hell and where else can
we apply pressure some people talked
about banks Bank of America has said
that they're gonna look at their
relationships with some gun
manufacturers other they said it in the
most careful corporate PR way so who
knows what will happen there and gun
Mack you know Dan talk to this on
Thursday pods sorry Dan talked about
this on Thursday's plot gun
manufacturers themselves I mean the the
big enemy here is not because the NRA
ultimately is not representing gun owner
they are representing gun manufacturers
they want to try to sell more guns and
it is gun manufacturers that we should
be putting pressure on in that we should
try to cut off their sources of funding
and all the other stuff that's that's
what we're that's the big goal quick
shout-out to Think Progress and sleeping
giants who've done incredible work
calling out these companies and starting
movements to get people to pressure them
keep it up let's talk about legislation
so in Florida Rick Scott wants to pass a
law raising the minimum wage to buy any
firearm from 18 to 21 strengthen rules
to keep weapons away from people with
mental health problems domestic abusers
and stalkers prospects of this he is
disagreeing with the legislature in
Florida over a few things he Scott
doesn't want a three day waiting period
the legislature does Scott doesn't want
to arm teachers broke from Trump on this
the legislature the legislature does so
the plan isn't enough but it breaks from
the NRA and Trump Trump in the
Republican Congress meanwhile are most
likely to consider the corn and Murphy
bill that we've talked about it gives
States incentives to submit criminal
conviction records to the federal
background check system ole will any of
this get done guys
you know I don't think we know I think
the future isn't written I hope so I
think it is possible I just want one
point on these uh the arming teachers
thing I I don't think there's been an
issue like this in a very long time
where it's one of those things where
my guest today on pod save the world is
'not on Guttman he's the Washington
bureau chief of the forward he joined
the staff there in 2006 after serving
for five years as a Washington
correspondent for the Israeli dailies
Haaretz and The Jerusalem Post and the
time thank you so much for being here on
pod save the world
I'm very excited to talk to you today
about Prime Minister Netanyahu and what
the hell is going on in Israel but sort
of hoping we could start with the facts
because there are so many stories
swirling out about corruption
allegations around the Prime Minister
that is actually hard for me to keep
track so it's hoping maybe we could
start by quickly walking through them
one by one the first is referred to in
the news as case 1000 it involves
Netanyahu receiving hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of gifts like
champagne and jewelry from a wealthy
businessman what happened there what are
the implications right yeah the very
police who made things easier for us
because they leave just numbered each
one of the cases we have 1,000 2,000
3,000 so the first one is 1000 that may
be the easiest case to understand for
about ten years Bibi Netanyahu and his
wife Sarah received gifts from a
Hollywood producer named Arnold milchem
he's pretty well-known in Hollywood he
produced films like a pretty woman and
he's a former Israeli who spends most of
his time in the United States and is
very close to it and it and yawen to
other Israeli leaders and apparently is
the Netanyahu's have a liking for the
better kind of life sorry Netanyahu
likes pink champagne Bibi Netanyahu
likes expensive cigars so we are and
it's hard to get by with that with a
with a government salary it's hard to to
come across all of these things and so
they reached out to Arnold milchin and
it started off as as gift but it became
a whole industry and according to the
police by the end of these ten years it
reached a value about three three
hundred thousand dollars of gifts that
why mention gave the Netanyahu's and
it's even hard to call it gifts because
they asked for it they they would just
let him know or let the driver know when
they needed more champagne or sick
there was also jewelry in there so
that's the the the Netanyahu side of it
him what did Milton get in return
allegedly we should say this is even
more complicated because Arnold
mentioned is a film producer but he also
kind of moonlighted as an Israeli agent
helping out Israel with its nuclear
program in getting all kind of
clandestine information and he was kind
of helping out the Israelis but problem
is that he couldn't keep his mouth shut
and when he talked about it in
interviews in American immigration
authorities looked into it and when it
was time to renew his visa they said
well we're not really sure that we want
to give this guy a visa because this is
what he's doing in the United States and
so he lost his visa to the United States
and that's where Bibi Netanyahu is
friend could help by speaking to
American officials even as high as
secretary Kerry and in the Israeli the
American ambassador in Israel so that's
one of the things there are also other
business issues that Bibi Netanyahu ID
to help milchin out with like a tax
break if he comes back to Israel so we
won't have to pay taxes on all the
fortune that he made in America and
other issues like that Wow
so that's even more shocking than I
thought case 2000 alleged the Netanyahu
tried to strike a deal with Israel's
second largest newspaper to get more
favorable coverage what happened there
what's the quid pro quo in this instance
so for Bibi Netanyahu it's simple he
wants to get good press doesn't anyone
everyone want to get good press right
and the whole note is the largest paper
the most influential newspaper in Israel
and their line while their centricity in
a political sense they don't really like
Netanyahu so they were pretty critical
of him and he wanted to correct that
situation him he had something to give
you do Tohono because he be other
Hinata's facing its own problem him
since there is a competitor the
competitor is called
Israel hayom it's a right-wing probaby
newspaper and it's funded fully by
Sheldon Adelson who you know well the
famous Las Vegas Republican make it
so here's the deal that was discussed
and conveniently even recorded by one of
the participants who later gave these
recordings to the police
basically Netanyahu told the publisher
of video do not know any Moses he came
to me and said you know I can talk to
Sheldon Adelson the owner of Israeli
home and make sure that he limits the
circulation of his paper should mention
by the way that you said a ohm is
circulated for free that's why it's such
a strong newspaper now what if I get
Sheldon to limit the circulation of
visceral human help your business what I
get in return better coverage to which
Nani Moses wrote we replied sure of
course we can cut a deal like that
now these talks never let a deal for one
reason or another but basically there
were enough for the police to recommend
charging Netanyahu and Moses the
publisher on bribery charges thank God
and then so there's also another
instance which I believe is separate
where Netanyahu's aides or accused of
trading favorable treatment of a telecom
company for us so having said this again
because I garbled that so confusingly
there's another case where Netanyahu's
aides are accused of trading favorable
treatment of a big telecom company for
favorable treatment from its news
website that's distinct right is is this
one also a problem for Bibi oh
definitely it is so now we're leaping to
case 4,000 oh my god sorry let's leave
3,000 of Cyprus great have to do with
submarines and it's very exciting myself
4,000 has to do with him
Bibi Netanyahu in again warning to
receive better coverage from a very
popular news website in Israel called
Walla and it is owned by a wealthy
businessman named shale a Levite who is
also the owner of basic as wheels
largest telecommunications company in
this case four thousand which is still
under investigation we didn't see a
police recommendations on this case as
of now again in all of it needed all
kind of regulatory benefits from the
government Netanyahu who conveniently is
only the Prime Minister but also the
Minister of Communications he insisted
on holding that portfolio it wasn't a
position to give him these regulatory
breaks or that would help his business
immensely and in return voilá became
this very Pro Netanyahu and even more
important very Pro SONET and our website
him at one point this recording came out
and again as you can already see
everything in Israel apparently has
recorded this recording came out of
Netanyahu the Prime Minister's wife
screaming had a media consultant because
she didn't like the type of coverage she
was getting in wallah and her problem
was or her issue was that they forgot to
mention there that she is a psychologist
with a master's degree okay
that's confusing this case is still
under investigation right and as of this
week the the police investigators
managed flipped one of bebés
highest-ranking aides who was also the
director-general of communications
ministry and a person considered very
close to Netanyahu he is now cooperating
and according to police the press
reports in Israel he knows everything
about what Bibi did and is willing to
talk
sowhat's case 3,000 men submarines yeah
I hope I am if 3,000 has to do with
submarines and it's very complicated and
it probably won't lead to an indictment
but in short it has to do with the
question death Israel me how many
submarines does Israel need him
Netanyahu apparently overruled the
decision of the military and decided
that Israel should purchase more
submarines aim as I did and purchase
approaches of them from from Germany
from shipyard in Germany I think is that
the person in brokering this deal isn't
it an owl's personal lawyer who is also
a relative of him which raises the
question does Israel really need all
these sub
or is Netanyahu pushing for this deal
because his lawyer and relative is
getting a cut off of this deal this
again is under investigation most people
think this will will not end in an
indictment and then on top of all of
this Netanyahu's wife who you mentioned
earlier is being questioned by Israeli
police over allegations that she's been
using public funds for private expenses
and compounding that problem a former
Netanyahu family adviser allegedly
passed a message to the prosecutor in
that case suggesting that she dropped
the charges against mrs. Netanyahu in
exchange for being named attorney
general so that also sounds like a
pretty big deal right and part of the
reason that we're hearing all these
cases come out now is because there's a
sense in Israel that in Netanyahu is
vulnerable right now so all kind of the
aides and people who were involved and
people who knew him for years but we're
afraid to talk are now coming out with
these stories so the story about him
this quid pro quo that you mentioned him
that's the dismissed
sorry netanyahu cases and in return will
appoint you Attorney General this
happened already two years ago but we're
only learning about it now Wow
okay so that is a lot of corruption or
these allegations of corruption for a
system yes alleged corruption force
isn't a process at one time but it's
it's hardly the first corruption scandal
in Israel right 2008 Prime Minister
Olmert resigned a week after police
recommended he be charged with fraud
bribery obstruction of justice he later
served I think 16 months in prison
Netanyahu himself dealt with corruption
allegations back in the late 90s does
this mean that Israelis are more
prepared for these types of allegations
and what is the response like in Israel
to what people are reading I think the
response basically breaks down along
party lines him and has to do a lot with
the fact that these investigations are
going on for a few years already and
that Netanyahu has been working to him
in a sense discredit a the
investigations discredit the police
discredited the the Attorney General in
order to make the case that this is all
political witch-hunt and everything that
I'll say from now
on you can replacement and yell for
trumpets exactly the same right so
basically he's saying you know they
couldn't beat me at the ballots I'm
Prime Minister almost the
longest-serving Prime Minister Israel
ever had just won my fourth election aim
and since they can't beat me fair and
square they're going on after all these
tiny things insignificant matters
whether I got a cigar it didn't get a
cigar whether I did this guy a favor or
not him so basically it break down break
down along party lines if you're a
supporter of Netanyahu's support of
literally cooed you're willing to buy
that story otherwise Israelis are kind
of shocked they aim kind of disgusted by
the by the way by the information that's
coming out and how severe it is a public
opinion polls show that Israelis don't
believe Netanyahu on this case however
politically he somehow seems to still be
pretty strong um you mentioned Sheldon
Adelson earlier you wrote a piece
recently staying that it didn't go
unnoticed in Israel that Adel s'en
hasn't come out and publicly supported
Netanyahu since these really police and
made this announcement earlier in the
month well can you talk a little bit
more about Sheldon Adelson what's his
influence like in Israel and and do you
think this is a sign that Netanyahu's in
bigger trouble this time than in the
past
I think Allison is in a difficult
position right now with Bibi Netanyahu
because on the one hand he likes
Netanyahu he supported him he definitely
believes in his ideology on the other
hand a Netanyahu basically took Adelson
for granted and tried to use him as a
bargaining chip against the other
newspaper without even telling me as
Sheldon Adelson so definitely a Adelson
is hurt by Bibi Netanyahu behavior
behavior and rightly so
him how influential is he in in Israel
we have a different campaign financing
system so the idea that a big donors
have direct influence is doesn't really
matter that much
in the Israeli political system because
we're not talking about a multi-million
dollar
campaigns and everything is regulated
however in ålesund mainly through this
newspaper that he started it managed to
be Bibi Netanyahu biggest supporter
because that was the way to the Israeli
public him by owning the Israel one of
Israel's largest newspapers daily
newspapers and by making sure that it's
editorial line is very Pro Netanyahu he
became a very valuable asset for
Netanyahu and him I'm not sure that will
continue now there's a lot of talk about
Allison looking beyond Bibi understands
he either wants maybe to leave or
understand that he's not going to be
there forever and he's looking him for
some other a political figure that he
can support probably right-wing leader
in a study Bennett writes um another
ally that has you know there's been a
little friction between with the another
Bibi ally who is uh who's had a little
friction with him lately as Donald Trump
the White House publicly and pretty
harshly rebuked Netanyahu's claimed that
he had discussed a plan to annex the
West Bank with the White House what is
that plan why is this important and why
was the subsequent rebuke so significant
in this case but understand that we have
to look at Bibi Netanyahu Coalition
right now in Israel of course after you
win the election it's a parliamentary
system you have to build your own
coalition and even if Netanyahu has 30
seats was that he could he still needs
another 31 seats to get get a majority
and the current coalition of Netanyahu
him goes to the right he's probably the
most centrist to figure in it everyone
else's to the right of him and in order
to satisfy this coalition in Netanyahu
has to him give them some some red meat
once in a while and this is a pro setter
coalition and what they would like to
see is to him use what they understand
is an opportunity now a unique
opportunity because in the white house
is occupied by someone who either
doesn't care about the settlement or
believes they in a very good position
Israel's position on it and may be more
open for some type of annexation partial
or complete annexation of
the West Bank and and that's why the
right-wing partners in Netanyahu's
coalition are pushing for that now a
Netanyahu is in this balancing act on
the one hand he wants to satisfy them on
the other hand understands that he can't
push the Americans too far and he
probably miscalculated with this
statement he was trying to in a way
appease his partners by telling them
okay I spoke to the Americans and kind
of hinted that if the Trump
administration is open to this idea of
partial annexation and that was a bit
too much even for the Trump White House
and that's why we saw this public review
so you talked about how Israel's a
different system their parliamentary
system that means there are more
immediate and different ways of holding
leaders accountable right I mean can you
talk a little bit about how the Israeli
government works and is formed and do
you think it's significant that you're
starting to see members of Netanyahu's
party the like who'd call for him to
step aside and you're seeing leaders a
more centrist parties calling for
no-confidence votes and other measures
of course in a coalition system
especially with a multi-party system
like it is in Israel where anything else
coalition is built of seven different
factions each one of them can decide at
a certain point to break off and since
he has a very small majority he will
basically lose his majority there'll be
a vote of no-confidence and he will lose
the Premiership in Israel will go to
general elections so members of the
coalition always have this ability to
hold the Prime Minister accountable and
to try to exert whatever benefits they
can for their party from him that's why
we can see in small parties like I'll
cross the docks parties they have maybe
only five or six seats but they do have
the power to leverage they're there
they're standing there by threatening to
leave the government if they don't get
their specific it needs answered and
that's what we're seeing right now so
it's an yells smaller problem right now
is the police investigation and the
possibility that maybe a year from now
he wouldn't end up in jail that may or
may not happen what could happen before
that is that his coalition partners will
say well enough is enough we can sit in
the government with someone who is
basically tainting us
by by actually being partners with him
in this crossed a red line and therefore
we're leaving the government or forcing
him to resign a man go to new election
right now we're not seeing any direct
call that way but it could happen it
could happen if these cases if we learn
more damning information about these
cases it could happen once the Attorney
General who is now reviewing these
recommendations will actually go ahead
and indict a mitten Yahoo Utley some
cases one thousand and two thousand and
it could also happen if any one of the
coalition partners decide decides that
maybe now is an opportune time to go to
elections because we have a chance of
improving their standing any one of
these scenarios can lead to addiction
rights I mean a million lifetimes ago
before the 2016 election there were
serious concerns that Donald Trump would
question the legitimacy of our entire
electoral system and not accept defeat
in hindsight that is too ironic to even
handle but you know you're seeing
similar reports coming out of Israel now
their concerns it Netanyahu will attack
lawmakers question the system and sort
of burn the place to the ground rather
than go quietly are those fears grounded
in fact or is this just alarmist
reporting I think a lot of it is
alarmist but clearly there is an attempt
by Netanyahu at least to question the
aim the honesty the integrity of the law
enforcement system in Israel these types
of investigations are carried out by the
police him he's already laying the
ground for questioning there any general
once he makes a decision so definitely
him he's not going to leave quietly he's
not going to go out in a peaceful way in
a sense like they would all murder we
mentioned they aim and but by the time
all this is over we may have a very
politicized in legal system and law
enforcement system in Israel because
Netanyahu basically saying to his
supporters you should believe me not
that any general believe me not the
police don't trust them they're biased
against me interesting thing is of
course that he himself appointed the
welcome Billy Eichner hey god save
America I'm so excited to be here I'm a
huge fan great having me yeah I listen
all the time
not every episode but why although I'm
nothing to sort of get by when I can
squeeze it in
but I'm very upset that John Lovett is
not here so he's very upset as well
Oh is he he didn't say that but I think
he's how how dare John loved it not be
here
doesn't he know who I am I invented loud
gay Jews who love to hear themselves
talk okay show a little respect love it
load or leave it and he left what does
that say about me he is busy with his
solo career right now
yeah the spinoff already did a spinoff
yeah you guys are the Kelly Rowland God
saves America there she was in Destiny's
Child guys I know they're a band they
were a band band tell us about glam up
the midterms so I started a voter
initiative campaign called glam up the
midterms with my friends at Funny or Die
a Will Ferrell and Adam McKay's company
they've been producing my show Billy on
the street for many years I'm very close
with those guys and I called them up
Trump had said something god knows I
can't even remember what it was because
there's so much every day but about six
months ago so I called Funny or Die
which has a history of doing politically
oriented initiatives like this like they
did with Obamacare and between two ferns
and I had done a Billy on the street
video with Michelle Obama a few years
ago and so I said I wanted let's do
something but I am just sick of angry
tweeting all the time and it doesn't
feel like the most productive thing even
though I'll keep doing it oh right how
could you know make a living it's right
exactly and I actually think angry
tweeting can be productive in its own
way but I wanted to do something I had a
tangible effect and then we got all
these statistics in which said that in
the last midterm election only 12
percent of Millennials voted in 2014
Disney which is very bleak but then I
thought before I just get sort of self
righteous about that I thought to myself
you know I'm in my late 30s I am more
than willing to admit that I have
skipped a midterm or two in my day and
maybe you guys haven't right we all have
right I mean 12 percent we're all
skipping the midterm and the percentages
aren't that much better as you get older
you know but for Millennials it's
particularly bad and I know Millennials
probably don't want to be called
Millennials but I'm sorry that's just
what you are at this point and so so I
said okay that's a dismal bleak
statistic what can we do to register
voters knowing there's a midterm coming
up and knowing now compared to two years
ago there is so much outrage and so much
anger and people want to be productive
but I thought how do we focus this anger
voting let's vote there's a midterm
coming up in November let's get out
there and register as many voters as we
can and you know we're in comedy we're
in entertainment so we thought what's a
funny take on that so I thought well
there's nothing less glamorous than the
midterm elections right there's nothing
more exciting or nothing less exciting
or sexy sounding than the midterm so
let's turn that on its ear and let's
glam up the midterms and all that means
is we're gonna go out we've pinpointed
several districts and we're in the
middle of fundraising and we're gonna
actually go yes there will be viral
videos we did a launch video with Kimmel
and John Oliver and Seth Meyers and all
these guys just to get the idea of the
campaign out there but one of the most
exciting parts of the campaign is that
we're going to go to districts where
they're gonna be hotly contested races
coming up and we're gonna be signing up
young voters it's a bipartisan campaign
I'm Billy Eichner I'm not bipartisan but
the campaign is bipartisan we're not
looking for Democrats or Republicans to
sign up we're just looking for young
people to sign up in general and also
while signing them up give them
information as you guys know like the
midterms it's different in every state
it's different every district the
average person may not even know which
races are going on in their state who
the candidates are what the issues are
and so we're gonna be giving them this
information sometimes in a very dry
informative way and sometimes in our own
fun entertaining way
and that's the general idea of it but
you're just gonna sign up Democrats
right no I'm just kidding um no no I
swear that we are not it is a bipartisan
effort I don't know how many Republicans
listen to this podcast but yeah exactly
so no it is a bipartisan effort and look
I can be political in my own way on
social media and advocate for certain
candidates that that I support but glam
up the midterms is a bipartisan effort
school it is about getting people to
vote and well do you want to ask me
questions or I can keep going Tommy do
you have a question I mean I think this
is such a good idea because registering
to vote it shouldn't be hard but like
there's friction to prevent you from
doing it right exactly critical but you
know you look at those numbers like 88
percent of young people took a pass on
voting to decide if Obamacare is
repealed to confirm Trump's Supreme
Court justices whether Trump will be
impeached maybe one day hopefully how do
we convince young people not just to
register but the stakes in these
elections and these off year elections
are just as big as presidential years
right well that's tricky
I do think young people like we're
seeing in Florida obviously but all over
the country and even before the this
most recent shooting young people are
more engaged now than they have them I
would imagine it certainly looks like
that yeah so what I wanted to do is go
out there and try to capitalize on that
interest and passion and say oh you're
interested in this now great here's what
you have to do there's a midterm
election coming up you know the media
doesn't give a ton of attention to
midterm elections it's very easy to get
involved in the presidential race
there's two candidates were focused on
nationally everyone is laser focused on
those two and the whole country is
focused on the same race more or less
the midterms are different everywhere
you go and so you know not every race in
every state will bubble up and become
something that you CNN or vice or you
know you guys will be able to focus on
there's just simply too many candidates
and too many races and so we want to go
out there and do our part
let people know young and old hey you're
fired up now great beyond just being
fired up there's a big election coming
up and it's not Trump versus Hillary so
you haven't heard as much about it but
we're giving you information here the
dates here's how's you register here's
information that can help you decide who
you want to vote for and just go
do it
are we gonna see little Billy on the
street you like running around yelling
at Millennials will you pay me a lot to
do that John I mean you know tell a nice
trademark you know we're gonna we're
gonna do whatever we're gonna do
whatever makes sense so well you know
what I don't want it to be is you know
I'm not gonna choose some we're not
gonna go to Pennsylvania and just
randomly drag the cast of Grey's Anatomy
there you know like I don't I know that
people just don't want random Hollywood
folks showing up and telling them to
vote they're convenient there's nothing
more irritating than that so what we're
gonna do is Katy Perry concerts what was
that Katy Perry concerts I blame Katy
Perry for everything no I mean I do
think look I'm someone with a platform
right and I'm engaged and I'm angry so
I've been shouting at people on the
street for years about pop
culture so now I want to shout
at people about something that is
actually important that can actually
affect our lives but beyond that another
part of the glam up campaign that I love
is that we're actually in these
districts going to be pinpointing local
heroes right local celebrities whether
it's you know high school athletes kids
who have a big platform on their college
campus the local bartender who people
just love and we want to engage the
hometown heroes and and sort of empower
them to use their voice no matter how
many Twitter followers you have or don't
have those people have influence in that
district and then we want them to help
us let people know that the elections
coming up so you were obviously born to
be the lead in one the king in Hollywood
what are you talking you have the
amazing supporting cast you ready of
James Corden Sarah Silverman Seth Meyers
Conan Kimmel John Oliver Rob how do
people get how do they get these folks
to go to their district how can people
listening be like come to my district
rally voters register voters
well I mean that's on me really I mean
when we when we had though when we made
the launch video I reached out to all
those people you just mentioned
personally and I said hey we're doing
this campaign here's what it is you know
I have a platform you guys have an even
bigger platform will you help us out and
that's what we're gonna keep doing we're
gonna go district by district and say
hey what do we think will be effective
in this district I don't think it's
about dragging James Corden around
wherever he's willing to go as lovely as
James Corden is he'll come they'll sing
a song we'll do a dance you know loves
to entertain but but it's not about that
we want to do things that we think the
people in that district will actually
respond to and care about now that might
be someone who happens to be famous who
has a personal connection to that
district coming and talking to people
and helping rally people or like I said
I might be talking to someone local it
might not you know it might be putting
on like an improv show for young people
and also having them register as they
walk in the door you know there's any
number of things you can do and glam up
the midterms as you well know is just
one campaign like this that's going on I
know you guys are working with swing
left you know indivisible has been doing
incredible work for over a year you know
so on some level we're piggybacking on
those guys and we want to work together
this is a bipartisan effort and the ones
I just mentioned are not as bipartisan
but you know when it comes to just sheer
voter registration we're just doing our
part yeah you know so I you know I've
followed you on Twitter for a long time
thank you so much you're you're welcome
you're welcome a lot of faves and I
notice you know you you've obviously
been much more political sense Trump was
elected have you always been interested
in politics is it something about 2016
that really got you into this because
you know a lot of your tweets are
serious about Trump yeah well yeah I
have I I describe myself as someone
who's always probably been more
interested in current events maybe than
the average person
you know I've always loved what was
going on in the world and keeping up
with that but like I said that did not
always translate into me going to vote
as engaged as I was superficially I
wasn't actually taking that step you
know I wasn't necessarily going to a
rally or going to a protest or you
and just going to the voting booth
sometimes I did you know I wasn't
completely out of it when if it was a
big race sure I would focus on it the
way any other person might but but did I
have an interest in what was going on
yes I remember hating Giuliani even
after 9/11 and knew because I'm in New
York or hating Giuliani and he was like
shutting down art exhibits and that like
made me livid you know ahead of the
curve though very I tell you how ahead
of the curve I was I hated Reagan I
hated Reagan back when it wasn't cool I
was like eight years old and I was like
he doesn't mention aids like the gayest
little eight-year-old ever seen but so
have I've always had an interest but I
have never fully sort of if this makes
any sense capitalized on my own interest
to do productive things and that's what
this campaign is about you know did
Trump change that for you I think he did
I mean I think he changed it for so many
people um and now look I don't agree
with what susan sarandon said about Jill
Stein back in the day and yes I did just
bring up Susan Sarandon Wow butBut I
will say there were people I don't agree
with obviously you know I was very Pro
Hillary and not Pro Jill Stein in any
way shape or form but I remember she how
Eichner comes out in favor of Jill Stein
on putty I've got a rod you know what
breaking news I'm a Russian Bob this
whole time it should have been bought on
the street instead of building on the
tree but I I will say there were people
who said you know what I think electing
Trump will force people to rise up out
of this like semi-coma that a lot of
people have been in now I wish he didn't
win I wish we didn't need him to imp you
know to energize us the way that he has
but he has that's right can't deny that
he has so yeah every cloud and this is a
big cloud but every cloud
has a silver lining I think al Roker's
the first person to ever say that
wonderful meteorologist but every cloud
has a silver lining and the silver
lining here is that we are waking up
that we were all not all
a lot of us were very complacent we
thought it was a more tolerant place you
know we took Obama's victories as a sign
that we were progressing and and you
know what we did progress that was
progress but now we see oh
like you don't just keep progressing and
you can actually step backwards and so
you know he has invigorated us he has
energized us and and here we are so the
Trump caused me to want to be more
productive and more engaged yeah of
course he did because he's terrifying
yeah so we so like what happened in
parkland was horrific
we the CNN Town Hall last night she had
these kids out front asking Marco Rubio
the toughest people saying like even
though all my friends are on Twitter
saying Marco Rubio gets points for
showing up
no he does it for his
constituents
I don't clap for my dentist when he
finally agrees to look at my teeth
that's his job you
sweaty little hypocritical weasel
 hate that guy how dare he that's
all we wanted we've just been i
attacking Americans also Marco Rubio
you're never going to be president never
the ship has sailed it sailed a long
time ago so at least try to earn a few
points by showing some integrity but it
just shows how lost like they're so lost
their souls are poisoned like
permanently damaged like they're they're
poisonous people yeah and so I find
those people to be a lost cause you know
he's a totally he's a lost cause but
seeing those kids out there being
tougher on him than any journalist has
been in like ten years
unbeliev it was amazing like what do you
think we should do to keep those kids
out front in this and like support them
in their message but make sure that you
know Susan Sarandon and Jill Stein don't
hijack what they're trying to do and
although that would be a great thumb in
Louise reboot the one we've been waiting
for for Geena Davis gets thrown under
the
for no reason but um what was I gonna
say how do we have to show up for them
you know what's amazing is they're now
showing us the way right which is
incredible we're supposed to be older
and wiser but you know you get jaded as
the years go by and what we're seeing in
them is a great lack of jaded Ness you
know a great belief that just having
integrity and fighting for the right
thing is actually enough you know that
putting passion and energy and time and
money behind that is enough you know and
I think we're all out here fighting and
shouting on Twitter since Trump got
elected but we're still very jaded we're
sit we're so we're still very cynical
you know and they are there's something
about it that seems very pure and I
think we just have to show up for them
in all the ways I just said like I'm
gonna go to the March on the 24th I'm
gonna March with every town and I'm sure
a lot of people will
I mean I'm mainly going to get Amal
Clooney autograph but beyond that I
think a nice side effect is I'll be
marching be right the smart cool thing
to say on Twitter after a gun massacre
is nothing's ever gonna change
you know everyone just to be cynical and
these kids are lacking that cynical bone
and it is so nice to see I mean Obama
had an incredible tweet this morning you
know I can imagine I can't speak for the
man and you guys know him better than I
do but I imagine after Sandy Hook I've
gone and rewatched his speech in the
Rose Garden after Congress decided to do
nothing after Sandy Hook those kids were
younger even than the kids in Parkland
right and he seems bewildered and
confused like he seemed at a loss he
said he said that was the most disgusted
he's ever been in politics right how
could you not be at that point yeah and
I just got chills thinking about it
right and so seeing his tweet this
morning and I don't want to speak for
him but reading between the lines and if
you haven't seen it he basically was
talking about how inspiring the these
kids in Florida are and how like I just
said we have to show up for them and
that were what you know we're here with
them and we will support them but you
could sense even in his tweet a shock
that we might be able to make some
progress
you know that they've they've they've
been encouraging to him I think on a
real level you know those weren't just
words that he was tweeting you're right
that's showing up for them I mean we got
an email yesterday from a father of one
of the kids killed in Sandy Hook and it
was a reminder that speaking out for
them showing up for them years later
matters so yeah it's also like we were
talking about this earlier
it's so cool watching these students
sort of it which is the refrain of Emma
Gonzalez's speech like we call BS
calling out on these
politicians and even at the Town Hall
last night yes you know not just at not
just being like regular journalists and
asking Rubio question letting him do his
talking points and then move on they
asked these follow-ups and they keep
pressing them you know and they just
sort of and in the conspiracy theories
are out there about the kids and then
they just go on Twitter and they just
call them out as you don't even
know the rules yes they don't have to
play by that right yeah they're just
being honest and I said to a friend of
mine last night you know as much as
we give social media and Lord knows
there are major pros and cons to social
media I mean I wouldn't have a career
without YouTube so I'd like to thank
everyone at the wonderful YouTube
company for supporting me but but but
there are major pros and cons of social
media but when I looked at these kids I
everything that's going on around guns
and gun control Danna I would say that
yesterday was one of the more hopeful
days for the gun control movement that I
can remember in a long time in states
all across the country saw kids walk out
of schools in support of the Stoneman
Douglas high school students happen in
Arizona happen in Maryland and Kentucky
in Texas and in Florida thousands of
protesters marched straight to
Tallahassee they slept on cots in the
Civic Center the night before and then
they walked into the State Capitol and
demanded new gun laws obviously there
was disappointment as there is with
republican-controlled legislators in
Florida and all across the country
the republican-led legislature in
Florida rejected a ban on assault
weapons but they're now talking about a
deal that would raise the age from 18 to
21 when you can buy an assault weapon
Institute three-day waiting periods ban
bomb stock ban
bump stocks arms school personnel which
we can talk about and I believe is sort
of a terrible idea but dan what do you
think about sort of the deal that's
happening in the Florida Legislature
which is completely republic completely
republican-controlled better than
nothing or what a 100 percent obviously
like that I have very real concerns
about a society thinks the best way to
protect students is to give guns to
their teachers more guns in schools
that's the answer you know well that is
not the right we are closing the barn
door after the horses left if that's our
solution but here's the thing which is
the the gun lobby the NRA the right wing
that the fear mongers on Fox News their
success has been in defeating every
piece of legislation to SAP hope from
the movement of people who want to make
this country safer and so this success
is that everything we want is gonna
solve all the problems is it perfect no
but it is something to build on you
can't build on nothing
and so that is this is a tribute to
those kids more than anyone else those
families and the public in the public
for rallying behind these children these
students and so if we can get something
done if some lives will be saved and
there's no doubt that would be the case
if this if this for the pass then that
is a victory like we had not seen in a
long time
in the fight over guns yeah I think
what's more what will ultimately be more
important and lasting from what's
happening around parkland right now is
not the legislation that will be passed
in the short term but the movement
that's being built that will last for
the long term and I think that you know
at least from now until November we are
going to deal with the politics we have
with the you know republican-controlled
Congress Republican president Republican
legislatures Republican governors across
the country but this is building towards
November when we can vote a lot of those
people out hopefully and get a lot of
pro gun control Democrats in office and
then look it's a movement that has to
last for years because as we saw it
during the Obama era even having
Democrats in Congress isn't a guarantee
that we'll get the gun safety
legislation that we need and so you have
to keep fighting but it's different now
the base of this movement now which is
the students students not just in
Florida but students all across the
country and these high schools being
active I mean that's that's something
that to me is incredibly hopeful because
these kids are not going to be cowed by
the NRA and they're not going to become
cynical because you know they didn't get
the assault weapons ban they wanted on
day one they're just gonna keep going
and and I think that's incredibly
inspiring yes it really is I think you
were looking at a generation of
leadership and I think we will look back
five ten years from now some of these
students who have risen to the occasion
and they will be political leaders of
their generation just like
there were people who helped lead the
movement against the Vietnam or who were
leaders for their generation or the
movement against the Iraq war more
people like our friend array who who
came to prominence in Ferguson and then
the black box matter movement and these
are this is the future of this country
and it is something to be Korea's
darkest numbering schemes this is
something I feel really good about these
kids are impressive as hell yeah so
let's talk about the prospects for
federal action this morning another
another big morning for Trump tweets so
Trump tweeted about how we should put
more guns in schools by arming teachers
he had quite a few tweets on that we
should note that first he started saying
like fake news says I wanted to give
guns to teachers that's not true what I
want to do is give guns to teachers
it's basically what he went on to say
you know what he's trying to say is that
you know you know I only want to give
guns to the teachers that are trained
for this and that would end up being
about 20% of teachers across the country
and we could arm them with guns let's
talk about this idea a little bit a
little bit I mean first of all I don't
know if we've already forgotten that
there was an armed guard at Stoneman
Douglas High School who never
encountered the shooter once while he
was there
we know that in certain states where
they've said that it's okay to armed
teachers not one school district has
taken up the state's offer to do that
because they don't believe it would make
kids safer police officers have warned
that that's not going to make kids safer
by arming teachers teachers don't want
to be armed dan what do you think about
this idea it's insane
it is an insane view that my mom was a
teacher for decades
[Music]
and the idea that and there is a hard
job to which teachers are dramatically
underpaid it's one of the most important
jobs in our society and at the same time
that we are cutting funding for
education classes are getting bigger the
teacher rate student-teacher ratio is
getting
we're gonna say in addition to trying to
teach with less resources a generation
of kids to be prepared for the real
world to learn prepare for the new
economy you are also going to have to be
a law enforcement officer in your spare
time so just that idea is crazy but then
we are giving up if we believe that it
is so hard to stop was the wrong people
from getting guns we'd have to give guns
to more people to turn an elementary
school into the okay corral is crazy in
trained professional police officers
members of the military in close
quarters combat will sometimes shoot the
wrong person they will miss the idea
that it teacher or a coach or a janitor
to use the terms that Trump use in his
event yesterday are the right solution
to this is insane it is absolutely
insane and the only reason people
promoting it is because the gun lobby
wants more people to buy gun so if you
if you have teachers buy guns those are
more guns sold and it is gonna make us
more dangerous not less it's going to
make schools more dangerous not less not
paper yeah it's completely insane idea I
mean even you know Marco Rubio at that
CNN Town Hall last night said and good
for him for saying this that it was a
terrible idea this is something that you
know the NRA was talking about after
Newtown after the elementary school
shooting at Sandy Hook they waited a
little bit longer than than they have
this time but that was there for a
solution to two armed teachers so
they've been saying this when they now I
look back at some of the coverage then
when they said this during right after
Sandy Hook everyone thought it was the
most insane thing that ever heard and
people were saying it was crazy and all
that kind of stuff now we have the
president righted States advocating for
it so that's where we are
Trump also go ahead that Hallie told me
this morning that I forgot so I didn't
do what we were doing this but it is the
New York City Police Department
these are trained professionals only had
an accuracy rate of about 28% I'm sorry
in 2005 18% so you have police officers
missing some time between 7:00
ten times or eight ten times depending
on the year and so the idea that
teachers are gonna be firing weapons in
a close-quarters situation with these
students it's just so dangerous it's
dangerous it's funny when you mention
your mom like my mom was a teacher too I
cannot imagine if there was a god forbid
if there had ever been a shooting where
my mom was a teacher and then the next
day she went into school and they were
like here's your gun mrs. Vavra good
luck it's just she would be like excuse
me are you crazy
god it's such a bad idea
so trump also tweeted about he said that
he's gonna be really strong on
comprehensive background checks with an
emphasis on mental health he's for
raising the age to 21 for assault
weapons and he wants to end the sale of
bum stocks on Tuesday Trump announced
that he signed a memo directing jeff
sessions to propose regulations that ban
bomb stocks and other devices that turn
semi-automatic firearms into machine
guns now this last part on bump stock
seems like because the Bureau
of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and
Explosives the agency that regulates
guns and the federal government just
said after the Vegas Massacre that they
cannot regulate bump stocks unless
Congress changes the law which Congress
refuses to do can't get any Republicans
to do that after Vegas even though
people thought there's some kind of
something that was going to happen there
Dan what do you think about the bump
stocks directive and also trumps other
tweets about background checks and
raising the age and all that kind of
stuff distinction between comprehensive
background checks which tribes won't
trot mentioned in universal background
checks no there are a number of
loopholes in the current background
check law including gun shows among
other things private sales and so in
2013 after Newtown what Republicans and
Democrats and some Republicans tried to
do more President Obama was in office
was to pass a universal background check
law which would mean that it's not all
virtually all gotten people who buy guns
would would need to get a background
check and that is not what Trump is
talking about here as far as we can tell
he is talking about
different piece of legislation that it's
still also a good thing which would
would strengthen the current background
check system to make sure that more
information got into the quote-unquote
NIC system this it's called to ensure
that people can fly like we should do
that we should have been a hundred years
ago it's insane that we have it
but it is not a significant step towards
something real know so and and Chris
Murphy who's one of the sponsors of that
legislation along with John Cornyn from
Texas says as much he was like yeah
obviously we should pass this bill but
no one should tell you that this bill
will actually do anything to solve the
problem in a big way
it basically that bill it increases
grants for states that send the federal
background check system at least 90% of
their records on people with serious
mental illness so it is basically a bill
that coordinates what should already be
coordinated between the state and
federal background check system that it
already exists it does not expand them
it does not close the loophole that
means that people who buy guns on the
internet or from get gun shows up don't
have to have any kind of background
check at all it's not it's not real I
mean great do it
right right
Trump also of course then he tweeted
that the NRA the leaders of the NRA are
great people which is you know was
interesting to do right before the CPAC
speech where like you know Wayne
LaPierre and Dana Loesch went out and
said awful things like that the media
loves mass shootings and that you know
Democrats are part of a authoritarian
plot to take over the world and blah
blah blah so that was that was fun
it's now the time to rant about the you
know I was going to do it later but we
think is doing now Trump so Trump also
met with students parents and teachers
yesterday I don't know if you saw I'm
sure you did the the card he was holding
where it gave him like instructions on
how to talk with these people and and
number five said you know it was a
reminder to have him say I hear you
people just sort of interested
so one thing I'm not it's it's more
funny than anything else that sort of
instructed empathy for Donald Trump you
know I'm sure the stuff we do this when
you're when you work for Donald Trump
and he says the that he says you
probably feel like you have to put that
on the card you know like I have a
hierarchy at outrageous when it comes to
trump and this one's actually pretty
well in the last I thought this was more
funny than anything else so what do we
think I mean let's step back on all the
Trump stuff where do we think this leads
how serious do you think he is about
this what kind of obstacles does he face
due to his own ineptitude and also
politics I think he actually thinks he's
serious about this yeah I do I think he
I don't think it comes from some place
of empathy for these students or parents
or law enforcement officers i he has
demonstrated no empathy for any human
being other than himself Roger Ailes and
Rory more and Steve Wynn
over the course of time but I think he
he what he likes to ride the wave of
news coverage and this is what the world
is focused on so he's got to talk about
it in order to be on TV and I think he
probably thinks he wants to do something
if challenge is threefold
he has the attention span of a
three-year-old 280k it's a fun dip the
PETA has no knowledge of either of the
specifics of the issue or the politics
surrounding it so he doesn't need to
know what he's saying when he says
things like armed teachers and
comprehensive background checks know
what that means and three the Republican
Party by proxy the NRA are against doing
anything real here so the in the fact
that he's saying trumpet said many
things doc infrastructure all of those
things and they've never gone anywhere
because he's incapable
of doing the actual work of governing
yes I mean this it's fundamentally about
his laziness and his ignorance of just
about everything that he gets all of his
information from cable television
primarily Fox so you could imagine that
he was watching television over the last
week and he probably watched a lot of
CNN too because he likes hate watching
CNN and he probably saw these these
students speaking and he said yeah no
that that makes sense
and he's you know he talked to the
people at his at mar-a-lago and
he's like yeah that makes sense I want
to be better on background checks and
better on this and also you know he
talks to some crazy people and they say
I'm teachers so he says he's for all
this stuff there will be legislation
from Democrats and Republicans the
Democrats will have actually real
legislation to do something about those
Republicans will have whatever the NRA
supports and then the Republicans will
go to him in the White House or his
staff will and they'll tell him this is
the good legislation that we're
supporting and what the Democrats
supporting is horrible and will destroy
the Second Amendment and destroy America
and so then you know week from now Trump
will tweet out that whatever the
Democrat bill is is horrible and awful
and the Republican bill is good because
he doesn't know any better because he
doesn't pay attention because he can't
read and that will be that it's the
exact same thing he did on immigration
when he said yeah no I love the dreamers
I have a soft spot for the dreamers
except when there's actual legislation
to protect the dreamers he says that
it's awful and that only his legislation
is right because that's what his staff
and the Republicans tell him and he's
easily misled and easily fooled
because he's an idiot he's an idiot who
shouldn't be president I mean that's
just I don't know that there's more
analysis than that you know yeah I mean
there are these larger structural things
about politics in a polarized age the
asymmetric polarization of the
Republican the influence the monetary
and cultural ones with the NRA and then
there's just the fact that Donald Trump
is in is unable in interested in
actually being president know he's
interested in like you know riding the
latest cable news cycle and that's about
it and just to talk about how difficult
this I'm sorry and just to like to get
an understanding of how difficult this
would be to pass anything in Congre
House Republicans have already said at
least the the portion of House
Republicans that control the entire
Congress which is the freedom caucus say
they'll only vote to strengthen
background checks if they're also able
to pass concealed carry reciprocity
what's that well some states allow
teenagers domestic abusers or convicted
stalkers to legally obtain a permit to
carry a concealed weapon
if concealed carry reciprocity passes
and you have a permit to carry from one
of these states every other state is
forced to recognize that permit no
matter how tough their gun laws are so
it basically would shred the gun laws of
any state and force them to match the
weakest gun laws of some other state
doesn't sound like a great deal ban that
is that is one step forward eighteen
steps back those states rights
Republicans yeah much about
passes tougher gun laws then people from
other states can move there and impose
their laws on you it is uh it's pretty
gross let's talk about what would work
and what people you know what Democrats
should be proposing here I mean some
people have talked about bringing back
the assault weapons ban so everyone
knows in 1994 Bill Clinton passed a
federal assault weapons ban in the ten
year period before the ban the number of
people who died from gun massacres dif
which are defined as six or more deaths
from a single shooting dropped 43% sorry
and this is the 10-year period after the
ban
it dropped 43 percent compared to before
the ban the number of gun massacres
dropped 37% after the ban expired in
2004 because Congress refused to extend
the assault weapons ban gun massacres
then went up a hundred and eighty three
percent in deaths went up two hundred
and thirty nine percent so
and people do believe that it's all
weapons ban along with a ban on
high-capacity ammunition would be you
know some of the most effective gun
measures out there what do you think Dan
what do you think Democrats should be
saying yes we should be for that and
more like the fact that they're a large
portion of elected members of Congress
and people in the country who believe
it's hard I to feel very reflective on
this Presidents Day unlike a very
insecure Oprah Winfrey on the show today
we'll be talking to New York Times
writer Zeynep to fetch e about
Facebook's role on the Russian
indictments and whether mass shootings
are contagious guys we're back in the

some of our favorites we have a panel of
interns and art historians and we're

you're wondering to what end we use the
resources we have here at cooking media
this is your answer is it oh I'm sorry I
didn't realize that John didn't support
art in public schools that's something I
learned Tommy weren't you weren't you
shocked I was I was well-versed in his
hatred of the Arts
I'll give money directly to the artist
Tommy how was positive the world this
way uh it was great John thank you for
asking I interviewed a a very very smart
journalist named Steve Coll he's written
some of the best books about the war in
Afghanistan ghost war ghosts wars
Directorate asses his latest ones about
the CIA's role the military's role all
the challenges in the region why we're
still there after 17 years so we tried
to make this conversation a little
different than your standard should we
send more troops or not discussion about
Afghanistan and really focus on Pakistan
their nuclear weapons program because
that's really the reason why we're there
and if you don't get that
you don't really understand the internal
machinations of policymakers in the
administration so give it a listen
it'll make you smarter he's a great
great journalist excellent all right
let's get to the news guys news on
Friday the Department of Justice charged
13 Russian nationals and three companies
with conspiracy to defraud the United
States through a campaign of information
warfare that was designed to defeat
Hillary Clinton and elect Donald Trump
mission accomplished happy Presidents
well done the entire US intelligence
community came to this conclusion a year
ago but this is different this is the
United States government stating that it
can prove the existence of the Russian
operation in court beyond a reasonable
doubt the operation included identity
theft wire fraud breaking u.s. election
law buying political advertisements and
posting fake messages on social media
platforms like Facebook staging
political rallies in the United States
and coordinating political activities
with unwitting Trump campaign officials
in that a bit redundant we're still we
still yet to find a winning trump
associate just to give some a few
examples of how this operation played
out some of these groups they posted on
Facebook and look there's a lot of focus
on the Facebook advertisements but a lot
most of the Facebook activity was post
and they pretend it to be different you
know political groups or satellite
entities as real or stole identities of
real Americans they encouraged African
Americans not to vote or vote for third
parties there was an instant one
Instagram account called woke blacks
sample add we cannot resort to the
lesser of two Devils then we'd surely be
better off without voting at all and
choose piece and vote for Jill Stein
trust me it's not a wasted vote there's
another group called United Muslims of
America that said American Muslim voters
are refusing to vote for Hillary because
she wants to continue the war on Muslims
in the Middle East and so on and on it
went with groups like this guys I want
to spend plenty of time on Trump's
reaction to all this but what were your
first reactions to the substance of the
indictment on Friday
what were your any holy moments I
mean I it's fascinating to see something
that was
probably a counterintelligence
investigation or an intelligence based
deep dive into what happened in the
selection gets spelled out an indictment
in these clear terms like that so I
think staying you know the fact that we
can now point to these specifics at a
137 and 36 page indictment I think
really bolsters the case the thing that
has bothered me I mean not just about
the Trump response today but all along
is all of this was knowable to him
probably through various intelligence
means counterintelligence the CIA's work
what the FBI was looking into on sort of
a regular day or course of action so the
system shouldn't be surprised by these
indictments in any way it's just I think
for all of us to see it spelled out is
striking yeah I was I was it was both
not surprising and then also so
disconcerting to see it all laid out in
such exquisite detail I mean the the the
reaction I had when I was seeing the
charges and and seeing the indictments
was indictments don't have feelings like
like Sean Hannity can't make Sean
Hannity can make like septuagenarian
racists think they don't matter he can
make them scared or angry but you can't
make indictments that are angry right
you can't make them indictments are
reality you can't you can't trick the
indictments into not existing or into -
not charging the people responsible like
this is the world this is what happened
and and and we're lucky that we still
have institutions strong enough that
someone like Robert Muller isn't going
to be intimidated out of putting forward
the charters he wants based on the
evidence he has yeah it's fast and
because I mean the truth is none of
these Russians will ever really see the
inside of a US courtroom they're not
going to get extradited and so you might
say you know well then why did Muller do
this but it is it the the year of
knowing that the intelligence community
has been saying this hadn't really sunk
in as much as the you know and it's not
everyone says its molars indictments it
is the Department of Justice it's the
United States government saying we can
prove in a court of law that United
States laws were broken by these foreign
nationals who tried to subvert our
election I mean the entity that did this
internet research the internet research
agency was the subject of a really
fascinating 20 2015
profile in New York Times so we've known
that this this bureaucracy existed to
just with people on the Internet
what Mulder did is he established a
criminal conspiracy with these Russians
and phase two will be if he can tie us
persons to it like little Donny jr. or
anyone that Paul Manta for it's about
the flip on or Rick Gates or any of
these folks so anyone who thinks that
this is over is probably not correct
there seems like there could be a whole
other phase here yeah well so let's get
to the Trump reaction we're done just do
a joke we can just edit it if you want
to say it we have one of the Russian
nationals here oh yeah yeah so go back
go back ya know and so you know what's
up with the Trump reaction next but John
did you hear that crackling on the phone
line yeah someone got patched in and we
didn't do we weren't sure this would be
possible today but we actually we we
have one of the Russians charged in the
indictment with us today on pod say of

help help joy merica well they're
laughing their asses off in Moscow
that's right
Oh God okay thank you Joe we will check
in with you later when you are arraigned
just hope the Trump people cherry-picked
to parts of the indictment to claim
vindication and I want to take both
separately first the White House pointed
to Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen
Stein's comments that there is no
allegation in this indictment that any
American was a knowing participate in
the alleged scheme guys I said Rosen
Stein and sky I know you did Oh
anyways thinking that yeah no no an hour
later a person with knowledge of the
special counsels probe told Bloomberg
that Moeller hasn't concluded his
investigation into whether Trump or any
of his associates helped Russia
interfere in the election obviously
what's going on here was interesting the
the word unwitting is doing a lot of
work in the indictment it was almost as
if it was there to say don't I'm not it
was um it was like it was clean it was
saying I'm gonna lay out the
interference case and it's not gonna be
touched by any of the other facets of
the investigation right now I and Muller
has been so sophisticated in how he has
laid out his charges he is very
carefully constructing a building that
isn't finished and so we don't know what
exactly it's gonna be right but you know
he starts by showing that he has people
who are willing to plead guilty he now
is moving on to the actual parts of it
that are true interference the
unassailable evidence of interference by
Russians it leaves open other facets of
the investigation facets like collusion
facets like obstruction and then the
final piece of it other crimes
have been uncovered that Trump is
financial crimes what-have-you but so
he's still leaving him and and on top of
that the other forms of interference
like hacking that we yet to know more
about that's a very big point that
hacking was not included right I mean we
know that that's out there we know that
these and we know that Russia sent over
agents to America to gather intelligence
now if they sat down with like the gang
at the hotline or the cook Political
Report can I get the lay of the land
like certainly those people wouldn't be
charged as part of a conspiracy right
they're just like doing a background
briefing but that doesn't preclude I
mean we know that Don jr. attempted to
meet with Russians to get dirt we know
that all this if it's what you say I
love it especially later in the summer
if it's what you say I love it
you guys what you say I love it these
guys these guys just cling to whatever
desperate little fact they can at any
moment to get them through the next like
two hours of news cycle and that's fine
I don't feel the need to fight every one
of these yeah that is exactly right I
was thinking the same thing time they
they they do this all the time it's the
worst political instinct that other
political people have had forever which
is just get me through the news cycle
and I'll worry about bad things later so
they don't care they know things might
be coming in the future that are bad for
them they don't care they just need to
get through the day they just need to
stop Trump from screaming at them and so
they'll say whatever they need to to
just celebrate and move on but that's
the point I mean that this is this is
where their ability to shape the news
doesn't matter at all it doesn't there
is value for them to getting through the
day there's really nothing they can say
to fend off whatever is coming in the
next few weeks or months so in a lot of
ways what they're doing getting Sean
Hannity out there to say that Trump was
vindicated by this has some value for
this period of time because six three
months from now when they're off to on
to the next you know whatever form of
misinformation to deal with however
worse this has gotten they'll just try
doing the same thing again Rick Wilson
always says this which is but you know
Muller has a royal flush and the Trump
team is just playing with a pair of twos
got the cards we've got a plane to go
fish right I read you guys something
funny that they interviewed one of the
two Washington Post interviewed one of
the trolls and asked him
do you think it worked and the guy said
the guy's job was to like write stupid
comments under news articles in Russia
about Russia all day he wasn't
transferred to the Facebook wing were
they screwed with the American
significant of English and the guys
responsible really reads the comments
under news articles anyway especially
when they were so obviously fake the use
were mechanical texts it was a colossal
labor of monkeys it was pointless for
Russian the audience at least but for
Americans it appears it did work so they
have built up an immunity to propaganda
we didn't we don't have that antibody
yet I want to talk about what this
indictment actually said in the type of
charge in the indictment because I find
this fairly interesting Bob Bauer who
was the Obama White House Counsel he's
one of the best democratic election
lawyers in the country maybe the best do
you remember the scandal he went through
where he found out that the staff
secretary had been a serial spousal
abuser and then he didn't tell any about
about it for he did wrong White House oh
my god I'm again I mean I feel so stupid
so the the charge that Mullard used with
the Russians was conspiracy to defraud
the United States also the charge that
he used in the manna 4 case so Bauer
argues Muller didn't charge them with
campaign finance law violations even
though for national spending money to
influence a US campaign is clearly
against the law it's a clearly a
violation of campaign finance law
instead he used conspiracy to defraud
which alleges that the Russians
conspired to obstruct the ability of the
Federal Election Commission to enforce
the law in this case the act of
obstruction was the Russians failure to
report their illegal spending now why
would he do that Bob thinks that if
there are American co-conspirators that
Muller is gonna charge it would be
difficult to charge them with violating
the law that prohibits foreign national
spending money to influence a campaign
but it would be much easier to charge
the American co-conspirators with an act
of obstruction in this case preventing
the government from doing its job so the
idea is that the backbone of the and
Marcy wheeler wrote about this as well
you know Bob Bowers got to go back to
law school this is garbage
talking about it sounds fascinating for
people listening at home I don't think
you're getting the full treatment
because John is in a trench coat and
sunglasses and he has a lot of red yarn
in his hand
I am look I went over this in detail
this morning with Lewis mensch
know is I think you're told no it isn't
a bold question but it's conspiracy to
defraud is looking like the backbone to
this case which is interesting because
it's it also goes to the question of
everyone keeps talking about collusion
collusion collusion and illusion is not
the charge here the charges of
conspiracy and the charge the charge
could be that anyone in the Trump world
who knew that Russians were influencing
the u.s. election and decided to hide
that fact from the US government are
guilty of a crime so this goes to the
Don jr. meeting this goes to Donald
Trump writing a statement lying about
negated the forces in politics that
ended up creating Trump whether that's
the Republicans going crazy changes in
media Twitter I got a lot to say about
Fox News and the Trump media in there
and so it's it's there's some nostalgia
there but also I try to take from that
some lessons that we learned and how
Democrats can apply those to the future
for the battles that come in 2018 and
2020 and so it's out 619 but it is on

exciting thank you John
I should tell everyone that we had a
Cricut media retreat earlier this week
and our special guest was Dan Pfeiffer
who talked about the changing media in
the Obama era in the Trump era I imagine
some of your presentation was from this
book and the entire commedia staff was
incredibly excited about the
presentation and learned a ton so if
that presentation if any of that
presentation is part of this book
it's gonna be an excellent read so you
guys should go get it it is I only had
one set of thoughts so it didn't book
the book that's all you need man okay so
that's great we also were going to Texas
in March we just got back from our
Denver Phoenix Vegas Swing which was
great and then a second weekend of March
we'll be in Texas I think there's still
tickets left for the San Antonio show
there might be a few left for Dustin
Houston as well I think Austin sold out
but yeah go check us out we'll be back
on the road in a couple weeks
I think love it's going back on the road
next weekend because he's crazy so yeah
so that's our housekeeping okay so
yesterday
tragically 17 people were killed in a
mass shooting at a Florida high school
many of them students the gunman was a
former student who'd been expelled last
year after being abusive to his
ex-girlfriend
he used a semi-automatic ar-15s alt
rifle and countless magazines it was the
18th US school shooting in the last 35
days in the rest of the world there have
been 18 school shootings in the last 20
years but it goes without saying that
this is a uniquely American epidemic and
it happens here so much more frequently
because the NRA and the Republican Party
want people to have as many guns as
they'd like with almost no restrictions
whatsoever you can be mentally ill you
can be a domestic abuser you can be a
suspected terrorist on the watch list
you can be a teenager NRA in the gun and
the GOP wants you to have as many
military-style weapons with as much
ammunition as you'd like minimal
background checks no questions asked
take your guns anywhere you'd like use a
silencer it just doesn't matter
basically we're in this like over and
over again because Republican
politicians make the argument that
because we can't prevent all gun
violence we shouldn't try to prevent any
gun violence that's what they argue and
it's and it's another reason we
should vote their party out of existence
dan what are your thoughts I mean
obviously yet again what happened in
Florida was just heartbreaking the
videos of people leaving schools look
there's one place you should feel safe
in America it should be at school
and with the SWAT team I mean just in
hearing from the kids who are hiding in
closets and classrooms I mean since
rates your heart and it's just sick and
the videos of the kids in the closets
and the kids in the classrooms that were
on Twitter or just they're sickening it
was it was just horrifying videos and it
is worth noting as you know you and I
had Cory Booker on the podcast last
month and he rightfully pointed out to
us that we pay attention to these mass
shootings whether it be today in schools
or shopping malls or movie theaters or
anywhere else and we we often ignore the
violence that's happening all across
America with guns whether it's people in
domestic disputes and their homes
suicide because you have to easy access
to guns crimes in normal like dumb times
that happen and like we ignore like gun
crime is and gun violence is an epidemic
in this country whether it's the ones
that end up with a lot of press coverage
or the ones that have that don't even
make a local news in their community and
the sad thing here is everyone knows
that no one is going to do anything
about it that nothing will change after
you know we were in Vegas and we talked
about this we talked to the political
strategy around guns yeah on Mondays pod
and so I don't know we don't need to get
back into that but it's worth
remembering that after the in Vegas a
man for reasons we still don't know shot
500 people killing more than 50 I
believe in Vegas and using something
called a bump stock which takes a
semi-automatic weapon it makes it fire
faster and more dangerous late and
everyone pledged we would do something
about it
here we are many months later nothing
has happened not executive action that
legislative action this is just how we
how we respond is we do nothing and
there's probably no greater indictment
of the Republican Party then that fact
because this is not a si you got into a
Twitter argument with our friend mark
Murray from NBC who this great yeah
right but but the point you made
this is not a failure of Washington this
is a failure of one party that is in the
thrall not it's not just at the NRA but
of gun voters to make up a distinct
minority in the country yeah I mean this
is you know it's one of the worst
examples of the media fearing being
accused by the Republicans of partisan
bias more afraid of that than they are
of just like being honest about the
problem I mean your political reporters
your job is to provide an accurate
analysis of the political dynamics and
the political dynamics in the gun
control debate are the Republicans want
people to be able to have guns and they
want to have as few restrictions as
possible on that does those of political
dynamics and yeah yeah there are a
couple Democrats from red states who
feel the same way
but it is an extremely small minority
and it is nearly the entire Republican
Party that holds the position that they
do right now and it's not even accurate
to say that the Republicans want to do
nothing because you know what the
Republicans have done in the Trump era
is they've tried to revoke an Obama era
set of gun checks for people with mental
illness they've tried to pass bills
you
so that make it easier to use silencers
on weapons if they've tried to actually
they've tried they're trying now the NRA
is now trying to pass a you know
consistent called a concealed carry
reciprocity meaning that whichever state
has the weakest gun laws around being
able to conceal a weapon and carry it
other states have to recognize that too
so it's not even that they're doing
nothing they're actually actively trying
to make it easier to be able to have as
many guns and as much ammunition as you
want
no matter who you are or you know what
kind of background you've had that's
that's what their agenda is
and everyone needs to recognize that
everyone in the country needs to
recognize that that's the problem and
that it's not Washington being broken
it's not politicians not doing anything
not doing anything and by the way it's
not even that the NRA is giving a bunch
of money to Republicans it's the
Republicans believe they believe in this
they're not just they're not just being
bought off they actually believe that
this is the way to go and I think that's
important for people to realize that
it's not just like they're doing this
for the money they're doing this because
they want people to have as many guns as
possible that's right they were the NRA
gives millions and millions of dollars
to Republicans but it's money not well
spent
because those Republicans would endanger
America for free that's just what they
think they don't think that I don't
think that fewer guns results in let and
and less gun violence they don't believe
that and that's their right to not
believe that but if the rest of the
country believes otherwise then we
should have a politics that reflects
that belief and we should vote for
politicians that reflect that belief
after the mass shooting in Las Vegas
the New York Times talked to gun
violence researchers and they made a
chart of the most effective gun control
measures and how much public support
each had and just here are some of the
things that top that list bar sales to
all violent criminals eighty-five
percent of the public supports that the
most effective thing you could do
according to gun researchers assault
weapons ban
you
health providers 88% support
bar sales to convicted stalkers 85%
support these are all gun violence
measures that researchers some of the
best experts deem the most effective in
reducing gun violence and they all have
massive public support
yeah please do which is you know you and
I were sitting here and everyone talked
about Congress and what if Congress
going to do if Paul Ryan goes out
there's a piss poor job of pretending
like he gives a I just press
conference today and some Republicans
like Mark Meadows go out basically say
this is the price of freedom and you'd
say well nothing's gonna happen in
Congress well don't wait for Congress we
have governors races with state
legislators legislatures up for election
this fall
go win those because this was actually a
Florida law that allowed an eighteen
year old to walk into to buy this ar-15
with no background check and buy
unlimited amounts of ammunition a
Democratic governor in Florida and a
democratic legislature Carter can repeal
that that law on in January of 2019 and
we do that all across the country
so just because Congress may be
beyond recognition right now don't wait
for that you know goes good to this in
the state level because every live saved
is worth it yeah this is what this is
this is the purpose of politics Rick
Scott is the governor of Florida he
signed five pro-gun bills making it
easier to buy more ammunition and other
things he potentially could run for
Senate to try to defeat bill Nelson a
Democratic senator make sure that he
doesn't do that and when there's now
there's going to be an open governor's
race in Florida make sure there's a
Democratic governor in Florida these are
things that we can do you know we like
you said we talked about the politics of
this in terms of how Democrats should
run against run on this issue and not be
afraid of it I said you know Joan Walsh
tweeted last night to remind everyone
that in Virginia and 2017 in the 13
races we're pro-gun control Democrats
squared off against NRA Republicans
Democrats won twelve of those races the
gubernatorial nominee the lieutenant
gubernatorial nominee and the attorney
general nominee on the Democratic side
all had F ratings from the NRA and all
of them won by you know huge amounts
so you know it is it is possible to
defeat the NRA as possible to defeat
Republicans who are backed by the NRA
don't let people tell you it's not and
you know if you want to get involved if
you want to help you know we've talked
about this before moms demand action and
Everytown are both two great
organizations trying to do something
about gun violence you can text ax a CT
two six four four three three to get
involved in these organizations so
please do that and please go defeat
republicans defeat republicans who
believe there is nothing we can do to
prevent gun violence go defeat them in
november it is the most important thing
you can do all right let's talk about
another rosy topic here which is the
immigration debate so the Senate's gonna
vote today on a bipartisan agreement
that would immediately protect 1.8
million dreamers from deportation and
eventually give them a path to becoming
full citizens though it would preclude
dreamers from sponsoring their parents
to become citizens it's part of the
compromise the bill would also
appropriate twenty five billion dollars
for border security including
construction of the wall but over a long
ten year period so eight senate
republicans are on board with us so far
they introduced the legislation along
with seven democrats and one independent
angus King from Maine who caucuses with
the Democrats if every Democrat
supported this it would have 57 votes
just three short of the necessary sixty
dan what do you think the prospects are
here what do you think about this
compromise look it's a compromise
is this the law that Chuck Schumer Nancy
Pelosi would write to be signed by
Hillary president Hillary Clinton no but
it is it addresses and in contains
things we don't like but that is also
light at a time of divided government
Republicans hold every lever of power so
if Democrats can get something that
addresses the the dreamers this seems
like the best option available to us and
I would encourage every Democrat to vote
for this because
this is our best chance to get something
done before 800,000 dreamers face the
prospect of deportation in the coming
months and this is this is the right
this is the right thing to do it is much
better than the absurd nativists
policies that Trump and Steven biller
have offered earlier it's a compromise
and compromise aren't perfect but that's
that's governing yeah well and it's also
it's about you know the divide between
what is urgently needed right now and
what we can deal with in the future like
right now you know
dreamers face deportation if nothing
gets done if we don't like money for the
wall if we don't like that they don't
get the sponsor parents if we don't like
any of this stuff we can fix that later
once we return to power
if we win in November and then if we
ultimately defeat Donald Trump we can't
fix eight hundred thousand plus dreamers
facing deportation in the next several
months over the summer over the fall or
before before Democrats take back
Congress we can't fix that once that
happens that's irreversible so this is
about acting now to you know is because
it's an urgent situation to protect
dreamers and all the other stuff we
don't like we can fix later
you know we it's 225 billion for the
wall paid out over ten years ten years
like we can get rid of that funding
after November or at least after Trump's
out of office if we you know get Trump
out of office we should say that no go
ahead no no god okay two things one I
know why schoolhouse rocks is not a
thing that's on television anymore but
walls are not etched in stone into the
side of the Capitol they're written Inc
and they can be revised and adjusted and
so there are two groups of Democrats who
may be iffy on this so one would be
potentially the Democrats in the
quote-unquote calm States in the one the
ones who voted to reopen the government
back in January what I would say to
those Democrats are if you vote against
this you will get in just as many ads
saying that
you are smuggling ms-13 members in the
trunk of your car into your community
they are not gonna the Republicans are
not going to go easier on you because
you voted with them they would rather
replace you in a Republican senator no
matter what your vision record is the
other group would be the 20/20 Democrats
people are thinking about running and
here's what I would tell that group is
one this is the right thing to do
regardless of politics but it's also the
politically smart thing to do because
what you don't want to do if you were
running for president 2020 is to have to
go around explaining why you were
partially why you worked with Tom cotton
Paul Ryan and Steven Miller to make it
more likely to dreamers were reported
that is not a question you want to
answer on the campaign trail or on a
debate stage in 2020 yeah
it looks like so the through the Trump
administration is against this proposal
and apparently they just issued a veto
threat which is wonderful you know now
that's still if if this passes the
Senate if we can get 60 votes if all the
Democrats are for this and we can get
three more Republican votes to get to 60
you know maybe the White House feels a
little more pressure there or maybe they
proposed some other compromise I think
the immediate the only thing we can do
in the short term here is try to get
this bill out of the Senate the other
bill that they're gonna vote on is the
Trump proposal the truck grassley
proposal that is basically like this
proposal except it cuts Lee it
dramatically reduces legal immigration
into the country something that doesn't
have anything to do with the dreamers
just wanted to introduce it because you
know they want to keep as many brown and
black people out of the country as
possible so that bills not going
anywhere that bill is not passing the
Senate but Trump proposal because that
hasn't have a single Democrat on board
that is a partisan bill that doesn't
even have the entire Republican caucus
on both on board so you know I don't
know what the I don't know what the
Trump administration is doing here
what do you think about that that they
just issued this veto threat they're
trying to ensure that they kind of
fourth injury worse as quickly as
possible
that's what this is yeah like Trump told
Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi over Chinese
food at one time that he wanted to help
the dreamers he may have even meant
those words when they came out of his
mouth I don't think it was out of some
sort of deep wealth compassionate I
thought it would think it was more about
getting praise on Morning Joe
but his administration whether it's John
Kelly Stephen Moore secretary Nielsen
they do not they want to deport the
dreamers and so they are doing
thanks hi everyone well thank you for
having me I just I missed the first part
of the show have you guys talked about
Trump we were waiting for you man thank
you for doing this thank you my pleasure
it's great to be here do you remember
the first time we met yeah in my office
at the White House in your tiny little
windowless basement office wow this is
relatable Bill Simmons Wayman and you I
was hosting the White House
Correspondents Dinner and you'd written
President Obama's material for that
dinner a lot of it and that was a lot of
screaming backstage he screamed
backstage - yeah and we had almost it
was it was funny I'll never forget it
because you didn't want to tell me what
any of the president's jokes were and I
didn't want to tell you what any of my
jokes were we're just kind of looked at
her to like yeah it's gonna be funny we
looked at each other for a while and I
said that it'll be all right
[Laughter]
so you stepped into the political fray
last year in May because your son Billy
underwent surgery for congenital heart
disorder and I remember when when you
were gonna speak about this you said to
me that when you want to make this
argument you don't want to be preaching
to the choir you want to be try to
persuade people who don't agree with you
so how did you go about doing that and
since you've been talking about it like
have you had you know people come up to
you and say you've changed my mind and
it's been working
no no one who said I get a lot of hate
mail and it doesn't mention anything
like that I will say when you know I've
spoken about a few different subjects
and when I spoke about my son the
reaction was largely positive and in
fact most of the negative reaction that
I got at least on online scene
be from people who are just trying to
get others to click through to their
articles you know just taking a contrary
position and I think that was I think
most people at the very least they said
alright well the guy you know I don't
agree with him but his son had heart
surgery and I could see why he's upset
and he seems to care about the other
people I don't care about the other
people but he cares about the other
people and so god bless him but and then
I spoke about gun control and it was
very very very different and those
people are intense yeah yeah that was a
whole different thing the ugliness
factor ratcheted it up significantly but
and then they kind of went back to the
health care thing and then hated me for
that - so I got retroactively hate from
the healthcare thing and I became as I
think they liked to call me a chuck
schumer's puppet ok no very multifaceted
yes great um you know you talk I
remember seeing you host the Oscars and
by the way can i I'm sorry to interrupt
the last time I was on this stage Warren
Beatty was standing next to me Wow he
looked like he'd seen a ghost he had two
envelopes in his hand for no reason and
I walked I walked to the wings and just
everyone went crazy Wow well that's good
because I was just about to ask you some
questions for John Legend so you saved
off me not making that mistake you know
you you mentioned when at the Oscars
last year reaching out and talking to
people that disagree with you and how if
everybody was watching reached out and
talked to someone who disagreed with him
that maybe we could make a difference so
fast forward to last week you made a
video where you featured a woman who is
a doctor recipient who was facing a
panel of people who were people who
didn't believe in daca and I want to
started watching the clip thinking like
well this is gonna be great
that's what I thought it was good
it wasn't great by the way it was the
version that we showed on television the
real version was much much uglier how is
it
really
it worse what happened well I mean I
almost got in a fight with one of the
guys there are nearly yeah there were
some just there was no respect being
shown for this family and that they were
being just well if you didn't see it
what happened was and I thought this was
a slam dunk and I thought this was gonna
be great and really have a positive
effect and we of course you know we're
all worried about daca and we found a
young woman who is in her 20s she came
to the United States when she was a year
old her parents brought her Europe she's
lived in Kansas for her whole life she
had a baby and you know now she's
potentially subject to deportation so
she's in nursing school just a great
person so I brought these these six
people actually I will say one thing
that should give us a little faith in
humanity is we tried to find people just
out on the street pedestrians and we're
unable to find anyone who opposed daca
and we have a lot of tourists here in
Hollywood so we're not just talking
about our way I mean almost nobody
outside this theater is from LA yeah and
so it's true there are tourists and
superheroes outside so so we found
people who talked about you know they're
there again stock online and we brought
them in and I thought okay so here's how
this is gonna go we're gonna sit them
down I'm gonna introduce them to this
woman she's got this adorable baby who
was born in the United States I'm gonna
tell her story and explain that she
potentially could get deported to Mexico
her daughter is an American citizen you
know how does that work exactly and then
I was gonna bring out her fiancee who is
in the military and who's about to get
sent overseas and we'll be there for how
long he doesn't know and she could
potentially be sent back to Mexico with
his daughter while he's fighting for our
country and I really thought that this
would have an impact on these people and
it had almost no impact whatsoever in
fact they seemed mad
they seem matter yeah if I brought
somebody who been busted for shopping my
favorite moment was the woman who was
like why don't you get an immigration
attorney like it wouldn't have occurred
to them years ago to get an immigration
attorney since they were trying to deal
with immigration and the simple argument
that they tried to make is well why
don't you guys just get married and then
you can become an American citizen well
first of all it's not that simple you do
have to go back to Mexico and you have
and you could potentially be there for
ten years according to their immigration
attorney but also what if they didn't
want to get married what if they'd had a
child together and they plan to raise
the child together and they weren't
married
I mean his child is an American citizen
the idea that the child mother would be
sent to another country it doesn't it
makes so little sense to me I assumed it
would make no sense even to these people
who but they had really it really did
not and one woman at the end I thought
and was she was a sweet woman and she
was at least compassionate she at least
had some empathy I'm not sure that she
necessarily changed her opinion either
so she wasn't the one you almost got in
a fight with she was not she was trying
to plan the wedding
what would she was doing can you
describe your almost getting into a
fight over this there was a one guy in
particular who kept in - and when
Michael the military man who works here
in the United States kept was trying to
explain his position this guy kept
interrupting him with his Sean Hannity
 over and over and over again
and it was upsetting him and upsetting
his wife and upsetting me and the baby
was sleeping so the baby was fine but
everybody was upset yeah yeah so can I
ask I mean obviously you spoke out about
health care because you had this family
connection your son went through surgery
and then you went on to gun violence and
then now you've been talking about daca
what made you embrace not just political
comedy which a lot of comedians have
done in the Trump era but the political
advocacy what's made you do that
well real serious concern for the future
of this country and having children you
know I have four children I have two
older children in their 20s and when I
had them I was in my 20s I didn't
necessarily think about politics in the
future you know I was just trying to pay
the rent and to make sure they had food
and maybe take them to Disneyland every
once in a while but now you know as I'm
50 years old and my son went through
this situation I saw these families and
I saw a lot of low-income people being
served at this hospital that relies on
donations and it seemed wrong to me that
a hospital should even have to rely on
donations and it I saw that even though
those kids were getting great treatment
at Children's Hospital here in Los
Angeles that and it's a great Hospital
they trained doctors that go all over
the country and all over the world and
work in every town but I saw that these
people you know they had to take months
off work you know they they can't get
Melissa McCarthy to fill in for them
that week you know like I was able to do
and and it upset me and I wondered how
they're like making it and free even you
can't work you're upset your whole
family is upset it's sometimes you know
heart disease at least in my situation
is an operation and hopefully it works
and then you're done with it but their
children with cancer and you know these
long-term chronic diseases that they'll
have to deal with for the entirety of
their lives and it just just so happened
that at that time the Affordable Care
Act was was in jeopardy and I don't
necessarily believe that things happen
for a reason
I really don't but it sure seemed like a
coincidence and it seemed like I just
felt like I don't know if I felt like it
was a message being sent to me but I
just felt like I had to say something
about those other people and
and in doing so you know there's Paranal
in late night television always the
history late night television is don't
show your hand don't tell people what
your political affiliation is I think
Jon Stewart really changed that for but
but when you but when it came to network
television that really still was the
case I mean it wasn't until late in
Letterman's career that we knew what his
affiliation is you know Jay Leno I think
most people thought he was a Republican
and he's not he's a Democrat you know
but you wouldn't know it from watching
his show and there was some wisdom to
that because when you tell a joke if you
think the person telling the joke is
unbiased you can just appreciate the
joke for what it is the underlying
reason is you could potentially lose
half your audience if they feel like
you're not one of them a lot of it is do
I like this guy and you know that's part
of the deal but maybe the good thing
about now having a hundred different
channels and 30 different talk shows is
you can be honest and you can talk about
these things and these things that mean
something to you and it also just so
happens that pretty much every
late-night talk show host is a liberal
[Laughter]
go figure and that's because it requires
a measure of intelligence
[Applause]
not a tremendous amount of intelligence
you do have to be over the baseline sir
sir
so I guess speaking of intelligence one
of the things that's been really fun to
watch it has been when you take people
on on Twitter who are much dumber than
you
for example Roy Moore I think you and
Donald Trump jr. have gotten into it and
I think a lackey of a Lackey of a Lackey
of it or is it their fourth Lackey
anyway there's a there's a multi level
Lackey of Paul Ryan have gotten into it
if you could fight anybody on Twitter
who would you fight and how would it go
well it's hard to top Donald Trump jr.
because first of all he's Donald Trump
jr. yeah what could be worse than being
Donald Trump
you're not even Donald Trump you've got
that jr. at the end I would every time
if I had to choose between being Eric
Trump and Donald Trump jr.
I would never dejected on I don't think
Republicans even liked him I don't I
don't know his wife probably doesn't
like him let's be honest I mean we you
want an unlikable character you want
somebody that you know Roy Moore was
pretty great it's like who's on Roy
Moore side in this battle you know who
am I gonna lose in this fight a horse
but I think the president would be the
president like what would what would
prompt you to take on the president well
I never start any of these fights they
someone else always starts them so I
would just wait for him to say something
in basilic first I probably point out
the spelling errors or bad use of quotes
see when he put Trump in quotes
I get more caught up with that than the
message it's like why is trumpet quote
he like you know it's not
easy to put quotes on your phone it's it
takes some doing
also the capitalization and units ran it
always ass insanity I have the I have an
idea and I think I know this is I know
this would be I know a lot of people
would have a problem with this but what
if we were all required to take an IQ
test okay and that number had to be a
part of our Twitter handle had to that's
it you want to be on Twitter there's a
test it's got to be there and then we
just kind of know where everybody's
coming from do it solve a lot of
problems
max thanks for doing the show man sure
thanks for the great endorsement yeah
well you know that I you make me smarter
so the reason I reached out to you to do
this interview it was because of a story
in The Washington Post that terrified
both of us they reported that Trump had
pulled back his nominee to be the US
ambassador to South Korea a guy named
Victor cha who is a well known policy
expert worked in the bush administration
widely respected apparently he was
pulled back though because Victor
opposed what's called a bloody nose
strike on North Korea that strategy
suggests that the US could conduct a
limited strike on North Korea as a
deterrent because as we all know the way
to avoid a war is to start one you
tweeted what I was thinking which is
that all along you know you'd assume
that this talk of a bloody nose strike
was a bluff because the risk was just
too high that post story makes us think
otherwise can you explain what a bloody
nose strike might look like in what you
think the consequences of such an action
could be right we're kind of telling Lee
I actually don't think that a bloody
nose strike is a real thing yeah I don't
I think that's just something that they
made up because it sounds kind of like
cool and tough because one of the
reasons that I think a lot of us thought
like okay this is some combination of
domestic political signaling or it's a
bluff in the hopes that like this will
be a low-cost way to deter the North
Koreans which like comes with some
really significant risks that you know
we should talk about but like it's a
reasonable strategy like you can kind of
make an argument for it but it really is
starting to seem like with this cha
thing it's becoming harder for me to
convince myself that it's all of us and
the reason for that is that like you
know bluffing is pretty low cost right
like you get people like you and me
riled up but they well you can't do that
and if you launch a strike then you know
won't accomplish anything and risk a
nuclear war but you know that doesn't
really my tweet storms are devastating
it's the program they say
single-handedly going to bring down
right yeah but like actually blocking
the nomination of an ambassador to a
post it
really need like the relations at the
South Koreans right now are really
strained and like whether you're
thinking about a war or not you want in
a like if your plan is to Bluff you need
an ambassador there so blocking the
nomination of a really well-respected
ambassador who is like ready to come in
and do the job it's a very high cost
step to take and it really suggests and
also like the fact that siya came out
basically within like half an hour like
the guy is real fast and wrote something
that said you know they were pushing for
a quote-unquote bloody nose strike I was
uncomfortable with it well you also
asked me what that is so I guess what
that is is just like lobbing some
missiles at North Korea as a way to say
like hey please give up your nuclear
weapons which it's not really clear how
the one gets to the other you know what
I mean and they're like the ambiguity
there is again that's a reason why
you're like okay this is probably a
bluff because they're just talking about
missiles not about you know where do we
strike what does it do while they were
saying we're gonna hit North Korean
nuclear missiles on the launch pad and
they don't have lunch pads mobile with
their insights and right they're mobile
so the fact that they even even bother
to say like oh we're gonna have mobile
launchers is kind of like okay this is
not a real thing but it's starting to
look like maybe it is yeah so to you
know I think you'd make an important
point that having an ambassador not
having an ambassador is actually a big
deal yes someone is in charge but for
example Barack Obama sent over a guy
named mark Lippert mark had been the NSC
chief of staff he had military
experience he had worked in the Pentagon
he's there's a lot of equities in the
region you have North Korea obviously
and you're a big part of that those
policy discussions but you had the US
ambassador to South Korea he's dealing
with one of the most important economic
relationships we have we have 28,000 500
troops serving in Korea so he's liaison
or she's liaising with US forces Korea
so there's a lot going on like that's a
very big job but I think many of us were
excited to see someone with the
experience of Victor cha even though I
might disagree with him on a lot of
policy matters put forward for this job
and then yeah like you said to see a
yanked back it is ominous to say the
least
well it's also
I mean there's been a lot of focus on
this disagreement over should we launch
an attack on North Korea as a way to
like punish its nuclear weapons program
convince them to give it up we rightly
that is a big question that we should be
talking about but the other really big
disagreement that I think in some ways
is even more striking and important to
pay attention to is that cha who was a
really serious political scientist on
his own merits has repeatedly argued
that the Kim regime that runs
North Korea is rational and the Trump
administration's position which is one
of the big data points suggesting that
you know maybe they do mean this is that
the regime is not rational and you know
be pretty much expert consensus is that
it is rational I mean you don't keep a
state that weak and isolated and poor
stable for as long as it has been stable
unless you're like pretty canny and
pretty thoughtful about keeping the
regime alive and all of their steps make
sense that are like they're brutal
they're you know morally deplorable but
they're rational to keep the regime
alive and this is something that Charlie
hit on his op-ed is that there's a
disagreement over with this regime is
rational or not and you know HR McMaster
is the National Security Advisor
when he has been making the case for
strikes
they have been premise on the idea that
Kim is not rational and can't be
deterred so therefore we can't tolerate
North Korea having a nuclear weapons
program and have to forcibly disarm them
now as chop pointed out it doesn't
really make sense if you're making the
argument on the one hand Kim as
irrational so can't be trusted to have a
nuclear weapons program without you know
wildly using them one day but in the
other hand we think he's rational enough
that he will correctly perceive the
signal of a limited American strike as a
punishment but not the start of a war
right yes I mean to be clear that's the
danger hanging all over all of this is
that a limited strike or even just talk
of one could create this you know
accident or misstep or slide into a
larger war yeah and again you know that
you Evan Osnos I've heard him talk about
this he's a great journalist writes to a
New Yorker about China and in Asia
generally and also about politics but
you know he and you very few people talk
about the actual stakes of what a war on
the Korean Peninsula clike I mean they
have chemical weapons biological weapons
and nuclear weapons
artillery blanketing Seoul that the
discussions are like hundreds of
thousands to millions of people dead in
the first couple weeks depending on how
long it goes right it's hard to we
actually talk about this a lot it's like
how do we write about the you know to be
here like low-level low probability risk
but that is so extremely dangerous I
mean when the numbers are that high and
when you're talking about potential
first nuclear use I mean even pretty
likely nuclear use in the case of a war
first since 1945 it's hard to know how
to accurately convey it without sounding
like you know it's like crazy doomsday
scenarios because that's what they are
I mean then North Korea's war plan is
very clear and that I mean the thing to
remember is that they are really weak
compared to United States and know it so
they are just in a knife edge and their
warplane is very clear that you know
first we shall Seoul as a way to kind of
suppress it and as a way to shock the
South Koreans into surrendering and then
they're very crystal clear about this
use conventional or probably nuclear
weapons on major South Korean ports and
it what's the big base that we have in
Okinawa target Okinawa target Guam and
the idea is just to disable all of our
assets for a region which is hundreds of
thousands of American lives not to
mention probably millions of South
Koreans significant number of Japanese
and then the next step is to hold a
major American city at risk with a
long-range nuclear weapon which one
thing that really puzzles me about
everything we Trump administration says
about North Korea as they keep talking
about and you mentioned this the C Union
we can't let North Korea yet
nuclear-armed missile capability to
reach United States they're there man
yeah it happened that speaks to another
sort of bit of illogic in this so you
alluded to that that Victor cha
immediately wrote an op-ed sort of
warning about the risks
a bloody nose strike shortly after that
I think today the Washington Post ran a
column by a reporter a journalist named
Josh Rogin that says the bloody nose
attack on North Korea is not happening
anytime soon
they quote officials saying there's no
change in policy yes they're reviewing
options from the Department of Defense
that include things like a limited
strike but that we all should just chill
out because it's not imminent but what I
don't get is the issue with North Korea
is the ongoing development of nuclear
and missile technology so waiting
doesn't help us there and time doesn't
turn a bad idea into a good idea what do
you make of that
competing narrative spinning out after
the chana's
I mean I kind of think that I know we're
going to talk about Afghanistan later
and like I think one parallel is just
this situation is humiliating yeah it's
just really you know they have achieved
effective nuclear deterrence against the
United States which is crazy I mean this
is one of the poorest countries in the
world it has you know I looked it up at
one point it's something like that GDP
of Birmingham Alabama it is a tiny
country and it's now one of three China
Russia and North Korea that has nuclear
deterred knew clearly deterred the
United States I meant that's very hard
for us to process and it's very hard for
us to accept so we end up kind of
whining and just like well you know the
sanctions are really going to buy or you
know we're going to threaten the strike
or we're going to launch a strike
something is going to happen and then
the Kim regime is going to decide to
voluntarily surrender the nuclear
weapons program that it believes not
without reason is the only thing between
it and its total destruction there's no
reason to think that they would give it
up and every reason to think that they
would accept everything up to including
a nuclear war in order to hold on to
them and then how do you admit that to
yourself yeah I don't know to be that if
a multi-decade multi administration
failure
a major one nonetheless um we talked
about this a little bit earlier but I
mean how important do you think that
broader brain drain is in the State
Department to you know you're never even
started answer a question over I'm
struck by the how we've we never hear
about new diplomatic initiatives on
almost any issue not on Syria not with
Isis not in not in Afghanistan not in
North Korea how much do you think that's
because of the general exodus of senior
state Department officials that we've
seen happening like just today we
learned that Tom Shannon who's the
highest ranking career official the
State Department is stepping down he was
known as the walking encyclopedia of
information at state like what what do
you think the net effect is on policy of
those people just kind of being taken
away from the decision-making table so
pretty shortly after Trump was elected I
thought a good thing to do with the
first year would be kind of travel
around all of the major treaty allies
and kind of check in with folks in the
government there and see you know how
does this work how are you running the
relationships how are you dealing with
this and the first place I went was
Germany and you know they kind of people
with officials on the record would say
what they had to say which is like we
believe in the transatlantic
relationship and everything is going to
be great and we're managing all of this
and I was interviewing one senior
official with the SPD which is the kind
of big center-left party in the
Reichstag and you know he was kind of
giving me it'll be fine we have our
disagreements we'll work it through and
then the interview was kind of wrapping
up and you know closing the notebooks
and he said by the way we can't get
anyone at the State Department to answer
our calls do you know who's working
Europe policy there no cool that's great
that has been like that's been the year
yeah any year of that and people have
kind of consigned themselves like okay
well I guess there's no one on the other
end of the phone line but that creates
drift to create some certainty it's
actually been amazing to me how the
degree to which allies are holding on to
the relationship despite you know
feeling personally slighted by the Trump
administration despite their publics
really not being happy with the Trump
administration
and the Alliance I mean it really speaks
to kind of the endurance of American
power you know and I met with South
Korean officials they said hey we think
that maybe your country is going to drag
our country into nuclear war and we're
really unhappy about it and people are
floating these scenarios of you know
maybe if you guys go to war our troops
are going to stand down and we're not
going to go with you which you know no
one will officially suggest but it's
kind of being discussed but then they'll
say you know we don't have any choice
we're with the Americans so we're going
to put on a happy face moon is going to
meet with Trump so I don't know it's
really interesting to see both how deep
the effect has been and how little it
has changed yeah they're riding the
mechanical bull at the bar and they
can't get off that drink the the ACOTA
to your Germany story is that Trump
dominated like the most acerbic hostile
Twitter troll out there to be his US
ambassador to Germany so careful what
you wish for German friends so I believe
he's actually blocked me on Twitter oh
good
lucky you so all of this talk about
threats of military action North Korea
dovetails nicely with an issue you've
written about a lot which is something
called the credibility trap the theory
if I can summarize it briefly goes that
the u.s. has to follow through on every
threat and confront every adversary to
maintain our quote credibility in the
world and if we don't our enemies will
rise up in our global standing will
plummet and the United States will no
longer be the leader in the world that
we once were did I describe that
correctly like why do you think that
logic is so dangerous it's dangerous
because countries are not like people we
so badly want to see them that way
because then the world would make more
sense and it would be more relatable and
we also really want to believe that
American power is this kind of like
self-fulfilling self-reinforcing
phenomenon and the more of it that there
is out there in the world kind of
regardless of how it's applied to the
better and the better that you know the
more the world will be aligned to our
interest and made it our image but it's
dangerous because it tells you that the
answer
to every problem is more application of
American force you know it says that if
I mean the classic example of this and
the thing that got me to write a lot
about it was when Bashar al-assad in
Syria used chemical weapons and I
actually thought that there were good
reasons to consider launching a strike
as a way to kind of enforce the global
norm against the use of chemical weapons
but that wasn't the argument primarily
out there they are you primarily out
there was that America is like a person
and America has a reputation and there
will be a stain on our reputation nobody
will take us seriously and you know
Russia will take over the world and that
was silly I mean even did Julie alfie
did a great story I think for the
Atlantic where she actually talked to a
lot of foreign policy people in Russia
and they said you know did you guys
invade Ukraine because we stained our
credibility in Syria which was the big
argument right just that look we we
failed to follow through on her threats
now people don't take us seriously and
Putin is walking all over Europe and
they literally did not even understand
the argument to keep explaining it
because it didn't it just like did not
logically follow even in their minds
much less being like a nefarious and
rightly so I mean I don't mean this is
not an effort to absolve the Obama
administration in any way for the
situation in Sierra but I do think it is
very instructive to see how deeply the
argument you're discussing this
credibility trap has infected this
debate because the the so-called redline
discussion from Obama was not a promise
to fully intervene in Syria and tippi
outcome from Assad to the rebels it was
a threat that said if you use chemical
weapons we will respond with military
force so I think that nuance gets lost
but yeah your you're referencing this
notoriously stupid Bush administration
official turned columnist who suggested
that the redline decision it was why
Putin invaded Ukraine and Julia Yaffe
asked Russian officials about the theory
they didn't even understand it and also
it conveniently omits the fact that
Putin invaded Georgia long after we
President Bush invaded Iraq
so like when when you got these glaring
logical fallacies within your own
argument within this decade how does
this become settled conventional wisdom
right become conventional wisdom I mean
that when we look at other countries
foreign policies Russia China we readily
accept the idea that they have kind of
ideologies and pathologies that guide
how they see the world how they interact
with it what they want from it in fact
that's central to how we understand
Vladimir Putin's Russia China even when
we talk about what the United Kingdom
and France do in the world you know we
kind of start with you know France is
trying to reclaim lost Empire you know
the United Kingdom has this kind of
World War 2 global leader thing going on
but when we look at ourselves we just we
cannot see our foreign policy as
anything but just the expression of pure
values and pure reason and that is
itself I think part of the pathology
you know after World War Two the Cold
War we kind of started drinking our own
kool-aid yeah and this idea that the
all right joining me today on pods day
of the world is one of my favorite
guests ben rhodes former deputy national
security advisor for strategic
communications a crooked contributor and
a good friend of mine who is still
fighting the good fight in washington DC
Ben it's great to have you on could I be
with you coming I mean I wanted to talk
today about the ongoing protests in Iran
because there are the events that are
happening on the ground there are the
sort of looks back to the protests in
June of 2009 when you and I were both
sitting in the White House there's a
policy debate around the Iran deal and
then there's the general sort of
insanity that infects Washington DC
whatever the word Iran is uttered so I
figured you were the perfect guy to to
talk through this with um so first on
the protests themselves I want to try to
outline what it is we know with the
caveat that I'm not in Iran you're not
in Iran neither of us have been to Iran
the likelihood that with this many
protesters on the streets there's a
variety of reasons why people are there
and doing what they do so huge caveat
huge dose of humility here about the
efficacy of diagnosing foreign political
upheaval from the US but according to
news reports there are protests in
dozens of cities the reportedly 21
protest protesters have been killed that
number is probably greater than what's
reported unlike you mean unlike the
protests in Iran in 2009 that were
focused with middle class or urban areas
these have been largely young people in
rural areas that tend to be more
conservative and strong backers of the
Islamic regime so that's notable
according to the New York Times and a
great reporter there named Thomas Terry
brink the catalyst for this anger is a
leaked reportedly a leaked budget
document that showed the military and
elite religious institutions are getting
a whole bunch of money billions of
dollars while subsidies to the poor are
getting cut and fuel prices are
increasing so that sparked a sort of
understandable outrage Ayatollah
Khamenei has blamed the protesters and
blamed the protests on outside enemies
President rouhani has appealed for calm
while saying that the protester should
be heard
leaving anything out here and is the
mere fact that people are taken to the
streets in these numbers significant or
is it just soon too soon to know really
anything definitive about what's
happening well you know speaking with
the humility of having you know lived
through many protests in that part of
the world I think we always have to be
careful about both diagnosing the cause
of protests and also predicting where
they may lead yeah I do think what is
clear is there is pent-up frustration in
Iran about economic circumstances and
the corruption inside of Iran there is a
sense what I'd add to your summary Tommy
is you know I think Iranians have seen
that they've been spending a lot of
money in places like Lebanon and Syria
places outside of Iran and in that
budget document it basically
demonstrates that both the military and
the clerical institutions you know are
getting a big cut of the budgetary pie
at a time when things are getting worse
for you know kind of working poor and in
some ways it's it you know it's a it's
inequality it's a basic frustration and
inequality and corruption that we've
seen in many countries around the world
so it's familiar in that regard yeah
you're right what's different is 2009
was largely middle-class protests in
response to an election that was seem to
be flawed
and there was flawed frankly and here
this is more organic and less there's
less leadership and 2009 you had the
green movement and you had identifiable
leaders of the green movement
politicians here it really is kind of an
outburst of anger and frustration from
more of the working poor and people in
different Iranian cities not just in
Tehran yeah interesting makeup of
protesters obviously ongoing but but
everyone is watching the world is
watching including President Trump who
was doing what he does and he has been
tweeting here's one example quote the
people of Iran are finally acting
against the brutal and corrupt Iranian
regime
all of the money that President Obama so
foolishly gave them went into terrorism
and into their pockets the people of
little food big inflation and no human
rights the u.s. is watching rouhani
responded some of those sweet saying
Trump has no right to criticize a-rod
since he's called them terrorists and
has locked them out of the country and
is constantly trying to sanction them um
how do you think tweets like that
comments from the United States will be
received in Iran helpful unhelpful
what's your take from from afar yeah and
you know there's a lot to unpack there
but we'll get to the Iran deal later the
you know frankly I don't think that they
matter much you know we tend to make all
of these events about ourselves
Trump always makes every event about
himself you know I frankly I think if
there was one thing that most people in
Iran would agree with it's that they you
know don't care much for Donald Trump
and they don't think that Donald Trump
should you know be interfering in in
their politics and the risk of course is
that if he tries to make the protesters
in Iran look like an extension of you
know the Trump administration or the
Trump administration's agenda that you
know undermines their legitimacy in a
way because what is powerful about this
is it's irani ins everything that
they're fed up they're not acting on
behalf of a foreign power they're not
acting even on behalf of you know a
political agenda that could be set by
the United States they're just people
saying we want more control over our
lives we want more resources more
opportunity less corruption you know
frankly a more democratic society and
that you know the government reflects
their their needs and so I you know I
think you can over read you know how
much impact it has it certainly doesn't
have a positive impact because I don't
think the protesters are looking to
Donald Trump's Twitter feed for
inspiration here and you know the again
the risk is we know the play that the
Ayatollah will run he'll say that these
are agents of the foreign power their
agents the United States there's no
reason to kind of give them that
ammunition but you know frankly I think
Donald Trump is not very relevant to the
current internal politics
of Iran and you know making the mistake
of presuming that this is somehow about
him and not just about the frustrations
of the Iranian people yeah you spent a
lot of time in the Situation Room in the
Oval Office thinking about talking about
policy options that the US could take
during protests like this comments the
President or the administration could
make and even you know covert actions
that the CIA or or you know the Intel
agencies could do do you think when you
think back on that time and those
debates and discussions and what you
guys did or didn't do
is there anything is there an action is
there a policy that the administration
could take that would be helpful to the
protesters or is it just not about the
u.s. I think that generally speaking
most Iranians want more engagement with
the West and more engagement even with
the United States the United States in
public opinion surveys has generally
been more well thought of in Iran than
in some of the neighboring Arab
countries which is interesting not sure
if that holds up under Trump so I think
that you know the points our maker one I
do think it's right to speak out in
support of the protest but I think it's
important to frame it as we support
universal rights we support the right to
freedom of assembly the right to freedom
of speech the right to have a government
that is not corrupt so that it doesn't
feel like we are trying to you know
control regime change in Iran to our own
needs but rather you know we're taking a
position that is principled on behalf of
universal values frankly the more you
can try to be consistent in the
application of those principles the
better so I think Trump is further
undercut by the full embrace he's given
to Sisi in Egypt and to the Saudi
Arabians who also have you know
authoritarian systems and don't allow
for you know freedom of assembly and
large-scale protests so I think anybody
looking at Trump's words in the region
are going to tune them out because
they're going to
that this isn't really about democracy
this is about you know how the United
States feels about the Iranian regime so
first point is a coucher support for the
protesters in support of their
fundamental human rights and aspirations
and try to apply that as consistently as
you can
recognizing that American foreign policy
perfect consistency is elusive second
though is taking steps to show that
there is a pathway towards more
engagement with the West in the United
States and so Trump's travel ban is
exactly the wrong message to send I mean
it doesn't send a message to Iranian
said as they reform and that we want to
be a part of that process we want them
to come the United States we want them
to study at American universities where
they obviously will be exposed to
different points of view so you know I'd
be looking at a menu of options to get
rid of that travel ban and frankly do
increase you know the students from Iran
who could come to the United States so
that again they're exposed to well life
on our university campuses or the
potential for to show that if Iran
evolves in a different direction there
will be incentives for that evolution
the other thing is information so we
wrestled with how do we try to provide
access to information inside of Iran are
there ways to unblock the Internet are
there ways to you know try to empower
people through technology and the US
government has a you know variety of
ways to try to do that to try to protect
some open space in areas where the
regime may be trying to crack down on
the free flow of information so that's a
another practical thing that that you
can do and and frankly at a certain
point you know dialogue you know we
don't know these people protesting and
and finding some way to engage the
Iranian people more broadly we tried to
set up for instance in the Obama
administration of virtual embassy we
also don't have an embassy but a
platform that could at least have some
form of online engagement with Iranian
people to tell them about American
values what we believe in the future we
prefer to have with Iran so you know I
think it's a mixture of criticism of the
regime
support for universal rights that we
want for all people including Iranians
and then finding two ways to engage the
type of people the young people in
particular who are who are driving this
this protest movement yeah I noticed
that uh Bibi Netanyahu also did a bit of
video wishing the Iranian people's
success in their noble quest for freedom
I would probably put that in the maybe
not helpful category I don't know about
you I think the bottom line is everybody
you know if you talk to people about
Iran and get to the diversity of views
Ron Ian's are very proud and they're
very sovereignty conscious yes a lot of
their if you talk to Ron Ian's not just
the people who you know support the
regime but you know the people that you
and I would know middle class educated
people who you know come to the United
States the you know that they'd always
bring up 1954 when the CIA sponsored a
you know a coup in Iran that reinstalled
the Shah they they're very neurotic to
external powers particularly United
States seeking to dictate their regime
and the point is that we should want the
Iranian people to make these decisions
not the supreme leader and not a farm
power and they're the ones who are
driving this process and we can find
ways to help them to give them more
space to to give them more
interconnectivity to people in the
United States and around the world but
if we make this about us and that you
know we want to this type of government
to be in place and Iran not only is that
going to be rejected by you know the
Ayatollah frankly that's not the message
that I think that people are protesting
you know are looking for they're looking
to control their own lives not to have
the United States or anybody else do
this for them right so going back in
time a little bit the Iranian green
movement started after the disputed June
2009 presidential election President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was in power he was
particularly brutal he was facing a more
moderate Challenger and former prime
minister Moussa vu Iran a surprisingly
strong campaign given that he was seen
as a lackluster campaigner there were
very significant
regularities that you referenced earlier
Mousavi basically said it had been
stolen and he went out and declared
victory and called on his supporters to
take to the streets and then you know
hundreds of thousands of people if not
millions listened to him the protest
started peaceful they quickly got
violent because the regime dispatched
riot police and and clean plainclothes
goons called Bastide militia members who
beat protesters in the streets shot them
murdered a young woman named data we all
watched literally watched her die from a
cell phone video we were in the White
House at that time during those first 48
hours I think Obama greatly internalized
the advice you've been talking about
about how we don't want this to be about
us we wanted to about the aspirations of
the Iranian people and he didn't weigh
in publicly on the situation in the way
that a lot of observers wanted him to
can you talk about why like what what
did he say in those first that first day
of those first 48 hours that you can
recall well what I recall is it yes we
did have a you know he did have a view
that we didn't want to make the protest
it looked like an extension of the
United States we also wanted to see what
Turner would take so in other words I
think he wanted to hold open the
possibility that the protest could lead
to something more constructive you know
like an actual dialogue and some process
to look at the election when the protein
it was clear that the protests were
being met with a crackdown yeah he then
spoke out so in other words I think he
you know once we saw we saw the protest
and we wanted to see how the regime was
going to respond when we saw their
response you know he spoke out and he
continued to speak out in support of
what the green movement was trying to do
right
personally I frankly I think you know
there is nothing lost in speaking out
right away around universal values so I
don't have a I'm not I don't take an
extreme position that you know we should
not be heard from I do just think we
have to couch our language to make the
about the Iranian people and Trump and
and and some of the people who are
weighing in make Iran seem like some
extension of American domestic politics
almost you know they're talking about
Obama and the Iran deal and and you know
comes tweeting out his own speeches and
you know that is not what this is about
so again we wanted to give some space to
see what would take place and then Obama
spoke out I think there's no problem in
speaking out right away I do think what
you say and how you say it matters and
that's where I think we would obviously
be taking a different approach right
right yeah it's it's it the juxtaposing
Trump statement of Obama's statement
immediately makes it a domestic
political statement but yeah you're
right by June 15th Obama was talking
about how it's up to the Iranians decide
who Iran's leaders will be we talked
about respecting their sovereignty
didn't want to make the USD issue inside
Iran but said he was troubled by the
violence by June 23rd it was went much
further we were condemning violence and
unjust imprisonments do you think that
shift in language was a response to the
evolving situation in Iran was it
increasing political pressure back home
like what do you think got him to a
place where he was comfortable
condemning what he saw was it just the
things got so brutal I think it was a
situation in Iran and it wasn't in DC I
mean I think like I said we saw what the
regime was doing I remember Obama
personally seeing that video of Neda the
young woman being killed in the street
and you know it was clear that they were
in a full crackdown mode and there was
no space for dialogue you know they
weren't they weren't going to allow some
process to look at the election results
or to sit down with the green movement
and they ultimately put the leadership
at the green movement under house arrest
you also have to remember that you know
this is going to play out on on its own
timeline you know that even in Iran that
protest movement ultimately those people
voted for rouhani in the next election
and rouhani was not the preferred
candidate of the Supreme Leader every
Iran analyst we had
he suggested he wasn't even probably in
the top two and you know they had barred
Ross and Johnny who was a leading
moderate who had some affiliation with
Ronnie and and some connections to some
of the green movement figures from
running and rouhani kind of came in as
the reform candidate the more moderate
candidate and he won so decisively that
the you know the supreme leader and the
powers-that-be
did not repeat the play of 2009 and try
to prevent you know the candidate who
was not the preferred candidate from
taking power right so in other words you
know that protest movement didn't
succeed in overturning the regime in
2009 but it did lay some groundwork for
a guy who was not the preferred
candidate of the supreme leader to get
elected president of Iran and in that
and here we are today where according to
that time story which has the ring of
truth you know was people associate with
rouhani who leaved that budget document
because precisely because they were at
odds with some of them were hardline
factions so we always have to remember
there is politics inside of Iran
politics and the people in the street
and there's politics within the regime
itself and how we react needs to do
whatever we can to empower the more
reformist elements and the people who
are more likely to lead Iran into a more
democratic less violent direction can
you just a quick aside can you explain
who pulls the levers of power in Iran is
it the supreme leader is it the
president like what's the gist of sort
of who's in charge and and who has real
influence yeah so it's a it's a it's a
complicated system in a way but
essentially the supreme leader is the
final decision-maker you know I mean
he's the ultimate authority but
underneath him there are a variety of
different sources of power so the
president who is elected who is now asan
rouhani has significant authority over
certain economic policy you know on the
on foreign policy we thought he had it's
