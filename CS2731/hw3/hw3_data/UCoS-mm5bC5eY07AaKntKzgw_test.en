&gt; There is a vast discrepancy between the hate crimes numbers gathered by the FBI from police jurisdictions around the country and the estimate of hate crime victims in annual surveys by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

&gt; The FBI counts 6,121 hate crimes in 2016, and the BJS estimates 250,000 hate crimes a year.

&gt; Complicating matters further is that hate crime laws vary by state, with some including sexual orientation as a protected class of victims and some not.

Upon making the claim with Amnesty International a warrant for his extradition on fake charges was immediately issued.  In a book he wrote he described the murder of another prisoner named Ralph Steele who was beaten to death in the same prison unit and then his death falsely reported as a suicide. **The letters he wrote to FBI Directors Louis Freeh and FBI Director Robert Meuller are contained in filings made to Supreme Court of Canada in 2007 as legal exhibits.** Btw... N. Cameron of Amnesty International in Toronto is recorded saying, "Because you are a U.S. citizen and not a Canadian citizen, our Director says you have to apply for help through the U.S. office because of budgeting issues." 

#The torture described in the OP link took place in Miami, NOT Guatanamo Bay or some secret prison overseas.

The man has been exiled in China for a decade after the U.S. put him on a no-fly list until his passport expired. They want him to rot and die in China even though he has a Canadian wife and kids in Toronto. https://afewthoughtsfrombruce.wordpress.com/category/torture/I think most of this abuse goes on in State prisons where the most rapes also take place. But hey, none of us knew about Guantanamo nor Abu Ghraib until someone blew the whistle. Gorcyca seems to know what he is talking about in the article he wrote and I found an affidavit of a witness named "Betzner" at http://whyunclesamhatesbruce.blogspot.com and another one from a guy named "Simmons" at http://whyunclesamhatesbruce.wordpress.com. Also I found out that "segregation units" really mean "solitary confinement".  Now I understand why Snowden does not want to come to America and how the U.S. Army extracted a confession from Manning.This post is BIGGER than you think. Go to this link and look through the legal exhibits until you find a sworn report of a private investigator named EDWARD REIKEN and read the 11 page report. Our government is literally getting away with murders. http://bruceslawsocietycomplaint.wordpress.com/

The people who report these abuses end up murdered or living in foreign countries like Jim Stone, Edward Snowden, Bruce Gorcyca, and Julian Assange.

Now you know why people get tortured in America!Good work. I kinda figured people do not get tortured for no reason. Now it is really easy for me to understand why Bradley Manning "confessed" and made a plea bargain. There was no reason to keep him in solitary confinement for months on end. They did that deliberately to break the man and remove all hope from his life. Just imagine what they would do to Snowden or Assange if they ever get them on U.S. soil!don't mind this idiot, this isn't true

that part was not sung at the games, op is just an racist idiot spreading lies The intent is the same...THEY ARE THE STRUGGLE SONGS ONE TO KILL THE BOER TH OTHER IS THE LAND WHICH WE SUPPOSEDLY STOLE ...the intent in both of them are against white people and the lie that we stole the land which justifies our killing period . blah blah blah, you posted this with the intent of making people believe that "kill the boer" was sung and it was not. you are spreading lies.Does Human Rights Watch have RSS feeds for their reports and news? I've been looking around and can't find anything other than an email newsletter.

Any help is appreciated.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTfE8B8wkE0&amp;t=461sHi, 
a dear friend of mine asked me to help her reach out to people regarding her research paper. My friend is looking for both interviewees and people to fill out her Survey. What follows is a description of her research and if it applies to you please fill out the survey or PM me and I can send you her contacts if you are interested in getting interviewed. Thanks in advance

**I am researching the impact that the awareness of NSA surveillance has had on people working in various fields promoting human rights (journalism, advocacy, policy, legal field etc.)**

**My research entails a survey as well as several semi-structured interviews with people working on human rights. I would be very grateful if any of you would be willing to give me a short interview and/or if you could put me in touch with any people you think might be interesting to contact for the research.**
 
**Basically I am trying to explore if the awareness of NSA surveillance has already had a concrete impact on the work of human rights activist and advocates and if so, in which ways.**
 
**Up to now only PEN conducted a research study on the impact the knowledge of NSA surveillance has had on writers, concluding that their members are engaging in self-censorship. Since we now are aware that the NSA specifically targeted human rights organizations and activists, it is a pertinent, albeit sensitive area to study that merits to be explored beyond a theoretical level.**

**I would love to have as many interview and survey participants as I can to make the research findings relevant. I would be thrilled to get a short interview (15min max) with several or one of you.**

**My survey:
http://newschool.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_4Yp8HfjhFe4unDn
takes about 4 minutes and is anonymous, feel free to share it with your networks.**  Hello wise advisors.

I am currently a junior at a top 10 undergraduate institution. I'm a physics major. I love physics as an intellectual pursuit. In an ideal world physics would be my profession, and I believe I am good enough at it to earn a decent living off it even in this world. It'd be a fruitful and interesting life.

However, I don't think I will be able to stay in physics. I don't know if I am willing to coexist with hunger, genocide, and poverty without fighting it. It seems so simple, that one should throw away all and work for the good. It is more complicated than that though.

Where does one start?

In terms of practical work I can do...what sort of career would allow me to combat world hunger? Or genocide? What sort of work is there to be done? How do I go about this?

Do most people like me try and work for NGO's or Governmental aid agencies? What sort of skills or education should I have? The physics career path is really pretty simple and I know what it looks like. But what about in human rights? What do most people in the field do?? Will my physics (and thus quantitative as well as intellectual) background put me at an advantage, or disadvantage?

Currently I plan on finishing my physics degree and then joining the Peace Corps. As a PCV I'd like to teach maths or sciences, and then from there I'd probably want to attend either physics graduate school or law school, depending on whether I go the physics academic or human rights advocate path.

I have certain moral and philosophical notions. I have no idea how to translate them into a career and lifestyle in which I won't hate myself.

This is mainly a reflection of public health policies and attitudes which manifest themselves through the mentally ill and drug users being incarcerated.

"*lose weight in 2008! bestlife diet.*"I don't think it is a very good argument. If you accept that a fetus is a person, then it would be unethical to detach yourself from that person, if you know it would cause their death? If you are not obligated to provide a fetus with a uterus, and may cut it out knowing that it would result in the death of the fetus, then what is the difference between that, and waiting until the kid is born to toss it into the dumpster? It is crucial, when forming an argument against pro-lifers, not to accept the premise that a fetal life is equal to an adult one.Your post is already dismantled in the article.  The fetus had no right to make the attachment in the first place.The fetus has no rights, period. It's a parasite and a non-human one at that. It's not even human, let alone an individual, let alone a person.

Some morons think that DNA is the sine qua non of humanity. If that were true then chimps are mostly human and parasitic cancers are also human.

If you can't abort a fetus then you can't have surgery to take out a tumour or have any other kind of cancer therapy.

The notion that a fetus is the kind of thing that rights attach to is absurd. Nevermind the fetus' attachment.

I think the law should enforce non-hypocrisy. Anti-abortionists should be denied cancer treatments and also abortions.*clap clap clap clap clap* Fencing in housing structures so that the world will not see your poor, Yeah I would call that deteriorating human rights.Advocates for social darwinism need to watch this.Where do these rights come from?  Youtube?  

This video is arbitrary and based on nothing.  The right to privacy?  What does that even mean?  Was I born with an innate right to privacy?  Or did it come when I entered the social contract?  

I think they should stick to talking about Natural Law, as opposed to human rights.  And Natural Law doesn't come with 20 statutes.  So yeah, in a perfect world all of the items on that list would be great, but it's not realistic in practice today, nor does this video state the intellectual grounds for which these rights exist.  This list of thirty rights is arbitrary, inaccurate, anglo-euro-western centric and contains many "position statements" rather than rights.

Summary: not very well done; verging on useless.3/4 of all the shit in your house is made in Chinese sweatshops. Don't pretend like you didn't know. It takes one lousy children's toy to get you outraged? The solution is simple. Stop buying shit. Tell the kids, "NO."Fuck China.  I fucking hate that piece of shit country.  It makes me really reconsider my anti-neoconservative views when I think of the kind of depravity promoted in countries that do not promote the rule of law (and yes, the US does promote the rule of law).

Thank God for the ACLU.How dumb are H&amp;M? Asides from the right for the child to be fed, how many high profile 'some idiot attacks a mother for breastfeeding and gets their arse handed to them' stories have there been in the last decade?Actually the article supports the idea that sex work should be legalised and regulated like any other profession - where violence and coercion are illegal.Damn dirty Christians!  Won't they just go the hell away and leave the world alone.  Maybe call their god and ask them to come pick them up in his spaceship and go back to their home world.Easier said than done.  I would love to never by shit that says "made in china" again, but the high cost of living in the US makes places like Wal Mart mandatory, as well other discount big boxes.

This will never stop unless the US companies tell them to do so.Keyword is "near."You sir, are correct. It is also backed by a god awful rendition of "All Along the Watchtower".I can't believe the illustrator didn't notice those obvious spelling errors denoted by the red squigglies.Where to these people get their acid and bomb making materials and AK-47s? They live in the dirt and have nothing...perhaps because of how they treat women? They waste half of their society's  talent.It is easy to pretend this doesn't matter, but when we buy these products we are playing a role in these conflicts.This is a joke, right?

These aren't even rights. They are restrictions.

"Don't discriminate."
How did that give me a right? Sounds like it took something away. Ditto with "No Slavery." So at what point does a fetus stop being a parasite, and start being a human child? At what point does it stop being part of a woman's body and start being a separate body attached by a tube? The question is, when you're lying on that table, and the doctor removes a dead organism from your vagina and places it on the table, will you look at it and think "parasite" or will you think "child"? 

I personally believe that all pro-choicers want is to be able to have unprotected sex without consequences. "Choice" is not a human right, but life is. Nobody forced you to have sex, nobody forced you to do so without protection, and nobody is keeping you from putting your baby up for adoption. Choice my ass...Yeah well, as a foreigner, I think it's all pretty hypocrite.. so this is something that you guys all defend, but when Janet Jackson suddenly shows a little nipple the whole nation is in panic ?

It both features boobs, yet one is a human right to perform in public, and the other is strictly forbidden to perform in public ?it seems nbc deleted this...very curiousthis comment sums up quite abit:
&gt; Women.  In chains.  Being forced to bear children. 

&gt; This is the United States.

-Amanda Marcotte The janet jackson event occurred in the US, this was in CanadaThe state of Texas likes to execute people, especially if the person being executed did not anything worth being executed for.

I am curious why Texas does not execute child sex offenders or repeat rapists.  Boy rape is just a slap on the wrist there.

I used to live in Texas and seriously, avoid that shithole state at all costs if you can.  Not only does it execute people like diabetics pop M&amp;M's, the police departments can murder with impunity &amp; at will, for anything.And they wonder why men don't want to be teachers anymore.

Hrm.  I wonder.&gt; At what point does it stop being part of a woman's body and start being a separate body

Gee, I don't fucking know. Could it be when it's SEPARATE?

&gt; "Choice" is not a human right, but life is. 

You have no fucking clue how human rights work. They don't adhere to animals, plants, rocks or non-humans for one thing. So in particular, they don't attach to you since you don't possess the intellectual capacities of a moral being. What you possess are merely quasi-rights granted by us humans because it would make us squirm to see you tortured. That's it.Eyewitness testimony is shockingly unreliable, certainly even moreso coming from young children. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WitnessThe kicker is that dolls, which are supposed to make children's testimony more reliable, make it less so. Children can't handle dual representation - that a doll is both itself and represents something else. When you tell them that a doll is them and then ask them questions about it, they can't remember that the doll is supposed to be them. Yet another triumph for criminal "science".I gotta wonder, personally, where that five-year-old learned what rape is. I suspect either he was abused by a family member, or he was subjected to an over-zealous speech from a parent about, "And if an adult EVER touches you when you don't want to be touched it is RAPE and you MUST tell an adult!"Also, I don't think the whole nation actually was in a panic.  I think most people wondered what the big deal was while the FCC and a couple repressed middle-aged parents screeched to the high heavens about it while the media pretended that it was some major moral issue.Its bullshit like this which would make me walk away from a lost child. Helping a kid isn't worth being prison raped for a decade before I kill myself.What can ya say?

Lawyers are sharks, by and large.  Their capacity for uber-orwellian plays on words is astounding, as well as their ability to leech of the sentiment "Oh please, won't somebody think of the KIDS?"

At least they're sharks when it comes to disbelieving adult women and believing male children.they just get a little more [sharky](http://www.mediaradar.org/alert20080805.php) when prosecuting accused males than when a prosecuting accused females.&gt;"Every public school needs effective methods of discipline, but beating kids teaches violence and it doesn't stop bad behavior," said Alice Farmer, Aryeh Neier Fellow at Human Rights Watch and the ACLU, and author of the report.

Absolutely true. It encourages them to hide offending behavior. It teaches them to be secretive to avoid punishment.I've been following this story and the whole thing makes me sick to my stomach. &gt;What you possess are merely quasi-rights granted by us humans because it would make us squirm to see you tortured.

Wouldn't that be ethics, by your definition?Me too, paraplegics are disgusting!Obviously this writer has never been to Texas.

It's not hinted there.China is like an awkward teenager. It likes anything that's shiny and is embarrassed easily.You're right that ethics generates rights. In the case of ethics these would be generated from the magical thinkers' ability to kill rationalists and the need of rationalists to make nice as a consequence. In the case of quasi-rights, these are generated from the psychological damage caused to a full human by witnessing the violation of a being that is superficially like themselves. The moral human ethics can be less or more than quasi-rights depending on circumstances. For instance, if moral humans came to have overwhelming possession of AI and nanotech then the ethics would disappear.This was not prosecutorial zeal, this was prosecutorial misconduct.A tremendous number of people either don't believe that prison is a rape-culture or they enjoy the idea of the existence of such a place, each in his own twisted way (feelings of punishment, vicarious titillation, etc).Maybe the pansy NYC protesters will see this and realize their place is not within a free speech cage.... you need a permit to march?They want an end to benefits for veterans too?Yes, you do. It disrupts traffic.I wish I wasn't at work right now, I could be there in an hour. Plus... If I was arrested I would lose my security clearance. Damn responsibilities... :(The submission does not seem to be a linkjack of the article you've posted.

Notice, the submission is written in first person, from somebody who says they are witnessing it.

There is a difference between being glib, or unoriginal, even cheap... and linkjacking.  This isn't it.  This submission does not so much as try to paraphrase the article you've linked.


Do not slander submissions by erroneous accusations of linkjacking. This is a warning. (I'm a moderator)There's just something so skeevy about a human rights organization of some kind being fronted on the internet by a fucking beauty product company.That parent isn't over-zealous, that parent is correct, given that the child knew what kind of boundaries the touching was referring to.&gt; At least they're sharks when it comes to disbelieving adult women and believing male children.

Is that how you were hurt?I am surprised by the following provision -

&gt; Provisions of the Pakistani law also allow the next of kin of the victim to forgive the murderer in exchange for money. And most of the offenders continue to use this clause to escape punishment.
Headline is misleading, he's facing the death penalty for a felony murder conviction. Hell, even the article is misleading, it makes a big todo about how he wasn't the one who actually pulled the trigger when that is essentiallty completely immaterial.

Not that I agree with the State of Texas' stance, but If they think felony murder shouldn't qualify as a death penalty case, they should just say that, instead of muddying the case.Any sources on this besides the blog? That's completely absurd! Are school officials really such androids that they can't summon the empathy to make a special exception?&gt;Dale has had objects thrown at his head and has been verbally taunted by other children...

Kids can be such heartless little bastards. This is America. Of course they are.I agree on principle but must point out the school is in the UK.What they need to do is to say, "Ok, this fellow is obviously physically handicapped, let's make an exception for him," and then second, they need to give everyone who threw something at him or hit him a Singapore-style caning.yes, that's true"the bio parent and second parent can have a relationship that isn’t romantic at all…like two sisters who adopted together in Maryland"

Uh? Source? I didn't find anything when searching the googles.umm.  didnt he kill someone?  whats the problem?omfg. sometimes I wonder how people can sell "God" anymore. Then I see shit like this and it makes me realize,  they cant.

If this is the shit churches peddle these days. We need less of these biblethumpingfucktards in the world.  Please someone put these sheeple out of their deluded misery.That made me itchI first saw it this morning, and it's only now that I realise who the guy in the middle looks like.

It also doesn't mention rape in male prisons.

This submission is appropriate for the HRW subreddit b/c it applies to a loss of fundamental rights for all persons who are oppressed under Sharia Law, be they atheists, Christians, Buddhists, or even other Muslims, or anything else.This would have been a very impressive stance.

Ridiculous.To protect the wealthy from the rest of you, of course.And for those of you wondering why this all matters -- not an unusual question -- I'll add:


The Senate stripped the president of authority to do this.  He is ignoring statute.


You might wonder why he would be interested.  That is because the president has direct executive authority, as commander in chief, over the military; whereas state and local police forces are answerable to and derive their authority from their state statutes and judiciaries.  So this *looks* like a harmless melding of military and police functions, but in fact the only reason one would want to do it is a very, very bad one.abrahamic religious bias, of courseWe've been smurfed!For your protection, citizen.  Now pick up that can.In all of these carnivals, how many articles deal with sexual violence against men?my knuckle dusters take care of that for me.Why don't you try reading through all of them before you ask that question?  There are several.

And I've explained this to you before.  If you would just find the gumption submit a competent$ post or two for submission for the next carnival, it would be published.  But you never even try.

There's no MRA articles because you assholes are excluding yourselves from these carnivals by not submitting, and alienating every article contained within.

There are fewer male-victim oriented posts because there are less problems with adult male sexual violence that aren't better suited for an LGBT carnival or a jail-rape centered theme.

Wow, America is a real hellhole, isn't it? Srsly, this shit is scary as fuck!The thing that amazes me is that you did not register this username specifically to post that comment.Great... now if someone turns off the lights and does not answer the door on halloween then people will think he/she is a sex offender. 



Some sex offenders are not allowed to come within certain distances of a child. They could get in some serious trouble if a child were to come up to the door.This is all too believable.  I've worked in the criminal courts for a while; I've seen serious cases of child molestation; and I have yet to see even one case of the kind that exists in the popular imagination: the wild-eyed child molester lurking in the bushes, near the playground, or waiting eagerly for some group of trick-or-treaters.  


The vast majority of child sexual abuse occurs within families and acquaintance groups, and the horrible truth is that most families well know that they have a creep in their midst.  Of course, after something horrible happens this can never be said out loud.  Why do families knowingly keep dangerous people around their children?  In every case I've seen, economic and social desperation.  Usually, the offender is a man on whom the more vulnerable family members are economically dependent, so they turn a blind eye or tell the kids to shut up.  They could leave, but they'd be homeless and/or without any real prospects for remaining in the community.  Solve that with a fucking pumpkin sticker.  These legislative stunts, including 1000-foot rules, colored license plates, etc., display, at best, abysmal failure to understand the problem, and at worst, craven political demagoguery.  Indeed, this sort of excommunication makes desperate families *less* likely to risk seeking help from authorities.  What a shame.Great post!I'm tired of this nanny-stateism.  One used to be able to hide razor blades inside apples without so much as a slap on the wrist!Does this include all the girls who were charged with sex-offender crimes for taking naked pictures of themselves while they were under 18?

I'm really glad we're wasting time and money protecting our children from people like that.Love that random crack at the end at Muslims by that doctor. Sorry bub, Muslims are allowed abortions within the first trimester *and a half*, roughly 120 days. Not to mention in cases of rape, incest, or developmental defects in the baby... the nuances of which some Muslim women physicians I know are helping research at this very moment. In fact, one of them that I last spoke to on the subject was specifically writing something about the very defects this woman's fetus had.

Aside from that, interesting read. Haven't heard things from the perspective of a woman in this situation before.As a recent father to a healthy boy, that article scared the living shit out of me.  I have no idea how I would have handled that.  I presume much like her husband did: stoically until you're finally alone and then simply fall apart at the seams and then pick yourself back up again.  It would be hell.  But the alternative would be no better.  In the long term, it would probably a lot worse.

I can't say I'd ever heard of what I would term a "valid" reason for this, but this clearly is it (so says another Catholic father).  I've always said "health of the mother, mental and physical" was my only ethical exception, and I think the health of the mother after a decade of taking care of that child would certainly be impacted enough to qualify.  I can only hope I'd be strong enough to agree to it, myself.so, like, most people?Hopefully this leads to some interesting discussion.  I'll start off:

I would support the ban, but the problem with laws is that they are usually implemented either/or.  Meaning that a good parent who just slaps their two-year old once, lightly, in a Toys 'R Us could be liable for jail, which just reeks of a over-coddled (or over-intrusive) police state.  It's not like there aren't child support services as it is.Your title is misleading and sensationalist and has a typo down mod for youIt doesn't help that the article was posted by the beeb in 2004.what? take a vaccine from the same people who intentionally let syphillis ravage a community whilst intentionally withholding treatment,and feeding special ed kids radioactive oatmeal for studies?  those guys?Actually, I kind of wanted the HPV Vaccine, can guys get it now? From what I remember, only girls could.Why, exactly, do you want it? Are you really concerned about being a carrier? The strains of HPV the virus protects against don't cause substantial harm to men. If you're just thinking about your future mates, then cheers. Dear UN, 

Fuck you.

Sincerely,

AmericaBaah, that's old timers' crap. You mean take a vaccine from the people actively researching a biological 'race bomb' and who've airdusted anthrax over a population center just to see what would happen.yep. exactly. so if you were to ask me if I trust these guys, the answer is absolutely not.This is big news for China, where people DON'T EVEN KNOW HE EXISTS. So the Chinese government are going to have a job censoring him. If he gets the Nobel Peace Prize, they won't be able to keep it under wraps. 

Fingers crossed! First the Chinese have to know he exists, then they can ask questions as to why he is in jail...I was thinking avoiding bumps on my dangly bits.Interesting how the wording shifts the emphasis from the strikers to the guards, as though they are the most important feature of the event.Rape is only acceptable if the individual being raped actually deserved it.  Take as an example the Enron executives, or several members of the current presidential administration.  Also, people who deem it OK to harass and attack others based on sexual orientation or race.actually that's lower than the us, because they said here one out of every 5 women will be sexually assaulted in her lifetime, putting it at about ~20 percent.  scary shit.  I think that 16 percent is an exceptionally conservative estimate though.And then liberals exclaim about how quaint black Africa and its traditional religions are. We Are The World, One Human Race type shit.20% per lifetime was the figure one or two generations ago. The modern rate is lower than 6%. Rape is disappearing with the advent of pornography.

You are a fucking idiot if you think for even one second that the chances of being raped in the USA are higher than in the Congo. Kill yourself. Kill yourself now.no, what im saying is that the statistic in the article was wrong.20% in 1973, 6% in 2005

http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/18/opinion/op-males18

Furthermore, the statistic in the article is not "wrong", it's ambiguous. Nobody said it was a lifetime risk!wow, 20% down to 6?  what happened?  I mean its positive change, its just amazing that it dropped so sharply that's like .75% per yearPornography happened. Why go out to rape someone when you can jerk off to a DVD of a woman getting raped? I've got a couple articles on that too.At least they're consistent.Consistently moronic. In fact, liberals which is a right-wing ideology are anything BUT consistent.I didn't realize we were discussing politics.Liberals are the type of morons that would hug a bear. In fact ...interesting.I'm not really following you.There is nothing distinguishing liberals from conservatives economically or ideologically. Both of them believe in capitalism and that's that. There is however a lot to distinguish them socially. And that's because conservatives are more knee-jerk traditional and liberals are knee-jerk 'hug the bear' crazies. Whether the bear is a totalitarian dictatorship like the USSR or primitive savages like black Africans or a literal bear like the bear that ate Treadwell. Neither of them is operating on reason, facts and logic. Both of them are operating on pure instinct. It's just that one's instinct is to destroy a threat while the others' instinct is to martyrize himself. Sadist vs Masochist, that's really all there is to it. And neither of them is any more or less consistent than the other.except that women are a little more human than men (not much; just enough)Women are more average than men so they don't encompass the whole diversity that men are capable of. Which means that women are LESS human than men.I'm so sick of the same tired picture of putting an X with tape across someone's lips.but men are bigger than women and, as we have seen, the human body is comprised of almost as much nonhuman tissue (bacteria, virii, and other microorgansims) as actual human tissue.  Men have more mass, so they have more nonhuman tissue, so they are clearly less human.

plus they have that hangie-down part that scares women and children.The article contains not one whit of evidentiary support for its patently superstitious anti-semetic claim.  Not one of the many reputable NGOs operating in the Middle East has documented a form of child slavery so large the author would have us believe it is responsible for a measurably declining population of Iraqi children?  This is an outrageous submission, and the submitter should be embarrassed.I think you should read this pamphlet I read....what was it's name again...oh yes ' The protocols of the Elders of Zion'...And told his story, he apparently did. Get to read it in this article, I did not. Sadness, it now consumes me.So, I'm a boring straight guy, and I have Reddit anonymity, so I'll ask the question nobody can in polite company:



Is this horrifying figure a consequence of a particular dangerous behavior: misleading naive male suitors as to one's biological gender? 


The article, which was a good read, actually says little about the genesis and circumstances of crimes against transsexuals.  [By no means to I mean to suggest those crimes are justifiable or even understandable; but I'm curious to know if the stereotypical hypothesis is the empirically accurate one.]

 I hate it that you got downvoted for asking a question.  

I would be interested in that statistic as well; are they being murdered just for being different, or because they were hiding their true self out of fear either fear or perhaps just out of the idea that they don't feel they're really hiding anything?  

And like you said; a reason for a crime doesn't mean that reason is justified, it's just interesting to know the reasons.  Thanks.  Somebody actually went through my history and downmodded several pages.  Flattering they'd take the time.  I'm not sure it was for this, as I said something unkind about Ron Paul this morning.  :)That sucks.  It happens to all of us now and then.  I can only speak for the transsexuals that I know well enough to speak for. One is a friend of eleven years, another my hairdresser that I've seen every six weeks for the last five years and is in my neighborhood so I stop to chat often and lastly, someone I used to be very close to in college but now our relationship is relegated to holiday wishes and the occasional email. 

None of the three are fully passable as women and only one is post-op. What is clear is that all three have a strong sense of self as a transsexuals, not as women born women.  As I sit here, I grapple with what to say because there are so many contradictions. Living in a predominately gay neighborhood I meet a lot of intersex people and know just how diverse a small community can be.  You've got male to females that pass as women, you've got male to females that that only define themselves as trannies...  You got the woman that manages the building next to mine that has been living as a woman for 30 years, not exactly passable but more of a woman than most in this neighborhood and so respected that goddamn you even thing of questioning... There are people that were born male, lived as a women for years and now as a man again.  You've got men that just fucking like makeup and and lingerie.  There's grandmas and saucy little thangs.  I guess what it boils down to is that while there definitely have been cases of transsexual's conning straight men into sex; Saying that it's predominant is just like assuming all men are pigs or all church goers are religious zealot's. There's too much diversity, even among a niche culture, to claim absolutes.  My guess is that most crimes like the what you describe hit the news pretty fast.  So the fact that you don't really read about it often probably gives you your answer.
Actually it was probably of no consequence, because Reddit's algorithm cancels out the votes of anyone who seems to be maliciously downvoting everything by a particular user.Thanks for your thoughtful reply.  I know almost nothing about transsexual life, but have a (principally lawyerly) interest in the way we approach crimes of sexual violence and hate crimes legislatively -- hence the original question about the genesis of the violence.


I should clarify: I am confident that most transsexuals do not con straight men into sex; rather, my question is whether such a sexual deception, *even if attempted only by a small subset of all transsexuals*, is not still the dominant precipitant of homicides with transsexual victims.  That is, if transsexuals are murdered at an alarming rate relative to the general population, do we know whether this results from lifestyle, generalized hate and fear toward the group, or one very specific and uniquely dangerous behavior?

Edit: I should explain why this matters.  If it's the first option, it's a public health problem; if it's the second option, it's a criminal justice and general tolerance problem; if it's the third option, it's all of those, but perhaps remediable by safety education among the transsexual community.Weird.  I did not know that.  I've noticed that if I say something particularly irritating to certain groups (usually, this involves taunting Paulites, or suggesting that the Tenth Amendment is not the answer to all political questions), huge swaths of months-old comments will lose a point.  I always assumed this was someone uniquely vindictive, and very willing to click.  I've noticed this phenomenon maybe four or five times.  Maybe I deserve it!Hmm comments might be different, but your submissions are safe due to the Reddit algorithm.12 a year, out of what - 30,000+ murders? doesn't sound like a lot to me. there's an influx of people that come to our neighborhood to go to the bars, club, eat at the "chic" restaurants.... Many of them come because it's a hell of a lot of fun and some come to see how the other half live; be a part of the deviance for a night.  But there are also the ones that come to bash or the ones with ulterior motives.  Man, I can't count the times that someone drives by a [pick a slur] and yells such out their window and then the person who was verbally attacked comes back with a [pick a slur]and you think, oh fuck, someones gonna get hurt and it's probably not gonna be the guys who started it.  Gay's put up with a lot and have a lot of hurdles to overcome to find peace in this world. That's why when they finally get a sense of self and become happy with who they are, they're not quiet about it. The parades, the marches, the flagrant in you face homosexuality and dykiness... this is reaction and anger for the angst that one has to endure to get to where they are and it's a happiness and celebration for finally saying "hey, I'm not hiding and I'm going to try to claim the what I deserve"  Unfortunately, a typical gay person will act the same when being attacked and turning the situation into a dangerous one, perpetuating violence.  My girlfriend and I (I'm a lesbian) will be out at night and witness (usually college kids) yelling slurs only to see some lone (drag queen/king, tranny, inter, twink, etc....) yell back and literally invite violence.  You think "shut the fuck up and ignore them" but you know it's also a sense of pride. gmcg, you wonder if the murder of transsexuals that con straight men into sex is a rising trend, or the percentage of transsexuals that con straight men into sex compared to the population of transsexuals in whole. I would suggest removing the "con straight men into sex" equation and take a closer look at what you have left.  I have a feeling that the "con straight men into sex" part of it may be a lesser plea to something larger.  Who's to say that many of the straight men may have copped the same plea to cover up marriage infidelity, their ashamedness for gay bashing, rejection or something else. Edit* gmcg you get upvotes from me because you're truly asking a valid question and if even a handful of people in this world asked these questions it would help bridge cultural gaps and make the world a better place. I have some of the same questions and frustrated that I truly do not know the answers and myself may be afraid to ask. Good thing you didn't say something bad about Obama. Last time I did that my submission time got extended so that I had to wait 18 minutes between my posts. "the third option, it's all of those, but perhaps remediable by safety education among the transsexual community"  I think it's safe to say so.Your right in a general sense, but compared to the overall population of transsexuals, it's big.  You read a lot about mothers murdering their children, but compared to the overall population of mothers and children, it will fall on a similar or even smaller scale that that of transsexuals. Psychologists and prosecutors and most involved will give much more time and money to the research of mothers killing children and topics like the one above go largely ignored.  That is was is being brought to light here. Sounds a little crazy...If the citizens of a country are going to demand strong state welfare programs, it is entirely reasonable for the state to be involved in decisions regarding reproduction.Unfortunately, the more clowns you bring in to this circus, the more screwed up things become.  Definitely entertaining though!they are fighting largely over coltan.  its terrible that people keep falling for the same exploitative tricks time and time again.  after they are finished killing each other, the brits and dutch will go and scoop up what's left when there's nobody left to defend it.What does "performing sex acts in front of guards" even mean?Jerking off in their cells.
And often enough they do it just to delay a cell raid, so it's not like it's going to surprise anybody in the prison.I'd rather just go naked and get thrown in solitary.

The headline made me think the guards were forcing prisoners to perform sex acts, then making them wear the jumpsuits so they would get assaulted and the guards could watch and wager.I've seen LGBTQ before - what does the I stand for?FTA: intersexual.

This, he told me, was religious discrimination.  I told him, in the kindest way possible, to think seriously about what he had just told me.  When he still felt he should sue, I told him, in the kindest way possible, to fuck himself, which of course is what a court would have told him thousands of dollars and many months later.  I'm not sure why the concept is lost on Republicans.I dont know what you all are so pissed off about, buy stock in us health ins. companies and get Canadian citizenship so you can get real healthcare.This seems like a good place to relate my story about meeting Dennis Kucinich and his wife.

I heard through the grapevine during the DNC that he'd be making an appearance at a local dive bar to greet his supporters. Nothing was publicized-- he just wanted to do something nice for the people who care about his causes but weren't privileged to be inside the Pepsi Center and see him speak.

So, of course I went, and the place was packed. Standing room only, just a big party, mostly middle aged hippies. There were a few young people, too, and one couple with a huge "Impeach Bush" sign that I totally loved. He and Elizabeth showed up just slightly late, and were immediately mobbed. He shook my hand, let me take a picture of him (sadly, the one of me with him didn't come out), and answered a question from me.

Dennis was having fun and would probably have happily stayed all night, but Elizabeth finally intervened, swept through the crowd, and dragged him out by the elbow so they wouldn't miss their Willie Nelson concert.

FSM bless Dennis Kucinich. Truly a fine man.

Who would say that neglect isn't child abuse?I have encountered many people who believe 'neglect' refers to minor incidents like 'neglecting to pay attention' to a child who desires comforting. 

I haven't met many people who take neglect seriously. And it's mostly women I've heard speak out **against** taking neglect seriously. Well that's certainly not "neglect" in the way that you can get in big trouble for it.How does one prove that they are gay?they shouldn't have to, how does on prove they are jewish?  if they are being discriminated based on sexual orientation regardless of what they are they should be helped.o'rly?  im tired of these bullshit studies, I think more focus should go into helping people rather than checking to see if a problem that everybody knows exists actually exists.You cant scare people into taking their money out of the bank.

It's my understanding that valporate, like lithium, is commonly given in conjunction with birth control because of the high risk to the fetus if pregnancy occurs. Everyone taking it already knows not to get pregnant on the stuff so the study is a bunch of alarmism over nothing.
Which is the other reason it pisses me off.  That Group loves alarmism, and if things go the way they want it to go, there are going to be a lot of people with seizure disorders scrambling to find new medications.  Kind of like [Ralph Nader/Public Citizen and the ban on Cylert](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/007140.html).Likely, because they haven't learned their place.  


I know that sounds wrong but bear with me a minute.  A formal journalist is usually trained in a few different colleges and understudies at a few papers.  They have seen people lose their job, lose their "journalistic credibility" and so on for minor infractions.  An online journalist may have the same moral fortitude as any other journalist, but, has no one to answer to but themselves and therefore doesn't need to care what happens to the fledgling blog they started.  They have no editor or owner to answer to and they can go to print with one source.So how does this relate to, you know, jailing them? How do you get from there to here? Are you saying they somehow deserve this for not "knowing their place"?In the next unit, we will discuss sample bias.It sounds like the place you are talking of is one of avoiding difficult truths, becouse that's what most of these people look like they are in jail for, mostly in China and other repressive counties, by the article. They are working on line becouse print is completely down-trodden.  So, are you suggesting that a journalist's place is to only tell the government sanctioned truth?Yes. And that's why it's a morally bankrupt profession. Structurally bankrupt.I am stating that they wouldn't be in jail if they knew how to cleverly cover their tracks or have people to back them up.  They may have said damn the results and went ahead and printed what they did knowing they would be jailed, but, I doubt it.Freedom, if you can hide and defend yourself. Nice.Lot of good they're doing in jail.  If you are in a repressive regime don't make it easy for them to arrest, imprison or execute you.  Though I can't point to research, I'd venture to guess that there is an elevated risk of abuse for all mentally challenged or ill kids.  First, we should be so lucky as to have only a 1% abuse rate among non-autistic children.  Would that it were.



Second, I suspect that elevated abuse of autistic children is a function of the excruciating frustration of being unable to communicate with a child, combined with the haunting feeling, unique to autism, that "there's someone in there."


Finally, though, I don't agree with the blanket attacks on all critics of the autism "epidemic."  It takes nothing away from the suffering of classically autistic children and their families to admit that this is a paper epidemic, created by diagnostic substitution.  Disabilities like "pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified" are now considered "autistic spectrum disorders."  That sort of diagnostic creep deserves criticism and even ridicule.  It is unfortunate that classically autistic children and their families feel attacked by this sort of thing, but as with the thimerosal debate, we have to look at facts and get people away from the identity-based siege mentality that too often mobilizes autism activists....for which the US has no respect whastoeverI think it's pretty legal.This is gayThere's a reason I moderate this subreddit and you don't, pn6.

Ugh.  It's MRA's who are full of lies, lies, lies.  We don't do anything like that and you know it.

&gt;From the faulty premise that women do not lie about rape

**We don't say that!!**

&gt;follow the equally faulty but still widely accepted premises that there is no such thing as a false rape claim

**We don't say that!!**

&gt;&gt;…in 18.3 % cases to be precise, rape is used as a weapon to malign and attempt revenge, found a group of psychologists who assist Delhi Police in investigating sexual assault allegations.

Delhi?  India?

There's only 2% false rape reports in the United States, assholes.

You are _lying_.  You are just fucking lying.

Ban hammer, come on down!As I don't live in India, I'm not that all that worried over what the rate of false rape accusation there is.

But I do object to your use of this 2% figure.  Is this from a peer-reviewed journal?  Of course we know that it isn't.

There aren't a wealth of studies in a career-killer topic like this, but the two that we do have from the United States are telling.  There is the study done by the Air Force in 1985, in which 556 accusations of rape were examined.  Of these cases, 27% of the accusers admitted that they had lied. *(1)*  And then there is Prof. Eugene Kanin's 9-year study in a Midwestern town, over which period, of 109 cases, some 41 percent of them recanted their allegations, followed by detailed explanations of why they lied. *(2)*

Aerik, cough up the source for your 2% figure, and give me a good reason why we should trot it out instead of the results of peer-reviewed research or I will declare you the liar.


1)- McDowell, Charles P., Ph.D. "False Allegations." Forensic Science Digest, (publication of the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations), Vol. 11, No. 4 (December 1985), p. 64.

 2)- Kanin, Eugene J., Ph.D. "False Rape Allegations." Archives of Sexual Behavior, Vol. 23, No. 1 (1994), pp 81-92.Read the Greer law review article cited in the piece: he traces the two percent claim to its origins and finds that it is without factual support. Explain how that is wrong, please. Your comment is the literary equivalent of stomping your foot and rolling your eyes. Nobody is persuaded.Studies don't count kids in that total who never have any reason to be involved with mandatory reporters.  Therefore the 1% figure is likely to be low.

As autistic kids are going to have all sorts of mandatory reporters around, such as doctors, psychologists, social workers... this doesn't surprise me.  If I was paraded in front of those people every other day growing up, I wouldn't be surprised if my mother eventually got accused of something like negligence, such as the time that she got confused about what day I had a field trip and wasn't there to pick me up one day after school.

So I can believe that a study would come up with 20%.  The actual rate whatever it is, could certainly be greater than the population-wide rate.  But I bet it's in the single digits.Some lizards will, when you grab their tail, detach their tail and scurry to safety. Which leaves you shocked, confused, and holding a severed tail.

Three cheers for Whole Foods Market stepping up to pledge to only buy tomatoes from farms which meet good labor standards.Actually I get/see a lot of sites about how incredible the buildings in Dubai are, and every time I just feel the need to comment "Yeah, slavery will get anything done, great monuments were built by slaves, but that was hundreds or thousands of years ago!!!"[Here](http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Slave-Labour-In-Dubais-Building-Boom/Article/20070841281723?lpos=Home_Article_Related_Content_Region_2&amp;lid=ARTICLE_1281723_Slave_Labour_In_Dubais_Building_Boom)  is something to get you started One more: [We need slaves to build monuments](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/08/middleeast.construction)One of the great American diseases in the past few years is this idea that rights, including individual rights or basic human rights, apply only to citizens of the United States, because our Constitution somehow bestows them upon us (a twisted and corrupt way of looking at the American tradition in itseld).  It is the logic used for renditions, and/or the treatment of prisoners in foreign countries.

And here again, judging from some comments I've read on this situation, we have the same thing -- that these people somehow deserve it because they're here illegally in many or most cases.

It's amazing how much of what we buy is produced in unjust conditions.  This is obviously a special case since it is happening in the United States.

Speaking only for me personally, I don't want any part of it.  But try getting the average American consumer to alter their buying habits even slightly for any reason.  Money runs the world; this much is true.  I can only imagine the power we could wrest from those in charge if we began spending our money strategically.

In a way, though, this is an old story.  And there but for the grace of God and all of that.  The dehumanization of these people is reprehensible.

Pastures of plenty...And the lifestyle you're accustom to living isn't supported by virtual slaves?  Who built the infrastructure?  Do you check where all your clothing/electronics come from?  [How about your food](http://www.gourmet.com/magazine/2000s/2009/03/politics-of-the-plate-the-price-of-tomatoes)?  Face it; out of almost 7 billion people, about a billion live on less than $1/day.  

And it's a moot point; Dubai has shut down all construction.  I just moved to Dubai, you get over the whole exploitative slave-like labour thing pretty quickly when you start living the good lifestyle.


I'm enjoying it while it lasts!The working conditions of the Indian laborers are bad but by no means slavery. They come to Dubai by their own choice and they make several times what they'd be earning in India. Yes they are treated like shit and housed in box-sized apartments but slavery it is not."They are treated like shit and housed in box-sized apartments"

"Slaver it is not"

How did these two phrases end up in the same sentence?Dubai also threatens to prosecute minors who are gang-raped. http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/31/africa/dubai.phpSlavery is about having the option to leave.  Some of these people don't sound like they have that option.  Just because it is retched living conditions does not imply slavery.  Some slaves, historical or otherwise, have been treated well, yet that in no way justifies slavery. The _African_ victims and their relatives called Amnesty so go fuck yourself. Stone chuckers and witch burners don't get a say.Go crawl back under your rock you racist fuck.not long ago you guys were burning witches too, so shove it.Not long ago? What the fuck? The Salem witch trials were over 300 THREE HUNDRED years ago and they didn't even _involve_ witch burning. No-one in America or Europe who is alive today was ever involved in government sanctioned witch-hunts or witch-burning.

Grow up and grow your fucking witch burning country up.When it comes to witch burning, your technically correct, even considering the odd case of Helen Ducan. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Duncan

You say it has been 300 years since the west has been involved in government sanctioned witch-hunts?

There have been "metaphorical" which hunts a-plenty, against atheists, gays, and supposed communists,  any and many "alternative" life style communities have been targeted, from communism to christian militia compounds, from atheists to medical marijuana proponents.

I corresponded with a redditor last week who pulled her children from public school, because, to paraphrase her words, a priest came into the school, accused them of being witch's, and told them they where going to hell. This was Arkansas.

This all catches my attention more, for that i practice an earth-based four directional naturalistic/taoist energetic way, (as in, yay, I'm a witch)

I'm also keen on the [Psychonautical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonaut) 

So this combination, telling people they are witches then giving them poisonous hallucinogenics wile beating them/holding them captive!!!

That's a recipe for annihilation of person hood, this is some seriously imbalanced magic  going on here, and it's the aggressors that are wielding thier will as a weapon. &gt; There have been "metaphorical" which hunts a-plenty, against atheists, gays, and supposed communists, any and many "alternative" life style communities have been targeted, from communism to christian militia compounds, from atheists to medical marijuana proponents.

[Bill Hicks: Religion](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=bill+hicks+religion)Apply corrective rape where it belongs - to white-collar criminals!How about "End Rape in South Africa"? With over 50 thousand reported cases and another 450 thousand estimated each year, rape is a huge problem. Writing letters to the president won't do much of difference when you have generations of South African's in poverty and without any education. It will take a long time to overcome the effects of the apartheid era.&gt; he elite, who have hollowed out the democratic system to serve the corporate state, rule through image and presentation. 

We have a 'conspiracy' subreddit for these things.I don't know about that.  They've been pretty obvious/obtuse about just handing money to various corporations the last 30 years (not to mention recent events).

And then there's this thing called "Public Relations" that takes care of the image and presentation part.

That statement is mostly true.  The only argument you can have is what exactly 'hollowed out' means (and to what extent does something become hollowed out rather than not) in this context.  We still elect officials - it's true.  But they MUST go through the hoops of one of two parties.  One that is completely for the corporate elite and one that is begrudgingly so.Great article. 

I don't want to sound negative but morally nihilistic self-interest, greed and measuring of one's success only by material wealth are as old as humanity itself.

I agree that education is not about 'getting a job'. Science students should take courses on arts &amp; humanities, and vice versa. However, somehow, I don't think that a more varied education can fix the problem. 

Maybe it needs to start at home, where the idea of 'sacred' spaces and actions is created and nurtured. The idea of inter-dependence and happiness without material wealth. 

It will take generations to change things. Better education is a start, though. She knew already.Democrats: They stand or "nothing" and believe in "nothing".Well, they certainly are spineless, but that is better than standing for hypocrisy, greed, fear, and deceit while also believing and acting on delusions.You mean the Democrats?He criticises Bush and then turns around when he thinks no one is looking and does what Bush did. Where are all those "ideals" he keeps talking about?Yes, when no one's looking... or in a nationally televised speech earlier today.  Very sneaky of him to tell everyone about it like that!  Hopefully you can distinguish between what he would like to do and what Bush was doing.  Here is a little experiment I've been doing since he took office:  

For every headline that has, "Obama does [action]", change obama's name to bush, and see if you still think it's a good idea.

I've found that I'm actually none too happy with his presidency thus far.&gt;For every headline that has, "Obama does [action]", change obama's name to bush, and see if you still think it's a good idea.

That may be a good "experiment" for the minority of Obama supporters who are really blind in their support for Obama, but unnecessary for the majority.

Most supporters are worn from dealing with the Bush administration's years of abuse of power and the idiots that supported that administration, and therefore may be slow in reacting to Obama's abuses, sometimes giving him the benefit of the doubt when unwarranted, but I don't think the majority of Obama supporters are so intellectually blinded that they need to use such a sleight of mind to open their eyes. They know abuse of power when they see it, and it registers as such, no matter the name or the person attached to it.

    edit:clarityIt has far more respect than Saudi Arabia..This is completely different, and there is no way this is "continuing" a practice.

Back when Bush was in power, he sent terror suspects around the world. There, these prisoners were tortured and generally  mistreated. To make matters worse, it was found that the Bush administration was making sweeping arrests, bringing kids in, and  doing little to insure that the people he put in these prisons were infact guilty. People were being abused and raped and never being charged with anything. We/reddit/liberals saw this and began hating it. We rallied to close Guitmo because it was such a horrible display of un-American ideals.

But we were never against imprisoning terrorists. We were against the way Bush did it. The way innocent people were imprisoned, and the way torture was justified as an acceptable means of getting information. But we were never against imprisoning terrorists. The prisons themselves simply became synonymous with everything that was wrong with the Bush administration.

And now, what Obama is doing is exactly what was needed. This "rendition" is continuing, but there is oversight. The article above describes the oversight that is being put into place that will prevent all the things we detested about the Bush administration. If Bush was ever this careful to prevent detainee abuse, and prevent false imprisonment, nobody would have had any problem with it. Oh - I guess they (AI) should storm the palace and change all stupid laws? - And why not do the same with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and all the 9 out of 10 countries that have laws that do not accord with human rights?

It is not doable - Amnesty must try to work within the laws (however ridicolous) of the countries where it operates, or it would (of course) be termed an illegal organisation by those in the state who would like to see AI go away.

This kind of article is depressing; There is of course no possibility for Amnesty to really Do something about this law except express dislike for the law, and try to spread public opinion against it.

I believe the purpose of such articles are to try to throw dirt on AI unless it follows the agenda of the writer, according to the well worn formula "AI is not putting all its resources and credibility behind MY special little interest, and therefore they support oppression"

Stupid, selfish, depressingAmnesty is clearly being selective about whose human rights it defends and applying double standards. The writer is not demanding all AI's resources on this, simply that it condemn these laws and urge its tens of thousands of members to write letters to that effect. But AI goes further, it offers political support to the perpetrators. You and AI are apologists in this case for human rights violators.How does AI "offer political support to the perpetrators" [of human rights abuses, I guess]?

In what way am I an apologist for human rights violations? - That just seems like an attept to throw dirt on me for not agreeing with you.

I am an active (when I have time + energy) member of AI since many years - what do You do for human rights?

Believe it or not, but "urging its tens of thousands of members to write letters" IS pretty much the same thing as AI putting all its resources on this. -Voluntary letter writers Are the main resource of AI; it is not a rich organisation in other ways.

The thing I'm complaining about with the article is the (pretty common) attempt to throw dirt on it when it doesn't do exactly the the thing some special interest wants (not that I call your special interest bad in any way) - it's very easy to throw dirt on something because it doesn't follow Your "great idea of how it should work" - a lot easier than doing something yourself, isn't it?

The standard of perfection is mostly easy to apply by people who do nothing themselves - I've read similar attacks by people who are angry that AI (for example) does not actively defend the freedom of speech of pedophilesOh, and - you are very correct in saying that AI is selective, but in my opinion it is not so much in what rights it defends, but in what cases to put meagre resources.

A simple way to improve AI, if you want - join, and vote, and convince others to vote in the way you want (it is a direct democracy)"How does AI `offer political support to the perpetrators' [of human rights abuses, I guess]?"

The Laos/Thailand Coordinator for AI falsely states that ALL the letters wanting action to get rid of the laws that make it illegal to `insult' the monarchy (with sentences of 18 years!) are from supporters of Thaksin and then declares: `The king is the strongest opponent and the biggest obstacle to a return of Thaksin to Thailand. Denigration of the King and demands that the Monarchy bee turned into a constitutional monarchy in the same model as England and Japan - as is demanded again and again - would likely allow a return of Thaksin.' Therefore, it opposes doing anything about these breaches of human rights. AI is entirely partisan and you echo them. AI get millions of dollars every year, much more than most activist groups. Yes, they can certainly afford to issue a press release and email it to its members.AI does not accept contributions from governments - why should it be "partisan" in this case?

I'm not sure what you mean in some pieces of your text - it's a bit unclear. Amnesty is not in a position to "demand" anything from the Thai authorities (in case you thought so). 

I've read that both AI ant HRW have been "tepid" about lese majeste, and I assume there is a reason for this, other that their suddenly deciding to ditch their human rights-missions

Saying that "ALL letters against lese majeste are from supporters Thaksin" is obviously absurd. Do you have a link for that?

BTW - selecting AI's "Prisoners of Conscience" is a demanding process; considering lack of resources, these should ideally be real "poster children" of human rights abuses against peaceful citizensIt is in the link you are commenting on. Perhaps you should read it first?Ok - I meant one with an actual quote, instead of just a claim that she has said it

And if you could answer my question; why would AI be partial in favour of the government?

It is very common to accuse AI of being partial - often it is done by both sides in a conflict, which is amusingYou plainly have trouble reading. The link includes a translation of the AI Laos/Thailand coordinator (and link to the original German). Here it is below. The email makes it clear that AI won't oppose lese majeste laws because to do so would lead to the demise of the king, which AI prefers to his opponents. That's making support for human rights conditional. Why does AI support the Thai monarchy?

Dear XXXXX

Amnesty International is swamped right now with letters from Germans who express themselves on the topic of lese Majesté in Thailand. Due to the abundance of letters, please allow me a short reply.

Amnesty International has evolved over the years and has long evolved beyond the prisoner aid organization that it once was. It has become a human rights organization, which deals with various kinds of human rights violations, including the use of political prisoners as well, but not always exclusively. Since it is impossible to deal with all human rights violations of this world, Amnesty International can only set strategic priorities that are determined afresh each year, unless a sudden issue is so explosive that must be immediately dealt with.

In Thailand, Amnesty International is concerned at present mainly with the Lao Hmong refugees in the north and the unrest in the south. If Amnesty International is now beset by a number of web pages and letters that are against lese Majesté in Thailand, and they are exclusively Thaksin and UDD supporters, demanding that this law be abolished, the presumption must be that this is an attempt to pressurise Amnesty International in order that these people can have the right to insult the King . The king is the strongest opponent and the biggest obstacle to a return of Thaksin to Thailand. Denigration of the King and demands that the Monarchy bee turned into a constitutional monarchy in the same model as England and Japan - as is demanded again and again - would likely allow a return of Thaksin.

During the reign of Thaksin, Amnesty International recorded the most serious human rights violations in Thailand. About 2500 dead were caused solely by Thaksin’s “war on terror” (“drugs”, surely?) A return by Thaksin would be a major human rights disaster.

Amnesty International acknowledges that the lese Majesté law is against freedom of expression and prison sentence is justified under any circumstances (maybe she meant “unjustified”?). But the organization also knows there are other ways to achieve a goal. It does not always have to be public. Above all, Amnesty International can not be orchestrated and used as a tool of those who want to push through a political opinion.

Sincerely,

The original, in German, is posted on the blog http://wdpress.blog.co.uk/This is said to be a "rough" translation from german, and that is true..

It is not a **correct translation**, which is something I can tell since I am (unfortunately for me) able to read at least basic German.

"If Amnesty International is now beset by a number of web pages and letters that are against lese Majesté in Thailand, and they are exclusively Thaksin and UDD supporters"

-In the German original it does not say "web pages and letters", it says "web pages" ("Seiten")

The rest of it would take some time for me to translate in a reliable way (I hate German grammar!), but the above part I am quite sure of, unless "Seiten" magically means "web pages and letters"

Also- you said that:
"The Laos/Thailand Coordinator for AI falsely states that ALL the letters wanting action to get rid of the laws that make it illegal to insult the monarchy are from supporters of Thaksin"

-She is only talking about the letters (or rather, web pages, according to her own letter) that are demanding things **from AI** about this - not ALL web pages that are about this subject.

If she had, that would have been an unlikely thing (that only Thaksin-followers care about lese majeste)

If the latter part of the letter is correctly translated I have my doubts, of course, but if it is (and she actually Does claim that the return of Thaksin would be an undesirable thing) I would think it was uncharacteristic (and a bit strange) for an AI representative to express such a view about the desired leadership for a regime - in my experience they usually avoid commenting such things

Lese majeste sounds like an awful thing to have in a state, but often it is not politically possible for human rights organisations to publicly oppose things they don't like in countries where they want to have a presence and an effect - for example; if they constantly condemned all undemocratic countries they would not be able to have any kind of dialogue with them; if they for example always worked to change regimes in undemocratic countries, then AI would of course be an illegal organisation in those countries. I think AI and similar organisations must strive to be as un-political as they can, and only focus on human rights, which is hard enough Yes, she is claiming that the only (all) people sending AI letters asking the organisation to take up the lese majeste cases are Thaksin supporters. That is not true. One democracy activist, known Da Torpedo, has been jailed for 18 years for lese majeste. This undemocratic law is the most important human rights issue in Thailand today. AI should not remain silent on it.No - she does not claim that, as I just said - she claims all (if I've read the German correctly) SITES (Web Sites) that [are now appearing to..] tell AI to do something about it are Thaksin supporters; which is something that is not so incredible.

You base your arguments on a very very bad translation from German, which I have already told you is wrong in at least one important place.

It's fine that you want AI to take a stand about lese majeste - argue for it as much as you want, and I'll be happy to read it and ask AI myself - it is not ok that you make false claims in order to attack AI, in order to make them follow your agenda; that is exactly what I said I disliked in my first reply to this thread

If you wrote the German woman and asked her what she meant, and how she could support (in your theory) the military instead of your candidate, I believe that she would answer you, if she didn't feel it was unnessecary to defend herself from attacks that are just based on bad translation. I don't think you want to do this, however, since you don't seem too concerned about wether what you claim is true or not

In that case you would have gotten a decent translation from germanThe email was a form reply to the flood of emails from Germans requesting AI support. The emails are in response to calls by some websites. In fact the key website (the one the original link links to) calling for AI to support human rights in Thailand is run by an opponent of both Thaksin and the current regime. Another, FreeThai does not either. This AI rep is lying in order to smear supporters of human rights as Thaksin dupes and justify inaction.I suggest you ask her what she meant - after you get a decent translation; the current translation is too bad to give you reliable grounds to make such accusations. Why don't you ask some German to translate properly?

-Again; you make many claims about her opinions, without really knowing them, and you draw unwarranted conclusions from them.

She talks about a Subset of web pages wanting AI to support human rights; not  ALL

"If Amnesty International is **now beset** by a number of web pages and letters **[SITES]** that are against lese Majesté in Thailand, and they are exclusively Thaksin and UDD supporters, demanding that this law be abolished, the presumption must be.. "

For one there is some inconsistency between if he's been "kicked out" or if he decided not to go in. It's also not made clear if the school took issue with the fact he was dressing in girls clothes, or if the girls clothes were "disruptive". If a girl worse those clothes would they too be in trouble? I would like to, and I would encourage others to, get more info before I take the advice of the blog and contact school officials.

Looks like a good argument to bring in non-gender specific uniforms.I came here to say just that. Sir, I salute you.Exactly; it surprises my how absurd people have gotten with all this. Yes, it is a terrible thing to torture. We are, however, at war and need to detain prisoners when they are captured. Detention is not evil, neither is returning a prisoner to a country where he is already wanted for crimes.They knew the rules, shouldn't have been witches. We must respect their culture etc.,

I just remembered this subreddit, and that I have mod powers.

Look, if you're only going to criticize what you see as leftists, I'm going to have to ban you entirely.Don't mistake this for a goodwill effort by Google on the behalf of oppressed Chinese citizens. China staged attacks against Gmail to obtain information about dissidents, and this imperils Google's reputation. The company depends on it's ability to collect personal information and use it to serve ads. Once people lose faith in Google's ability to safely store that information, they will move it elsewhere. 

Discontinuing censorship of search results shows the Chinese government that Google is willing to play hardball in order to protect its business interests.They weren't doing this before? I'm surprised.Well, a true Democracy would be a good start. There has yet to be one. imho.want more democracy in the us (and west)? easy.

what is needed: restoring the true secular principles of the state (but at least building MORE distance from the vatican), abolishing corporate lobbying practice, abolishing the fed, reform the legal system, reform the political sytem (multiple parties or whatever), decrease the size and powers of the federal government by 95%, kill off (take over) the mil.ind.complex, pfizer, monsanto, exxon, goldman sach, the msm, hollywood and the like,  reinforce the constitution, close up overseas military bases and military operations, stop funding israel and decompose zionist control over the us government/media/finances... arm the masses if all else fails.

in a word, if you want democracy you need to beat fascism first. it is impossible to have both at the same time which is what is the present problem in the us (and west in general) today.Toblotron

Sorry but you completely fail to understand the context.

Ben Zawacki, AI's Thailand researcher, has gone on the record with several pro-royalist statements.

The most infamous was in connection to Thailand's draconian LM laws and these laws' present application in connection to Da Torpedo.

His words, in a written statement were "We can see why."

Incredible.

Furthermore, AI's Thailand office were infiltrated by PAD members (PAD are an organisation deemed neo-fascist by the respected Asian Human Rights Watch, who, unlike AI, are made up almost entirely of Asian human rights activists), were putting out statements supporting the PAD, sharing stages at them with rallies etc.

In the last few days HRW have come out and criticised the Thai govt on pretty much every single issue that AI refuse to take up.

And anyone who knows anything about human rights in SE Asia knows that the KEY battleground is Thailand. While Burma may be a trendy cause cos of the nice photogenic Suu Kyi, if the West ignores Thailand's human rights travesties why should Burma care?

Also the resources question - that's just a get out.

AI in Asia have been pursuing South Korea over arrests of bloggers who are likely to face FINES.

At present Da Torpedo is imprisoned for 18years, being denied medical treatment and being singled out and mistreated.

To put out a simple statement criticising that costs NOTHING. 

AI's position is selective and ultimately it is that that undermines AI's standing not criticisms of it.

Having just read some of your views on "rape" I think any other reader who comes across this thread can make their own judgement as to your personal grasp of other people's rights.

"Maybe it's not obvious to you since you are a woman (and probably do not have much experience in having sex with women), but many women actually act like this; teasing, pretending not to want sex, but still hanging around.

It may be surprising to you, but I think most guys have probably run into a girl like this.

I think it's a way of trying out their sexual power - how much they can arouse and manipulate a guy.

Edit: I think it's ridicolous calling this rape in any way (if we go by the story told) - it's detracting from the seriousness of the awful crime that is rape. The poster Should have left the girl alone, but mostly because it's always a good idea to stay away from messed up women."
It's credibleThis is really depressing...This is actually unusual.  The people who collect this stuff generally fall into two camps:

(a) Actual neo-Nazis, like skinheads, and

(b) Conservatives who tend to be pro-Israel and collect it out of historical interest and/or gloating over the Allied victory over the Third Reich.(c) Jeff Hanneman(d) people watch too much History Channel(tm)

Iran executes around to 1 in every 180,000 (Iran on the graph looked about 380-390 to me).  I think my math is correct...

Anyway, my point is that a graph like this isn't useful.  I don't agree with capital punishment, regardless of the country it's used in.  But it's important to get our facts straight, and put things in the proper perspective.Look at US companion countries in this report... should we be keep this kind of company... Yeah oh and JapanThis seems like a ghost.Because the US and French governments have never supplied gear to suppress crowds... not liking taking free vacations... training riot police... providing them with equipment like tear gas... or have US corporations ever been implicated in blocking cell phone calls and assisting governments in repressive policies against their own citizens...

Oh wait. Pot, Kettle, Red.Initially, I wrote this piece as a letter to Congress, explaining why I do, and why the United States (US) should, support efforts to expose and halt the gross affront to human rights currently perpetrated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against the people of China. I quickly decided that this content would also prove a useful tool in raising awareness and informing others about the atrocities of forced organ harvesting, and ultimately, about the persecution of Falun Gong, in China.

This article now contains background information about the current situation, including a bit of history on the CCP's brutal rise to power, and discussion about effects of the methods and philosophies of communist theory on real people, especially those that the CCP singles out for elimination. The article goes on to cite human rights abuses that the CCP has made against its membership with the United Nations, and why the US has an obligation to take a stand against such abhorrent behavior.

I follow up the body of my article by suggesting further steps we might take in order to prevent US citizens from engaging in the crimes of transplant tourism, including examples of legislation passed in other countries pursuant to the same goals. Finally, I close the article by providing my personal connection with Falun Gong as a motivating factor in this work.

This article is written in a serious, semi-formal, and scholarly tone. Source material is fully-cited, encouraging further exploration of the topics within. Parallels are drawn between the Holocaust and the persecution of Falun Gong in China. In essence, the article aims to bring readers up to pace with current events and hopes to inspire others to cast off indifference and speak up for what they believe to be right.
