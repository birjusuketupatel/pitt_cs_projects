but to change topics Josh you were
talking about you know giving people
something to vote for and giving people
at least some hope of a better future
which ties in nicely to a project that
you've been working on throughout much
of this year that I've been following
and I'm glad we finally have a chance to
get you on here could you just like just
kick it off for us
what is measure B going on in Los
Angeles and why are why are you devoting
so much time to this yeah measure B is a
very simple amendment to the Los Angeles
Charter that would make it possible to
create a public bank that's it
that's all it does it doesn't put any
money towards anything it just simply
removes one regulatory hurdle allowing
for the ability for Los Angeles to be
the first city in the history of America
to vote to take our public money out of
the Wall Street Hell labyrinth how does
this currently work like the city of Los
Angeles is the second largest city in
America and is basically manages around
nine billion dollars in revenue that's
connected through taxation like how do
they like how does that how is that
money currently managed and how would a
public bank change that yes so a lot of
people don't like think about this but a
city right when they take your tax
dollars they need to start a bank
account and just like you and your bank
account they get [ __ ] like constantly
brutally over and over and over by those
even fees yet to the tune of a hundred
million dollars a year in fees alone
that's just fees and then when you bring
in interest which if you have any
experience with a loan or a credit card
you know how you get [ __ ] by interest
the city of Los Angeles owes over three
billion dollars a year in interest and
pays over a billion dollars and it just
puts the other couple billion on a
little ledger sheet so we're [ __ ] in
the future this measure B is on the
ballot this is a measure that people in
Los Angeles are gonna vote on on the
sixth right yes all right so let's say
it passes on on
six setting up this public bank like
what would that actually entail and how
does a public bank work differently from
like let's say Wells Fargo Bank of
America or Chase right so a bank right
by virtue of being a bank is able to
loan out ten times its capital base and
loan out ninety percent of its deposits
that's a very shitty flaw in banking and
that's what directly led to the 2008
financial crisis because 90% of the
deposits were gambled on these risky
loans and then a the loans couldn't get
paid back in the banks went under so a
public bank would be able to loan out
this money to not risky things like you
know infrastructure improvements and
[ __ ] like that like right now beyond the
risky loans are tax dollars like if you
go buy a [ __ ] ice cream in Los
Angeles your sales tax goes to finance
pipelines to finance private prisons
including the very cages that separate
undocumented children from their
families we're talking guns tobacco just
like the worst [ __ ] like if you could
imagine a horrible thing odds are that's
where it goes and a public bank would
place transparency and accountability
into this process so that the people of
Los Angeles would effectively become the
shareholders and thereby be able to
prioritize where this money is invested
and be able to restrict investment from
these horrible extractive policies so
like when you say you when you pay sales
tax like you are also funding you know
child prisons or guns or things like
that that's just by virtue of what every
commercial bank is already invested in
yeah literally like just you know they
say there's no ethical consumption under
capitalism and that is very literal in
this case another issue to deal with
this public banking thing in California
is what is the weed connections all this
myth
well so actually it's funny that's sort
of how it started right the that's how
the public banking movement gained
traction at least when it comes to
elected officials on the the activists
and organizers side it grew from the
divestment movement out of Standing Rock
by you know the a big THC man has a lot
of ICI money and so they saw public
banking as the solution to the current
crisis of just [ __ ] not being able to
deposit all this cash because a public
bank would not be FDIC insured and
therefore it would not have to go
through any sort of federal regulations
meaning you know Jeff Sessions wouldn't
be able to just steal it and use it to
make a rocket to shoot into a
historically black college so like the
the the cannabis issue is something that
we think can that public banking can
offer a solution but honestly the
cannabis people have enough money they
have enough lobbyists that is going to
be solved and at this point right now
we're not really focusing on cannabis
we're focusing more on Community
Development lame sounds boring I want to
be able to my bank branch and
immediately chief this is [ __ ]
yeah Josh I like a public bank I don't
want to toast her if I'm gonna public
bank in LA I want that Wow I don't want
that strong ass pack I want a free
eighth when I open a checking account
absolutely Bank done and you make you
ask for it I'm making it happen when I
say that I like you know like when I
open a checking account with the public
bank like what any citizen of Los
Angeles be able to go into the LA public
bank and keep their you know just
deposit money into a checking or a
savings account with that bank so at
first no because that is an incredibly
costly service right to provide checking
in
like savings for just a commercial
reasons we do believe that it should get
to that point and we're modeling it off
of the very successful German spar casa
which as I mentioned before fund 70% of
their renewables it's also the bank of
first resort for Germany and has been
since you know hundreds of years I think
over a hundred years so the answer is
eventually yeah yes you will be able to
at first we think that we're gonna you
know this is a very like complicated and
serious issue and so we don't want to
bite off more than we can chew but right
now there's six hundred thousand people
in Los Angeles mostly people of color
that are unbanked and they're getting
preyed on by payday lenders and so you
know eventually yes within a couple
years we hope we will be able to do this
I mean and this is this is part of like
you know like that it would be like an
important test case for Los Angeles
second-largest city in America but this
is part of like a broader thing about
creating a banking as a public
institution rather than essentially a
privatized casino like like that that's
what we're talking about like banking as
a kind of something that everyone needs
whether it's a you know municipality or
an individual but it like needs to be
run as a kind of shared public
institution in which there is as you
said kind of democratic transparency and
control over how that money is lent and
what it's used for versus JPMorgan Chase
Bank of America Wells Fargo that you
know let's be honest are almost entirely
criminal and fraudulent organizations
yeah exactly
you know there's um you can't [ __ ]
call Lloyd Blank fine or Jamie Dimon you
know and be like yo hey can you make
sure to not spend my tax dollars on
imprisoning children engages thanks dog
like that doesn't happen there's no way
and and the government has proven time
and time again our federal government
that they're not gonna regulate these
people and so why are we giving these
translucent millionaire
these blood sucking frauds all of this
power the power to decide where billions
of dollars are invested why are we
allowing them to [ __ ] Hoover billions
from each and every city and so a
municipal public banking works because
it bypasses are broken federal
legislature legislative branch and it
allows cities and communities to assert
their own power so Josh like as you as
you make the case for measure B and like
the idea of a public bank in Los Angeles
like seems like a self-evidently good
thing to me but obviously like you know
you guys are gonna get a lot of pushback
on this and I guess I'm interested in
like what are some of the arguments
against public banking where do they
come from
and and what are the sort of the lines
that they take when they try to convince
people to vote no on B so the biggest
one we've seen so far and this is a
pretty typical conservative talking
point which is oh yeah you're gonna
really trust these clowns and City
Council to run the bank and the answer
is no this is a new institution that is
going to have demographic representation
and we're going to have worker controls
be put in we're going to like you know
have the the people the workers of the
bank themselves have a say we're going
to appoint experts in affordable housing
in you know homelessness activism and
renewable energy and green energy
activism to the board to make sure that
there is Community Development and also
even if you take that argument at face
value right like oh you're gonna really
trust the the government um yeah yes I
trust them more than I trust the guys
currently running the bank's well I
don't know what are you talking about
seeds out
you don't trust Wells Fargo who just
like to open accounts in your name
without your knowledge to charge you a
bunch of [ __ ] fees that you don't
know about until you they've already
accumulated you know you know you don't
trust those I trust those guys sorry
buddy
no Josh Oh funny that those commercials
were there apologizing they're so good
we'll do better and they show like
slow-motion footage of like you know the
old-timey like horse and buggy like
Wells Fargo covered wagons and I just
want to like tell whoever's making those
commercials like hey maybe showing a
terrified animal with blinders on being
whipped by a rich old white guy it
doesn't exactly say we're not gonna
force our employees to break the law
anymore Josh I saw one of those
commercials the other week and it was
like you know again it was like a period
piece commercial and they were like last
time there was a run on the banks
Wells Fargo let all our customers Oh
reopen their accounts based on a
handshake of their word loan like and
we're continuing that tradition today
sorry about that other stuff folks but
we're going back to what started us here
it yeah we you know we got to go back a
hundred years to the show the one good
thing we've ever done I sure would
appreciate if y'all took a gander at our
paste bin but Josh I remember I was a I
was listening to a radio hit that you
shared with it was sort of like a debate
with one of the one of the one of the
measure be like one of the experts or
people who are advocating for this
public bank and then someone who is
essentially like a representing a
representative of like I don't know the
Orange County Better Business consumer
Bureau or whatever some some [ __ ]
goal and yeah like the the main line of
attack on the idea of a public bank that
this guy came out with was you know yeah
like you said do you really you think LA
City government is gonna run a bank okay
better than do they know more about
banking than bankers and I'm just like
well he was like he said name one thing
that the LA city government is good at
and it was like what and you're like why
would you expect them to be good at
banking but what that doesn't address is
I bankers aren't [ __ ] good at banking
they've raised world economy with this
[ __ ] what are they good at doing
other than like you said ripping people
off making their employees commit fraud
in the names of their customers and like
I said generally just sucking all of the
life and vitality out of the
and species and planet this is not a
piggy bank for City Council or the mayor
you know this is like an institution
first and foremost that's going to have
a very strict charter that is going to
be its main like point of governance
right like the the Charter is something
that we believe is going to be voted on
by the people like this isn't the only
vote right like there's going to be
other referendums and other ballot
measures and that charter is going to
very strictly restrict investments in
things we don't want and prioritize
investments in the things we do want so
that the actual humans that are running
this Bank won't be able to be corrupt
and when you look at the only existing
bank in the continental United States
public bank in the existing contents of
United States it's the Bank of North
Dakota of all places and that Bank has
weathered the 2008 crisis it has a
better credit rating than JPMorgan Chase
and it has never had like a huge
corruption scandal even coming close to
what Wells Fargo's come to in its 100
years of existence that's my favorite
thing is the same thing goes for [ __ ]
like Medicare for all these guys their
main argument is you are [ __ ] [ __ ]
to think this thing that other places do
successfully for [ __ ] decades or
centuries is possible here it's just
like right basically are preying on
people's absolute ignorance of anything
outside of their personal purview
because it's this Islam these are not
like fantasy ideas they exist
successfully everywhere in the world
Josh I just looked this up this is from
the hill from five days ago a public
bank is risky business by Rob Nichols
opinion contributor who he says it also
says who would oversee this new Bank the
proposed public bank would not have the
FDIC insurance that consumers expect
meaning that their deposits would be
protected not by the trusted FDIC but by
state or local politicians without
professional regulators overseeing the
bank would it be swayed by the
politically connected to make
excessively risky loans think about
writing that if you
the head of the American Banking
Association the banking sector is not
well regulated no blue giant hole in the
world economy let's be honest they're
probably gonna do it ignores half next
couple years yes if you're years for 500
all those risky mortgages that's that's
all coming back now yeah risky I mean
again I know this was only ten years ago
but after they just literally shot a
load over the entire world economy the
US taxpayer made them whole yep made
them whole again and then no homeowner
was built I don't know you know like all
the people who were ruined by the
finality of the actual the people who
use commercial banks or get loans from
them they weren't helped out but all of
the giant big big too-big-to-fail the
banks were made whole again specifically
with taxpayer money because they are
politically connected look who isn't
look every single person who has been
charged of the US Treasury Department
comes out of either Goldman Sachs or
another one of these huge [ __ ]
financial institutions dracula's yeah
they are thick as thieves and you want
to talk about political influence over
our banking system follow adhere
Geithner basically defy ignored an order
from Barack Obama to actually like start
thinking about breaking up the banks he
just did what like Madison those guys do
when Trump says that they need to send
SEAL Team six to kill the Hamburglar he
said yeah we're not doing that and then
he's just he just slow rolled him and
basically glad handed him until like he
got distracted by other things because
that was the priority of the [ __ ]
banking industry they were given
everything they asked for without a
single string attached and even that
wasn't enough for them and these people
I mean they can't even countenance the
thought of competition from the form of
a municipal public bank in Los Angeles
yeah it's it's horseshit and and here's
the other thing right like um North
Dakota has the healthiest community
banking system in the country because
guess what happens when there's a public
bank local community banks are able to
share risk with the public bank thereby
allowing for student loan debt
refinancing which would improve
drastically improve
the lives of you know millions of
Californians and angelitos we would be
able to help risk share so that we could
put a deathblow to you know payday
lenders and there are two hundred
percent interest loans like all this
[ __ ] could go away which actually helps
bankers in the community that are the
only people it hurts is these Wall
Street plutocrats but like if we expand
the idea of a public bank out to a
national level and conceived as
something like a u.s. national public
bank that you mentioned that every
citizen would be a shareholder in what
are those actually revolutionary
implications of that idea what it does
is it places power in the form of money
right in the hands of people and um I
personally and we at Public Bank LA are
advocating for municipal public banks
because we believe that when you get
closer to the street level you have more
of a say it's easier to influence what's
happening at the city level or community
level county level than it is at the
state or federal level and and the
implications of having this I mean this
is almost like you know direct democracy
ultimately we're just cutting out the
Wall Street middleman and passing the
savings on to you you know like this
would allow for the massive massive
climate infrastructure spending that we
need if our country is going to exist if
our world is going to exist in 40 years
you know and we're again we're doing all
this without raising taxes and you know
I mean just like again broader it
brought more broadly speaking here I
think like so much of this idea that
like oh like oh what the banks do is
just so complicated and you really need
experts who are you know have been
banking families for three or four
generations to you know really run the
economy depends on this idea that this
this mystification of the economy that
the economy is just money
people who have more money you know
necessarily should run the economy and
like the economy isn't money the economy
is everyone in our society there is no
economy without the people in a country
and their time and activity and the time
and labor that's what the economy is and
there would be none of it without all of
us so I think we all deserve some kind
of share and say in that money that we
generate for to keep this whole [ __ ]
thing going also slightly way we're
gonna get anywhere close to the sort of
workers and citizen control of the
actual mechanisms of production that is
necessary to as you say survive as a
species because if we just allow the the
[ __ ] logic of capitalism to continue
dictating these choices it's just gonna
burn us to death literally like we have
to take control of these reins and
things like public banking are really
sort of the grassroots expression of
that and a chance for people to really
get it through their head that they have
the ability to do this stuff that it
isn't some sort of a cult mystical a
path that only the adept only somebody
Yeah right okay let's do it Mary desmos
and Happy New Year
below where you add
[Music]

I don't actually own somewhere so I'm
pouring this into these sake glasses
that I used to steal from the bar you
protect little pandas on them amber -
amber doesn't own stemware she owns
liberal arts for arts where I want this
I want the Snoopy mug please I'm putting
a marker down on that right now okay all
right so in case you don't understand
sound effects that was an actual bottle
of champagne that's $13 champagne being
popped on air we're popping bottles to
celebrate the absolute top boy Jezza
it's the Jessa episode it's the Jessa
victory lap episode guys I don't even
know where to begin with this one
because there's so much to talk about
we're extremely happy yeah the world is
legible I'm chuffed shaft is one of
those English words that means not what
it sounds like right it's good right
yeah it's good it's chuffing season my
fanny is well chuffed at the moment yeah
no I was let me put this into
perspective the moment the eggs had
pulled hit I was stuck in the
brooklyn-queens tunnel on my way to the
airport - the worst things but I was
just like almost crying with joy going
through TSA it looked like the exit
polls were [ __ ] up I then I get on the
plane my sinus infection is making my
[ __ ] ears clogged up and my I feel
like it's about to burst out of my head
but I didn't even care because jazz did
it and I went into the bathroom and
dipped and watch Arnold at the end of
Total Recall yeah yeah I got my ass to
Mars bars on strategy fire Jimmy can we
just [ __ ] glasses together and get that
sound effect as well let's do it up boy
the boy I mean I want to be good
actually Matt the last time you were in
the city we were talking about this like
before the election and we alluded to it
a little bit on our UK pre-election show
that we did with Jonathan Shannon
but I remember talking to you about it
that if this had gone another way it
would have been really [ __ ] hard like
it would have been really hard to like
keep going you know or it to make the
case that we have been making with
regards to electoral politics in Western
democracies yeah it's a proof of concept
mm-hmm what we've been saying since
since Trump as well if you get people
you know a vision of a world where their
lives are [ __ ] better than they are
now and you identify the actual
malefactors that make their life shitty
in the present moment instead of going
off on scapegoats you can actually
engage people regardless of their
circumstances or whatever their tribal
affiliations are and then motivate them
and specifically motivate people who
wouldn't otherwise vote yeah and tap
into that which is like the most fertile
ground in terms of future electoral
prospects and this was really the chance
to see that theory brought out and I was
and it [ __ ] worked
it's [ __ ] work even though the
entirety of the British press they all
said that he was a nightmare
IRA sympathizing [ __ ] it didn't
[ __ ] matter it didn't work at all so
we're able to [ __ ] bring out people
to vote who otherwise would Nev and
bring out young people 72% no because
the media class is so cynical
they literally underestimate people all
the time every time they say you're not
ready for this radical blahblah
but they are it's fine everything ever
they tried everything they tried to
reinforce every third rail Corbin was
touching whether it was his
anti-imperialism whether it was just
unabashedly saying yes we need to
redistribute they tried it all these all
these things that 10 years ago we
believed would end anyone's campaign but
no he [ __ ] did it he persisted that
scared liberals across the Western world
are most afraid of before an election
which is a terror attack because the
PlayBook is always there's a terror
attack it were down
to the right-wing it resounds to the
security state always but instead of
curling into a ball and and trying to be
defensive work deflect Corbin took the
the principle anti-imperialist critique
that he'd been developing for his entire
career in politics and [ __ ] used it
and people were receptive because it
made sense like the litter the guy who
bought the Manchester ariana grande
concert came of a family who were part
of a Islamist militant group that had
been [ __ ] armed by the British
government during the Libyan Vasia and
who had said that was a bad idea to
begin with the [ __ ] boy yeah
connect can I say something about his
his foreign policy speech that he made
his speech about terrorism I have been
waiting since [ __ ] in 2001 for someone
on the center laughter laughter anywhere
even I would have taken it from anywhere
to make that speech but they never did
the best we got in America was Sanders
position you know I'm for the smart Wars
I'm for the good war you know not the
bad ones like Iraq but Corbin who has an
actual holistic view about imperialism
about terrorism and about blowback he
goes out and makes a speech and after
years of being told that people will rip
rip you apart because they've been
reading Jeanne Kilpatrick and it's for
some reason still 1984 September 12 2001
he just didn't care
he's gonna do it right or wrong but this
time most of the people agreed with him
and the other thing that I really loved
that the other major third rail that he
touched it one of those debates is that
he wouldn't commit himself to
preemptively nuking in the country if
they insulted the Queen Mum or whatever
it was just like no he was like no
actually that's [ __ ] insane swing
that Labour got was the highest for any
party since 1945 yeah most of them the
Labour MPs who lost their seats were
anti Corbin guys the Blair rights so I
mean the death of Blair ISM is
accelerating it an awesome rate and on
the media point there's a great anecdote
that came out while things were kicking
off about Rupert Murdoch at what at the
party that was supposed to be
celebrating Mays Mays victory and he
started to see also hosted at the Javits
Center coincidentally and
everyone is throwing up and vomiting and
he you know got got a look at the exit
polls and stormed out apparently and
despite all the the hysteria about fake
News and the internet and stuff like
that the fact is that a very small
percentage of young people in their
country or our country read the print
media that of course in Britain is
overwhelmingly just you know dominated
and infected by right-wing billionaires
like him and so while it's great to see
that korban didn't back down or he
didn't get you know sledge-hammered by
any of it a large reason why that is is
because the young people who voted for
him didn't care or didn't read it and
are not gonna start reading it yeah and
I just like to speak to Amber's point
about how the media class like breeds
this kind of cynicism that they
themselves are so stewed in it is
infectious and like I will certainly cop
to feeling that same kind of cynicism or
trying to never really let myself
believe like preparing myself
psychologically for what I thought that
the bad outcome would be which is that
he would be defeated convincingly and
then be shuffled off the you know I was
just wincing my internally the entire
time like all of that the absolute boy
gonna do it [ __ ] that I would do online
it felt like pre-emptive irony like I
was doing the irony now because I knew
that I wouldn't have the energy or the
will to do it later pressed I look back
at how I felt about it about this
election and I realize this is a mirror
image to how I felt about Trump in that
in my gut I kind of thought Corbin was
gonna do it but I could fix myself he
wasn't in the same way that I kind of in
my gut knew Trump was gonna do it yeah
and convinced myself that I wasn't
because in both cases I could not
conceive of a world that good or that
bad yeah well and you also can't
conceive of everyone whose job it is to
know about this stuff being wrong and
everyone and yet we so much should've
and yet it's it's so pervasive
it's such just a mechanism such an
overwhelming mechanism but even though
these [ __ ] are wrong all the time on
everything all the time fact that they
still have jobs and they're still there
and print every [ __ ] day it just it
conditions you to take them seriously
and now they're eating [ __ ] and one of
them literally ate his own book and
phibian who worked for Obama and then
was tweeted smugly about how Hillary was
gonna roll over Trump in 2016 and then
went to work for Theresa May and her
fascist gargoyles has not tweeted since
the day of the election if the if the US
government really wants to take out
Assad they're gonna send Jim Messina to
work for his campaign yeah he would lose
a bath party election that's a [ __ ]
rotten that [ __ ] is but I wouldn't
leading up to this you know months ago I
was saying like you know I thought he
could do it I was like I'm laying it on
my voyage as you can find what I said
but what I meant was I thought he was
gonna cut their cut the majority he was
gonna cut Theresa Mays lead and the
Conservative Party's lead and he was
gonna surprise people he was gonna do
like maybe six points better than a poll
suggested but he did beyond that hung
parliament he got a hung [ __ ] part
right now the polling agencies that got
it pretty close to the marker saying
that if there were a general actually
points ahead I mean he would win it was
able to cobble together is doomed and of
course that's the ultimate irony of all
this is that she spent the entire
campaign saying that Corbin was in bed
with terrorists yeah now she's literally
formed a government with the political
arm of the Ulster defence Association
that's a bunch of [ __ ] murderers who
literally murdered a guy in a Sainsbury
parking lot last week and then the
leader of the UDA met
when the head of the D you the dup that
later after later on after that I mean
it's like a parity it's like it's like I
mean might my dream of shin Fame coming
in and and and giving jazz a majority
didn't happen but we're sort of getting
a weird like mirror version of that with
this this like shambolic connection
between the DUP and the Tories which by
the way has not been finished yet
the latest thing I heard is that the the
Orange Order is asking that they as a
condition of joining the government the
DUP demand that they bring back the
marching season and all of the band
marches that lead to massive riots every
year that they used to do them I mean
it's really amazing because this is the
return of the repressed with the DUP
because the Tories got back in power in
2010 partly by get it basically jettison
their classical social conservative ISM
and saying we're the new we're the new
conservative party with a hard we don't
care if you're gay or anything like that
we just want you know to privatize the
NHS and we're basically the Democrats
now and now like all of that repressed
social reactionary ISM is now coming
back in them having to stitch together
this coalition with the DUP which is
like the most horrifyingly savage
atavistic core of like white settler
colonial ideology it's like the thing
that animates all of the most base and
horrible reaction throughout the Western
world without any kind of alloy or or or
finish on it I mean it really is it's
like if the people it's like if Eric
Rudolph's unindicted co-conspirators
political party yeah and I only say Eric
Rudolph because Timothy McVeigh was
Catholic yeah Teresa may for me a
coalition government with the supporting
characters from the movie afield in
England
the thing is Matt Teresa may jump the
gun on this one the person who ran
saying she was the one to negotiate the
brexit said it's okay we're going to
start make a government with the DUP and
the DUP said hang on hang on we didn't
agree to that yet but
I only joined the government with the
Conservatives on the condition but they
maintained the plan on the hunting of
foxes and repeal of the ban on the
hunting of Catholics explain to the
children or the DUP are they were
created by Ian Paisley the maniac
Presbyterian minister who once tried to
fistfight the Pope at the European
Parliament act out by MEP member Otto
von Habsburg when he tried to do it and
they are the most reactionary the most
far-right parts of the Ulster Unionist
movement and they are deeply connected
to the UDF or the UDA which is the main
umbrella sort of a legacy terrorist
group they're very similar to Shin fain
only Sinn féin is good and they really
do think of themselves it's like part of
a settler colonial Legion of Doom I've
seen pictures of the inside of of UDA
meeting houses where they've got flags
on the wall and they'll they'll have the
Red Hand of Ulster and the Union Shack
of course but also the Confederate flag
maybe the Israeli flag and the flags of
apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia yeah
one point I want to make on that is
actually Angela told a funny story that
I think is indicative for like Americans
to try to understand like what the
difference is between Irish Republicans
and the the Ulster people in Northern
Ireland she said she had American
leftist friends who went to Ireland for
the first time and had a kind of
skeptical attitude about Irish
republicanism and they're like well this
is just really nationalism yeah
nationalism of another stripe and then
they went to Northern Ireland and
walking through the Republic I returned
a burr hoods they have these murals that
feature Nelson Mandela Martin Luther
King and like children holding hands
with like we will win like victory for
like the workers of the world and stuff
then you literally cross the street and
in the ocean your own baby yeah yeah you
see murals dedicated to robert e lee
a grim reaper stabbing a union jack into
a dead body with like we will kill you
exactly one of the most famous murals on
the Shankill Road I actually saw it it's
a it's a guy in a ski mask pointing a a
K at you they say it's like the Mona
Lisa in that as you move the barrel of
the gun follows you but the one point I
want to make about this is Adolf Hitler
meeting Vegeta the yuta Ford unionist
rule the one point I want to make about
about the DUP though is what's what's so
grimly hilarious about this Matt is that
as you alluded to the Tories were
running as the rebranded were the nice
conservatives now we're not anti-gay but
the fact that they actually are
basically gonna restart the troubles to
form the shambhala government yeah makes
so hilarious the fact that a [ __ ]
traitor like Jim Messina could go work
for these [ __ ] and another absolute
fraud JK Rowling and all of her
ridiculous base encouraging people on
election day to vote for the Lib Dems
100% trying to throw the election to the
Tories against what was a good proper
and right candidate in Jeremy Corbyn
because what's so exciting about this
moment because before the election the
residual Blair rights in the Labour
Party were not trying to win and they
were just trying to sweat Jeremy Corbyn
so that one day he would be gone and
there would be another Miliband would
show up and put another make another
obelisk that says we're gonna kick out
the pakis I just want to read now here
the last couple tweets from Jim Messina
who is now extremely not online so
Paul's came in okay what he did here is
a he's quote tweeting a picture of a
Labour Party plane circling over a
polling place and like dragging a banner
in the sky and Jim Messina likes quotes
this and says tale of two campaigns
Tory's going targeted digital other side
flying banners guess what [ __ ]
where's your cane and now [ __ ] is neo
he saw all your zeros and ones and
kicked Theresa Mays head off and then
here's the date oh here's the really
last here's a really good one the very
last tweet he did from four days ago he
just says from London watching this
strong democratic election as my
country's politics slides off the rail
hashtag general election twenty seen
2017 hashtag Comey because he was doing
the people forget this this is the other
[ __ ] great thing about this election
it happened on the same day is that
[ __ ] [ __ ] Comey testimony that I
had to endure hearing about like for
cars and booming out of people's
speakers all day long they were so
riveted by that absolute all the stories
horrible yeah the stories of young
people in Brooklyn assembling at bars to
watch this in random warehouses people
tweeting about their [ __ ] Comey watch
parties flavor it for God's sakes the
absolute boy versus the absolute poor I
mean like yeah so in one hand you have
the perfect representation of American
liberalism you know some six eight
[ __ ] low mocks who spent last 40
years
framing [ __ ] Muslims for attempting
to kill Inspector Gadget Akon the
right-wing overseas you have an actual
campaign you have an actual manifesto I
think the crucial part that we're
forgetting about this is Labour's
manifesto that was when the gap started
up closing is after they released a
manifesto it's it's it's not just okay
so you know there's the thing that we
talked about on the Fisher episode where
he said that you know the left is kind
of stagnant and all it can do is try and
fight fight for what it has and it's of
course losing grounds the manifesto is
[ __ ] advancing the demands hmm you
know what they want listen to this gray
wolves
he wants to renal eyes the tray
oh by the way search from Jeremy Corbyn
on Twitter and trains
if [ __ ] accidentally slapping at it
wasn't enough so he is so one of us but
but it's I mean okay I remember like
during the election people were like
well if you go to Hillary Clinton's
website you click on you know on the
issues there was a great explanation of
policy and it's like yeah but did you
make a big splash about putting that
policy out there about did you do it did
you do a big press conference and a big
media media drop about how I don't know
Hillary's plan to like [ __ ] make uber
for drone construction or something no
no you ran on like I'm voting for this
baby she's my abuela a few Corbin wat
ran by the way a Corbin ran on we're
going to give you your future back yep
and that was more powerful than any
[ __ ] any [ __ ] Katy Perry now with
the same haircut from the stands there
was no one really was that crazy I mean
some people were but a lot of people
weren't that crazy about him and he
wasn't exactly a juggernaut of charisma
but then you you give people a manifesto
that says here's what we're gonna do for
you and suddenly they're like oh I can
vote for that guy Jess had a message
that would make you want to fight for it
he said before the election
you are lions we are the many they are
the few and it's like where do I sign up
to join the special yeah we were we were
all right uh well oh my god Secretary
Clinton Secretary Clinton he's coming to
the room and I'm gonna give my mic to
Secretary Clinton Secretary Clinton what
you have to say after Tuesday's offense
I may not be David Carradine but I
[ __ ] joke
I may not be Johnny Knoxville when I
[ __ ] on live TV I said I may not be Dale
Earnhardt when I smash into the [ __ ]
wall because I couldn't turn left
[Music]
[Music]
it's us guys we're back hello darkness
my old friends we've come to talk to you
again you know what it is
chocolate trap house joined by Virgil
Texas hi everyone and we're here to talk
about the life and career of Leonard
Cohen one of the greatest songwriters of
our time and now he's gone and we all
feel bad about it
Leonard Leonard Cohen taught me that
like you see somebody you should put on
a safety pin on your lapel and he taught
me it's okay to have an open marriage no
this is uh this is the first time that
we are talking to each other or even
looking at ourselves since Tuesday
night's election like we're not looking
at each other if members of your hair
profile of the big cast that's why no
we're in the same room and I think you
know before we go any further I just i
from my own you know
psychic balm just to exercise these
ghosts I just need to say right off the
bat we were wrong we blew it as if you
were at the live show or listens to the
audio of the live show you know you saw
a show in party it was great but it
turned out more like the New Year's Eve
scene in Boogie Nights and we're all now
in 1980 you know and more than anything
I just got to say Bill Mitchell is now
all of our dads we're recording this
madhouse I needed one he's needed gives
us an allowance now Bill Mitchell was
right we were wrong on like you know we
had to change the ending of the show
because honestly none of us could
conceive of Trump actually winning the
election Donald Trump and his advisers
couldn't even conceive of him winning
the intelligence community couldn't
conceive it the markets couldn't
conceive of it bookies couldn't conceive
of it we were all under the same
incantation
we we probably should have seen the
writing on the wall in a few spaces I
mean I remember before we put together a
map I saw this thing in Florida from
Alcee Hastings a US rep who said the
Clinton campaign hadn't even tried to
reach out to the black community he was
saying this before voting day like three
days before voting date I was like wow
this is a really bad sign and but of
course like all the liberal liberal
media people were like we registered 18
million new voters in Florida yeah it
was like they were built Mitchell
they were the yeah well we saw you know
I mean looking at it analytically we saw
you know there was like 90% black
turnout in North Carolina in terms of
early voting and the assumption that we
made was like oh she can kind of sweat
that we know it's not really gonna be
2012 numbers and Latinos kind of pick up
the pick up the pace there what we
didn't really realize was exactly how
bad her ground game was and we kind of
presumed that we would have heard in the
last couple weeks some kind of some kind
of a subjective you know warning sign it
would have been like anonymous like door
Walker and Wisconsin's like this is
going a [ __ ] and what it turned out was
her ground game was localized in just
these big cities where people were not
that enthusiastic about her how many
campaign offices in Pennsylvania I don't
even want to think about how many but
all of them all of them in Philadelphia
or Pittsburgh none in these rural areas
at all you know and and if you listen
back to the the shows throughout this
entire election like this is something
that I personally have waffled back and
forth on whether I thought Trump could
really be President but in the end at
the end of the day my rational mind like
in collaboration with you know the same
[ __ ] stupid media and the polls and
all the right sources and sensible
people you know conspired with my
rational minds you'd be like you know
what like at the end of the day like I
couldn't conceive of President Trump as
anything other than a joke until it
wasn't a joke and we were like right on
stage when it happened and I feel like I
read from HP Lovecraft on stage and I
like said the words that like opened up
the membrane into the dark universe and
that's where we're living now we all
live in this I feel like one of Nayer
latha type schemes yeah he's got an
entire life that has a sense of humor
about it I was just gonna say I'm proud
of all the boys for holding together on
stage even as we ate [ __ ] on our planet
I had diarrhea yeah yeah just feeling so
so like I gotta go my I like my bladder
was you know I had to piss I'm like
frequent pisser but I've a diarrhea boy
yeah he's good virtual is diarrhea boy
I'd known from working with him he will
always be a diary boy it's what I like
about him I promise you that for these
next four years I will still have IBS
yeah so here's the message to you people
the standard president Trump Virgil will
have twice the amount of diarrhea the
Sun will rise in the morning and I will
go into the subway and be really sweaty
and worried that it breaks down I'm
proud of the boys though that like we
held together against her diarrhea
against their entire plan [ __ ] up and
that just shows how powerful being
spectrum is yeah because like you don't
you actually everything nothing actually
emotionally affects you except for what
people are like oh I think diesel and
steam are the same thing you're like you
[ __ ] piece of [ __ ]
I cannot believe what has happened to
her country but people kept coming up to
me after the show and saying like hey
you guys did great considering the
circumstances and I'm like ah what
happened perfect when you read our lines
a little little insider info and the on
the chapo election night DVD extras you
will see the alternate universe of our
ending where Virgil declared it looks
like Hillary's gonna win and Felix is
Jack the Ripper character goes into the
bathroom and shoots himself I was really
going to kill myself Hillary wins so
like you know hey silver lining you know
not because I don't want to want me to
be president but because it's part of
the show like you had to be contiguous
with the source material and I had to
die so yeah um like I said we're we're
all living in the zone right now
Bill Mitchell is our dad and and the
fact that this this illusion was so
widely shared does not make the sting
any less acute at least for me I mean we
talked on the show so much about how
Hillary had no appeal to basically any
voter group yeah right and how her
entire campaign was organized around
appealing to these like rich enclaves of
moderate Republican suburbanite shout
out Chuck Schumer on Akers Virginia and
[ __ ] and how if she was totally ignoring
the rest of the country but for me I
just felt like there was there was going
to be such a thing as a negative
mobilization that people were gonna be
so disgusted by the idea of this Joker
being president that they would vote
against him and I think we found out
that's not how it works
people needs now to vote for they're not
gonna vote again and you know what what
I what I what I've been thinking about
is like like I said this tug-of-war
between like my rational the rational
brain and like the kind of media
super-ego and like this kind of like
Bill Mitchell the gut instinct and I the
moment I think back to was our first
night in Philadelphia covering the DNC
when we were watching that Horror Show
on television and we were sitting there
in Nick's house and that was the first
time like we're in my gut I thought holy
[ __ ] they're gonna lose this election
yeah and then like but little by little
I was able to sort of build a levee
against that you know like I said not
unreasonably so considering but like at
the same time was a kind of a bulwark
against like that's like the you know
the psychic trauma of considering Trump
being president or them losing it and
what made me feel that that first night
watching the DNC is I was thinking like
okay if I'm watching this if I'm
watching this right now and I'm a voter
in any of those states that Hillary lost
in the Upper Midwest or Pennsylvania or
Florida
regardless of you know race gender etc
etc if my life has been more precarious
since 2008 and I'm worried about the
future what am I seeing here tonight
and what what you saw was Donald Trump
as a mean rotten person and Hillary
Clinton deserves to be President by you
know just by virtue of her existence
that's it you also saw their fight song
yeah yeah yeah I bet I remember
yesterday it occurred to me that I
looked through my tweets and I found
that in February I realized that is when
I first had an inkling that this was
could go wrong and I tweeted and it was
when she had launched America is already
great yes to make America great again
and I tweeted you know America is
already great and a voter just thinking
I'm gonna go with this guy he may be a
screaming works lunatic but he
acknowledges there's a [ __ ] problem
yeah and and like I just yeah I like
everybody I just convinced myself that
polls meant things that that campaign
infrastructures mean things and that
more importantly than anything I think
that we all or at least a critical mass
of Americans had an innate resistance to
the idea that we should destroy all
barriers between entertainment and
politics like that's why we I thought
that and I think most people thought
that Trump lost the debates is because
he just seemed like a reality TV clown
and she seemed like a real politician
and I think we all assumed that people
still wanted a real politician but I
think that's gone I think I think we
were like basically the last people to
realize that for the most people who
watch 80 hours of television a week and
who process everything through what they
see on TV that that that barrier is
non-existent and probably hasn't existed
for years know that the barrier is
non-existent and a corollary to you know
Donald Trump our game show host
president I have a hundred percent
notice on the other side among among
liberals now who all throughout the
election and then now dealing with the
trauma of facing up to the reality of it
are once again we're treating into
fantasy and entertainment and pop
culture you know I mean like all the
harry potter [ __ ] you know like it's
just like it's the same sort of retreat
into kind of and this
Staal juh and away from the grim
realities of the world that enabled
Donald Trump and it's a hundred percent
true for liberals and Democrats as well
yeah it's like it's not one side I mean
a lot of people who voted for Trump are
like hey I saw him on TV he seemed like
a good businessman he really you know he
sure told meatloaf what was what but
just is the same thing you had liberals
create these fantasy worlds where yes
they're they're [ __ ] Dumbledore or
whatever I mean it's like you think the
people you think you think do you think
the adults who like view the world in
popular culture exclusively through
entertainment design for children do you
think they're having a hard time
understanding went that a bad guy won
yeah well it's something I said - Felix
maybe a week before they're not actually
a few days before the election we were
doing the predictions and I said you
know narrative Lee yeah the only thing
that makes sense here is him winning
that's the only correct conclusion for
the past you know 16 months of this
campaign you know uh didn't we kind of
presume that she would win almost kind
of based on another medium for children
uh Aaron Sorkin West Wing fantasy yeah
that Americans would all come to their
senses and say we support the the
principled politician the one who's who
reached out to Henry Kissinger but
really no we're not but really most
people and say instead of going look
don't let good be they don't let perfect
be the enemy of good and listen you son
of a [ __ ] Donald Trump and Mike Pence
if it's illegal to love a man well I
love a man called the truth and I suck
his [ __ ] dick and it comes in my face
you bastard son of the [ __ ] ignoramus
my god Mike Pence what else will you
electrocute will you electrocute the
trade deficit there is so many / there's
so many perfect fuck-ups of this thing
that mirrored the insanities of Clinton
world you had their obsession with
mythical moderates these people know my
god eight freaks they
love their mythical moderates whether
they are you know performing female
genital mutilation or locking women in
cages in Syria these moderate rebels or
if they're you know country club
Republicans that they were vying for who
in the end told them to go [ __ ] a girl
thing fake mom we talked about that
Chuck Schumer line it's a stunning
example of malpractice it's it's insane
and he's going to be the Senate Minority
Leader Matt what did he quote it he said
and this is very close to a direct quote
for every blue-collar vote we lose in
Pennsylvania we pick up to moderate
Republican women in the Philly suburbs
and she got seven percent of Republican
voters which means that she absolutely
did not get those [ __ ] moderate
Republican women she just lost the
blue-collar voters and a [ __ ] story
yeah I did like Chuck Schumer like I
like he should be put to death
focused on all these [ __ ] lips are
like oh the rising tide of fascism oh
now I know what it's like to live in 30s
Germany he lost by it's looking like
maybe two million votes he got a where
he did worse than McCain or Romney he
did not do well in terms of raw vote
Tory yeah this is this is the most
important in this election she lost it
through bad strategy bad messaging being
a bad candidate it was not won by Donald
Trump that needs to be [ __ ]
emphasized exactly he was like he wasn't
swept to power on some like huge
outpouring of like white supremacy or
you know peppe's all coming out to vote
I feel like to quote to paraphrase the
great herm Edwards
the Republican voter is who we thought
they were it's the same people who voted
for Romney it's the same people who
voted for McCain nobody voted for
Clinton or not enough people did as we
said earlier she thought that she was
entitled to that Obama coalition just by
virtue of her existence or being a woman
or whatever but offered them nothing and
did no one but they didn't come out for
her in the same numbers
that they did for Obama that won him all
those states twice vo and that's it
that's it you know like and it's the
thing there's the thing like there
weren't enough of them to win in any any
election where you give a [ __ ]
opposition and Matt and Matt you you've
you spoken about this too and I think
it's also important like there's a lot
of talk now about oh do we need to like
reach out to Donald Trump supporters or
whatever it's like no [ __ ] that we need
to reach out to the people who don't
vote who didn't vote way bigger pool of
people it's a way bigger pool of people
and it's a way more persuadable there
were some people who voted for for Trump
who had voted for Obama twice and an
appeal guess what an appeal to the
people who were unengaged
and didn't show up this time it'll pick
them up by accident you don't have to
direct anything specifically to them but
I just think like we need to be yeah
like just be on the lookout now for like
everybody who in there like
post-election analysis or post-mortem or
whatever he's trying to play it off like
this was inevitable or there was nothing
that could have been done or that like
America is just so irredeemably racist
that as soon as they heard that dog
whistle it was just all over because
like I'm sorry like that [ __ ] is as
ignorant as like the most like baying
[ __ ] who voted for Trump yeah it's not
true [ __ ] giant sack of pudding it's
not true turn it's not true and like the
people who are saying it are covering
their own ass and they're they're
basically trying to protect their
careers and they're just basically own
psyche from the like the damage of
facing up to what hey as was the story
in the primaries and like now it is the
full story of the election this campaign
laid naked the total irrelevance of
every single member of this media class
of this journalists class who spent the
past several months
clapping each other on the back at how
smart they were at making these appeals
like you saw on Saturday Night Live in
that intro that people the last one
before the election that people [ __ ]
said they cried at where Alec Baldwin
and what's-her-name broke character yes
yeah and then Kate McKinnon and Kate
McKinnon says at the end you know I
can't tell you who to vote
or but um think about the country you
want to live in and it's like [ __ ] you
like it like anyone like anyone who
doesn't have an Amazon wishlist would
heed those words I mean it's because it
boils down to aesthetics because these
people's lives are comfortable no matter
what so it boils down to their aesthetic
horror at the idea of Trump being
president which will not get somebody
off the couch who's living in the
[ __ ] [ __ ] in the Midwest who's
all of these an oxycontin addicted kid
or whatever all of this their material
conditions are not being appealed to all
of these in sense of like sense of these
abstract notions that have nothing to do
with their lives because they have real
[ __ ] problems unlike every [ __ ]
in [ __ ] Hollywood who's wringing
their hands about what right scenes
about America sleight Hollywood
digression another added benefit of the
election is that Stephen Baldwin is now
the most alpha Baldwin brother he will
be carving the Thanksgiving turkey
yeah Alec Alec and will it Billy are his
sons now well just like we are Bill
Mitchell sits does Alec gonna keep
playing [ __ ] trump that's awful doing
this awful now yeah give it to Anthony
yeah yeah so but but so like we you
remember all these endorsements for
Hillary Clinton and then like some
historic endorsements and people like oh
my god Variety endorsed New York
endorsed her and just all of this bad
clapping and like all of it all of it
was ultimately just just horrific aliy
meaningless and Matt you know congruous
with what you just said people voted
against a political a media class and
all of the people covering their asses
right now do not cannot reckon with how
much they are loathed they're just like
they're just like Hillary they thought
we have the right qualifications we look
at things the right way we experience
the world in the right way
well you it has to be totally discounted
to not value our input and it turns out
no people hate you because you are
backbiting calculating cowardly [ __ ]
weirdos who have no idea what the rest
of the world is like and it [ __ ]
showed you know what if you guys really
thought you had any effect on this [ __ ]
hello Cleveland
ladies gentlemen delegates please put
your hands together for tonight's
keynote speaker the man with the gifted
hands dr. ben Carson
hello hello thank you
thank you everybody thank you for
welcoming me I want to welcome you back
by thanking you for not being
politically correct one thing about me
is I am not politically correct if
you're looking for somebody that is
afraid of stepping on toes then you
found the wrong guy because I have been
known to walk over the toes of others to
walk on the path of righteousness huh
[Applause]
we've had some wonderful speakers this
week in this fine convocation we've had
Dana White a man who came from nothing
less than nothing he came from the city
of Boston and made his money off a
spectacle of naked men fighting each
other we have Peter Thiel who is despite
his sinful lifestyle of also who
preserves his life energy' similar to
the way that the Jehovah bites and the
argue lights did in the book of net sha
thank you Peter for being you and thank
you for letting me be mad you know what
you learn something when you put your
hands onto somebody's brain stem and you
manipulate it to make their legs kick up
in the air and pretend that they're
marching when they're really live down
on the table you learn that inside all
of us is a gift and that our only
limitations of that which we put on
ourselves and that if you can put your
hand on any part of the brain you can
break test the limits and that is what
Donald is doing to America he's reaching
his hand into our brains and wishing us
why so in conclusion I want to thank the
pyramids which were actually spaceships
that transported the aliens that people
now describe as the Egyptians that were
defeated by the Hebrews who were
actually an ancient tribe of young men
wizards something that informs
everything that they and amen day of
seeming machina it turned them red
[Applause]

another commentary I'm sorry well I've
cut you off no yeah we're gonna be doing
some we're gonna do some anarchy in in
Philadelphia this week before we can get
to that before we can make new memories
we have to process the old memories and
that began on Monday of this past week
when Brian you and Matt traveled to the
city of Cleveland the mistake by the
lake for the Republican National
Convention and you went to what I
thought a Monday was probably the
hottest event of the entire convention
the Alex Jones make America first again
don't know what was it called America
first America first with Alex Jones and
and it was originally supposed to be a
way to basically intimidate the
delegates with a show of trump support
if it had looked like Trump was gonna
get backstabbed at the convention but
once it became clear that he had it
pretty much locked down it morphed into
this unity rally and it had like a dozen
sponsors there was Infowars there was
all these different weird groups that
I'd never heard of were Christians for
Trump Millennials for Trump
bikers for Trump made a huge appearance
but so yeah it was basically sort of
this thing that had been attended to be
a show of force it ended up just kind of
being in an end zone celebration for
Trump's Francis nomination you mentioned
bikers for Trump Brian I noticed on your
on your Twitter feed covering the day's
events in Cleveland that the bikers for
Trump were aligned
to shake the hands of the police
officers who are working the event yeah
we actually followed a minute we came in
at the same time as the bikers for Trump
so they're getting off the freeway and
so are we like we were pulling in which
by the way the day before that my
facebook feed was filled with memes of
like the massive amount of bikers that
are showing up right now and in
Cleveland but it wasn't it wasn't azzam
that's photoshopped over and over again
like they clone ten bikers and just made
the line look longer but yeah we came in
with them we actually came in with the
we came in with the Trump meme truck
with the big it's got like a big huge
bumper on the front that says Trump it
was to make sure that nobody blocked the
freeway or anything that was one of the
memes that was showing up before we got
there there's a big cow catcher to clear
all the protesters out of the way you
made a way for Trump it kind of freaked
me out a little bit though like because
we're going to this America first rally
which absolutely just sounds like one of
those British like a racist British
thing cuz that's what they always call
they're like we're usually not as
elegant about the rallies that we have
it's usually like the whites only rally
or something in the United States but
they're but in Britain it's always like
you know this is the British first rally
but it's basically their clan that's
what I thought we were going to see
which I guess we kind of were in a way
but did you see the bikers shaking hands
of the police
yeah they stood across the street the
police were lined up across the street
like they do for any protest sitting on
horses and the first thing the bikers
did when they pulled up first of all a
biker gang called the gunslinger don't
[ __ ] with my gang we're called the grim
reaper laser gunners and so the
gunslingers pull up and the first thing
they do is I guess they're Jax gets off
the bike and they walks over and shakes
each one of the cops hands and a lot
that's the [ __ ] freezing
yeah the hell is that the Hells Angels
are so crazy that they would stake out
police stations and wait for the cops
come out and thank them I just say that
this makes me sick
thinking about just the once proud
tradition of outlaw biker gangs in
America just lining up to shake the
hands of the foot actually what I
imagine is that like the cops like they
come out to line up and then out of
nowhere you just hear and it's a single
point you're clapping and then it just
becomes a cascade of applause as all the
the bikers the outlaws pirates and I
don't know Highwaymen just gathered to
cheer the police purpose of this event
was to disabuse people of the notion
that bikers are cool because one of the
speakers during this a terminal thing it
was all day and started around noon went
to like five or four or five o'clock and
so it's just this collection of complete
weird all random people and some higher
profile folks but the pipe is for
someone out there and he gave this long
boring very low-energy speech about and
it was mostly it wasn't even about Trump
was about how you know people think that
people think that bikers they they sell
drugs and that they do crimes but
actually there's plenty of men and
respectable members of the community who
enjoy to do motorcycling like likes to
ride motorcycles people think people
think that motorcyclists are these
badass outlaws but actually we're
incredibly [ __ ] lame yeah Square as
hell what it's like it's like model
trains for people who aren't spectrum
banana
body strength to hold up a bike
it is sad he kept he kept throwing it
was like he was doing like a job
interview or something or he was
probably making a viral video for the
for the Facebook group tattoo acceptance
in the workplace really boring though
and and he did did the first thing he
said is like there are bikers at the top
of many industries in the United States
one being Jay Leno I don't know what his
politics are really I think one of the
things and I said this on street fight
too is that like I think these these
bikers for Trump or dudes that really
just want to be in like a charity group
like a Toys for Tots type of thing but
that's not cool enough so they have to
call it a gang they have to name it like
the gunslingers like they're a biker
gang that's more focused on like breast
cancer Toys for Tots it's selling minute
okay the next to ask you about from the
from from Monday's rally Matt you
mentioned that there was an amazing
musical guest to sound quite an
inspirational song it was it was a
co-production of Alex Jones and Roger
stone and Roger stone spoke later people
who are maybe perhaps aren't familiar
Roger stone is a longtime Republican rat
[ __ ] and dirty trickster and started
out with the Nixon administration but
he's been in New York State politics for
a long time a lot of people speculate
that Roger stone was the person who
basically set up Eliot Spitzer through
his many many connections in the world
of prostitution swinging and kink
perfect decadent pervert Republican he's
like he's like the upper echelon
he's like the Domino mask Eyes Wide Shut
Republican elite
a tattoo of Richard Nixon on it he does
right on the small in the between his
shoulder blades so he had a street team
there because he was selling his book
about the Clintons and he had a guy
there like this old dude in a great
ponytail who he talked to
he had a shirt that had a Shepard Fairey
thing of Clinton Bill Clinton and it
said rape honest but he was there with
this young woman she was like in her 20s
maybe early 30s I think she was like a
Russian immigrant or something and she
did a song it was like a 90s ask sort of
post-grunge a lot of some Morissette
song and there's this long pause and all
of a sudden she just goes it's like a
[ __ ] course it's like if Lisa Loeb
were racist and you say Benghazi was
about a video when little wayne says it
it's okay the other thing that really
struck me is that there were never more
than maybe 200 people for the event over
the course of the day and at every point
they were at least matched and perhaps
outnumbered by reporters there was you
guys we were there such a blonde
we saw Tim Heidecker and Victor gur saw
Chris Hayes who's a fan of the show by
the way we just outed him he's in
trouble with MSNBC you know david korn
who i wanted to push into the [ __ ]
river and most disgustingly jamie kirkuk
was there sweating in a pinstripe suit
on the [ __ ] hill right in this little
note just a slight digression on on Jake
Kirk
he had an article last week saying it
would be a shame if the military had to
intervene and take over our democracy
because of Donald Trump I wouldn't want
that to happen so when is when Jaime
Couric is on the road and away from his
handlers does he have like a spotter
with him that tosses him fish with his
[ __ ] dolphin teeth
hey is swollen man he was mad swollen
but the thing was set up this is that
they the stage was right next to the
river and then there was a hill that
everyone sat on looking down on it and
then there was a concrete runnings path
and Plaza above it which is where the
vendors were that's also where most of
the reporters were and it felt like a
Victorian surgical operating theater
like like these people were the elephant
men and the lifts are up there like I
want to show you something
globalist right now if you look at this
disgusting globalist freak you'll notice
the only thing untouched by the
globalists or is genitals yeah they were
I mean the first time we really got to
see him get fired up even was like Eric
Andre got on stage oh yeah yeah yeah
yeah I wanted to talk about this this is
the next thing that I saw from there
Eric Andre a comedian who just doesn't
give a [ __ ] really
and I give him a lot of props he [ __ ]
made a lot of waves at the RNC man he
had some great videos coming out this
week but you guys saw him get on stage
with a global global news and Bors
prison planet
[Music]
because he was trying to get on stage he
had a big mic taped to a pole he was
trying to get on stage and I thought
they were gonna [ __ ] kill him
because they kept pacing him back and
they were screaming in his face and at
one point cuz I was up on the hill and
he was down next to the stage I saw him
fall down and like oh they're stomping
him to death but then I went down to see
what's going on he was up at that point
he was trying to get back in with my
wife part of the whole thing was that
the Daily Show's the Pentagon black op
that was pretty impressive I mean that's
another thing I'm one of many things
that those guys have in common with with
the more strident quote-unquote
anti-imperialists is the belief that any
like vaguely left-of-centre media
property is operated by there you know
have not been taking it all in
did you speak to any of the any of the
crowd who was there or in earnest yeah
yeah we have I actually came away from
it with a good amount of sympathy for a
lot of these people because I went to we
talked about it on the show I think in
May in suburban Cincinnati is one of the
wealthier bedroom communities in the
north of Cincinnati and the crowd there
was really a bunch of pretty vile smug
chubby comfortable suburban Knights who
were clearly getting their rocks off
that they got to you know be politically
incorrect but this was you know an
Infowars event in northern Ohio these
are some hard
Grabill folks these people were not
we're not like smug suburban knights
these people had seen some [ __ ] there
was one dude who was very animated in
the front of the thing who really stuck
with me he had on a tie-dyed trunk shirt
black socks pulled up almost to his
knees and no front teeth what to speak
of and that was sort of emblematic from
alike these are people who have had it
tough and listening to them have
conversations and stuff the stuff that
they were talking about they had
obviously some dumb [ __ ] opinions
about black lives matter and stuff like
that but a lot of the things they were
talking about was the industrialization
and trade that was the thing that they
were really kind of fixated on and even
when they talked about illegal
immigration the crowd anyway they were
really talking about it in terms of jobs
so like it really is how you see the the
way the people who have been [ __ ] over
if you speak to them in sort of their
language you can kind of get them on
board with with what is in general a
pretty shitty policy because of the fact
that you at least turn acknowledging the
[ __ ] things that are going on in
their lives and in the world I heard one
woman talking about how Hillary Clinton
is you know above the law and how
there's one set of rules for people at
the top and one on the bottom and I'm
like [ __ ] that she ain't wrong I can't
argue that she's not right about that so
yeah it was it was a more there was more
pathos in this crowd than and among
Trump events I've been to in the past
right and what was your take did you
talk to anyone I did I talked to a bunch
of people I you know what it was really
mostly people that I would have I felt
like it was people I grew up with I grew
up in like a suburb of Columbus Ohio
like how kind of half rural half like
suburban and it was basically that it
was just broke people that didn't have
jobs that are probably been shuffled
into serviced like 15 service jobs in
the last five years and they're just
[ __ ] tired of it you know one lady
lately event she said I think she was
trying to cover for the fact that it was
relatively and on poorly attended she
goes we have so many people here this
week or gonna
be fighting and making their voices
heard they weren't here today because
they actually have jobs because that's
like a classic moves that they always
pull on left-wing demonstrators as yeah
people people are demonstrating because
they have to work and they're like well
you just said [ __ ] you to everybody
who's in this on this event who actually
did show didn't get much of a response
from the audience and another thing
about the the bikers and stuff world is
just a lot of it there were a lot of
veterans too it was like the veteran
bikers that are like I didn't fight for
this country so I could press one for
English it was it was that it was just
that crowd that they didn't seem
dangerous they seemed old they were
bikers that look up to Jay Leno and a
bunch of kind of like he said what I
guess we'd call him Lonnie's like just
people that you know probably spend most
of their time like smoking cigarettes
and [ __ ] drinking cheap beer on their
front porch got a chance to come out and
be not politically correct another
conversation that was happening a lot
around there and Alex Jones even
mentioned Ron Paul's name in the speech
he's like we've tried over and over
again we tried with Ron Donald Trump and
it looks like it's gonna happen and you
could walk around and and every single
person was talking about bankers and I
think that is like that's so emblem at
well first of all it's probably
anti-semitic it's probably missing that
subtext but there was a lot of talk
about the Federal Reserve and gold and
stuff like that I think a lot of people
that were let down by Ron Paul not
winning like I said we were among the
Infowars people so a lot of the issues
that they were most focused on were like
fluoride in the water and 9/11 being an
inside my favorite song from the 1919
60s and 70s by a higher on butterfly
[Music]
was so funny to me because the other big
focus of the event that we haven't
talked about yet is was throwing Hillary
in jail the big showing and they had
shirts that a lot of people had that
they were selling because he's a [ __ ]
you know he's a [ __ ] snake oil
salesman he's selling t-shirts and
vitality potions and stuff like that but
what I thought listen honey I wish I had
been oh yeah you could have cleaned up
which I had been silent no speech they
were so fixated on throwing Hillary in
jail presumably over maybe Benghazi but
the thing they kept talking about was
the emails and I just kept thinking you
people think that George Bush did 9/11
focused on getting the guy who killed

senior zinger
kate upton shows up to your house and when a tray of in and out burger tray of in and out burger french maid outfit
the new playstation five
play with you than absurd
he do
felix i yeah everyone
jack shit tracked
i really enjoyed your video about the when these tweets oh
his favorite corporate brand now i love where is because all the tweets are like
it's they turn to pick up like sort of disconnected but socially conscious style of irony from like two thousand and fourteen words like
so for far she's are pretty cool
our core gender conformity people are like where did when these good so good at tweet
i just you know using my extreme comedic ability i thought what if it was like they are
similar to the point that they did because our theory
jews dna which actually have been thinking about that anti semitic it
started from vegas con and that's cool yeah it's pretty cool yeah we all the central thing is now like two percent or sometimes we descended from
john africa
it means when people say we're all africans were from the founder the continent of africa africa was the what is it the move guy
they're all somebody africa and i always wanted i think john waters talked about this he said i wish someone would make a movie that sue africa who was the one white person in move and she just was kind of their and no one really explain why good for her
the documentary must really doubt amazing always complete like one of the best documentaries because there are lots of batteries that there is no narration or any current interviews it was all just assembled from like stock like real news footage and yeah of that stuff was there and they had dad talked to and like people malls here's the
dang
obviously the philadelphia police department literally drop a bomb for the helicopter the yeah destroyed and entire middle class
i should have however if he is that documentary makes clear living in that neighborhood with those people like i always wanted to bomb that have asked whether he had like distended bellies and the guy was like oh it's because they'd so much in it's like it's because they want
only fifty eight hundred and fruit and raw vegetables the average averages must had diarrhea constantly and like that the same are not and seek shelter we're doing my alley balk i like the fact that the wendy's god tweets of the week came with the same it's time that there was a news article about how hyper explain when is of the
yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean when i was when he is more hyper exploitative and other fast food okay so you know when the girl
now i mean it's like anywhere else it's like wage i think they're all pretty much equal to me i they literally ran off the same model yeah but it's like you know that a wendy's has a space eat spicy chicken with fast fast samurai
the fouls only frosty is terrific but yeah it's like anywhere else like we wage in unpaid hours and just capriciously like taking jabs and giving them away
everything that a shitty him or any company has wendy's is my favorite national fast food chain yeah acre it's my go to
papa i i ok
it's a compromise is now ubiquitous as a national ice is i think it is because i like ergo had my as as the best sides
that those biscuits
the get i've got here below and fodder clouds may say my face reactivate my favorite like not national but very big look like tri state area chain
you guys know what i'm going to say fuck it covers and i didn't know that i'll ever have a great oh god
we can see how this whole has as dairy treat that's true custody is the best frozen and tree what separates custard
eggs oh that richer oh it's just kind of velvety now and the luxury of aren't fat yeah it's worse for you that parties
guy that are my favorite part of any meal the mouth feel
if i don't have about know what i'll feel feel with that mouth feel isn't up to par i'm not interested when you get a little bit older and start really not just you know you're you're in a relationship where your folk hotels are doing friends with benefits and talking about the saw connecting union queen are going to go to covert years and instead
of asking her how the cheese turns feel in her mouth
you going to toss three of those bad boys in there and watch you chewed up and then
oh ram your tongue in through it so yeah feel went in love that
i love being treated like that
love it will you toss cheese kurds in their mouth and then shoot them together and feel how the moon
real soul connecting
third i really you know we do have young impressionable listeners we don't want
we're going to do that because you told no they're not they're not dating anyone in haiti have been awesome over them

okay

a joke
magic pill
just
guys
well actually this is a good place to they actually start the show because this is this is a banner week you know for people who are really funny on twitter because we're all now everyone is a real stable genius
if you can just do a riff on that joke baby and your display name it's like tons a rack up those flaws
beginning with david frum of course you said the trump is like credo
because he said i'm smart like he insists that he's smart like credo call from the radio betrays that you haven't really seen any of the godfather movies because frito is like the also rans brother who like nobody really respects and doesn't have any power that whereas trump is like actually the president
you're just saying oh he's like this character because he is bad i just think frito is the free floating lowest hanging pop culture reference from middle age shit has with
really no frame of reference for the modern era is jay leno one movie yeah trump is like saddam hussein they're all future godfather trilogy trump trump is closer meryl streep in the devil wears prada than he is afraid that is absolutely
the news bitch
a history when people i bet when someone like in late spring of two those and fifteen when someone who was like what do you envision for america and you went through his mind it was just him and like as silk bathrobe and nascar going
anderson cooper who ever told you to part your honor that way
not the smartest move your on the wrong side of forty and just dispensing bows and anna wintour
in his eternal struggle against her and and garter
and then when it came out of his mouth he's like jobs are coming back and no mexicans
then they were like oh that sounds great
we're a bunch of racists long island shithead to hang out in a trump tower in the cop playpen it so
here's the sort of hierarchy it's like okay you start with the middle age try hards like david come like trophies alfredo then you have the no resist
there have like twenty something girls you don't really not a curse who are just like trump is a trash shit bacon dumpster garbage man and hey trump euro shit ass mother clock or and then there's me undisputed irony comedic genius
our president has a big old percy
i have a lot of fun just imagining what
orgasms are like i kind of imagine the jerking off trump would be like getting frosting out of a piping bag
i think he's like is your regular railways like a star so it comes out and there's no like plato and the way i like pigs are where they don't actually each accolade it they just dribble for a long period of time oh yeah he's like it's like a lava cake yeah exactly
just lethargic the polling or huddling in like a sort of in gillies behind like a trail few way it's a while and he gets really excited it's like the last blast have already web cam
just the slip the very end
what if what if it's like an omni directional com like it seeps out through its poors she i was thinking about that i was thinking about just like his attire every summer for labour adam has nurse where it's like where it's like it they can sweats now yes
now with saying what if he didn't have a urethra
yeah he just had like a dick dick was completely solid actually similar to the platypus he doesn't have a day he has a poisoned barb
see yeah i guess we're we're talking about this because the talk of the week of course is the michael wolff tell all book
the trophy administration
no not really sure how to feel about this you know it's like everyone's talking about it people love it because it essentially confirms what a stupid shit show everything is and how dumb everyone in the white house's you know that's on the one hand it's fun to read and it's cause this big falling out between trunk and ben and they're bitching at each other and ben and just apologize which is really fun
ran up the white flag which obviously arena
you got to choose sides the literal president of the united states no matter how stupid are disconnected and comedy yes he's still fucking president he has all the connections related to that everybody wants a piece of
he's got all the suction with all the dollars or just this fat booze sweating
i i'd who who just as a website
i got a bandana in the ran and got so high on his own supply from like reading those articles that were like he's like darth vader he's like he's like if captain hook met the judge from two now
and he was like then he read like his articles that he he like commission articles on bright part that was like the new geniuses cool stuff in japan
like he was on tour and that was all right but was for like a month and then he just read comments from like boomers were like steve buried says where i'm thinking and he's like oh i could run for president kim is masterful is donald trump and then like yeah people didn't vote for steven and they voted for arnold
because they like news gossip
they like dark machiavelli and then it didn't work it's ban in you know
what happens when any to alpha males fight he was like i'm sorry and i would love to paint
jr is not a trainer is a very smart young man
your muscles are so tight and homey big j jared what's up were looking for in swore have you been doing pushups on the plane that's abandoned said because yeah whenever too strong men fight that sort of like but like in needle respect between warriors
in michael wolff though you found like the perfect marriage of writer and subject because michael wolff is like a fish face fraud of the highest or totally full of shit and by the way michael of is not allowed to travel to germany because his face violates hate speech laws
and i really did love people who have been in just a perpetual state of apoplectic
perpetual state of apoplectic the outrage the idea that there is fake news that the media's making things up against trump and then this book comes along by this guy who admits that he basically makes things up as it goes along like yeah but it's fun
it's okay it's getting to it's truth ask even if it's not technically true it's pointing us the writers are okay if is validated everything every one of these holding more and has ever said about how the media doesn't actually give a shit about the truth congratulations millionaire
they don't know yet hands around to some they are right that's the thing that's where that's that's how trump is able to reach people even though he mostly just talks about media gossip is because he's tapping into a genuine alienation from the media yeah i mean i think it's perfect like that after this whole thing of this book by this
he's like if you created in the mind dallas of an all right guy like immediate michael off would be the perfect guy this guy is known as a fabulous and just completely full shit that the day like today jake tapper had i'm steven miller
and did my favorite jake tapper thing where he just gets a guy who's just straight up lying and doesn't know what he's talking about and he's like sir that's not the truth and everyone's like i can't believe he just did a newsman smack down and it's like that doesn't mean anything it doesn't mean anything
it doesn't matter whether it's michael wall firms like probably have full shed probably half the shit and the book is is made up or if it's jake tapper who technically is like beating some dumb as an argument because
in an adamant as culture where no one follows an internal logic no one ever hours but especially not now and it's completely tribal it's just a completely master pretoria exercise their mean
the book is meaningless the argument between ban and and trump is meaningless
the slap fight between miller and jake tapper as meaningless meanwhile every fucking inch of american coastline discuss authorized for fucking oil drill yeah way of why everyone is jerking off about jake tapper owning the miller for being the wrong type of that no nationalist jake tapper who wants
during my hair came back from the dead
trump is creating the big show disaster for metal gear solid to support it
caught out one i hit bonus
well now i feel compelled to i wanted to bring this up just sort of atone for bringing up their michael off the filth and the theory or whatever it's called
q yeah this is from the the washington post today are trump this from a fourth sorry
drug administration plane would why they expand drilling in us continental waters it says the truman administration and the controversial proposal thursday to permit drilling in most us continental shelf waters including protecting protected areas of the arctic and atlantic where oil and gas exploration is opposed by governors from new jersey to florida under the proposal only one of two thousand and
explaining areas in the arctic ocean pacific ocean gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean will be off limits the oil and gas exploration according to interior secretary ryan zinc he said the bureau of ocean and energy may make management is to forty seven potential areas where in industry companies can buy leases between twenty nineteen and twenty twenty four when the proposed
would begin and end so yeah like look forward to more deepwater horizon in the future
it's sort of like i guess an underrated thing about the trump administration and underrated a horror is like the and all the environmental things that they're just absolutely gutted it's really terrifying also there's the clean air act as well
they're expand their allowing companies to dump fucking tailings and to tributary now in a way that was banned before just selling off meant much of the national park system again for extraction industry and amazingly enough drilling and and or something that was a multiyear brutal battled around the bush a minister
they ultimately couldn't get even with a republican congress just sailed through as part of the tax bill basically nobody mentioning it you people would allow people to alaska wants or they don't because they want the check yeah they want they want they want more of that that sweet sweet luker yeah alaska is their political representation
so weird because it's like it's just understood that the us rap and the two senators from alaska their entire job is just to drift
it
and rewarding a little bit to the taxable and murkowski vote for it i wasn't as matter as i was for as i was it like susan collins because it's like well that's the that's the job for alaska
it's got to get the drifted just got a just got to get it so people like i don't get another another community center that's paid for by like no work labour it's sort of like the sopranos but everyone is christopher
i love your member deepwater horizon of course of talking about the movie with mark wahlberg
not be an actual oil spill now
you also like still the effects of that are still not even widely we weren't even able to do to assess the true scale of that disaster but there's probably some urban area in the gulf of mexico probably the size of connecticut that's just like a dead zone around but nothing is and again like effects of is so be long long reaching and
i read here from drilling also has its supporters including house majority whip steve school of santa he says with this program my constituents whose jobs depend on the energy industry can rest easy knowing that oil and gas development as a priority for this administration with increase exploration and production in the gulf of mexico and
yeah and we will be able to create more jobs and continue to receive revenue sharing it's vital to rebuilding our coasts to which i say boy
yeah and even if none of these things blow up even if nothing leaks and any of these oceans
life on earth cannot sustain itself if we take all the shit out of the ground period like the stuff that's in the ground largely has to stay there or else we will fucking microwave everything to death
but people have jobs right up until the moment that their skin melts off their body and that's what counts and those jobs are great and they're fantastic jobs and their long term they were down to the community
they're healthy yeah like look at those those freaking camps in north dakota you can't car a great time
that is a thriving social order right there it's just a birthday party every day all these guys in these fucking wants that huts all stabbing one another
sex trafficking people it's awesome yet
i think like half the people overthrow the bar in same paul or people who were oil workers in north dakota
and it made me very sad because i really like their big night out
like they're big vacation night out ways to go to saint paul minnesota
a party in north dakota began know they were lunatics because they were work to the bone i mean it's like any other industry in modern america where the jobs of five people are give the one person but they're also just bloated up with opiates for their injuries and then math to balance it out
you know actual math or like by hands or something
and they will make a shit load of money of oil is above a certain price but if it isn't they're just their estimates go completely off and they get laid off and they went into debt by an s u v but facts you a philadelphia and let the fire burn though did you guys see the local news footage from philly of
with the da's krasner just fired walking
i actually i should link this in the episode description it's from local philly news so there are like common or near the water
ours are new da's been fired all these cops and prosecute okay krasner that's so fucking bright spot for two thousand and eighteen the footage of in probably zero degree temperatures scores of these fucking prosecutors carrying cardboard boxes full of like world's greatest lawyer
pencils out of their shitty offices just trudging through the snow it's just just news rubble looks on their face honestly fed my soul and yeah is that and i get about that's how you fucking reform is just clear out the fire these fuckers there's no reforming them with these people having their job that's that's such a
good sign that he got in there was just like day one you fired
what's funny is that the local local i read an article for the choir
they said first of all they gave plenty of space for all these cops and prosecutors say rule are destroying our ability to do a job
but also they said why did they fire these thirty it might be because they pissed off his wife who's a judge like the process anything outside of just petty fucking personal vendettas there's no real like the idea that a guy who campaigned and wholesale radical change the way that they prosecute crime in the city would have to fucking fire people to make that
happened just doesn't even compute play you have to fire people who is like entire lives and careers are based around the exact opposite of what he's attempting to do in criminal justice system
yeah i they saw coming i bet they did but still you know i bet a lot of the looks on their faces at like they're like we're talking a thirty year veteran of the da's office you know i don't know what's a good filly shit had no nikki casts of widowed
and he had a look on his face like maybe up and so on and he had put your stuff to one of those cardboard boxes he thought that he could like you know
yeah out as this guy to worry about it
oil furnace and it's fine
i do you want to talk about
a little bit more serious and i want to about the the profile the very long
profile james rise in that was in the intercept this week matt you read it it's fairly explosive can we talk a little bit about that peace and important well he talks about his his personal genes rise in as he was your times is then i have sat here and order reporter for them during the bush years and
he got the he had access to the fucking essay spying story that was later confirmed by edward snowden in two thousand and four
before the election and
he was not allowed to publish it essentially by the new york times because they were told by government officials like michael connelly the rice that it was too sensitive we were at war we were saving american lives and so as a result they couldn't talk about it and for over a year they stopped him from public
pushing this this information until he basically force them to by writing it in a book
that he had contracted outside of the new york times publishing empire basically the situation was it was either going to be in a book a room know why the hell has in in the newspaper or it was going to be in both and they eventually blink them they publish to make he got a pulse for it
but only after being stopped for over here from he publishing it basically because the government as the bill keller and those people nicely
and the asian me is like i don't know whether it would have made a difference in their twenty two thousand and four election however would have had some effect and the conscious choice that the bush administration
demanded that they not publish what the new york times were complicit in i think putting a film on the scale for that election but the funny thing is is that they actually thought of it the other way they felt like publishing it would have been influencing the election and therefore it was more fair to not publish it because someone who is because
first thought was that one of the people who was a source might have had an agenda might have had a political agenda and so it would be not right to sort of help them by publishing something that might change the election but essentially what what he details in this article is that the government does
have veto power over what the new yorker absolutely and it wasn't just say story before that during the run up to the iraq war he he had stories that that called into question the accusations about weapons of mass destruction in iraq and ties to al qaeda and the that were largely butchered and spiked
and none of this was anything like the situation where there was a threat of legal legal action there was never any suggestion by the government that it would be illegal for them to publish the stuff they just said it would be bad will be bad for america be bad for national security and they bought it and sometimes they lied to them for example they gave them the idea that that
they were just collecting data nobody was leading emails are listening the phone calls which was a lot
but the one thing from it that really stuck with me is after the whole thing was over bill keller reflecting on it well you know i didn't want to publish in two thousand and four because the
america's
this the moment everyone felt very scared we were very worried about terrorism and we be trusted the government to stop it what's this we and then a year later but or two years later
by that point bush was in the toilet nobody trusted him the edge kind of come off of that that post nine eleven hysteria and so he said and so the atmosphere is different and they could publish it and he said i was happy i'm i'm pleased with my decision to not publish it and then i'm pleased with my decision to publish it because the national me
mood had changed which is basically saying that they're too much too cowardly and too worried about getting yelled at essentially to go against a presiding of mood which like what what the fuck are you if you can only trail after changes in national perception you are literally doing nothing
the second bush administration is very interesting as opposed to the first because when they talk about this national mood changing what they mean is like basically around circa two thousand and six was when
sort of elite consensus left the bush administration
they gave up on right and the funny thing is is is is basic premise you'd say well yeah ok maybe maybe bush is a champ maybe we don't trust them anymore but aren't we still at war we still facing all these threats isn't possible nine eleven around every corner and we need every mechanism of the national security state including this illegal wire
tapping stuff to to combat it well no because if the president is a champ and an incompetent to let's an american city drowned or whatever
then the thought of him being in charge of protecting us is too disturbing so we're going to revise down the threat that we think we're in it's all in our head when we when we when we trust the president and it's a significant threat because we trust him to protect us from it
but if he's a fucking idiot and a clown and and incompetent than the threat can't be that big know
about the fact that he was then after the bush administration subpoenaed for his sources by the obama administration well it went through started under bush and then it went through to obama and it was all part of this one whistle blowers that really took up the second part of the bush administration or than really intensified under obama
and one of his sources was sent to prison over it
and i think that was the most interesting thing that popped up to me and as someone who as will will remember because he was to was sort of a young resistance lived during the bush years
according to rise in the thing that changed the government attitude towards leaking which used to be there be a leak and the government kind of shake their fists but they wouldn't really pursue finding out how it happened because it would involve this really dicey showdown with the press the could end up looking bad pr perspective so we didn't really pursue
trying to force government officials perforce force reporters into revealing sources
then patches fitzgerald's investigation of plane gate
changed everything according to rise and he says that fitzgerald went to hog wild trying to find the person who leaked mallory his name to the to yeah and so he subpoenaed a ton of reporters judy miller actually went briefly to jail if people remember that
and that sort of set the tenor and then everything was it was different after that and to me that was really resident because i remember routing like hell for the plane good investigation yeah no i mean i want to fight with the plane good thing because i think it's interesting because me personally like matt was obsessed
during the bush administration and i thought like this is what's going to bring him down yeah think this is why i have an immunity to like the russia stuff now because i feel like i've had that illness before and now like my immune system is built up and the idea was that i was so
intent i added that the prospect of karl rove going to jail for a leaking state you know cia agents name or something like so tantalizing ask me that i was willing to essentially look to be delivered from this nightmare the bush administration from a fucking federal prosecutor like patrick that
again
i undertook a rather nasty assault on the freedom of the press yes and the idea that judy miller went to yale is of course likely satisfying because she should be in jail
oh yeah for her awful prewar report aren't of that's also an attack on the press judy miller is a rotten person and should be punished in some way however it's know it's like this patrick fitzgerald they was the prado people who have sex fantasies about robert more yes absolutely and james call me that the indictments came down i remember this
whether the indictments came out in december
and people were calling it fits smith and they were saying merry christmas online
because he was fitzgerald and it was christmas
christmas and people were so fucking site they a little pellets and so it's the same thing as the rush of thing where you're rooting for the fucking this this government apparatus this law enforcement machinery and the fucking c i a like carrying that of a officer got fucking got unveiled
that that's to you a horrible fucking miscarriage just i mean people remember if i can fill up the seventies i mean if that had happened under bush and you'd be rooting for the government to kill him or something
generally like those years like made liberals like more mentally deficient because right after nine eleven i would say like pretty much everyone except barbara lee went along with the mission in afghanistan and for most people who their default is not giving a shit about
foreign policy when there's an opportunity for you to get mad and have a vendetta and be very serious and get very emotional thinking about the brave soldiers and thinking that there's actually some good and evil struggle where you can side with the most powerful military in the world and it's good
it was very calming for people to do and then iraq and i would say enough democrats went along for along with it that this generation of liberals they couldn't
criticized the concept of or the concept to them either
the myth of like the liberal dove has always been a myth and america
they've always going along with every major intervention but this was just the one that did it for this for this generation and so when the time came when like the post nine eleven love of bush wore off they they couldn't hit at him at a moral standpoint it had to be like oh you were mean
oh you didn't disclose these documents properly or oh your daughter's like to get drunk
just the most fucking sub mental mind numbing lines of attack and the plane good thing like yeah i don't think they should have disclosed the undercover agent i mean i think you should just blow the cover every
once and fucking give a shit
but it's like that's the thing that's the thing about bush that you'd taken down that that he blew the cover valerie plane not that he killed these two million people and now you see the rebate now it's like people are like oh you think nothing happened with russia it's like now i think like russia the greasy is
entry in the world besides maybe ukraine which is why i support them in their struggle against them
the radio shack of countries
i think like they probably did something weird with the rush of people donald trump
but in the face of everything else i don't fucking give a shit give a while the real damage is when you end up
looking for some sort of procedural way out of out of a disagreeable administration by rooting for this apparatus of state that is persists long after
any given presidents gone and does way more damage in the long run that is the real the real danger in fact one of the people who went to the new york times to convince the matter to report on the center say stuff was fucking james komi
got a ladder
shiloh eyed man all right he got shined up because he was when when obama appointed him f b i director one of the stories a got put out was the he was one who stood up against the and essays by it said it was fucked up but then a few months later after they did it anyway he was at the new york times selling them not to fucking report on it james caan a can i just say how much i can not
can that mother fucker
big lurch dumb ass the trucking brill cream statue shit
like every to every fucking ever since he got fired this guy spent like four decades framing muslims for like yeah trying to assassinate wall
like all his agency does is like send some fucking long island shit are some mormons sociopath to go on i c q and find any thirteen year old most on to go head you want to do not eleven we do it every year and you can take part in it like
when they say yes going oh we stopped him we stop nine eleven who just one of the most egregious evil agencies the guy that runs a child opponents are not some ministry and this fucking is fucking scumbag he's spent his entire life throwing people in solitary confinement forever for the rest of their lives he gets treated slightly unfairly
once he gets fired by the dumb ass president and he's obviously like even if there wasn't this whole back story by that you would go into whatever seven figure gig at like a law of or something or just make speeches called like the justice of honor at the fucking foundation for remove in riyadh and
he gets treated slightly unfairly maybe one one millionth of our he was treated anyone else in the world either at the f b i or his career as a federal prosecutor
and all he does now is just make people take silhouette pictures of him against the sunset and going
when the times are hard
good then must be great
and it gets fifty million recruits the underlying thing to play a game was that value claims husband joe wilson was in fact right about the spurious nature of the getting uranium from africa what african country was a nightmare nigeria
and then in my head have been so obsessed with it like i thought like the war on terror administration like the troop kiss is like this is too much people are finally going to really realize the hypocrisy there they're exposing to danger one of our agents he's supposed to be fighting the war on terrorism and a god
that's embarrassing out because you know like felix said if i had that knock less like mission impossible i'd gladly egg all of you
okay i see it like you see them every little thing like you know now
the us navy is like the amelia delia of military branches like they're just getting lost all the time and it's pretty funny
but every time they get like
things where they've been lost in the persian gulf gotten lost in north korea despite one hundred trillion dollars being spent on special computers for them to never get lost and people are like donald trump weren't you taking leadership on our members of our military being in danger
it's the same everything words we never interrogate this idea that we have so many boats going around the world that are supposed to scare people that they just crash into each other no it's the donald trump didn't send their families a card when he's like sorry
the gps fucked up
you know i've got a lot of for on boats
larry silverstein let's just say we put the eiffel tower the hudson
they want to do that call he thinks we have let her or visible plane yeah how the fuck is he going to fix all my three much after he would love that
never never know what's going on inside is an invisible yeah like wonder woman of jeffrey actually don't know okay jeffrey we're not doing that never with the sailors like when it were up in
iran is water is and they have commandeered and they gave them juice box of shit and people were like dave humiliated or chef
they may they may sit down and drink juice boxes while they waiting for their parents the competitive mother
yeah those sell it looked like they were at his sleep over at like someone's they like fills asleep with gum and their hair and got over their clothes and the iranian kids like here is where our close
that level of humiliate that was the mole with the us navy lost its confidence and just started getting lost all the time
it's it's you to close out this week's show i want to get to this piece that was one of my favorite things that i've read recently this was right before the new year is a profile done in the new york times about the latest trend that is sweeping the valley and all of the smartest people in the world of course of talking
about the raul water
movement
what is for all water you may ask is basically untreated water that is now being sold for like sixty dollars a gallon some of the most gullible shit heads the
in the new york times this is an article by nellie bowls from december twenty ninth of last year headline unfiltered fervor the rushing to get off the water great now keep in mind when you read this article though water grad we we can be very critical of the society we live in society is
bullshit as fiona apple and thirty i'm world and bullshit world is blackjack
our civilization is evil however i feel pretty confident saying i think what are the things that we can be proud of as a civilization is the fact that basically well in most parts of the country
can turn on a faucet
and get water that you can drink and not die the fact that there are so many parts of this country that have bad water that have will added water like flint and countless other means that's bad that's something that we should fix because it is genuinely a miracle of modern civilization that we have created this network that allows access to this life
so that we don't shoot ourselves to that again is welcome to life hacker those weird faucets and dreams you have in your apartment they're not just decorated you can use it to clean the dirt off your disgusting nude body could even wear a bathing suit if you want or you can put it into what's called a cop and drink it
you don't die
has been life back so because like this is the thing that all it needs is more money and more investment it doesn't need to be reinvented it actually works if we would just fucking funded free mother fucking watershed to jail you buy new favorite person on the internet so keep that in mind
maybe even taken for granted the fact that you can turn on the faucet in your house and have water that you kid wash yourself with you can drink you can cook with it it's right there and you can pull it out on the ground it's just leave him one hundred and eleven knock you out
freeze it and put it in any other beverages here's a little easter egg if you got what's called for skin
dip your penis into a container of water and clean the land that baby mac pillow back just you take all the out you know the gun in there you can take it out daughter
buff that hard
sanford okay in san francisco and the valley there's dammit different idea so ridiculous
reading from this article it rainbow grocery a cooperative in the city missing district one brand of water is so popular that it's often out of stock but wouldn't recent evening there is a glittering rack of it glass or containing two point five gallons of what is billed as raw water unfiltered own treat
id and sterilize spring water thirty six ninety nine each and fourteen ninety nine per refill that's my lady arbuckle took a bath
my glistening or because of
it's not like those little specks of lint dead skin in they're they're like little flavor cursed
old slog
you go it has a vaguely mild sweetness and then re smooth mouth feel yeah that's the colorado oh yeah that's the electoral lights from the fat guy that took a bath
nothing that overwhelms the flavor profile
thirty nine a shift manager at the store bottled water is controversial we've curtailed our water selection but this is totally outside that whole lotta it's a glistening orb yeah here on the west coast and and other pockets of stupidity
many people are looking to get off the water grid like we said that amazing thing that allows us to like live in have like a clean yeah easing society anybody gets to do it the thing is these people are violently opposed to any kind of social good they hate anything that everybody gets because
they're not special remember fucking il en masse talking about how awful public transportation yes you're surrounded by just anybody
give me the other they hate that they're special perfect beings of genius and they should not have to drink the same water as every other fucking sub normal club that they have nothing but contempt for the hogs the fucking future cattle that they just want to basically turn into batteries and oregon farm say down enjoy any sense of kind of big key
immunity air collectivism and i and i hate the idea of community in the way that it's normal years but the fact that you can get on a buys and basically look around and see sesame street he said one or two people sounds like piss is like an actual wonderful human part of living in an urban center and these people don't like that part know they want to be carried around
a jet propelled little crystal ball everybody can look at the end of the shuttle around the town in there floating author or other little water or floating through thousand so everyone could look at the would be like that's a special that guy knows how to cope yeah yeah
musk felix i didn't see that you've uncovered the fact that not made out you on musk is a rockabilly ilan he said
whereas paper he said
i've never heard him speak so i'm just going to do an approximation of work but he sounds like a sort of a south african dracula
like
the next to a supercharged frustration for tesla
we're going to have waitresses on skates and they drive in movie theater and minds poodle skirt
and like you know switch flick knives
he on modesty is going to colonize mars
the colonies just going to look like a big jukebox
and instead of having a solar cycle because it's dark all the time a big robot will go up to and hit it will play like one of the classic fifty look like the rock and roll nick down it'll be he's going to live in rock'n'roll mcdonalds and when the big robot the big mac hits the juke box and plays a song called like oh sweetie baby will never run across the train

he shares a malt with sex robot pretty those on the i robot wearing like a cherry dress and has really big yeah which is betty page bangs but they're not built with policies like the only way you can reproduce is if you rub girls elbow
the you transfer your your comment to their robot uterus through there and create android children who grow up who are just born with hard parts they come out wearing davy crockett traps
a rock and daddy thinks her great and me
they start creating your misbegotten android child who doesn't know whether his duty is the moment machine or man
amaro on android baby and your my human queen all never ever become one with the great machine

oh my flesh and blood baby
some days are going to freeze your store you know can i could put you on a robot body for me okay but until then my dad's ilan mosque and that's a o
a robot on mars or i'm a rockabilly the best parts of human and baited

oh oh we're going to go out and day
go to go down desire on killed allows the human
another thing that's enough to it
mosques martian colony is a store called another the store franchise of liquid eat in a water store that opened in san diego three years ago
waters store on are still would eat in the lake in the garden of eden god was located so heard of this whole water filtration process and i put florida in it and adams like not going to trick me i'm going to drink from the dirty tributary
it says a liquid even eat in offers a variety of options including fluoride free chlorine free and mineral electoral eight alkaline drinking water that goes for two fifty a gallon
well what if here it's share is a weariness of tap water particularly the fluoride added to it and the lead pipes that so if it passes through they contend that the wrong kind of filtration will lose more beneficial minerals even traditional bottled spring water is treated with ultraviolet light or ozone gas and
pass through filters to remove algae
hi alex
right away
why the toothless hillbilly stereotype exists
fluoride in that water and they lose their fucking teeth before their forty both of my grandparents had dentures in their early forty's you have a lot right as good as our what was are the scream amber
or their ph level of a were better than whatever you say that but once we remove all that helpful algae
they say these filters
they kill helpful bacteria pro by addicts in raw water
sauerkraut you down
it's water
you have three older there's a talking about your can achieve that i love going to a restaurant and having tap water munich
sir
there is none of the algae or raccoon
i usually enjoy on i know the owner that everything my attic now and know everything should be probably i live a robotic lifestyle isn't averse eat fish shit every to keep healthy but off but the off grid water movement has become more than the fringe phenomenon it once was referring
the john birch your the nineteen fifties and general jack
what i love about this is that these are the most sexless
super optimized linked in human beings but in practice through the same as virtues who were the coolest
yeah either the same as the people who were like
you'd use are putting jack paar on television and a third of day with his wink
here are more than the fringe phenomenon it once was with a sophisticated marketing cultural cachet millions of dollars in funding and influential supporters are silicon valley
one recent morning in the hills of berkeley california cody freezing the founder and chief executive of zero mass water was inspecting water collection panels he had installed for his investor skip battle a long time tech leader who now sits on the boards have linked in net flicks and open table
this is a sort of thing that collects water from the atmosphere
solar panels which i guess is kind of cool if you're trying to live off the grid and general but like you know as a consumer product and you shouldn't live off the grid
live with people
oh a this asked how it will never be as good as that one oh my god so good ok
people want to be big ted so bad
that nobody can touch and here's our absolute king
yours are things really get mr battle poured himself a glass the water from the just doesn't taste quite as refreshing he said now is that because i saw i come off the roof and anything from the roof feel special
it's rough water
you know that classic thing where you're like it just tastes better if i founded on the roof everything's better off a roof what's what's this great rotisserie you're making oh it's this page in that film
her chicken
that's why i replace all the plates of my also spanish style from my roof
this guy saw the movie title
cat on a hot tin roof and was like that sounds delicious
or it gets really really good this is a call back the most prominent proponent of raul water is doug evidence a silicon valley entrepreneur surprising after his juicy and company to cerro collapsed in said
king those i remembered you sarah the yeah
five hundred dollar juice machine that literally does squeezed
his his company collapsed because it was fucking stupid
you had no reason to exist then he was exposed for that like so many of these other shit who will like you know the blood baron herself elizabeth battery two point oh
we'll never suffering a negative one realizes they're coming back without you sarah personal responsibility to lead on the next morning and i finally figured out you sarah like that the why they thought that it would be a machine because they only drink juice they'll have pellagra and they don't have the physical strength to crush it themselves
you wrote him because he went on a

pero yeah of course grass
the thing i'm going to run out now it's and getting back of my axe elizabeth
that so after you sarah collapsed in september he went on a ten day clan hunting nothing but live water i haven't tasted tap water and a long time he said before he could order raul water on demand mr evans when spring hunting with friends this has become more challenging lately the closest spring around san francisco
those recently been cut off by latin slides
it means crossing private property which he does under cover of night
just get given merc buy a property owners so you have to be encouraged us to off of a leaf
you have to be agile and tactile and be available to experiment he said literally you have to carry bottles of water through the dark i want to see like a david attenborough documentary with a view that cool night vision they're like this is now have a silicon valley
he's approaching a cactus to get its do he moisture
clean water source i wanted to see this be the new metal gear solid just replace the beloved big boss and solids their characters with a guy that invent stylists is
i won't mention them as it is is i do you think we have like a human desire for struggle and these people don't have your frankel baby and said it's plugging
ruling the world or anything like that they create
weird survival fantasy in their hand with like oh i have to get to the good water
i will never die if i drink it you know if i have the roof tar and bird shit
will never die so you've already gotten juice zero and a lot of of silicon valley v c bullshit let's let's bring in another utterly repellent an awful cultural phenomenon into this mix you ready for this at burning man
that attracts the did your roddy and others
evans and his r v make broad fifty gallons of spring water they had collected i'm extreme about health i know but i'm not alone with this mr evans said there are a lot of people doing this and me you'll never know what you run into at the spring what i find interesting about this is like these are like california ideology silicon valley utopia and they're burning
man this big hippie love fest in the desert
the core of all their beliefs and like their obsession with purity and taking hello series is extremely reactionary there's something very right wing about all this is hitler youth or something absolutely back to nature it's it's you can try and or as other this
like roof so in understanding of what period he is and it's like no science brings you here
well yeah it's like the teutonic myth
yeah so i am drinking from a mountain spring and the poisoned by the june
we lessons or wagner the entire trip to burning man
i love and year ago wagner pod cast the found our underlying water
the founder live water new can sing started selling spring water from opel springs and culver oregon three years ago but it was a small local operation until this year marking material is show mr singh original name christopher sanborn sitting sitting naked cross legged on a hot
spring ways in south asian now exactly is he will do the reverse bobby june
sitting naked cross legged on a hot spring is long brown hair overflow okay you guys going to see the yukon know it's right here i'm here is mccaw here
here's christopher sanborn a new concept
so it says here pure water can be obtained by using a reverse osmosis filter mr singh mr sanborn says real water should expire after a few months
think about that
this is a problem i've never had with water
is it supposed to be a durable
be i know it's literally one of the most chemically unconfirmed substance
that is available in law that's that's what happens after the man's strips down
real water that is a dead rat
sleeping like he went enough
don't have to shoot your water
oh wow
he goes
pope water
it's i'll water
the curse that have all the nutrition
my mom used to leave all the pebbles
to be so it all goes real water should expire his does it's these most fresh within one lunar cycle of delivery he said oh my god
on the moon
ty rocks that sits around too long it'll turn green people don't even realize that because all their waters dead may never see it turn yeah i want that water like why don't i don't want to get typhoid
i want i want to get of fucking boost his bath water sold to be sold to be by a guy with ask league pair though ti who had the my seventy dollar water to me you know they still have a have have a powerful magnificent cycle
either way that's speaking of the word cycle i am dying to know this man's insights into menstruation ember another good ember you ask about oh my god this is beth
you mr singh believes that public water has been poisoned tap water you're drinking toilet water with birth control
there's nothing more than a lotta i need that
i love that like knowing where disgusting for the birth control draw it's like i said these guys are all low key reactionary yeah yeah like they're just missing there's one degree of difference between these people and the triad cats people want to live in the hobby
no anti society modernist it's just yeah well i'm in silicon valley has often been accused of trying to bring bad feudalism and a real piece of evidence for that as their insistence on trying to bring back medieval diseases yeah well one of the interesting things like you look at how now realized he couldn't actually developed the countryside as quickly as they want to you
it was like
well can we can build a hospital here but you can use traditional chinese medicine and like what's that i don't think there's learn to your grandmother used to do this yeah okay your leg it's writing off but there's a type of lizard and you'll be completely fine and this is what people try to sell to poor people when they either
two or find themselves unable to provide them with the support of modernity and now instead we have board rich people deciding to cause play as medieval present ship
i hope they'll fuck and like big dark because like edmund burke used to say that like there was a value to rich people accumulating wealth because then they were able to display at the people in a way that was aesthetically pleasing and inspiring splendor that everyone could enjoy even though it was controlled by just a few rich people these mother fuck
don't want to do that they just want to recreate the lifestyles of of a fucking like a shack dweller in mumbai or something like that they want they want to fucking its soil and shit their guts out from fucking chunky green water it's a deranged fantasy that has always been fallen the upper classes during times of
of extreme wealth inequality to where they both kind of fantasize about this bucolic pre modern era and also try and make an elite so it's unavailable to actual poor people
they knew the victorians when they were gonna shove corn flakes up our ass so that we can stop a retard cousins
rough terrain and ideas about health because they had this generalized
kind of anxiety and alienation because they like another child got eaten up by an industrial live in my factory today but it serves more corn flakes
they're not least because john harvey kellogg reborn yeah they're only social engagement is going to special parties were like them and they're rich friends eat oysters off of each other as pot bellies and oh i feel weird all that
a problem is that i have like a bad humor
could somebody just makes my room temperature
they pour down my urethra
but if that's the way if all you want to do is drink pond water
he fucking soil and paste you don't need a bill him finish it just take all of their money they told me that
here's mr singh says it addition to the fact that tap water is has birth control drugs and room he says core mean and on top of that they're putting in fluoride call me a conspiracy theorist but it's a mind control drug that has no fun
mind control drove it has no benefit to our dental house and then in parentheses it says they're in the article it says there is no scientific that all right
i'm control drug but plenty to show that it is dental health so then it goes on where they talked to actual public health experts who are very disturbed by this new trend with good reason
i'm not because normal people won't do it if i got a great i got a grand bargain for these mother fucker it's not even like the vaccination staff it depresses it's true it's it doesn't hurt anyone else which is good
so let's make a deal give them all of the bog will her and run off that they can drink and then we take all of their money and we use it to modernize the water infrastructure for everybody else and get all the lead out of the pipes and give everybody else access to clean drinking water dead water
rygel of the out of all of the out of the all over the acorns that they want to it's a hell of a bargain yeah so starts to one more person
vanessa
commercial of emeryville calif who says fluoride it's a deathly toxic
escape designed for large tech companies he was said she was in early a doctor of raul water and no many of her clients following suit their health conscious people and understand the bigger picture of what's going on she said everyone's looking for an edge new tropics bullet proof coffee better a water
as the health benefits she reported include better skin and the lead to drink less water my skins plump her she said and i feel like i'm getting better nutrition from the food aid see that a lag gives you a nice nice blokes level for you shit out every
you know it also makes your skin plump for when you drown in your body stay still lake fertile with it
my friends who drink spring water when they come over now they're like oh yeah give me the good stuff said amanda thompson or writer in san francisco the consciousness around water is changing
this is all real estate
however we live in is truly historically significant and i hope to jackson leaders lives long enough to write about it
in the same way that he wrote about the hysteria of the upper class victorian what's this all boils down to his buddy poisoning
these people have been poisoned by having too much fucking money yeah where the only solution is to take it from nuisance for their own got yet all water is such a nascent business that there's debate over what exactly to call of liquid daniel vitality hosts the pod cast really wild yourself that promotes hunting for food and gathering water it's
guess that the hunter gatherer lifestyle
why after africa troll billions of dollars of assets to do this shit
what's it called again reviled yourself real wild years and says he prefers the term unprocessed water which echoes the idea processed verse own processed food i don't like raw water because it sort of makes you think of raw sewage said the service
grier has a ton of now
there's no way that's nice fucking when you say live water that's going to trigger a lot of people who are into physics and biology
alive
the article that has taught us how people on earth are going to be excited by your branding opportunity
so take their money it's the only way to stop them from shooting their guts out of the covert it's acting on it
fix itself
yeah but not if they keep hearing about it
pass it on and i hope they all get georgia but like the problem is that these people are extremely wealthy and have the ear of politicians and are quite powerful people in our society that i think are going to try eventually to disrupt our water in transportation infrastructure i mean because at all hundred another and
won't be a luxury item i mean yeah i mean that's true but at the other it has it's own budget benefits because it would probably cost a trillion dollars to fix america's
pipes nationwide at all
all the can just tell people to drink out of the sewer this drink out of drink out of the gutter as a good laugh at your house get along strong yeah no i think your your reference to now is the correct one where it just like we realized that like when we know we can sit by can't mean we're not going to spend the money to upgrade our infrastructure provide clean
drinking water for every one of the country so you just discover some ancient secret about live water and just tell everyone to drink out of fucking rain puddles massively anyway

my check one to one two guys hello
will unfortunately has been kind of paused by his care today that's right will made out with his cat marty i warned them and why people do you still hear he's just out of commission but we're going to go ahead as as promised with alex premier hello
and we're going to talk about him a gruff the crime dog can get it
i'm still here i'm still alive
a little a little bit low energy is will start off the other search this has already introduced i guess for the week it's returning champion alex marine of splinter whoa whoa whoa what's going on
well our ip to hawaii
prayers up to hawaii add to the fan of ours
pray not funny
it was in their defense are trying to do one of those positive social experiments were it would be an amber alert alert your beautiful smile
and they were like oh no i didn't take off the new template all thought and everyone's mad at me once again shatter to our fan tommy lee jones from the film undersea
and the best part of this is that you get to pick over what this is false flag to cover for pizza gates and russia
an impending a crack a north korea any any flavor of paranoia can be sated by the actions so congratulations well donald trump's planned to introduce loot creates the us military
yeah hawaii still here will still we're still here i'm still here most importantly of all after a nasty stomach virus but
this week up until you know it's it's hard to play any shows in hyper hyper normalize world because i thought this week was going to be shit whole week and i guess that was the pee wee herman word of the week
when we when you hear shit hole everyone just go
everybody on cnn who like acted like kids in school when the teacher goes out of the room going insane like we could swear know this fuckin reps
yeah they all didn't notice were there mr trump pass the damn executive orders i don't want any damn immigration quotas rod where did you learn that don lemon where did you hear that
yeah i guess if the president curses than that is you know our institutions like the grey lady the new york times which is usually very sneaky now they have an excuse to say north korea is a bitch ass motherfucker now we're already in my favorite part of the news cycle when it's people
or like guess what my great great grandparents came here from ireland
in a nineteen o two will i'll a shit hole american
i am a proud resident of shit hole there is to there are two equally stupid responses in one of them is like attention for do you know that your grandparents came from a shit hole enemy
other one is actually a scientist once came from
i swear it's like i like the ones where it shows like troops and it's like yeah i guess what this guy died in one of our dom war he says he went from a shit hole i do like that now the people on twitter whose name was there like deplorable merle now have an exact mirror image in my shit hole maria
steve shit hole it's this one this one's interesting because i remember right after the election like the one of the big lines of liberals was being mad at the media big they they were like you were to unfair to hillary and you also covered every like minutiae you
covered over every micro controversy and allowed him to turn it into a culture war which galvanized his base for people got fatigue of it gave them free airtime i guess is their argument like he wasn't running for president but there is an argument to be had at like covering every single thing he says is like a bad way to cover him that you should mostly government's policy it's because they're wildly and
popular but then also once he got inaugurated they're like resisting is this has been subscribed to the two biggest newspapers and know if the a one stories all time
are those washington post new york times articles are like look what a stupid thing this asshole and it's like yeah they're stupid and fucked up all the time but it's like also i like nixon said the n word like way out what what president and they just like completely adjusted their minds to obama era and nature
can't live on well that's the thing is like obama when he was in there like this he also said the end when he's all the time he had a mark mail and to tell him to stop mark earners with them they were doing like an eight year long have you
i have heard from credible sources that he did during one budget negotiations mitch mcconnell a honky
but it's like okay so what is this job with chief executive is the commander given the armed forces he can make life and death choices with the stroke of a bad most of the time he fucking picks death because that's what you'd use the head of an empire and you end up even if your a c
smart law professor thoughtful guy like obama you say things like good to killing people and if you're a fucking idiot like trump you go i don't want people from the shit hole countries but it's largely the same policy like if you remember obama resume deportations of haitians in september of twenty six dane late before the election so
so there are two things going out with us you have the liberals gas lighting themselves by saying we shouldn't gover trump this way but then only reading coverage of him this way and only talking about the dumbest things the dumbest man alive says and and buying into these like twenty four hour news cycles the ultimately mean nothing for him
and also excusing and making it so he's the first bad president and ignoring the imperial power yeah the president's a attempt that's the worst enemy of the cable news press and some of the dumber people in the printing presses like he's the first president you feel with the should whole thing
again it could have come out of a mix and tape it could have come out of a johnson tape mulligan
well good idea when turning it into turning it into
discussion about vulgarity
actually does distract from the sort of
if you want to talk about here is everyone covers these trump outburst like they're sort of individual distinct things i think the criticism as well you're not tying it into a narrative of who he is and who the country is so yeah that you can easily fit that into a coherent and more damning narrative about about his world view
and how it succeeded in two thousand and sixteen
but instead you get
the half giggling i can't believe i can't believe he he used it all
shit i think i think that is right about also like the libby no delights that a lot of these people are experiencing for the first time because it and sell our press and now paul krugman is walking around with a bad ass motherfucker wall
it's like trumps president you can swear and i'll just go for it yeah
right as he's ruining the world by swearing and we're saving it by swearing and it's like al yeah fuck it i'll get there's a whole political life going on outside of this sound in theory you know culture war bullshit
what could a dude your brain to hang on the every word of the dumbest man on earth i mean if that's your life
who could who would imagine that there would be good for your mental acuity he for your sanity
to do that might try that you know my fight the stupidest person you know and invest your entire emotional well being in every word that comes out of their mouth and see how i have a baby
oh yeah
maybe not
terrible terrible
it's like you you become him you what it what does the resistance last big thing before this it was screaming at vanity fair i think you got that from somebody an
think about it like i find myself in parenthood like like like speaking to inanimate objects like their babies now because my mind of in their yeah i'm like like are elected okay
no myself losing vocabulary yes
but where i want to go in this is along this line of like we began two thousand and eighteen with are sort of thesis statement for the year or like of where we're going and twenty eighteen is that the hash tag resistance has become the hash tag t caught of a few years ago i'm sorry if bernard this already but i see
it will be a theme will be returning to him by that that's just like a way of saying that like the trump has shifted the overton window so far to the right that like what is traditionally thought like the democrats are just moving right along there with them and i want to touch on something alex that you wrote this week for splinter about the actual meeting that the shit hole comments came out of
so this was a mean it and then dick durbin came out of the media and he never never heard of russia
that awful said by our president and then you have paul ryan saying like it was very unhelpful very unhealthy very unprofessional but alex you talk a little bit about like what were the actual contours of what was being negotiated in this immigration deal that the democrats were were there to talk to trump about so the the reason
trump even had
was even debating should or countries that a group of lawmakers was sitting there talking about the deal they were trying to cut to to save dhaka
and and
the dreamers like help them stay in the country
but the the dealers been negotiated was that basically congress was going to restrict legal immigration so they were they were going to
i think that the deal as constituted it was basically give up the diversity of a lottery or at least severely restricted and then they were talking about the countries with temporary protected status who like the salvadorans who just got that removed there are people who because we fuck
up there are countries were like we won't support you back there because we fucked up your country
that said is the also that el salvador think yeah and now that's been rescinded news about two hundred thousand salvadorans in america who are now of dubious legal status yeah exactly so anyway but so what was being negotiated was which countries will we restrict immigration from how will we restrict legal immigration in order to get dhaka dot and true
with being like oh you guys you know he was like oh like why can't we restrict restricted to norway like white like you want to lungs
the country why would they don't want
now their job
is a burning shukla cheese why would you go
last our they're like big bears trying to catch the salmon swimming upstream the salmon or job
as that back but what does what has been under remarked upon is that this is a massive that will be a massive giveaway that will be an astounding if you had told any political observer a year ago that as a male senate democrat
would be negotiating to restrict legal immigration in order to get some version of the dream act through they would be like what are you talking about it makes no sense
and that that is because of these negotiations were happening quickly and largely under the radar but no one really noticed how much of the farm democrats were preparing to give away well this is the idea to forty plus year precedent yeah says the immigration active eighteen nineteen sixty five i think yeah that would be reversed so i just want to read for your piece stroke
you say here democratic leadership has completely conceded rhetorically and politically that this is now the middle ground the fact that hardliners you prefer an even more extreme policy is all the justification they need this is the rationale you're calling for political here
it's cleared key democrats are sympathetic to the you're from their left flank but aware that something needs to pass congress they can win trumps signature scent negotiators believe there are emerging agreement which they say they're getting close to finalizing will lose votes from the right and left representing true concessions from both
i love both tom cotton and the congressional black caucus will oppose are deal so it is by definition bipartisan this is how far right policy become centrists and less than a year and this is that democrats are negotiating with the historically unpopular president in a midterm election year on an issue with they held immense amount of leverage
a month ago so they are negotiating they are get the position that the democrats are negotiating from his the position and steven miller wanted to know i know what's crazy about it be one thing if you had a united republican party that wanted that would agree with steven steven miller up until trump steven miller's position
was an outlier in his own party led the republicans were not in favor of restricting legal immigration except for the hard right
this is why the bush tried comprehensive immigration reform only for it to fail because of the hard right
but again like they're they are negotiating from a lake against republicans who don't even want to be voting to restrict immigration because there are rich business republican who like cheap labor
so it's astounding
that that the overton window shifted that quickly with barely anyone noticing i mean this is how democrats negotiate to democrats
and their argument against anything that people actually want be socialized medicine or you know leaving afghanistan is like that will never pass so we're going to are expressed position that we even run on his the compromise
it's a compromise that before you even get to the table get exactly what you came for like they don't they fundamentally don't understand negotiation it's like you
come in roll over on your belly say please please please and then hope that they go take even more and not only that like and then they come out of this meeting and go president
the horrible things like you know like and of course likely up
like he wanted and he still said bad as it is grotesque particularly as far as like haiti goes to call haiti a shit hole span
all means he's a yeah stupid person that oh my god will you stop freaking out every time trump is trumped well here's the thing it's become another random like of what i've noticed is that people like the resistance people this becomes another whole round of like demanding that cable news anchors call the president has yeah i was just like okay if you're over
the fine invest yourself and with him
he says or doesn't say for anyone other than that i don't know why you're i love and then the corollary to that his website so that only liberals read like congratulating themselves were calling trump racist and a headline like all you did all those drivers or read daily beast or sure going to make and and not be a president
oh i will say like trump got the democrats out of the shitty deal they were correct like again like just by saying shit had he blew it up like i don't bring it was already because
i tried to be fair when i was writing that for once i try to be fair
a lot of fit better i like a lot of senate democrats were already like furious at the deal as it was emerging it was sort of dick durbin seem to be to sort of going out on his own and hoping that people would fall mine
kemal harris was against it was sorry it was durbin and lindsey graham turn you into this me again angry and a game and then they showed up to find that is a tom cotton bob good lad were there weren't expecting to be in the meeting that steven miller had invited than there just to make sure to make sure that encourage
exactly know that he would have preferred to then then we're proposing graham in durban we're proposing cutting of these a lottery program by fifty percent and prioritizing countries that are already in the system how are they allowing him to negotiate about the a lottery system while he is going around thinking that the visa lottery system is where other countries hold a fake lottery
they're in their homeland as and then send people over he doesn't know how it works though
honestly like it's one thing like oh you learn he has an idea of his head that is insane fantasy where they're like holding of like the like there's a massive added a bunch of ping pong ball right
there's a bunch of playing golf balls on kurdistan he television
i it around because they're in charge of it there like pulling out only the balls they want and so all the murder that are worth how do i now
what a fucking the the lottery is by the state department no one has told him this that he's in the room
yeah yeah definitely think it's very possible that someone has told him this multiple times
yeah and he's still he's in his mind palace where he's in a casino in kurdistan
at the isn't making everyone play the big bang theory slot machine and he's like they don't know i'm only let the nines and tens when the art of the whole
thing about this like broader like the failure of the democrats are particularly or even negotiate what should be a popular winning position for yeah i'm or just not cut a deal with the president i mean it's insane that they have to put something on his desk while they like the first of all what they had they had the leverage and they theoretically might still
have it too
to basically threaten of shut down until a clean version of dac of past no oh yeah
the
but the like the the justification i got a twitter argument this afternoon because i was bored mostly because the guy who always wanting to was like an elected official when i was like you are too dumb but he was like if you don't want any deal because you want to sacrifice dreamers at the altar of purity politics
yes
i want to i want to dress them all and why i'm going to add up
i've got a light from any i'm gonna wear a score guess that is what i thought it was weird i what at bernie's positions was to bring back as far our wars yeah yeah we have nazi quartile quarrel over three
but i don't think it's an argument about it's an argument about about tactics and strategy here and if you want to get like a clean dhaka or some version of the dream act passed well first of all like the question of what trump simes is answered by anything you put on in front of
quake
miller have some influence over him but if the republicans put it on has to have kill it like he's shown that time and time again
putting like a know geez on likely making it more appealing to him i mean they someone probably have found but miller the white house's i like the little smiling a white house is like a door slamming stage farce so it's like every time they try to get like like one policy in front of him miller miller's like a failed
like kneeling behind someone open for someone to push them over i mean like it so on the one hand you have the steven miller view of immigration which is that if it's not from a white country we're not interested or we should try basically and legal all immigration to america from any country other than you know first world western white countries right
the democratic you on the other hand i feel like
like i said early they can't articulate a competing visions of this because whether it's people in countries that maybe are so nice to use a better word than shit hole or even parts of this country are people in america right now who live in places that are impoverished misery rated or maybe not so nice to live it democrats still believe in this like men
craddock vision of like you have to earn your way out of these hell holes basically you have to demonstrate some kind of usefulness regardless of why those places are exact which may or may not have something to do with the president of american foreign policy yeah i mean their favorite thing to do is to post like army veterans from hate
the yeah gathered absolute favorite thing to do because there's no interrogation of like so we should have this imperial executive branch where trump orders and sky to die in like whatever african republic and lie about it because he found like a navy seal seals only money just because we're we're invading all these countries you're not interrogating the fact that he
he has to earn his humanity to you by killing and dying for you it's just like no you didn't go to vietnam drop you pussy you are too busy being gay with vladimir
to kill a bunch of farmers slot i do you think that there's like a danger in reducing
entire countries to the sort of pain and misery and exploitation experience but also let's acknowledge that these thing that these many of these places are miserable for many of their inhabitants specifically because of us
this idea of being like i've seen a lot of people would be like look at all the beautiful music and food and eighty and it's like okay but also you should be able to say there's a lot of a whole era not going to go to the american south
i mean that but the that's perfect because before this new than the liberals centrists and even like rubio cocker argument for immigration was like don't you like foreign food that it's like when these are human beings you fucking well doesn't usually only way they understand universal islam or some kind
egalitarianism is through bourgeois cosmopolitan islam right
they have amazing beaches yeah it's yelp world or
going going for the young this path of both the democrats both like having having this to step up being like trump is the most vulgar unfit for office like authoritarian dictator america has ever had but then still largely a seating too
everything he's doing are we being really willing to play along with it and this idea of the imperial presidency i want to talk a little bit about the extension of essay surveillance that pass this week with big win big win
actually if it passed the house have passed the house but it past with votes from nancy pelosi and the democratic chair of the house intelligence committee and this is an extension of the pfizer act just run down here this is from the nfl dot org
the house bill today endorses all warrantless searches of databases containing americans communications provides a narrow and seemingly useless weren't requirement that applies only if researchers in some later stage criminal investigations allows for the restarting of quote about collection invasive type of surveillance that the nfc ended last year
after being criticized by the pfizer court for privacy violations and sunsets and six years which the congress is best opportunity to debate the limits of an essay surveillance are they also voted down an amendment to the bill that was offered by just an amish of michigan a republican who sort of like a libertarian republican which would have required law enforcement agents to go
a warrant before searching and save data for information on americans
let's see here
pelosi said respect for the debate on this issue i myself will be voting to support my ranking members of the intelligence committee referring to the bills roots and a template from the intelligence committee weighing the equities that's the path i will take house speaker paul ryan also spoken for support of the bill and against and amendment from remember his own party speaking of the amish amish amendment
he says i want to say pelosi for coming up and speaking against the amish amendment and in favor of the underlying bipartisan bill so again there's this massive cognitive dissonance between believing that trunk is a reckless white nationalist racists authoritarian but still voting to re up the essentially limitless surveillance
powers that we've given the imbued the office of the presidency with no you don't get it like the nfc is going to use it to prove that didn't rush is no no i'm not i'm not even kidding i looked into resistance or about this and a lot of people were saying it's a big win because with the surveillance powers the is going to take down trump oh my god they're going to take down to
robin this it's going to blow all the russia collusion classics work for the tsar you should know that phrase book and eighty of the thing that's amazing to me is like if you're saying that the russia good spirits he happened to the extent that it did even if you're not unlike the eric garland end of the spectrum if you're more of like a six than and ten
oh she didn't have the he should have the
that isn't that exactly why they're there
sorry i don't either you're all you're all missing the fact that our continued security as a country is dependent on donald trump's ability to remotely activated suzanne somers web cam
hello is is candice bergen
new being very unfair to me
thank god we gave him this power greater garner i see you you look like shit frankly i'm in your alexa
so this is just a quick bit from the the intercept right up with this a devon different nunes circulated a flyer opposing the amish amendment with pictures of the boston marathon bomber or so concerned i have yeah that they also remember when they prevented that
i was all can and will get forget when they stop that happening
but actually it was the picture of that would
like this has nothing to do the with the amendment but like he's innocent
yeah to say oh my fridge or har people troy i love you
an annoying one i mean because democrats actually had i mean there were enough republican the amendment the warrant amendment had democratic cosponsors having zoe lofgren was one of them
so does actually could have passed the house like fairly easily and and if it had like like an actual meaningful reform one of them had a chance of the senate made a date was pasted away because policy like can't be bothered to
like actually take a stand on it and what what is what does that calculus for pelosi here like what would be like why what does she see like the negative in like what's the last year in not opposing this i i honestly think that official washington
they believe their own bullshit on this and they are
they have intel agencies with bring in the rear of the have to be allowed to do anything they won that's a big part of it and the other part of it as deeply ingrained belief by democrats that if anything bad ever happens they'll be blamed for being soft on terror polio which i think
interesting to contrast this era now with the late seventies in which the last and there really was an effort by congress to rein in the imperial presidency i mean there was a lot of push back against it but there were democrats and liberal republicans of that era that did sought to bring reforms to the and
televisions are vast
at that that time then it was vast now it's even more expansive but there was an effort to rein it in the late seventies and now it's been completely abandon you go back and look at the church commission and the reforms that happened in the seventies and it it actually unimaginable to think of that happening today after fairly similar
scandals frank
and
the overarching theory that nine eleven
broke the the country's brain and made everything measurably stupid or that might be the reason why but
you know like i i find it very worrying about of that like there's not a constituency or voters who were like like please
retain the patriot act and expand surveillance and so their they live they live in a hypothetical fear of being punished by voted for terror happening and them being blamed i think there's something to that the nine eleven argument but there were mass protests and there was still an anti war movement it died under obama oh yeah because
everyone was like our lives
yeah pack up and go home i think though one of the most effective acts of propaganda was america after nine i love it was the troops thing because it was it was fluid it was just troops were troops anymore the s troops i mean you did you see i meet you i'm really
i was a real show
i don't do the tweet but they were like i was just watching cnn or something and they were what did they say it was like someone or other farmers are protecting our crops
i think you to found her to look like
just like that's that's precisely what i mean by like nine eleven made america stupid or in that sense like sally has ever yeah i think this average is producing anything you're always protecting yeah
so even if you're like even if you're supposed to be sort of than the laughter that issue like the other day someone found a tweet from nicholas kristof to those and fourteen goes
people are people talking about those guys who were crying while they were torturing people that shows humanity
like they were literally do they were literally torturing her buddy but that pain really bad also trying of the people they were torturing i sort of thing about the movies zero dark thirty and how they are all these little cultural little cultural snippets you're put in there like that it's a cool bad as woman doing it
that one of the first scenes as her like torturing that guy with jason isaacs or that the one counterterrorism guy takes out a prayer rug and i think that propaganda of all right we've got you in the position of you have to say that you have the troops and also we're going to expand troops to anyone who defends anything which
like you said it could be farmers it could be ball security could be moderators on a message board
that they're bree the brave men and women phrase i've heard so much in reference to trump in reference to trump being mean
the f b i the idea that they're sacrificing for us everyday these people who go into a h back the perfectly seventy degree office everyday eight salads from cozy and like go into exile and decide which fourteen year olds they're going to murder like that they're risking their life somehow
oh i just so like this all started with george w bush in two thousand and eight and then it was of course expanded throughout the entire obama administration and there's a certain logic in that like all these people who love the obama were like well it's okay because the good guy now has his hand on the till and we're going to win the presidency for out ass surveillance
hey and yeah and they expected that it would have happened forever but now that trunk literally their worst nightmare the probably the most irresponsible like least qualified person ever is in the oval office
are still largely okay with it and i'll tell you why because now they've put their face entirely in the deep stay or like i'm i'm using that in quotation marks but they've put their faith entirely in the these gigantic federal law enforcement and intelligence apparatus to use as a check on trump and then also they did
roddick party does not exist to produce policy they exist to reproduce the democratic party at this point and they can definitely keep doing that and or champ i mean they one needs to the other one other thing about this
this is the thing of the voting the bill
reading from the intercept this again it's as the vote followed him morning of confusion as president donald trump treated in opposition to the you referencing a conspiracy theory about then president barack obama spying on the trunk campaign he walks himself back few hours later treating we need to get smart with actually in the morning
fantastic story for our age because of what happened that morning is entered depaul town on fox news literally turn to the camera and said don't do five a president trump trump treated weeks left not do pfizer
and then john kelly and paul ryan had of on the phone for an hour and told him they live basically they lied to him and they told him notifies is only for foreigners it won't ever effect americans and then he treated we gotta do pfizer and but in that our republicans were like are we against it now we will be no no that's why they ultimately gave him the power
because he showed he had a nuanced exactly jags and he could listen to people
oh i've done a lot of learning this morning it turns out i can use is to have conversations with anna wintour
mr
looks like a great resistance response to wear like the law fair blog guys and senator mark warner room
they looked at trumps to eat and there were like what a hugely dangerous misunderstanding of the issue this is like oh my god and this is why we must renew his authority to oversee these programs like that was their argument
i knew a they think that the president's he isn't like a montessori school
mr president in light of recent concerns about this bill we're giving you a city cop will you sign it
we're getting a call over and were given a city cup and i got it
they don't make as a map i think like that is that you have to keep in mind is that ultimately this is a cruel stupid man and like they seem to both understand that he's stupid yet panic at some at that
at the idea that he's like kind of pure evil incarnate like he's a movie evil is what they think we're like he just exists to do bad things and that it to the point where it's not even about self preservation or he lacks any motivation besides hurting other people because he is cruel but also like clearly it's it's easy to him
influence his person because he is deeply stupid
yeah he's like just do anything at all ever
last the last guy who's going to have words with him is always going to be kelly or one of those gate keeping monsters i don't think you're ever and you enlighten me if she ever sept showed suppose she looks like that puppet madam
well that might be and it is only never him and actually is true that when you look at when the for the white house he did the immigration merchant negotiation on camera at approve of the terms brain works
i learned about what happened on camera was day and find it was like art for clean dhaka in trouble like yeah i'll have to clean dhaka and kevin mccarthy the house be whipped like leaned over it was like that's not our position mr president will but it's like the present like the policy is being set by john kelly and these got well you can't blame them for that because lake
when a powerhouse of charisma like daniel
i sat in a room with her once ended up naked don't even remember
she could talk me into doing anything you want to talk about the hilarious scandal that in any other time line would have been like that
deleting this
get their forget they're going to have a little vegetables for we get to our desert here i do you want to bring up one last thing that is
you know i think more monstrous now and like any been trump calling other countries shit like are certainly more consequential i'm talking about this in where they've they're now allowing states to him require medicaid beneficiaries to work or lose access to healthcare
yeah and i just want to kentucky is already gone through this and i want to read a couple things from the new program there is literally there is actually literally illiteracy provision that says here this is from the whole innovative moves at him herself and her health literacy or financial literary literacy course beneficiaries who are
an eligibility suspension for failure to meet the requirement on their read determination day will have their enrollment terminated and will be required to submit a new application kentucky by kentucky will provide good cause exemptions in certain circumstances were beneficiaries who cannot meet requirements so you don't get chemo until you bring back a book report
treasure island
this is no it's smith simpsons summer
stupid babies me the most attention but they do actually there a marine
andy slav it i'm reading from sort of like compile the the rundown of this horror show there's a six month lockout provision which means that you can apply again for six months if you removed from not registering annually or if you have a kid or get married and don't report it and it says that this is for quote certain populations
language is it says decent walnut and six month non eligibility period for certain populations for failure to report a change in circumstances that would affect medicaid eligibility
see their death by thousand cuts so it's just making the process so arduous and anyone who's ever had to do this knows how miserable it is anyone who's ever had to go through any of these systems actually it was great in indiana i have to say getting getting food stamps in indiana it was great he just showed up they filled out
shit for you getting at here it is impossible now they've cut like that
number of people they have at the offices if you ever
for example like have to get unemployment in the month of december
you will literally blow your brains out waiting on hold and
you bring it up but it says in the bill here it says in addition were an individual experiences a period of non eligibility kentucky is providing opportunities to return eligibility several commentators noted that the state's medicaid offices were many beneficiaries go to report those changes and the phone lines used to call to get or changes are already busy and the calls and visits are time consuming
so it's like overtaxed and already overtaxed like nightmarish well and i think it's all intentional that sounds paranoid but i know i think i think building up bureaucrat like i literally spending more money on more bureaucracy to keep people out as a means to shut it down and looks like is an hour
testing regime is for welfare recipients that costs vast know my husband but yeah they stop fraud with but you know what this is the price we pay because as we all know there's louis brandeis said the states or the meth labs of democracy and we have to let them just cook up whatever freak monster baby is that the put together in the urban meyer flaws
if it's totally intentional it's the welfare reform model
you make it more of a pain in the ass to sign up you make it easier to throw someone off and then when the number of people and rolled goes down you pointed that number and say it just sucks yeah yeah our fixing the problem fixed it the early anybody who wants to talk about how health care reform bill how whatever form it takes needs to be dynamic and to allow for experiment
station and then a for states to find out the best way to deliver quality care fuck you
one universal standard for everybody it is genuinely psychotic that someone kid die no bearing on end and you lose it and then and last money making on low barrier to entry savagery of their state government
you don't know i know housing crisis and like i said before the housing crisis in indiana you just for like i don't have any money i got fired and they like here is two hundred dollars a month for food and that was it and you saw slowly change it started with you is it getting cards that said not bank of america but at major bank on the back and that was you new snap card
like he had already with them facilitating it and then and then it got harder and harder and it became there were fewer and fewer people working at the office there are longer and longer hold times and then you move to new york
it basically bombed out the entire fucking office impossible to get that shit yeah and even if you do have health insurance like i know somebody who recently had a health scare and her when she had to go to get a spinal tap and she had to go through like seven phone banks to figure out if her insurance covered it and how much and charge you would need to get
and witch doctor to go to and the phone lines are busy that's even if you get in and you're part of the part of this is by design it's as everyone said making things more complicated so you have to go through three rat masons to get one piece of cheese they want to exhaust and punish poor people for trying to get
food health care unemployment housing aid anything right and that's the on the right ways out of it it just literally is eugenics so i did on the on the democratic side it's it's this meritocracy that they love believing it right and idea
a little fucking nerds and they're like oh here's a new system we're going to improve it by added in our town yeah like once we have everyone everyone will and won't enjoy filling out their forms of making choices what if it's like a fun puzzle to get your food and it but it's like they don't realize it like for people for people who have to get assistance before
or for anyone who doesn't have a top flight plan where they can just kind of go wherever and network and it's fine they're already doing that they're already scrolling through menus maybe they don't look as pretty as the obama care website but it can't the only two choices can't be means testing and means tested
with eugenics behind it because it makes no difference to the average person was to access them to it has to
it has to be different it doesn't matter if one is just out of sheer cruelty and one is because i don't know a bunch of roller backpack kids thought it was cool to match point about the salaries of these a local governments experimenting just a comment from the governor of kentucky bevan absolute piece of shit and they say iran he
hannah on election on the promise of taking away the medicaid expansion in kentucky all together which he wasn't able to do once he took power
experts they this is what he said about these new work requirements he said
low income people in kentucky will now learned dignity and self respect
i also think we can't underestimate the fact that a lot of these people really do have lake anti humanistic contempt yeah
oh you meant by their
doesn't matter doesn't matter i mean it's like looking at the only other is don't really yeah someone was telling me they went on some and when i'm like a safari trip
aw lion eat a
the liver out of a buffalo and as like how do you know it's delivered and like they always eat the liver first and that raised his really weird question to me where i was like holy shit and i look it up and it's true and it is it more nutritious it is more nutritious and so i'm like okay that lion doesn't eat it
because it knows that it's more nutritious on some level where does it taste better is this like delight is this cuisine or is it home economics and the answer it doesn't fucking matter because he ate the fucking live over burglaries as a mess with the water buffalo yeah sure after say don't waste too much time i really think trying to figure out what balance of of
malice slash ignorance these people have the point is it's dangerous
so moving on from a serious topic to just based instinct and desire
talk about how how does to how do you really got shit hole
last laugh at the ladies i can we talk about stormy daniels
is something that you're just them player with a tri pi i can think i've never heard of this person oil all of us have been sitting in my apartment
going through the stormy getting those catalog like bob korean and john carpenter and auto focus just just pros jewelry
together particular guys regular guys being friends watching movies together i mean look i can think the donald trump is reprehensible person and also think that it's cool that he's eskimo brothers of johnny sins
i can think that that's an important moment for me to see here's the thing is my big shock with the thing came out was okay wait a minute are you telling me that he paid this woman to keep quiet about the fact that they had sex because i'm very much team in the cell drop
ansel trump a lot of a sexual yeah like what i am i'm mike my because i honestly think okay a month for the election he's in the middle of the pussy grabber thing his bases and deserted him how many people really would have had their minds shaped by hearing he banged the porn star that's actually kind of cool fall so he as hell ivana to like
speak very explicitly about their sex life yeah he love that stuff like do these tall tale exactly you know what he was really paying her for was what want
have look these up though because it is almost childish yeah because i think he had her say we're like yeah his dick was his biggest table
i thought i'd gladly somebody is never had said it comes out it's no big deal but a stormy daniels and says okay you took me into into this hotel suite he he had me rolling around in flower
they need his excess torso flesh out like pizza
even the mega people would be like dude that's a valid
i did all the things you do you do during sex and more frankly
sorry about the search or procedure which was truly excellent
with her penultimate active first you have to find the that's a lot of trauma with that the i can find it but it's right on the front of the pelvis and to a penis world's
and then you know i go hey can i can i can we put these things put my thing in your thing okay great i go i do my thing you know go rocking back and forth like you do during sex and i'm paying
i know what he said he won one hundred percent paid her to get balls of gauze and clean the magma out of his gun
real sex we did not that we certainly didn't wear matching planet hollywood commode ozawa
i don't have bed sores
know and the best part of sex is right after when you are our on the back and say i actually work
superb what are is what what i like about this is in any other reality
been like like we crack story of the century and i borrow i guarantee you this will be ever more forgotten this by the time this up imagine obama fuck kendra
is like i was at the arabian for someone
shit hole will be done in two weeks this will definitely be done by the time this errors but as long as we're talking about this we had alex your alex your your own a media critic a journalist there's someone in this the interesting to to this story is that jacob weisberg sleep on that sylvester cat sounding motherfucker
had this story he had stormy daniels on the record he october two thousand and sixteen saying trumps fucking psycho lawyer michael cohen another absolute winner that guy paid her this hundred and thirty grand hush money to cover cover this up or whatever he had this record in october two thousand
sixteen then she started turning his phone calls obviously assuming because she was paid off by our know they shut her up in some way yeah and she just release some fucking letter that sounds like you know forget she might as well be holding up today's copy the new york times
so wise very says i have this on record but i didn't publish it because i didn't have her consent to do it which and this was like a week after the pussy grabbing thing we can debate whether or not anyone would have given a shit about this but it does like it would have been a huge story young election and a huge story coming on the heels of the pussy grabbing
tape and it's like well weisberg is now saying this to the new york times presumably without his daniels consent of sunlight builders why the fuck with the only release it when he had cancer would have made a fucking and if at all it's an incredible fuck up and my colleague thomas go with just was just saying this
okay first of all
we're on the record saying this to you than you had her consent to publish because that's what on the record me
for the second of all she's not a victim of of any sort of attacks by all accounts it with a consensual sexual act and shake yeah exactly
so could like the idea of needing your consent to publish what she voluntarily told you on the record
we're not talking about and assault or rape or anything else here we're talking about fucking blake porn star having sex with a celebrity
people
exactly the since he you'd have all the beautiful people in the prime of their life
the doing i would totally now comes natural yeah not at all like can make it roll more at rolling or
probably just wasn't that good or confirmable or anything i just that it was bullshit nothing story because i because trump is never fact i
we did vodka and they destroyed the tape i paid to destroy the tape because if people saw how good i was there be no more porn industry but everyone within a month they said too insecure to every people
well is called me the white lightning that steel name i came up with but it's really a grey really interesting stuff people are hidden and more and more or hearing and more and more people who say anywhere people are saying and look this boy can be thick is incredible
i mean thicker than him
i didn't even set out to try to do that
a very good genes my dad was a thick man
his buddies the wrong side of yes
another interested in got some done another interesting
sort of connection to the story daniels affair is we talked about it a few episodes ago the queue and non conspiracy that has consumed so much of the right wing or just online right now even people were offline the big catch phrase of the queue and non conspiracy is a storm is come
and by that they mean that like all the celebs sick goes in the democratic party are going to be arrested or like like something a story something's coming and then now the stormy daniels revelations which seem very interesting to me that in all lines up but however as twitter friend on earth spirit pointed out
all these same people will be like no not this this is just a coincidence
good deep state
that's he's being the opposite of a pedophile
he's like it's proved that he does the opposite of pedophilia by sleeping with an adult woman an adult film star yeah that far as an adult films like him or her and been
donating one hundred and eventually would be like oh she than phantom a thread
you know you're saying been bad for me that came out during the election but also hillary fucked peter north
either out of it like man there really isn't a choice for a candidate that hasn't been fox by opponents know gary johnson know
heyman riley reid
the dig by the deep state
well again you mean it's fun to talk about but it'll all be a lot of
although his best thought
thing that they don't lose all your fucking marbles over everything that happens it's just all experiencing a lot of over stimulation at the moment
navy suit yourself with
the guys
centrifugal simulator and massa with your face off
exactly and yet but
try and take care of yourself you know that you have like a capacity for this stuff and you don't you don't want your brain to pop it on and also have you know have a laugh
it's fun watching stormy danny's villiers with your boys if you're if you're of a week mind you can't follow all that stuff you can follow every micro controversy you can follow every awful thing he says you can't follow every little culture war thing you can't fall everyone he's
pretended to have sex with that's where people strong braids that's us we're doing our job more troops were troops in our job to think about the president sweat only rubbing up against florida which is why all of us voted for you to lie about as you know what i will it doesn't feel like it
no
best the day it feels like a job as a day i get out
like are like our cousins in the army say
job i ever you think of my job of keeping the post safe
i don't want to go to keep the post
wondering what the fuck jacob weisberg was thinking what sitting on the roof or and has is how you to was that he wanted to make sure that they could keep doing the trump cast
also not have
stupid fuck truck as if actually actually proves trump right when he claimed that the media would fall in line and twenty two thousand and because they need him
said
any other president this will be the biggest thing yeah presidency would probably result in resignation and now it has suddenly there will be gone for the end of the
it's quit
the that will sort of this stuff i don't have an acceleration is like will they are celebrating yeah holy shit
if you will find space
it slowed down after the line it go faster and faster
as ten
you
any any
the angels
so close things out for this week we got we got alex preen on the scene i wanted you're really serious now as a tip of the cap to the the dearly departed for report i want to read now with alex david brooks is cone cone me which is very germane to everything we've just
talked about because david wrote this on tuesday all is proving that he's just way ahead of the curb these they always look good in retrospect yeah especially this week
so this is david brooks reading up and the new york times this week the headline have a lot of the piece is the decline of anti trump ism
david rights let me start with three inconvenient observations based on dozens of conversations your own washington over the past year we don't tar floated you inhale helium are notorious hail helium and then we ran out of helium and we will we realized that we could actually kill ourselves
particularly i'm so then we switched to a drinking game okay
if you if he bemoans the younger generation the kids today
if he does thinly veiled autobiography
if he brings up humility virtue humility virtue
her character and and name drops of the writer name dropping is a big one yeah so every name drops if he named drops other writers and then it's two drinks if that figure from antiquity
and then yeah then if he if he references the decline of democracy got to give your home massage
some makers mark left there a right about asian paying book
the components of china it's an important book okay so brooks goes let me start with three inconvenient observations based on dozens of conversations around washington over the past year first people who go into the white house have a meeting with president trump usually leave pleasantly surprised
because their expectations were so astronaut is so fucking low to begin with but because they find that trump is not the raving mad men the expected from these tweets storms or the media coverage they generally say that he is affable if repetitive
he runs your door
he said and downing he runs a normal good meeting and seems well informed enough to get nor all white house
one of for to get by right
standard for the price of the united states are go walk up to him and i say how are you doing and he says i'm having a regular one and good
second people who work in the trunk administration how wildly divergent views about their boss
some think he is it deranged child my goal for four days i'll put some think he is merely a distraction they can work or
distraction
yes he could kill everybody on earth if he presses the wrong button but you can you know it's like it's like when your kid makes as the thing is you just gives all riled you got jingle your car keys in front of him but anyway
he'll forget that he has the power of life and death over every being on earth any new say that but again what has been proven time and time again is that it is very easy to put him on the complete opposite track of what he was twenty minutes ago
so may have keys work some think he is strange but not impossible some genuinely admire trump many filter out his crazy stuff and pretend it doesn't exist
a really good literally just sharing some people are living in fantasia
some people think he's the best father in law he
my impression is that the trump administration is an unhappy place to work because there was a lot of because there is a lot of hate your internet
a lot of infighting and often no direction from the top but this is not an administration full of people itching to invoke the twenty fifth amendment yeah because that i'll be out of work
third the white house is getting more professional
tuesday or the last two this is entirely an office management
that's exactly what is three think they now have a chore board
stays
doing the dishes and he's taking out the most retarded using slack and they have their channels organized yeah
a machine that way when doesn't leave out coffee for it was it gets a young man named virgil texas
about have told them about the food choices channel on slack post all meal decisions for affirmation or denial i love imagining david brooks reading this about our office where
there are far less outbursts
now under three hours to decide about one the
they no longer get distracted watching old ron fournier videos on c
the amount of garbage humiliated around felix experiment has sure kind dramatic
so the trade houses getting more professional imagine if trump didn't
badgers trouble wasn't raised seventy years old
the craziness of the past weeks to be out of the way
the whole thing is like it's just twitter that twitter
new guy you imagine the president away the white house suddenly seems much more i yeah i know charlie weis builder
i'm going to
the studs or but recently replaced i know you guys think the strong things are ridges bitches
thought experiment imagine he is about thirty years younger he went to harvard law as black his name is veronica
now do you hate him
check the majors at all
and says if he wasn't cheating we'd see a white house it is briskly pursuing its goal
a shift in our pakistan and policy shift in our off shore drilling policy shifts that's a lovely yeah the coming the next four or five deepwater horizon incidence of briskly changing the makeup of the gulf of mexico oh i like this the fruition of our isis policy
the nomination for judgeships ships in the formation of policies on infrastructure dhaka north korea and trade so so he thinks the worst case scenario is that trump gets in there and he's just like he gets lost in the bathroom and they don't do any the
the idea of doing anything well here's a like brooks sort of has a point year because like yes trump is an idiotic sorry shows like you know paying porn stars hotshot money or whatever but the white house is actually pursuing a policy agenda it's just that policy agenda is a fucking night many also just laid out like the people they're nominating
the federal courts are unhappy with us until i'm dead problem we are like you know cow jocular fred flintstone the john birch junior society
he a beauty pie is going on the ninth circuit court
he's wrong even my own standards though because this isn't use describing this as professionalism as if this was a sort of normal republican policy policy shop normal republican policy is happening but there's no coherent agenda because it's a bunch of individual actors jockeying to accomplish whatever their goal is like the judges like there are there again
one of them through but the like even people that chuck grassley early aren't disguise a little too odd qualified for me like you know yeah but buddy nice my lionel i really only the one guy who was just thinks that like taking away his twitter would make every he thinks that they should be taking away his twitter at the way that
people hate r's polio
good of their lives
this is this is informative though because i think that david burke speaks for not that big slice of the country but a definite population were yeah
it's not really the policy is that they have to pay attention to his twitter
imagine the johnson administration without his comically large penis
so he goes it's almost if there are two white house's there's the potemkin white house which we tend to focus on trump berserk in front of the tv the lawyers working the russian investigation in the press operation then there is the invisible white house that you never hear about which is getting more effective at managing around the distracted the boss i sold was
an unaccountable invisible state
i sometimes wonder if the invisible white house has learn to use the potemkin white house to discuss while it changes the country okay with brooks is describing here is that if you cover your eyes from thinks you've gone away
can see him and he says i mention these inconvenient oxford observations because the anti troop movement of which i'm a proud member seems to be getting dumber it seems to be settling into a smug fairytale version of reality that filters out discord information a fairytale version where we believe that if we
just struck down the evil twitter mission
more anti trump or it seems to be telling themselves a madness of king george narrative i think that's the same oh and
king george okay fictional character king george
trump be careful though already
the madness of king george narrative that trump is a semi literate madman surrounded by sick of fans who are morally intellectually early
trump is a semi literate madman surrounded by sick of fans who are morally intellectually and psychologically inferior to people like us that's what brooks says is the fairytale nerd
oh okay i think is going to fairy tale because i see nothing in david brooks that's better than like don't ski or whatever they're just as shitty they all live in the same neighborhood and chevy chase maryland
goes i'd like to think it's possible to be fervently anti trolling for also not reducing everything to a fairytale the anti trunk movement suffers from insularity most of the people who detest true i mean i agree with him on that they aren't around us
nerds but you are the kings a nerd yeah this is millhouse
getting mad i look like a nerd
how is writing a column get smart prince
it into most of the people who detest don't know anybody who works with him or support so i mean know this is this idiotic idea that you have to fucking be friends with these their father also absolute shit head route from supporters to understand generally the trump isn't an awful president is it was a terrible thing
if just factually false and it shows his insular and it just broke to them as hilarity because like you know who fucking detest trump like you know my aunt who lives in the midwest and know the a shit ton of trump voter year later she'd detest him i would if i knew him if i was actually in
social circles with more trumps supporters i would probably he'll probably joke less about trump oh hate him
and have him so much now i'm very lived in ironic and i'm like isn't it funny we have a crazy president folks porn stars you know if i was like living in a community where like i had to deal with these people in a day to day basis people who were like he's my president daniels the not this is fake news footing
would the honestly i would be like buying a mill or you know you'd be you'd be that woman in texas to fuck that boss woman in texas with the pickup truck the said fuck drop on them
twitter a jail and then she broke her back out of it she added to it fucked up and fuck the share like the sheriff well i've i've been dating hope picks so this is my perspective this is actually a common
you know i want to unpack as a little bit because this is the this is like when conservatives make fun of the old pauline kael line i don't know anybody who voted for mick jagger pauline kael she wasn't being ignorant it wasn't me how to mix and when she was stating a fact in her bubble she didn't know any mix and voters the conservatives who took that as like all they all have in a bubble are like manhattan
conservatives who used to write for the national review or whatever and who professionally interact with a lot of liberals had john podhoretz is a bubble yeah but do you know who actually lives and in fewer bubbles are people in white enclaves all across the country who universally voted for trump like they're the ones who don't know like they intentionally live and encore
use of like minded people and then people like brooks are like you dummy liberals don't know anyone who thinks different than you and a half of us fucking come from families of people who voted for trump
those trump people in the enclaves know any
hillary voters but they know jimmy kimmel
iris realize they are they're more like the even larger like number of people like the people in my accent family you just don't oh oh yeah of course yeah so he has the movement also suffers from low brow isn't fox news pioneered modern low brow ism
the modern low brow think sean hannity your dinner de souza ignore his normal journalistic or intellectual sean hannity literally has a low
hello hairline
he creates a style of communications wasn't me who make more it makes you think and noticed less the ultimate test of low brow is not whether it is not whether challenges you teaches you or captures the contours of reality it's whether you feel an urge to share it on social media i'd say we're very low over
the in every war nations come to resemble their enemies
so i suppose your hogs
so i suppose it's normal that the an anti trunk movement would come to resemble the pro troop movement but it's not good on my god i've noticed
a statement what does the talking about both sides do it is blowing my mind that is like an accent is of great than as i actually if you if you killed the bourgeoisie do you not then also become the bush was in
you throw your old phone and lose your new government
so he says is not good i have noticed a lot of young people look at the monotonous daily hysteria of we anti jumpers and they find it's still out as a drink
because not only of the event when i whenever he said i've noticed something young people do it what setters i've noticed my why i thought about it
this isn't just a struggle over a president it's a struggle over what rules were going to play by after trump are we all going to descend permanently into the trump standard of acceptable behavior yeah oh yes
yo yo had before can porn star center
or are we going to restore the distinction between excellence in mediocrity truth and lie are we going to insist on the difference between a genuine expert in an informed blow hard or we going to restore the distinction between those institutions like the congressional budget office that operate by professional standards and speak with legitimate of
authority and propaganda mills that don't know it's so hard to salvage their credibility i've got a link election and it's like now we're never going to your expertise again i what i like about using this is like a contrast a fox news is that a big big project of really respectable conservative specifically our vic roy and a lot of the heritage foundation guys
is completely change have a go
does that work california so that they can do more things like be like show that they're insane tax bill will increase growth and revenue so yeah don't know who the fuck you saw me about your ego closing out final sentences there's a hierarchy of excellence in every sphere
there's a huge difference between william buckley in sean hannity no no they're blocking is why
only one of the threat to beat someone up on national television and sean hannity actually could because we know he studies and million street style
william buckley and sean hannity is sean hannity is a more successful television
i think
so shut he would never write a bitch ass sailboat
our boats all started
jet ski guy on high anything weird with yeah well i mean instead of the skinny dipping in the long island channel
dude touch ball the judge football shirts and skins every day so no someone plays shirts and gives booze ball that on what the fuck you know nothing below the way just shirts and guys be dude okay the closing out part of the struggle is to maintain those distinctions not contribute to their eviscerate mission
oh god i'm haven drugs and no content there was nothing
says oh you think the trouble is just a stupid tweets but he also has a government well yeah because government has like a continuity it's bureaucracy
of its own okay what does that what does and sean hannity is an open and you need to be less like him what he doesn't even have an example of what he's talking about and that's actually one of the killer things that makes like a killer brooks as he doesn't even name and example of that he's talking about it isn't always talking now as he made else generalizations it's like they they always become
their enemies and it's like when when he just keeps going that he just his wife was watching the daily show and she laughed at a joke that he thought was too simplistic
silently judge turn just like gritting his teeth and ploughed out a call or well then he is right because the daily show sucks and i stand with david
we stand with david yeah well today which lifestyle watch watching the daily show
looks as aiding ladder on shop
yes yeah really
your head as high as ever and it's really depressing last year
and not an acceleration in terms of entertainment this is not this is not a comedian's funny
no i have i have a theory i have a theory i have the theory
boss a body what would you have written
now but he's close to a machine and i will tell you why if you had a relative that was other son downing are dying what something you could put on that wouldn't excite them that much
it is like is it is i mean all of those political comedy shows are dreadful but there is something just own meal ass about the daily show now where it has any been run through cuisinart five thousand times and to just total paste it's like the soil and of entertaining today donald trump tried to say
a barrel through bogged and had a raid quit
australia and whatever how was like okay
difficult

doing it
a lotta at off
go off go off well i mean i don't want to
gamble too heavy drinking bourbon material
we don't want to sell we don't want to give this been away for the retard the studios about drinking bird so pay wall this yeah they the drinking bird stuff not even by in the five dollar mind that the special one thousand dollar wall so we mention okay man ember are furloughed right now because the federal government is officially shut down it is too
totally unprecedented except that happened in two thousand and three thirteen for roughly the same reasons
i have not been paying very close attention to this essentially this is all over the proposed democrats want something to cover the dreamers right they want the dreamers and trump took away the protections against deportation from the dreamers that old
obama put in through executive order and these are people who came to the country as minors and they are the good immigrants in popular culture they're the ones who work hard and serve in the military and go to college and things are like those other immigrants who are just human beings
it was other immigrants are not dying in wars they're not starting a new fusion cuisine place you go didn't feel good about yourself whatever happened to them so that deadline is march for a legislative fix that's going to give citizenship a path to citizenship or just permanent legal status for the dreamers that's mine
stats and bows by the president and democrats have no real leverage here except the budget where republicans need their votes in the senate in order to fund the federal government and oh a little bit about this process so congress has to appropriate money to keep a government running
right and
they will do this by passing and appropriations bill but in recent years it's been harder and harder to pass that appropriations bill especially because of these you know hard liners on the right wing who are freedom caucus right or people like rand paul who say we need to reduce spending in the deficit and destroy social security and all that shit obviously that's apocryphal because all these people voted for the taxpayer
so just total rank hypocrisy
so what congress will do is pass what's called a continuing resolution which is it could it could cover the entire fiscal year could just be a stop gap measure they will just keep things humming along based on whatever the last budget said and we passed i think two or three of these in at the end of last year
just which was imposes a it's just a self imposed deadline the final deadline ran out this weekend on the friday at midnight yeah the most of the most of the coverage of this seen from like the political meat is like who's going to get the blame for it
and
i
one of my predictions are unprepared for to be wrong i picked the main event of the last night you see when i was on go off kingdom of course i cursed being wrong i'm wrong about everything but also i'm right about this
the there's like a lot of hey being made over like oh well it's the republican republicans control both legislative houses and the presidency the shut down happen under them they'll be blamed her or the not enough democrats voted for this will be bland and i have to say i don't think shut down and register with people like they used to
because are rooted did sort of absurdity of a down is rooted in your belief in norms like your belief that way the government should never stopped working everyone should come together to just make sure at least the basic organs upstate work but now after donald trump has been president everything is incredibly stupid roy more the root beer
yes pedophile almost became a senator i don't think these violations of norms work any more people are to analyze to for enough like undecided voters to actually care about is in effect it's like it's only non essential things i mean it's just like the only thing is really being affected by sugar is probably some
actually as time goes on it gets worse
right now it's like you know you can't visit the lincoln memorial or something
they're keeping the parks open but they're just not having trash collection something like that
his i don't a fan of littering now is the time to go hog while but it's also things like a lot of the department of education which provides funding and especially for a special needs students across the country and a lot of the judiciary could shut down in i think a couple of weeks and right know everything just
running on fumes in addition to like things that are mandatory like you know homeland defense the military like these will keep bombing but and as well
the tens of thousands of government employees who are just getting fucked by this or either they have to come into work and will not receive a check or they've been furloughed so i mean it's a shitty situation all around and it's obviously a failure of governance i do think you know your average person this is a byzantine process your average person who doesn't really follow this process isn't really
i have a big table take away except that oh shoot guess those republicans fucked up again how about that because that's really just been the story from the past year everyone who is like following this process to a certain extent has already made up their minds about who's to blame and who's not to blame and most of that is falling on to congressional republicans and the president can you explain
to me
get some one of the lines of heard or saw this week from like the sort of mega trumps of people that i don't know what they're referring to you they keep saying release the memo
they're talking about kind of yeah there's this memo that supposedly shows that the f b i
deleted or what's the word abuse the face a court system vice accords are what they all just voted to renew which are these secret star circle corny talking about this the other week this is the the extension of like the ongoing warrantless and as a surveillance yeah i mean the whole thing is fucking fraudulent out
course the f b i abuse it and they abuse it to terrorize muslims basically and so this is all just like this is just all total invented bullshit because your average mag a pig thinks that oh this is the memo that shows obama ordered the by to surveil donald trump in order to make hillary president
and it also contains evidence that south retro was murdered or whatever that's what they think it okay dumb shit
yeah regarding the shut down while this is happening while while the other trying to pass a continuing resolution or a budget in the background
republicans are negotiating with democrats in order to pass some kind of dhaka deal and i w just been released but the rough outline of it is democrats are going to see more money for border security and for the wall right or they they want to like at least thick allocate money
or make it seems to the trump has the money to build his wall even though nobody thinks is was actually going to get yeah basically some money and they also are going to tinker with the
legal immigration process which is neither here nor there really and in exchange they get a legal status for the dreamers and dreamers get potentially some kind of like ten year pathway to citizenship something like that that's the rough outline of it this is being negotiated by the gang of six which is lindsay graham
flake and four games i'm against gang gang get it and the signals was good for a while and they seem close to a deal until the president said no that's terrible because he saw something on tv or more more precisely because of stephen miller who's an hour now white nationalist
and makes it impossible to deal with
either figure that ever reading has been like the one who's actually negotiating this stuff was like running point is john kelly right he is that he the staff and he's the general he's one of these like you know he's the grown up in the room that i think it's interpreted as like he's the kind of ruthlessly efficient military
a man who's there to provide order and just make sure that the executive bridge run so here's what what is weird about that is that p i think people either forget or allied the fact that john kelly is actually a highly ideological immigration hot as well where he is more in the steven miller camp then you know
lindsey graham other people he's negotiating what happened was at a meeting the schumer right and the fear there was that trump would strike a deal with the democrats and then force congressional republicans to go along with it so kelly dropped a dime to john core nine in the senate and said hey this is going on but we want to assure you there's not going to be a deal that comes out
this so he helps got all the process miller scuttling the process and it's kind of that
it's kind of had a logjam here and the funding deadline came about right the house passed a stop gap measure into the middle of february that would have also fully funded chip the children's health insurance program for something like five or six years that's the sweetener and they expected democrats to just go along with that however
democrats are now
for more or less united in the demand to get legal status for the dreamers they do not want to do what they did at the end of december which is just pass another stop gap because they're activists are getting more and more pissed off about this and it makes sense that they should go to the math for the dreamers because one it's politically pop
mueller like the vast majority of people in the country say oh yeah that's reasonable if anything the conservative position should be to legalize the dreamers or give them a path to citizenship the liberal position or the left position should be full amnesty frank right so they're already negotiating for what is essentially what something like a fifth of the undock
demented population in this country and as well you know even when they get a deal i mean i think a deal would be good but then what do you do with that other four fifths what do you do with the dreamers parents were you're going to say if you're going to give them a deal that says hey you can stay in this country legally but we're going to give more money to enforcement and ice who are going to go to your parents
well the dreamers your favor that because that it just like know parents party
open house silica beastie boys
i would like to be mad matters not here i would like to viewed stream pessimists position
so the polling in favor of dreams that we've seen is very positive but it makes me it makes me wonder that pulling the people who know what the dream act is i hesitate to say that most voters know what a fucked is know about any of this and forever positive dhaka pole
and for our positive goes polls breed dreamers as i don't know that it's i don't know that undecideds are either knowledgeable volt is or that there anything beyond like immigration agnostic and that this won't just this won't it won't be the masses
of the massive shot in the arm to the democrats they think this is i mean
hope that i'm wrong but it just it it seems like one of those things where it's like you have fifty thousand screaming mega shit heads he wrote amnesty and posting pictures from like on barack and saying that their eyes
becoming into do karate the home depot
yeah i saw a really good conservative mean today where is a picture chuck schumer and i think they'd had better than their usual photoshop skills it's chuck schumer but his whole face is covered in those like m s thirteen style tattoos
yeah that's that's pretty cool actual and is what it looks like bond
at age fifty thousand
people like on twitter and lay on all the concern of website and then he have like on hundred thousand resist people who i didn't really seem to give a shit about immigration until tromp until it became like this point that they would argue in response the trump and i wonder if this isn't just one of those cases of
kind of like shutdown of like the same people through the same things about each other getting pulled it pulls in a certain direction but for the majority of voters they're totally ignorant of the issue and it's not going to move anything i have three responses of that one is they should do it for moral reasons oh no no i agree every wants this and they need the basic come out and know
i totally agree or not
they're not getting hoodwink like they've always been getting old when the other is the people who are hardliners on immigration the essentially white nationalists are very very small minority and it's frankly the democrats need to stop keeping to these people and being afraid of them because they're always going to vote republican they should tell them this this reactionary white minority to go fuck themselves and the other is that
in these polls normally it is about framing and perception because in these polls normally they'll read like two statements right and they'll say one should people who are legally immigrated the country as children and you know they work jobs are they go to college or something should they be offered the chance to stay in a country legally and the numbers for that are like seventy seventy five percent
that's an overwhelmingly reasonable proposition for most people i mean will it be framed like that is the question because trumps like cramps polling was famously like completely tank like the lowest ever been for anyone at that point on the presidency and every generic poll that showed like generic democrat vs generic republican was approaching double digits like of
slaughter now we see that that house polls narrative five points and it's because like because enough people not the majority of people it's enough people have seen like have seen the dow is up and they pass this tax bill they don't know how any of this shit works they literally just think oh donald trump the jobs but
the stock market this thing that i don't have any money and because i have a negative net worth oh that means that the economy is doing well their their lives of the same maybe getting a little bit worse is is anyone who's like below middle class but just the way they process information is so a to be they don't
have an understanding of these like highly unlikely issues but it still affects their perception of these issues you'll absolutely here's the thing so obviously republicans are trying to frame it right now as oh democrat shut down the government they refuse to let children have health care for the scary illegal him
grants for the m s thirteen guys and i don't think that is a message that will break through or that anyone will remember come november
honestly like ultimately you can look at the shut down to two thousand and thirteen it what followed that was republicans winning a massive historical victory in the midterm election i i generally think it's a wash but ultimately the only thing that comes out in people's minds because it again this is a very byzantine process people aren't going to hear weight democrats did that for
or they sold out children for illegal immigrants like that means anything or make sense unless they're already a maggot child i think at the end of the day your average like kind of out of touch person going to look at this and say oh wow this is still a shit show this is still pretty fucking incompetent because like you want to sit down and explain the budget process and reconciliation
these things to people nobody's going to do that to
from like the
this alleged deal and the negotiations about dhaka and the wall or whatever like going off or something felix said about how people take by you know i keep hearing all the time the stock markets are unemployment is low and trumpeted their jobs but when he got back in the white house there was like it was comforting glass and obama was like oh
although are not going to touch that not going to break glass
first and only jobs i'm doing or the going to do in the back of
i did you guys get a chance to look at the thing that the new york times did last week where they were lake
no is this week they were like you know instead of lieu of running our go ah bed section on thursday we're only just going to reprint letters from trump supporters yeah the yes i saw the letter that i got bubbling times my family resume
proud of the writer it now
yes i saw the crayon drawing
there are no these are the new york times reading trump supporters who are consider themselves you know educated successful not like the king hogs
we usually i thought about even i regard them as exactly the same yes
i was struck by how basically all the reasons for why they like trump and support for all identical and it all came down to something like yes they declined his boorish behavior and then like i wish he wouldn't tweet but they're like hey the bright side is the economy is back it's better than ever
unemployment is low and they rattled off where he's getting things done like the tax bill which is good he's getting rid of regulations which are bad and the other like the wild card with the thing almost everyone cited as like would net positive like why they still support trunk despite some of the bad things was moving the us embassy to jury
and these are all not like you know orthodox jews reading and these are all just like you know these are the suburban boat dealership type of people who are like i did read are really happy about moving the embassy to jerusalem young i remember seeing that drove over and over again in the letters it's like hey guess what i'm not one of the shoe is room yeah i'm a professor
i am rich
have all i own a boat so i i support trump are you shocked by that it's like no i'm not shy yeah there are plenty of shit at your own music i've been a college professor i'm an author i'm an entrepreneur and that guy was really at the end he was like would trump is done is like we used to be so fragile
we'd be like oh i see this
oh global warming and like now trump is back and he's don't have to be afraid any more of the scary things in the world this is just he literally said chaos is just opportunity and the people who love opportunity capitalists
there was little finger that
i think about donald trump someone who has a very like steely eyed look at the dangers of the world takes him on very soberly well those the actually the only thing in addition to move the embassy dangerous and they all said he defeated isis when he finally let the generals do their thing he edited eyes a job is being the chief come out
under the syrian arab army and as hezbollah to them
the gate economy a second job good for donald trump task grab a top answer the task rabbit
as well as detachment and syria i do have two points about that economy thing and this is something that a lot of people have identified as a kind of kind of a weird aberration of the drug administration is that the economy is doing very well but trumps approvals do not reflect that and even his approvals on the economy which are higher than his overall approval
raiding does not reflect that while we should be clear about what the economy doing well evil ways i attacks and the stock market being up is like what percentage of americans own stock
one hundred
thanks a lot of people i would assume have stocks that are tied to the stock market i ever retirement funds that are tied to the stock a lot of people do own style but it's in retirement funds in mutual funds and also like unless you're a day trader the like year to date movement
do they cycles don't actually mean a lot to you i mean it matters where it's going to be when you catch it out which is like
looking at things were definitely heading towards another recession
generally like a day to day like you have a dow being up and unemployment being down is like a good thing right but like
really
does that mean the economy is yeah i don't think so that when we talk about when we talk about unemployment like the jobs if he will have are like worse and worse in that area canada it's contract yeah it's contract work their wages have not kept up with inflation what's more is that that unemployment that employment and unemployment pull it
smaller now because more people just dropped out of the economy after two thousand and eight the up now if you look at the white collar economy any also service positions what happens to those seven two thousand and eight is combine the jobs have like five people to one person who they worked to the knob and they'll pay them more but they save money
you know sort of the salaries are wages and five people and what's more important the benefits of five people save money on and we're in this swirling world diary a whirlpool of cheap money and trading on the margins of things and the economy now sort of being
growing to be centered around these companies that just spent hundreds of billions of dollars of cheap credit to try to take over a marketplace under the understanding that once they achieve monopoly or oligopoly that they will be able to charge whatever they want to the smaller and smaller pool consumers that can either for this like the the alec the
the average voter are like person is does think that like all like unemployment is down with the economy is doing better their jobs or it's like to me like the only thing that would be like a meeting for indication of like an economy being strong is like what is like wages to productivity
successful economy to me you have been americans are on the average being paid more and working less right that to me would be a healthy and their economy but the exact opposite is true just because they have a fucking job lake
necessarily think that that's a good indicator of economic health or social health certainly not that's really the thing i mean are you you can look at the top line unemployment rate
are you content if you're working in a in amazon slave warehouse where you have to wear a diaper because your bathroom breaks are doled out to you
who by alexa you i mean are you are you content with how the economy is going exactly and doesn't matter to you what that top line number is are you familiar with it does matter what the dow is at once
i've noticed that trump or
his trolling tweet for the women's marches that like more and will live in a loving me because unemployment he obviously didn't write that tweet by the were it's just a side note i really love how easy it is to tell which ones he writes and dozen years
people who write like the fake ones they try to get his style they try to like ape it but it never it never quite right it's always a little too you can never predict over it and you will never predict what the real trample put in all caps you'll never guess what he's going to connect the larger issue to whether it's you know authority that he went to and nineteen
eighty four when you found the other day and you're like if he was going to wrote this before he was it was clear who is paying for the tedious smokey the bear
yeah
have already about keith
but the forest fires
i mean that one that what is great if you want to be one of these people who diagnosis tromp psychology
that just proves how senile
that is that was an early two thousand and fifty that is like that is the exact type of thing and old birth deploys about this see this commercial so many times will watching the fifty and helpers of d v i watch every day will years
i support the message of the smokey the bear ads but i don't support using sex appeal
to my are you that this is another thing where you get isolate yourself with tromp where i'm now convinced that like during the early to those and fifteen part of the campaign he had a feud with smokey the bear and was like no one talks about this for forest fires off and control over vegetate
many birds
it's not nice we don't want to say we don't want to say you know go and say oh we love it when the birds burned to death but when something craps on your car and too many invasive species has another situation correct me if i'm wrong i'm thinking of smokey the bear
as sort of animal pitchmen or cartoon characters goes is this a smokey the bear wear pants but no shirt yes yes so he's like he he's he's literally and and it is
he bought obvious set of other cartoon like famously mickey mouse you know no pants donald no mickey mouse pants oh right yeah i know you don't you think a thinking goofy this country wear pants yeah goofy worse by a good hero goofy where's turtleneck of a little ad
address is like gerry adams
as often but a lot of animals do like that no no shirt pants that like how fifty said would be when it came out and if you had a body like smokey the bear with nowhere assure you would look oh god no to look for any opportunity to take your shirt
into like a turns like the thermometer goes to like sixty five and then it's just all get it out
trump the way that trumps he is the world is kind of always sunny or charlie using cartoon
trump legacies like men's fitness magazine he just his brain interprets of smokey the bear is on the cover like get a body like smoking like i don't get it this is ridiculous
you're talking about how eric trump was like my dad who easter is this person is he doesn't see color he just sees green and we were saying that means that he thinks every person he's met and last ten years the grinch
his chair jerry can be working on christmas he never celebrates christmas because his people the grinch
either great okay look there was one bad one but my daughter is a grinch
she converted to be the grinch
and their children will be beautiful pillows okay look you know it's going to be working are for you and maybe if he he makes peace and middle east we will give ms rose beast
but when the economy i think the problems that are happening today are the same problems i been identified towards the end of the obama administration even though unemployment slow the quality of jobs or worse it's over type fuck and jobs and as well the you if your han casting casting and and as well if your health pre
museums are going up and the cost of living is going up you're not getting ahead you are not doing that much better well this is another refrain that you hear from people who are like you know he may be rude and i may not like his character but like you know he's done good and a tax cut like you know you may see you pig pod casting entrepreneur three hundred dollars may not seem like
enough before working fairway an extra three hundred dollars in the old pocket that uncle sam doesn't get a taste of that immediately go to the servicing their dead
didn't like was that you to dollars as like you know weighed against what you're already paying for pocket health insurance
that was that was another thing that i think was under orbit the election if you notice like in the fall of two thousand and sixteen people's premium skyrocketed yeah it up
you know i would rate before the election there is a big spike in the apartment and insurance markets are worse than ever because of little things that trump is done to fuck with them as executive orders and parts of the tax bill
but i do fear maybe the people are so adamant that they may be the people that didn't vote or voted for top in these rust belt states where their premium skyrocketed they think of he's still fixing obama care after obama made my insurance more expensive or
i don't have to do to individual mandate a more exciting at some point like that that breaks at some point you can't compartmentalize these things i think it's bad enough you know what's going on in the cooler areas in the manufacturing belt trumps main problem is he's going to bring back these high paying jobs
right in the manufacturing industries where you don't need an education necessarily the jobs that have been going and getting outsource sort of these trade agreements the boys on routers of the world economic i where are the opposite is happening there are still lay offs there are still the carrier plan is having lay offs and what's replacing them fox con is matt was telling me the other day fox
khan is going to go to wisconsin have a fucking suicide net
going here but you know do these disaffected people
frankly most of them who didn't vote in the first place some of them for chromosome number for clinton's on them didn't vote it depends on where you go
day shift to the left or is it the story of what's happened so much of america thirty realization that people just get so beaten down by their lives by having no solution they just stop or spending all together
i mean i don't know i can't answer that question it really depends on what kind of messages they get and whether or not
there are people who can spread an alternate explanation for what's going on one they've not been exposed to before i well if you if you just leave things in a vacuum it's going to go to the right because that's that's his liver reactionary country because that's the consequence of that's the conclusion you draw base on everything this
country has taught you and your experiences have taught you especially growing up during the cold war and the baseline will always default to the right because even know these same people are getting laid off at their jobs as we talked about before what does offer is tangible if not into material says than certainly in a psychological one as you've taught
before this chin see brand of nationalism been kind of like you have nothing else you know at least some of america and like that like you know america is strong and good right i always hated that thing of oh they're voting against their own self interest and i always thought it was such an improper calculation because he has the democrats offer them like
a marginally better world i don't say marginally as this huge attack on the democrats i say marginal because a lot of the economic solutions they're offered are on the margins and for a lot of things that's fine your life is built around the margins especially in in in the economic sense
you do have a need a big down down the middle not centralism the overall change but offered marginal improvements are marginal stop gaps against the declining life expectancy in wages that have not kept up with the c
they're offered something that is exactly what their self address our which is an internal kingdom of heaven and in america built on blood and soil they can be proud of if you're given the choice of like ears your same shitty life
maybe you'll be able to buy better insurance for some people don't leave english affect them
a little more than others or you you are you are on god's right hand smoking all all the all the fucking isis terrorists and all the european policies and you will be in heaven with god forever because he stood on the side of righteousness
what are you going to pick what do you get to pick are you get a pixel are you going to pick soaring storing language are you gonna pick
frankly with the other party filling other even know what they're like the prospect of like making your life are no two to five percent better if you're willing to fill out like a zillion forms and like you know and then compare rates on like every different individual market like every single day
and given even if you want to if you want to go to these economically depressed places and you want to bring people into your fault you want to get them on your side
you will how you can't just give empty promises biggest democrats have been doing that for decades and they don't buy it any more because you have to actually explain why things can be different or given other another explanation not a conservative explanation for what's going on and the labor movement has been pushing that
explanation that it's nafta and people like bernie sanders push that explanation it's the machinations of wall street that's easy these are easy enemies to identify and i do want to say for anyone who's listening to get mad at us from the liberal arts center aside to say that we are hyper focusing on apple asia we're not
because you seem to say you saw the same low level of engagement in philadelphia in two thousand and sixteen
this is not a win this is a working class problem working class people are on engage that doesn't mean fucking white working class that means everybody they don't vote at the numbers you think they should and i know that because your calculations were hinged on them doing that and they fucking get it
not only that he's doing that then you know
made note of and made fun of numerous times
that what we what did she say for every way working class voters
oh yes so rich republican race what is what does he have an matic oh what a genius pragmatic move are going to bet that country club republicans are going to be against racism without locking that is hilarious though about all the people who sneer at my class politics as being kind of
sir
underhanded way of promoting a kind of heritage evoke white social democracy it's all the people are staring at that were like after recording the votes of rich racist or add and the deal they just tried to make was to give donald trump a symbol of racism the same people that have spent this entire time
you know going at bernie sanders or even further hating anyone who makes a joke they don't lag are defending schumer for trying to give trump the wall
as part of the sea ordeal and they say you know oh
he won't actually affect immigration it's symbolic what the fuck was the point of all of all that are into that sixteen the if it's ok to give donald fucking trump a symbol of racism the thing he ran on
what was your point it's almost like you have no fucking believes in you just want to flanking will allow me as i am i the only one who thinks that chuck schumer is just not as crafty is that a white man drawing
yeah she is going to get fucked in these negotiate oh yeah
a strategy mindset political tactics genius question yeah yes
as it exists now it seems like the democrats to like if they can get something for the dreamers they'll be like okay trump can have his wall on the assumption that like this very kind of maybe not even incorrect technocratic view of things that like the wall
probably won't get built anyway even if they give it the fucking money for aetna there's a certain logic there i don't i mean i wouldn't make that deal here
during which you make a deal if the deal was
she'd be pushing for which is for amnesty for everyone is in america and in exchange for that trunk gets to build this stupid wall is that is that a good deal yeah i consider that a good deal for this reason the here's how that frame has shifted in thousand and thirteen congress the senate passed by sixty eight votes a bipartisan
that would have amnesty for the undocumented immigrants in this country not just dreamers just full amnesty and the house under john boehner who's not who's not a rigid ideological paul ryan is did not even take it up and it was dead now they can they are struggling to pass even a compromise
that would give legal status to a fraction of undocumented people in this country i mean the democrats have ceded so much ground in these past few years and i honestly think that the only way that they could call back and try to win back this narrative is by making that big demand in terms of a wall i mean for god's sakes
you don't congress can appropriate money for something with such a legislative language where it doesn't actually have to be spent people expect that the next president will be a democrat and the next president can say fuck it worse than going to build as fuck and wall anymore and fuck you but they would have to have the political courage to say that and say fuck you to the mega white now was child
we have talks we have a joke before the past perhaps even on the show that like the savviest thing
hooked to do politically we just go to a border state and have as tiny section of the wall built and be photographed her front of it during his folks are wearing a hat and that was basically all you need to do you know you could just say you already built i don't believe it doesn't matter that matter because it doesn't do it doesn't there's already portions of will fucking wall i mean what's more
disgusting frankly is ice and no democrat should be voting to fund ice and i think that the demand that we should have is a democratic caucus that says the fund ice because these people are actual fascist pigs this is like the you saw the video yeah you saw you're against it the most despicable things i've ever seen in my life
these fucking innovators who are all neck folds just head full of neck fold pouring out the water that these
i'm sorry i can't remember the name of the zero there are groups that leave water and supplies in the desert because i keep in mind the us mexico border is one of the deadly as borders in the world in terms of how many he will die every there's yes of people in the past two decades die and all you do is a leave out jugs of water some food
some who is it gets very cold there and night i think i forget the deserts i do get very cold at night
here's bets of facts
right and these these guys they are border guys they go around there and they just pour out the water or kick it over and they filmed themselves doing it like they don't care because they don't care because they will now
never ever be punished for it ice is i mean law enforcement in general is probably maybe the worst slice america has to offer and of that slice i could be the ice is definitely the worse because i firmly believe the people that join eyes were too fucking stupid or flunked the site test to join every other branch
of law enforcement this is the absolute as ragged they tried to the time i joys in high school his own like you know their ambition was just to make life hard on other yeah they have they've wanted to be someone who could it's like the ball and thing i'm going to show use never that here thanks
it's people who couldn't even get into like this special swat team that they have for the department of education
dives anyway here's how i see things going on you know the feeling back to the budget thing the democrats have only one card to play because the need sixty votes overcome a filibuster to pass the budget and when they tried late on friday night to pass the house bill which was just another temporary extension into the middle of february five democrats
voted for it for republicans vote against it
and the democrats are the usual suspects the heidi hide camp and joe mansion and these red staters and our newest red cedar doug jones of course
he he's given out his phone number of a
got builds up on the low by jones about the compromise because the see are about to blow and be that back then hosts didn't want me than roy and more was a pedophile
well i've had back then was it a while but he should have been road more so
now they still don't want
and the republicans were graham and flake who are still passing trying to push the bipartisan deal
and might lead and rand paul who are there from the right wing saying we're spending too much we need to we need to pass a serious budget cuts every by the way who of course voted for the tax by the way it just gave out today finally we we know what the rand paul beating was about it was because he can
he is
is literally piling brush to close this neighbor's yard
that is like summer your suburban mine said i love like the deeper into suburban mindset you go you just become like croats and
his
the micro different oh my god no did you see also this week rand paul are doing some hearing about the crisis rate and as rand paul los to you he was this out that he's a doctor in
but he went to medical school reading i went to hollywood upstairs about a coyote read these letters on the wall
and
no no no edit out and rand paul was testifying about how
over prescribed that he is like as athletic he may now have recently ah know a thing or two about pain and i know bet you she just to have just wouldn't take an aspirin
it hurts every time a breed
we're not worth thin leave that lean should bother two thousand and seven three
are p for it
seriously they don't know i might have hired a vendetta don't do leave
though i mean if you have been i would like to try it i must say i'm going to do it as much as i know i meant the listener
not us
the vulcan analysts yeah so the sorry couldn't pass it the deal that the gang of six is working on they have apparently gotten a promise from mcconnell to bring a dac a deal to the floor on february eighth so what could happen
possibly monday is both houses will just pass another continuing resolution until the eighth and then wrap all of that together that's a possibility but when right now everyone sort of in trench and they're playing the blame game and i say democrats win it because simply because the republican leaders
ship has been one the republicans controlled the entire government to be as probably has just been so fucked up for this past entire year that it's driving these suburban voters whom hillary banked on into the arms of democrats they're the ones interesting you're saying that matters not here i'm going to fill in his role just go
out jar pilot could be president shit world health health skate twenty eight it well i mean what's powering this democratic wave that's building right now it's two things one it's the standard democratic base that's engaged in coming out and to his these educated upscale suburbanites
are actually appalled by the government not necessarily because they disagree with conservative dogma but they just don't like the way it's operating and they're willing to vote for democrats who position themselves as the rational ones i'm not saying that produces a good democratic caucus but if you're short term goal is we have to take control of congress then sure
you can rely on that and the end this shutdown is only going to encourage both of those trends
so the dagger deal i i do just have one final thought on this and
you're seeing the blame game go around and right wing people are very fond of pointing out now that oh republicans can't just pass it alone they need democratic votes therefore it's the democrats fall
you might be wondering why they don't use reconciliation to pass this reconciliation is a legislator procedure where that the certain bills involving the budget spending and deficit can not be filibuster you can pass that with a simple majority in the senate
that's what it's there for the reason why and this is incredibly important not a lot of people are talking about this the reason why you can only use reconciliation once each this school year
and the republicans already used it on the tax bill that's how they pushed it through that's why they have to get democrat votes here and if they had just used reconciliation for the budget as it's supposed to they could pass whatever budget they want well shows their priorities exactly
for air priorities so it's not that the democrats are holding the federal government hostage for dreamers it's republicans already did that for a one point five trillion dollar tax about a wealth transfer to the upper class either way the democrats absolutely should hold the federal government how absolutely dream or not just the dreamers but all illegal and
it's their only honestly it's their only card to play and i honestly scared that schumer is going to fuck it up and he'll play that card too early or hill agreed to will budget deal that doesn't guarantee a dreamer passage but just guarantees consideration of it you need some kind of large bill
because ryan has to get that pass in the house and the present has to sign it i think what schumer should try to do here and i'm just thinking out loud here is get a bipartisan
bill to the floor of the senate
have every democrat vote for it and enough republicans to vote for or just push it through fast enough so that no real filibuster can emerge there that's going to find the government tighter to chip tie that the dreamers and say that's it that's the only vote were doing the house you either pass that or or fuck off because we're not passing anything else and the price
didn't you sign it or not or you'll see you own the shut down and that's it that's the only real way to play hardball here because there is a deadline of early march for the dreamers and the president can at any given time reinstate obama is executive action and from his prior statements he doesn't actually give a shit up
about any of this he doesn't actually despise the dreamers he just believes whatever the last thing he heard was it might be from steven miller and might be from john kelly might be from foreign brands that he lobbied yeah so there is so i mean you can see it in the genuine fear of people in the white house that or republicans in congress
oh fuck if he talks to this genius chuck schumer he might be pretty convinced by this charismatic heavy weights will can't let this happen again
chuck schumer will use nagging and quito to get trip to the giveaway the whole store
chuck schumer in the steam punk
he's wearing goggles and of top out what what do you think it is it an egg drop he's going to get it soon to be something like you've you've like you've lost weight
mind that i work keep in mind though that the only way the democrats in the senate their bargaining position is straw is if those five democratic senators don't vote against the rest of their caucus that's mansion height camp donnelly their of a banana mccaskill mccaskill the i will play haskell jones okay
well that's easy process a tall order
that's really it for lions if you're only card to play if that's your only leverage you have to use it as much as you can maybe i think i've got i think is a practical matter they'll just pass and other see our and then still try to figure out the immigration thing who knows what trumped does honestly and one knows what right does
moving moving on from the machinations of congress the but you have thrown yes the this case of throws the rob they're all playing you win or you cry
your meet you know are we touched a little bit before about this kind of to freeze reviews before the show blood and soil nationalism that i think does some up like a certain kind of nation
or resurgence resurgent fascism in america
i'd like to segue now into a group of people they represent
i would say blood and soil nationalism because i don't think it's quite accurate i'm going to
i would say more like kermit and belly button linz nationalism
and i'm referring of course to the
but events a gala event held here in new york city last night perhaps you are familiar with it we were in attendance
i mean we were really i'd be honored guest speakers i'm talking of course about likes of which in his name of freedom in new york city just one night because i think every night night a free unlimited freedom and so few of the this
and as you guys catch any that i did i did there is one thing that a know we will be talking about though when it was at the chelsea manning thing so the after story to this apparently was that chelsea manning showed up to the event
as to cub reporters from buzz feed well reported on a incredibly nuanced and correct ways well what are what do we make of this like chelsea do better chelsea doesn't matter you don't see come on shopper so like the entire thing with it is murky i mean chelsea
post of the choose protesting there were people there who are protesting that save a chelsea came up talk to them but then there's also that picture of chelsea with jack prowess
cassandra
whatever and it's it's like there was a of her giving the thumbs down so you have to weigh that against i mean i think you gotta say it's yet bad up but i also think like the response to it which you know from a lot of the left is either like know this is perfect she did the perfect thing or know about optics here
or i told you she fucking saw a piece of shit and the response from liberal quarter's which is like they probably went there to do russia stuff together because they all like russia
all ironic because i i don't know i've been thinking about this vaguely about chelsea and i think that
chelsea sort of burst onto the consciousness of the very online left ourselves included because she did something very heroic it very selfless and was yes nearly tortured to death for seven years for it and because of the stupid way that we process people we like we've decided
after that
it's not just a person that we admire who does things that a person would do that they are living icon of everything that we believe in so if they do something that on first glance is like it leads bad optics
that it's actually correct or on the other hand if you put somebody up that much if you put them on that much of a pedestal if you make them so inhuman dehumanization walks and both ways both and making someone subhuman or angelic literally having no human qualities it will crush and disappointment so much that you will come out spitting venom or
worse become totally disengaged
and
i think the thing that no one is saying is that maybe this person who is stuck in solitary for seven years
maybe maybe they're having some trouble
maybe they're having some trouble in the fucking world
i had to say it like kind of annoyed me a lot seeing like near at hand in go interesting this is probably part of are planned to murder been carded and it's like is it is it that is of the cheers a comprehensive plan or is it the of a world view you never know irrigated and mean this person made a mistake
or did something stupid because maybe her engagement with the world is a little off from what you think it may be because your boss
blocked her in solitary for seven fucking years or you were being paid and bends or die as
to that add to that entire quarter who's spouting steam out of their fucking knows about this confirms and you their cree fucking craven mad men writings
joke out of fucking frogs the a bladder but you know i do want to say to everyone in our quarter like
you know this is not to say don't criticize or
if what she says is true is bad optic should certainly certainly that if you take that one picture and you go oh maybe she's like nuke us and riverbank or something
yeah because like i started edge in and all of them are using her appearance there to be like all like you know like hey we were all nice to her like if we were really nazis like we wouldn't have been meaning to chelsea or what i think it's that one is weird because everyone is like everyone is furious add
chelsea for oh you legitimize them like okay but then what do you say about like the new york times
right how many articles have we seen about how what a gene more likely that idiot buzz feed reporter like daily they interpret like you know
whether whether it's sure not like they have no problem going to these events and schmoozing with these people and giving them a platform or whatever my general opinion is that
being photographed with these people in any way or just giving them any kind of oh you shouldn't
about the about the the freedom night
one other thing can we can we listen to a little bit of the musical act of milk and cook yeah i found it so i read his music and we can we just era snippet of it is quite honestly like the worst garbage i've ever heard
it's like
yeah music written for a car


magic of diablo they lose universe and the movie
or had to take a pill that suppressed
milk and good sounds like knocking the actual act seem to be nice lake
twenty one they're like twitter and another like twins assessed hitler youth guys the property brothers his songs
no they're impression blues brothers
chris makes it very i think steve point that
this is there their seamless called joy district that that is where the the nazi assess joy division was held oh okay it was like the community in which you know will be all those wonderful gals big post punk set up yeah
this says
the law sexual excitement of qaeda or craft work fast
jimmy buffet this is the kind of music you put on when you're trying to seduce a serbian
don't
god you think this week with this guy mark stein it was on tucker doing he's a he's the new fourteen eighty eight beat reporter for tucker
petrol every episode of yucca see i'm not a not necessarily tivo this clip got passed around a lot and he is this like sort of canadian muppet who often is the sub co host for a rush limbaugh
he's been around for a long he's been so he's been like a national review guardians russian both pleasure boy yeah he's are easy easy easy easy easy rush pig
so he was on security and use in this clip that didn't pass around a lot where he says that like you know basically says demography his destiny and like in the future of arizona is hispanic and as such that effectively means that the border has been moved north and the he's lamenting the fact that like the south west is
as a lot of spanish speakers on it which is fucking funny because the past was also literally mexico but
i bring this up only because i treated about this learn the week but i really want to make this and want to get the spread is far and wide as possible marks nine cut an entire album called feline groovy
that is his sort of like you know when seth macfarlane like makes people companies parties and do is like lounge blizzard character and mixing crew to them i didn't know that but i would like an invitation to that he does that kind of like pseudo fake lounge lizards jazzy like swimming kind of guy yeah and he does he's call
songs about cats mark sign is an amateur lounge areas sings about as a jazzy songs that are all that house cats can i put one on his or a try yeah listen to
i taught i thought
a couple of vision
think
i thought i'd see
dad and been
you
i thought i still run
i thought i saw pussy
i still am
i saw
i still see
a group in
i did
good as plain as he could be
then proceed
really guys
guys that was overs new concept album
yeah there's there's there's a whole everybody bump that feeling groovy
no it's like i bring this up because you know marks nine has been a guy who was like proto oh all right before i even if thing he wrote a whole book about how europe is being out by muslims and what not and he's very much
know he likes cats as much as
back to the beginning and the pretty tat won't touch the koran is trying to get it
i thought i saw a boy
saying all law
i bring this up because
because it is these are people whether they are the date for freedom people are the slightly more upscale sophisticated version and like this sort of dad version of that represented by marx nine are people who are the self appointed defenders of western civilization and western culture and
they lament that it's being diluted by multiculturalism and diversity and they they hate that but i think it is absolutely bear it isn't obvious point but like it really berries stressing this is the culture they want
the culture that they're actually want in defending is not marble statues or like great works of literature or shakespeare charles dickens it's this it is the most chin see corny bullshit imaginable every this is what they feel safe with this is what all of our culture would be like if they
even announced our you know what it is every single one of these guys is gail better
by the way i am see replaying all the breaking bad this month fifth anniversary of break

thanks that a toddler does
my head of off know did you
i've been reading it because it's funny either way
so what do you think sure we get our anger and on criminal one ryan m f grim yeah right
grim and so on will talk socks and politics yeah politics and super bowl or talked me into
we're going to give you all the betting like one of the replies to jerry priceless about his book is i used to like sci fi nowadays the government intrigue is so deep it beggars authors imaginations much more this lowly reader
folks any accuracy use a document
right now onto the main event
weeks interview role that tape
all right we're join now by ryan grim live via satellite live my certainly from the top of the arianna huffington broadcast building and studios ryan grant joining us now to discuss the block buster a piece of shoe other reporting him anything just turned in for the intercept
this week about the dc c and d c c cc the ditch teacher if the d trip turtles
but the episode titled there we go ryan
before i asked you about that i want to i want to get something that happened this week
not in the article per se but i think is largely related to what the article is getting at here
and that's basically where the democrats stand now post this like government shutdown they decided to back out of it some would say cave
on reopening the government with and like when this happened on monday the line was basically they did it to preserve as chip the health care for children and that this is just a ploy to get mitch mcconnell and republicans were they want them on a dock of oh then i think on thursday just
came out that they would not be tying doc or linking it to any future budget negotiations to i have that correct yeah more or less yeah so what is the line out of the democratic leadership now
going from this is a brilliant bit of negotiating to further capitulation on the very issue that this was supposed to be about when the nice thing about this was that we're going to be able to get an answer within the next couple of weeks
there and so part of the line that's coming from them is just wait like we've got this like
there were sitting down with graham and durban and he are going to come together on something or we're going to pass it through the senate and then we're going to jam paul ryan and the freedom caucus and we're going to force them to take it
and the beauty is that within the next few weeks you were going to know whether or not that's actually gonna work but what you saw i think was all two thousand and eighteen related democrats have these nice bunch of folks running in trump states in two thousand and eighteen and they started getting scared and me
saw their poll numbers dipping and chuck schumer had designs on you know it started out like democrats like well let's see if we can not get annihilated in two thousand and eighteen to whoa if we really run the table here we could actually take the senate and so anything that gets in a way of taking the
senate
is going to have take a backseat and by their lights which getting in the way of that is negative perception that they are shutting down the government because of
favre illegal immigrants right
right in states where you don't have a vocal population of dreamers okay so yeah exactly
so i guess wait and see is the line that we that's that's the best that they've got right now
times report the times of war that joe mansion was close to actually retiring and of right yes election this year and the article implied heavily i don't think they came out said it that schumer worked harder to end the shut down because mansion as a moderate in the problem solvers caucus was very
yeah unhappy about yes
that sounds right
and he's a case where you can safely say that if he doesn't run like they're not winning that seat and two thousand and eighteen
like there are a lot of states where you can make an argument that there might be progressive populist that could step in and rally
and actually win a general election
there does not seem to be that possibility in west virginia and so they're looking at them thinking okay well we we lose that see we lose we lose west virginia for like two generations ryan you're saying that but is there any chance that they could perhaps get don blankenship to come over to the donkey side prompt give in
given just making your a barren you america humour has impressive recruiting abilities and he would fit the profile of the kind of
successful business manager greater sell funding in a it
and it doesn't cost much to self funded and election in west virginia
makes hard choices not afraid to get
surfers
a few a cuts through custer red tape is big on criminal justice reform
yeah he's first hand experiences experience the excesses of the system
don attica blankenship yeah future criminal justice reform
so this is this is how the democrats are looking forward to two thousand and eighteen which they are hoping and being a wave election a like a backlash against donald trump
i guess that schumer in in the senate but i want to want to talk now about the peace that you only wrote for the intercept which is really all about the house of representatives and as we said the the d triple six mafia
and their plans for it
you open this piece with a group of activists in lancaster pennsylvania who these are grassroots progressive activists who like after the thousand and sixteen election came together and as you quote in the peace basically said that we don't want to ever get out organized again and our own backyard and they are coming to get around
the core democratic policy issues like preserving the
and then also locally making sure that you know the state of pennsylvania is your house of representatives is kept out of the hands of like tea party freedom caucus yeah hose
these people they call us around a candidate name jess king
can you describe what happened after they've got a fair amount of momentum and indeed fund raising what happened when jess king sort of ran her propose campaign up the flagpole to the bigwigs of the democratic party
not much is basically what happened and i talk to a couple of people on the establishment side who ended up endorsing her opponent and essentially
they didn't really even know that just king was running you know the the parties just like luck
endorse this woman christina hartman in two thousand and sixteen she's going to run again so let's all endorser again and so yeah so just just king she reaches out to emily's list for instance and emily's list know sends back a questionnaire
are you pro choice
are you really pro choice are you
are you lying about being pro choice you sure you're pro choice you know she's so she fills out her all questionnaire gets back to them and that's and that's kind of the end of that and she finds out later that emily's list is endorsing her opponent who had gotten wiped out in the in the two thousand and sixteen election
same with most of the congressional delegation same with ed rendell same with katie mcginty who ran for senate in two thousand and sixteen and last same with this group called and citizens united which was founded by three veterans of the triple see and is ostensibly campaign finance reform group
but they
they endorsed this this this her opponent as well so you know
so she you rally dislike pretty huge grass roots support and she hit the one hundred thousand dollar mark pretty early which is for washington that's kind of a number that starts to get get people interested like oh okay this this this this is somebody me how is this
israel is a one hundred with her grassroots can they are able to raise one hundred grand on her own and her own people without the help of washington and the d triple sees a larger fund raising apparatus like basically all small dollars and yeah basically all local what can you tell us about the difference between just
king as a candidate and cristina hartman the one that they ended up backing i mean you mentioned before and think biggest importer one casino hartman was already a she had already lost before and underperformed hillary clinton in this district still with her the apartment was she was a consultant in in washington
for awhile came back and was a consultant
in in lancaster or in lancaster region
and when she ran she she ran as kind of we're not the you know we're not the republican the republican is terrible is gross
he's just like donald trump
your vote for us and very kind of on objectionable democratic platform if you if you go through her website or if you go through questionnaire that actually filled out for lancaster stands up you know
it's a lot of things that sound like they are very progressive and then you read kind of the questionnaire the just king and you're like oh that that's that's actually mean something like that something i can disagree with so whereas you know the the pristine harm and approaches more like i'm for more opportunity
more access to the kind of and citizens united is actually a good example of that kind of rhetoric it's like yes let's and citizens united
and everybody wants to rally around the idea that you should get rid of scissors you know it's terrible court decision
oh actually what does that mean
i mean and citizens united
but how what how we're going to do that and citizens united
and then what are we going to do after we end that because
citizens united was just a couple of years ago and things were terrible for that too it's like how hillary wall street to cut out high frequency trading and everything just went down and said
large down to the supreme court say citizens united
like citizens united that was founded by a couple consultants right right right
it was a project is up a pack connected to this
a consulting firm called mothership strategies
i thought that
we wrote a show about these people that would be called to out here
yeah it's called i'm a little baby nurse me super
ryan
frank i want to return the article something that just kills and can't
i am really answer your question
sorry about that her her whole strategy was the the clinton strategy that ed rendell strategy of okay we're going to lose some working class votes but we're going to peel peel republicans out of the suburb exactly
age and jerking strategy is the opposite yeah we're we're going to go when those working class people were going to bring our base out we're going to bring the hispanic vote out and we're gonna bring we're going to bring more voters the polls then they bring to the faults exactly know the only group that ever accomplish that we're going to lose working class and pick up suburban
people and it paid off with g it in the early two thousand
the only time it's ever been done successfully right you right here
just says her her her own campaign she said
she planned to focus a populist progressive campaign on canvassing and harnessing grassroots enthusiasm here's the key part if suburban republicans came along attracted by the promise of medicare for all or tuition free public college then great but they would not be kings target
we have lambaste we have made fun of this line that came out of the twenty sixteen election it for every one white working class vote we lose will pick up to in the pennsylvania in the philadelphia suburbs and like this is the this is the real like ongoing test case for that already losing strategy which their doubling
down on again going into two thousand and eighteen what's a wild as that she underperformed hillary clinton
so like let's say that hartman in two thousand and sixteen in a tough year or whatever for democrats in pennsylvania
came came really close to winning and over performed hillary clinton and if you're the trouble sees okay well she was really good she she she outperformed our national candidate let's give it another shot but she actually there were people who went into the ballot box and were like yes i'm voting for hillary clinton
and then looked down at the next one
and they're like no i'm not voting for her i'm voting for the guy's name a smoker
conant i'm going to vote for smoker instead so to underperform hillary and then
you know to immediately rack up all of the establishment endorsements when you jump into the race again
doesn't show whole lot of reflection about the the the strategy that was that objectively collapsed in pennsylvania right
kind of a tangent here but you quote ed rendell saying that in the peace and i know schumer also said that in two thousand and sixteen was that a talking point that the hillary campaign distributed to surrogates to defend their shitty strategy yeah it's certainly became a talking point yes yeah so couple i'm like yeah we call it ed rendell
because he's he's he still the boss of the pennsylvania democratic party
but yeah it was it was like that was it we're gonna yeah yes it's true we're going to lose you know bob over here
but we're gonna pick up a couple ladies out here near the pan era you mentioned at the end of this opening story about lancaster pennsylvania you say you right in mid october the d triple see hosted a candidate week in washington bringing democrats running for the house around the country for training and networking
hartman was invited king was not as part of the canada gathering and off the record happy hour with national reporters was hosted by the detroit will see in the quote wasserman room with the democratic national courtyard
you
there's no fighting in the laws them in a room
he tripped week is ache olympic village
yeah yeah
it's balls for condo it's an all star weekend like hardy be says lobbyists don't get cold
like they're big elaborate
party room when right when you walk in and see it's literally called the wasserman didn't see
their party room is named after debbie wasserman schultz
this is the party they want to recruit a new candidates
again it's just like this
this article at least in that they had this happy hour
wasserman
the washing machine room
popping bottles in the washing machine
people hating on the outside because they can't get in problem solving wasserman room
there are times in journalism where you just have to be grateful
i mean i think it's this article really becomes about like the overall culture of the democratic party and like efforts
slight indications that there may be shifting in one way but then you think there's a party room named after devry washing machine
and the mind begins to balk i want to get to the next thing probably like this is a thing that we should do well and maybe it will become a the next and see chair will have to have an actual position on the name of the wasserman
because i mean perez is probably country with wasserman
that the difference
i thought the top or as the in viper lounge with lana del ray
among often like the lancaster pennsylvania example i want to go down to the thing which i think has been like the sort of the stinger that has been most chaired out of this article can you describe for us what the rolodex test is who knows it and what is it so let's say that you are
thinking about running for congress or you are running for congress and you you obviously want to decouple see support they've got they've got money they've got big email lists got bliss have lots of rich people who are now looking to give to people that the party says i should give to so you won't impress them so you sit down with their
with somebody from the digital seen the most rudimentary version of this is to take your phone out and scroll through your contacts
and say okay
this guy he worked at the law far more i used to work i'm sure he'd hold and house me a fundraiser i bet i bet he'd be good for fifty four hundred himself plus you know he could do a fundraiser for thirty you're like okay were right about thirty five thousand so you and you go through your rolodex you go
your contact list
and you kind of add up
what you can shake out of that and if you know depends on the district
you know it's a lot more expensive to run in new jersey then it has to run in west virginia but if the number is an impressive one then all right let's let's talk to you go through your phone and maybe i've got five thousand bucks out of here
thanks for coming by we don't validate
let me see here rachel millman i think she's good for ten grand
felix can i have ten thousand dollars
get it back whenever i'm going through my contacts right now awry in i see is three different drug dealers i knew in college all name white mike
i thought well you only give once you know just just because they're and there three times does that mean they can give can
we can rely heavily on the white mike
no amount of her support wall as a good boy the first ten names in my account airport are different numbers i can reach my mom at all
does you boys in the senate that's our that's how the show got started
and the bomb you can either occurred
mean that actually is a favored way of
finding a campaign patrick murphy's daddy put about a million bucks in a senate campaign and that was the reason that the cc endorse him over alan grayson
was that two thousand and fourteen and sixteen so yeah actually rich parents that that ends the phone test right there was thrown back in your pocket that's the best way to do anything that your mom you just get permission from your mom you can do anything the world's your oyster cancer and harris's dad died so that she could be a senator that's beautiful
for quite a gift now
obviously know money money talks and bullshit walks and politics is a prime example that you need money to run a campaign and you mention it's more expensive to do that in certain parts of the country than other others
how about the example that you use from minnesota
and just how well it seems like are on the surface obviously the d triple see there are no dummies they know that you need money to win
and you know having money equals a viable candidate and they want to support viable candidates right at the same time
this rolodex text test does favor a certain kind of candidate that has increasingly become more and more distant from the issues and beliefs of the base of the party and you talk a little bit about the case of angie craig and jeff erdman yeah and jeff erdman and and on
i got to put a whole lot about him in the in the story but he's he's been an american government teacher in in the state for two thousand and seven years and think a varsity football coach for almost as long as like friday night lights sky twice he was the minnesota varsity football coach of the year
and he in order to run he went down to eighty percent so that he could get out of school little bit earlier after the football season ended and go out campaigning and trying to get a spin off the ground he did eighty percent yes to keep keep their to keep his health insurance and his wife whose his speech
therapists took a second job
you know so that he could go down to eighty percent now he's kind of a charismatic as you would imagine from a varsity football coach of the year he volunteered for angie craig in two thousand and sixteen
and came away
disaffected watching watching her campaign and so that's why you decided now
jump into the race that's an interesting bio that's the brainy jock type you know he's in the locker room talking about checks and balances and shit
he gives his american government teacher he's very idealistic about the process and public public financing of campaigns and me is also kind of a down the line bernie democratically medicare for all pretty college and of the whole the whole slew and he thinks that that that district in minnesota's is ready for it he doesn't buy the this will turn off
the the rural voters
hey when he was phone banking for angie craig this is one of the things that drove him to run himself he said the script was written for a kind of the metropolitan voter and he said
what if i get a rural person on the phone
and he said the supervisor said to him
you know there are deep thinkers out there are just tell the trailer park story
because angie craig grew up in a in a mobile home
real humble upbringing in somewhere in minnesota
and he's like just tell him the trailer park story
the second thing that drove him was somebody asked him a question at a at the door
you know the answer to it so when you had a chance to talk to to and unit in a queue and a said you know what do we do about that should be direct them to the website or white and she's now don't do that yeah we haven't built out the website yet because we don't want to put our positions up there so that the republicans don't know where we stand certainly because then they'll start attacking us for it and besides we haven't
gonna end of summer polling it
so now i don't necessarily do that just you know animal literature and and move on and he was like that there's just no way and he thinks that not only is at the wrong way to run a campaign but he thought that that was part of the reason she lost and and she badly underperformed to and not only did she underperform hillary clinton minnesota she got fewer votes
then the state house and the state senate candidates
so everybody on the ballot
she lost to literally everybody their show people you know there were thirty thousand people that went into the the ballot
and just did not vote for either her or her or her opponent they were there they they they took the trouble of of driving their asses all the way to the polls and and just didn't vote for so what you're saying is that trailer park story didn't work on the roofs
maybe the intel it to enough people i don't know
i mean again what you're describing is a pattern of the favoring of candidates who have business connections good contacts but essentially run a campaign to the extent that it has a message is not one that resonates with anyone or his pitch to basically modern
republicans and everyone else will be completely like the lack of enthusiasm here is startling thinking is it betrays like a fundamental lack of not only ability purchased interest to talk about politics in a way that connects with people's lives as you said like oh well we can't actually tell me what we believe the republicans will attack us for
if i mean why even run in their place at the republicans know that we're going to be on the ballot they're just going to do the same thing
to be one step ahead of them
it's not even like campaign i mean people have talked about like cynical democratic party machines but you know if only it could be that this isn't even that this is like fucking amway it literally is you're just you're getting a bunch of fucking losers who got sick of staring out the window their corner office because they saw one of those instagram means the phone
janet girl doing yoga
you know make it so that the world
is is your office and yeah i'm going to do that and then they go in with the only skills they have which is looking in their phone book and asking people for money
it's like mary kay for people who sold missiles to the saudis i got an idea what if dietrich goes out and recruits all of those guys who have twitter accounts about that posts success when mine said memes know and all those pictures are those like stock photos of guys and tailored suit standing on boats and shit yeah oh
people always like oh let's get rid of citizens united states
let's get rid of the revision that says senators have a natural born citizens because then we get michael hudson's boys so our same in all the prince of persia they would clean up could you imagine that roy tom perez he went over the moon just weirdly lives thinking the persian pops ah sorry unless they are ryan are you familiar with the
the princes of persia the persian body builders and muscle man
i'm not i'm not a little bit of report
it's the most exciting new progressive group on the ground right now
i'm going to get to google and are
the other reason i picked her to highlight lead i picture the highlight his citizens united endorsed her as well and it turns out that she was on the board of the medical device company pack where she worked for eight years and it was actually the director of the corporate pack in two thousand and twelve
love and from that perch cent tons of money to republicans in the house and senate in an effort to repeal the medical device tax which is one of the underpinnings of the revenue side of of obama care and so as a little unusual that the campaign finance reform group would pick her but all
as a detachable see
that is bother you that this was what she was doing in shortly before she was running as a democrat
how can you suggest that she's part of the establishment she's a lesbian
raising a family
flawless i didn't say that i even say she was part of the establishment actually all i said was
she was directing a corporate pack that was funneling tens of thousands of dollars to republicans in the hole in the house and ryan hold on one of the one of the one of the sort of things that comes up early on that you mentioned already is emily's list which is a big group that's like the big pro choice grew up and i remember back during the campaign there is a bit
big route when bernie sanders describe planned parenthood is the establishment like why did planned parenthood indoors hillary clinton i think he said something to the effect of well they're the democratic establishment and people got very angry at that but they are quite the mean like objectively groups like emily's list and planned parenthood are the democratic establishment really
large part right right the difference but the difference of course between plan parent grandparent actually does things yeah
no they actually like i have a grassroots operation that actually helps people
emily's list absolutely is a part of the establishment now
like i said they they make they endorsed christine arm and over just can't even though both of them are pro choice they have not endorsed kara east man who is pro choice woman running against an anti choice man brad ashford in nebraska
they have not endorsed murray newman was a pro choice woman running against an anti choice man in illinois he's a sitting congressmen so that may be why are shying away from that they have not endorse ruby lopez is running for governor against an anti choice man in texas
so they've jumped into a bunch of competitive primaries between women while staying out of that primaries between a woman and a man went when the man is even anti choice that's you i mean
angie craig
i mean she may have been on the super pac of a medical device company but c'mon if you are an executive at a company that sells medical devices
reforming health care to the benefit of the american patient is at the top of your priorities i mean let's be honest there you works it's you have a hands on experience in that's a plus people like their medical device as i like i have this rape and that's basically a medical device
stay alive i love my lifting belt
better erdman though jeff erdman like you describe this guy you mentioned his bio before like if you were like a hot shot campaign manager for like the democrats would you be dying to get your hands on this guy is a big bear of a man yeah the yes and
there there are a lot of these people that i like this are sort of like a consultants dream if you're looking for the kind of person that can can resonate they just don't have a whole lot of money another another one that i wrote about who has doesn't have any money this woman can mallard who met with emily's list and was about to get their endorsement what their families
landed the trip was going to go a different direction and so emily's list at to go to a different direction but she became a teacher because her father who is a coal miner she discovered was illiterate and so as a child she taught him how to read and that gave her a love of teaching and so she became a t
teacher she learned her politics standing on a picket line with her grandfather who was a coal miner and like
born and raised in this southern virginia
district and you know she can't get the day trip to return phone calls you were talking about money there
how much money is dee trip looking for because in my mind raising one hundred two hundred thousand from a large number of small donors in an off year is impressive and that would have been something that would turn heads say ten years ago right so the other thing that they look for is and the teacher will say our cooperation as a two way street
so they want and i think that this played a role in the just king situation
they one regular conference calls they want access they've put this down and memos they want they want access to your budget
you to commit to spending seventy five percent of your budget on television ads
and they'll give you a list of consultants who will places television ads for you to they have they have a style of campaign that they want you to run
and they call that you know two way communication and so it so it's not just money it's also what you're going to do with the money and my sense and i didn't get this on the king campaign but this is this is the sense that i god is that they were like know like work we're running a field campaign like we have whatever thousands
volunteers signed up we've got small donors were gonna like we're gonna we're not gonna go heavy on the consultants and and television ads we think that there's another way to win this and so that means that the money embracing on her down dollars isn't quite enough is not just money that's what you're going to do with it but in general if you raise one hand if you raise one hundred thousand
dollars and you tell a teachable see us will hire those consultants and will run this kind of campaign that definitely has you in their in their sights that's amazing that that's their doctrine because television advertising has one of the lowest rates of return of any other kind of campaign expenditure by field is a great example i mean it's not
also they will to be fair i'll say just tv or this is seventy five percent of paid messaging so but but that's almost all television ads is for was and why would they likely the others commissions for firms when you buy a long as they cause more there's more money kicking around the same as she world whirlpool it's the say it's the same
pyramid scheme aimed oh shit
t v is fine i mean rick and morty is on tv
you can hang out with all your friends like malcolm in the middle they should advertise on rick and morty oh yeah i can't
that audiences very engaged they know any aegis like oh you have to have a high i q to understand these policies that will be i'm a smart candidate wearing any that
that will resonate with the trailer park crowd
there are intelligent is where you do run ads during trailer park boys
yeah that's the problem there was an hour
okay you you run ads during spike tv while now paramount network flagship
boehner scientist a during the x f l one that comes back oh yeah i'll be a good one
in addition to these these two way street that the d trip talks about in addition to they want you to hire you know consultants and they want you to hire their consultants and they want you to spend this money on t v
also this year they're very keen to avoid certain pitfalls of the twenty six sixteen democratic primary and you reference a memo there was obtained by the young turks which ask their candidates think a series of pledges which amount to you and i will not bad mouth the leadership of the democratic pa
artie or its political per hour
the funny one was i will not do anything that will cost the party
the election general election
well what speaking of two way street
maybe the the democratic party should not be pushing candidates who are going to then lose the general election like it if if this is something that everybody going going to agree to but it says we will focus on our shared values as democrats opposing republicans in other words don't like don't say that your opponent
his sell out or is not as good on healthcare or is not as good a wall street streeter know that you have a better position than them just focus on the fact that you both disagree with republicans on everything how do you run that campaign then don't
yeah lose their
and the system the only way for these these lefty candidates to win is to create this is to create a distinction and to let voters know like there's a choice here on the more progressive one i have the backing of know just democrats are revolution move on whatever whatever elements of that constellation show that okay i'm a proxy for
the left here because the democratic voters would vote for that person and the triple see knows that fits a straight up and down here is what this person actually believes here's what this person actually believes the democratic voting base is going to go to the left every single time and that's what scares them because bait
think that that
that that candidates not going to win the general election i mean that's the that's the best life to put that argument in can talk of a little that rahm emanuel is a figure that comes up in this he was in charge of the teacher policy for a while
what was the role the he played in being a lot like in setting up a lot of the template we're now seeing this i don't know this pattern emerges throughout this article and all of these races and candidates that you guys profile
you start of a roms all a nurse yeah he kind of institutionalized what had been a trend at the detroit will see already which is that
the ideal candidate is somebody who served in the military
owns a business and as wealthy and has a lot of wealthy friends and so can can sell fund self funded campaign
and his centrists to conservative so can appeal to lose
the white working class or whoever they think that they're going to peel off there's this was two thousand and six their strategy worked for them in two thousand and six
partners or who worked on that election for the f l c o i thought well he's he said something like rahm emanuel
had the
the wrong strategy at the right time
said it a little bit better than that but there was a wave and when you have a wave
you're you're going to when you're going to get washed in and so who whoever he had put up was probably going to win and we know because at least three
candidates who rom thought were the best ones to win in the general election actually lost in o six to grass roots candidates
and rom wrote them all off and said okay when now we're gonna lose those now we're going to lose that district and into the cases they won in one of them they they they almost one
and so it it shows that there's really not an omniscient
mr emanuel but you also started like this idea of wave elections are also sort of fools gold if you're going on this strategy because a lot of these candidates they got in and then they lost almost immediately in the next cycle and so i actually think and potter made this point and i agree with that
that people should be thinking differently about forming governing majority is your you're not be when when you have inequality that's this high when you have you know dissatisfaction this intense among the public you're going to have waves all the time people are just going to be pissed that whoever is in power so your objectives should not be to create some
type of permanent majority but create a progressive majority that when it gets in immediately puts in place
some some big popular policies and then you're probably going to your wiped out by if they're popular there you republicans are not going to be able to wipe them out and i think that's exactly what paul ryan and mitch mcconnell decided they're like work we're about lose the house
giving them tax cuts
and thinking that okay we'll lose but democrats aren't going to be able to come in and reverse those tax cuts at least let's say they did six trillion and tax cuts let's say the democrats can chip away at two trillion of it you know they still walked away
with with four trillion dollars as a pretty good haul for two years yet and i may also the ability to point to something in the past i mean everyone always points to obama is
like high personal approval ratings and the fact is guess people liked him a lot especially when they saw him next to trump but that doesn't really mean anything
as far as wave elections as far as midterm elections because people
are not going to vote on the cultural signifies and cultural identity of the democratic party that sort of stopped being able to accomplish big things that people remember it after two thousand and nine and instead
a sense of norms and yeah that can be appealing in what this year will be wave year but when they get in there and if they continue to not really paul anything big like say maybe they do and earned income tax credit ear they ever some voucher for healthcare they're nothing that
mass electorate can point do they are going to get wiped out again and they won't have anything that the republicans will have trouble taking a hatchet to i mean we've seen all the incremental changes that were made her in the obama years have just been completely wiped out in the first in under a year of the but
residents say and it's even possible they could come in and do what city come in the the do medicare for all they do republic college they could still get wiped out
like that's like that's totally possible
blood those games that were made are going to be very hard to do you want to be the the republican that reverses preschool or takes away health care from somebody
this year showed even a bill as unpopular as obama care has been extremely difficult for them to even chip away at your they were able to walk out some of the least popular parts of it the taxes in the mandate
but the but the gains are are staying and so to even if you lose so it's thinking about like let's think about politics as a means toward making people's lives better
rather than as a means toward permanent majorities in the house and say yeah i i mean i got i got into sort of it
good argument with a for obama person about this about obama care versus damage as and they said well don't you don't you think that a republican would just completely dismantled a single payer system but what i said was look at the n h s you had margaret thatcher who is more of a steely eyed
ideologues and donald trump ever could be and actually had this paul ryan as investment in austerity as a belief and she couldn't even get rid of it and yeah it's taken huge hits from
from tories and from new labour but it's still it's still so beloved there is still such a tangible thing that now corbin is able to sort of run i'm poor
putting money back into the n h s and i don't really see any comparable electoral oil you can do obama care you mention no one wants to be the republican that comes in and takes away people's free healthcare and education and that may be true but sometimes politics just is about doing what's right now
what's right
there is something you pointed out in the article that i had never known before and it was about the house financial committee and that the leadership stacks that committee with vulnerable freshman from swing districts because that's where the money is and that ends up preventing any kind of large
changes to the banking industry that would be unfavorable to those donors yeah and in two thousand and nine pelosi even expanded the size of it
i think there were seventy two members of the financial services committee in two thousand and nine i mean that that's not a committee any more
that's bigger than are some legislatures and you're exactly right the reason is
you call every banker in new york and say hey i'm congress from so and so i am a member of the financial services committee know here my account details
and and so they just rack up the contributions and because they're from swing states and because they've been the product of the triple see let's get business friendly centrists in their those are conservative members and so they're the ones that are
you're voting down progressive legislation that the best example i i i've seen players live was when there was an attempt to make auto dealers part of the consumer financial protection bureau in my god like can you think of a business that is more need of consumer protections and the auto dealers
democrats are all in favor of this as the vote is going on the the freshman and sophomore sit down on what they call the bottom two rows and so it gets down to the bottom two rows and they start the freshman freshman and sophomore start voting no on this and so it becomes clear that this thing's going
down and auto to not can be part of this so now all of these democrats who had voted for it
say a way how am i recorded on their vote a your your record as a yes i meant to vote no to all change their votes to know because of the things not going to pass you might as well vote with the industry
so you can go hit them up and so it shows that like a single member is not just a static guy sitting in the legislature they have a dynamic effect on how how these votes go and so if you just looked at the vote it was it was a landslide but it actually would have been quite close and if it weren't for these conservatives
stuffed on this panel
so that they could raise money for the banks
the past and now you see all these shady lending products
popping out of these car dealerships it's staggering to me how short sighted that strategy is that if if our emphasis is just to have so much money that we're going to outspend our opponents in the next election what we'll do that at the expense of passing legislation that would either be popular or would actually
create some institutional cushion such as
car jack or expanding voting rights or statehood for porto rico or something like that that would actually maintain our majority if your plan a money game with republicans that's that's a long term loser
limit i mean there's there's there's a limit to how much impact spending is going to have i mean hillary outspent donald trump two to one it didn't matter
no that's right and
if if you see victories by people like just king
in these in these primaries
then you're going to see a significant portion of of the establishment in the party saying oh wait actually this there's money their money and this and there is winning in this paradoxically come out of citizens united with with a party that is hugely funded by small dollars know if if all of these days
eight house and states senate candidates that are running around the country build up their grassroots networks and and they rise through the ranks your you could genuinely have a small dollar funded
party or at least like a big enough portion of the party that it becomes the dominant partner in a coalition
against a party that funded by one or two billionaires like that's a possible
outcome yeah but it's the party is still going to be as strong as it's weakest member and if you still are people like joe mansion holding the balance of power and calling the shots you are going to be married to whatever his policy priorities are right right so so you have to keep elevating that weakest member but
yeah that's that's very true i mean there isn't you know there's there's thursday trip which for the most part calls the shots because all of organizations like emily's list will follow their lead but you don't really have anything comparable right now on the left you just have this kind of diffuse power among a lot of these grassroots groups like p trip or
faye join us democrats now
there's no like the right now has the and r a like so that their function now is to basically annoying the real conservative in the race like it's not even about guns
as like this
so if you're a republican and you want to know who to vote for and you want the most conservative guy you vote for the and i endorse candidate and there really isn't anything like that on the left and i think part of that is that it's because the left as a coalition of know a bunch of different interest groups was the right is white people
so that makes it harder but it does seem like that's something that needed yeah i think i think there's an opportunity there are ryan i'm curious this article has gotten a lot of burning i'm curious what if any response responsive you gotten from the d trip or it's surrogate son defenders in the media
have you gotten any push back on this article not a time i think i think they're taking their medicine
i had no they were pretty well prepped for for what was coming and so it makes the prime makes blow a little easier to take
we had a few quibbles here and there but nothing you know to the heart of it i mean let me know what do i have i mean they certainly didn't like it i'll say that but i think it's unnecessary conversation and maybe eventually they'll even recognize that one of the one of the winds that i heard that
today was this idea that like oh you know this is the intercept they hate democrats or whatever they're trying to tell you that the democrats are so incompetent that they lost an election to donald trump but are also so ruthless and efficient that you can't win a primary against them
if you read as not what we said
i forgot about that
really i actually think that i actually think that says
some of these candidates are going to win
and we're going to follow their race is closely
so like i don't hate the democratic party
i don't i don't i feel one way or the other about it
is a fact that they are endorsing in a lot of cases these is establishment candidates
but i don't think that that means they're going to win so i don't i don't i don't actually think they're omnipotent i think they're going to find out that they screwed up some of their own house races i think there was a good chance just king wings for instance i'm ryan you quoted someone who will alluded to brainless twenty six year olds running the
washington
so who is this class of people and have you met any of these these people laying the strategic decisions will the editor of the piece was twenty six and she has that the person quoted actually apologized on twitter to all twenty six year olds
for for that
yeah it's a it's you know it's a kind of folks who have worked on some statehouse campaigns maybe some states senate campaigns local stuff like they probably ran for class president
or ran somebody his campaign for class president which even stranger
but you know they've they've just always been into politics as as for the sport of it
not to say that they don't believe in what the same but like they love the hand to hand combat of of politics and and so they want they want to rise up through the democratic party ranks and so the they win a couple local races
wind up being so no midwest
no political director for a teachable see or southern political director
there you go on and generally you become a consultant
and you take on clients who are these candidates and that's where that's where you make the money because your i mean you have to make the money goes for a year you're unemployed
but then the year that you're making money you're making a lot of money because you're selling the same product
to like ten or twenty different candidates because you're basically telling them all to run the same same campaign and the retainers you can check it out
reports that retainers are pretty sweet and you know if you're making five thousand dollars a month
and you've got ten of those you're doing i guess just do it to wrap things up i mean what you have here i think is like the deep trouble people will say would you like we want democrats to win and their fears always that the general actor eight is more right wing than the democratic primary right
however i really think reading this article it's hard to come away from it at least for me
within the impression that at the leadership of the democratic party would rather lose with moderate than when with candidates that create an expectation that they have to deliver on popular or left leaning policy goals or to put it another way their their power within the institution the democratic party
more important than the overall power of the democratic party yeah if you do with the way that it's been done before and you lose it's not your fault
no it's just a bad year
if you try something new and you lose it's your fault
you should have done it the way we did it last time so i do think there's a lot of version there that plays out there though reminds me of some of the lessons you get from the dilbert books about that stupid boss
yeah
in closing
message to anyone of years
is god they're change the system run for something if you are legally engendered from running for city council or state legislature in in high school run for student body president it doesn't matter of their arrest you use a constitutional right to be and then i was the middle school president

that's right
agree or game is given to you by friends your crew your guys the jets
all get nicknames because all of us sooner guy and very much nicknames
in the way we got our games was either for something that we did or something that we were known for so they called me of the guy was always trying to grab his girlfriend's wrist but didn't call the it's always been neatly big bird because of a necklace that you wore you found a dead bird
he took all the bones out and cleaned them up and he drilled holes through put all the bones any add the school of the earth hang on this necklace and we thought that shit was fun
so then he got the nickname

eyes go go shoot so we been do guys be and cats actually a guys been cats will mark barron officers catalog he does what kind of looks like one of these guys you know if i sort of their they're like older sort of
their mentor like you got a crew of high school and he leads like the doc brown to the high school researchers have today like you they go they go to old man maryland's house and he tells them how was that many gives them jesus you are you and they get sleepy are you think what i'm thinking do says wild prestige tv series mark marion as
as the boss and mentor starring start like the head rockabilly we're going to have to use a big stars were going to have to get a young viewership
it is going to be little pond little is going to be the head rockabilly okay we're going to get around certain things with that and

quit lawyer that at my shop kids yeah they're always going to take your big cashier hall of thirty five cents which you
the biggest amount of money you could make that is a zoo pixie go out the door a turtle window will actually he mention that the only way you can get greece or nicknames is for have your boys given to you what are to so let's give each other greece or nick that yeah great joe felix just because of like some shit
it's funny to me and the crew were to call you create jack okay cool
hey jack double meaning crates
okay so it's i mean you're known for but it's also something that the dumbest pieces of shit in the world would think would sound cool
so you can just call virgil over watch because rockabilly don't know what that is because they're afraid of pc gaming they're afraid of computers generally
computers they just ushered in an era where no one rumbles anymore that's where they don't like them but these guys they go on a computer and there's people calling them an asshole and they get mad about it they're lighting three cigarettes at a time and studying it out on the monitor and fucks i rockville is another thing is they never smoke and entire cigarette they will lighting and taken two puffs and stabbing i gotta say i because of the
cyber bullying really did did destroy rumbling
rumble anymore they just go on the internet until people to kill you know who's like killing you inside you know who's like the day walk or of rockabilly is because he can be very online but he's still iraq it's boy you are most
who's everyone else yeah oh yeah yeah yeah lot of or for
thread what's called a scar specs because he wears glasses he has all but i suspect that
will i think like college boy whoever we all just me the holiday more knowledge that would be your name college college
matt
i actually mats would be the professor so years has to be something different years has to be old man

spider
pig pen because you live in filth i don't live in philly

i'm just got so dirty you had to move that's not why i'm they do in order not at all why i moved it's not at all why i moved i moved because i don't want to climb the ladder to piss any more
like having a balcony
to find a more racist building and i you know okay yes the chain on the toilet broke i didn't want to say so
i would just wanted to move and resolutely think the higher now than and their rockabilly is where you are now oh no i mean there is like there is like a chad colony on my four year is the clutches mean
not all of they live
also i just i'm just leaving my door open up trying to do cool dorm environment
guys come in any i'm watching the three hour ex and see on interview deja academics to have any like old console systems playing so faint wants to come in and play some mario car or mind the nazis only battlefield all the time we're not
it's like what the rockabilly guy said you have to adapt for the modern world i think
embers rockabilly name the too scared to be the she'd be scorpio
okay scorpio as a tribute you can if anger in his love of rockabilly what about amber alert to at all
that's
why would i hundred if you tended to double a week or yeah
oh that's cool
robberies are already things though
this is our radio yeah
hands cans now whereas the headphone i think it's radio because he's told me that his favorite cuba gooding jr
and i knew that three year ago rockabilly is love that movie
if the american flag with somebody with their intellect reflected him
representational politics matter
has anyone ever seen juices wild of course i have said
well that's when we for the early odds with stephen dorff where it's fifties greece's rumbling and i honestly think that these guys probably watch it every day they open palm slapped
every morning when they went to high school and that's how they ended up what i thought it was just the outsiders i remember that's that's an too
that the amazon has passed
also it's written by like a fifteen year old girl but also it's just too old previous generation of rockabilly these young guys these young cats
oh affirmative aid saw deuce juices wild on cable and it broke the brain that's why we have to make the juices wild series so they have a new thing to watch yes but now i mean you do you watch the movie with what you wanted them when i wanted to be in the military was thirteen or fourteen i watched i literally did watch black hawk down
every night for month
get a lifetime ago if someone said to me i would have been out a question did but now it it's just watches over
warm breeze
what a game or i still was like i was i would run like my parents broke like run up really fast doing
to like seven have many miles because it was like on the p t test to be great hey i want to watch black hawk down a big yeah they kind of fucked job but it's like they have nothing to feel bad about because they're katie ratio
and i literally thought
killed so many more killer
so i'm like mission success what kind of
why it's called uses wild said about a card game as their the juices that's the name of the gang know but they're not playing cards and know it's a double entendre it all their wild another classic one the walter whole movie streets of fire were out of oh yeah
that's not up here came willem defoe plays again the final boss research that movie yeah pretty awesome he's a genuinely terrifying person if kids are fat guy with the critic frenetic are
but since the cryptic okay if if could be cut out it was a man of many phases and if he had not been murdered by the state department and obama he would have gone on to a rockabilly greece or phase one hundred percent as of greece circle have a handle cryptic art that it's not a grease or name
that's like a friendly another and is quite literal that's like a representing like that's like a fuckin
yes or at sea or or a flat it's gone by artists that's yeah maybe lately yeah like gotta pick up and ever is a good point because you had it is earned his cryptic it just like here here's an eagle riding a motorcycle red roses and eagle riding a motorcycle just thought what if he did that maybe it's a for any type situation
and he got kicked out of the community for me it's go and like a little it if we're eating out women and decide ran through all these different sub cultures until he found a home at rock abilities and well you know i was like around these people
i was highly exposed to these people in southern indiana know how our yeah i mean i was like watching ginger english movies well everyone was like breaking their carburetor said that the car would be intentionally louder
nothing and i was like i fucking hate these people it was just down and watch down by law
thank you very much a way to feel
subversive well being extremely conservative if they were a little younger i think a lot of them would be out right
though they share like error codes and some fashion sense of believe the fred perry palos well yeah and teddy boys greg is just a nazi now so well in atlanta as a any a lot of skinheads end up like that not the not racist kind they call rockabilly skinhead retirement
i'm not joking it's literally what happens it's like i look stupid with a shady had now i'm a little too fat for the show i think you know these these subcultures as you're describing that
harken back to some mythic past be at the nineteen fifties or people who still dressed like cowboys are pirates or whatever are all reactionary because they want to add enough and i'm going to go on the different direction and i'm going to be cyber punk from know and i'm going to live in an anchor i'm unaware like a plaque see through plastic raincoat
wearable tech and i will spell my name with a one instead of and hi i'm going to go a little bit beyond you
zero cyber punk know invented a new thing it's called jetsons
oh and chances are all about the nine hundred and fifty as this thing
that's better than a reactionary with oh by the l a
it is it is isn't this in the books that you guys like not
retro futurism is here saturday the truth this is the crossover where the flintstones and the jetsons mean i know was an issue at all
that's called such now listen to the fifth element as our look book
as was i think matt dressed as ruby rod is busy
i want to know a guy old than i am i'm going forget fast for the future and going alternative reality i'm going present day sought style but if the british had won the war of independence
have higher order had basically there's going to me with a gander at us rubble an insufferable sort of like fuse british english accent it'll be really awful everyone will hate it yeah
combine that with street were so it's like a snap back to work cork
it's like it's a down in a candle but it says thrasher on uses icon yeah like drew that up and they're like this has to stay fit more like this is too cool people aren't already i like that i like imagining met in this alternate presidents where the british won the war of independence so americans still technically part of britain and the only concession to that
that is you wearing a track or to have but still dressing exactly like you do know exactly as it's just you know cool
what he would have been he would have been like the or way to be a weed back then was like you were sort of a weed for like muslims and turks yeah a bunch of her converted yeah and matt league of you war like a really long flowing t shirt it would be leg sort like a captain
you would be cool



county will carry whoa
we are back back from the rockabilly discussion and most importantly absolutely no time has elapsed
and now
wrap rock block back continuing to record this up for the first time for the first time and distance we took that break you know if we start recording and now the eagles have won the superbowl of the stock market crash fifteen hundred and four kids so things you're looking up the good looking good
we all one hundred percent thought the eagles are going to win and they did and we call that of the most important then again sega matt yelling all throughout the game the eagles are going to win by exactly three days
that's right again
no i was actually very certain until the absolute last second with the patriots were going to live will you add your bets by changing your mind every fifteen seconds in a matter what you say look i was right now i was wrong i'll admit i have
certain that they were going to do the same exact thing with them last year which was tied up with two point conversion touchdown
and then when an overtime grossman could be wrong about this one
literally that's it
the sports ball that doesn't mean any ordinary place because
battle between the nazi team in the regular races team you want the regular racists to win
and on excel raise
i'm going to argue the patriots are a little more walk him
tom brady most sex positive
wow that was
other fan support criminal justice reform talking about unfair of way certain criminal defendants are treated
shudder to philadelphia though because the best part about the he was winning the super bowl was philly you really came through with the videos from less than a address ass and i got a real kick about washing those we saw some cars being overturned we saw just random vandalism
we saw a guy literally eating shit eating horse shit off the ground to a bang and cheering crowd of man proposed marriage to a woman who was drinking from a forty hour
was know i that's weird
as i got the post here is this is this is a new social movement it's occupy broad street
it's good probably best of all was seeing the owning of the ritz carlton collapse and little done about forty people and then people running through the streets with little pieces of the awning the only thing i'm disappointed it is that nobody pulled down the results statue on on was looking and would have been a perfect moment to just fuckin
wrap a quarter of his back and forth said
a statue of a rat frank rizzo and or and replace it with the joe paterno start
when you enter
we'll watch the streets you watch the skies
philadelphia doing great feeling great this morning
i phone hey guys version if we could turn that many people into the streets willing to do violence for a good cause
nice but that's not how we do it in america just for once
have you ever seen the phone go pop riot
seen them live them but tell me about it i was there
so yeah it's it's the day after the superbowl super bowl sunday the big game our national religious holiday basically says something that we all do as a nation we all watched it over here it verges place last name
i think arctic away from the big game was just goddamn america burn it to the ground assault the ashes and of course the game itself is mostly incidentals all this what really matters the real median message is the tv commercials well i mean that's true but i really
i'm struck by the ephemeral nature of commercials now compared to when i was a kid and part of that is just the weird the way that you remember things but i think i figured it out and it is that when you when i was a child the olden days when they were my news boy cap
john uppers though was a chimney sweep the you got like five memes a year
and two or three of them came from super awkward
go as a means you got the beginning of the years like these are the memes sparse about for the rest of the year you're not getting any better
fashion as we like to and we loved it it was like so every time every one of those commercials we were just bated breath because that could be a me name or
quality of fraud that of budweiser and bronx yeah but now i got the mass media i mean every five seconds
we don't need some broke commercials to be the mean repository anymore so it's just it's a base coined a language and decadence it's it's it's fifty brands of toothpaste we don't need
you know these are these were very disappointing commercials i think we allocate i would say i would say that the memes haven't gotten worse commercial names of always it's just that they're more means because the producers the production has been democratized now instead of like your mean being like of these guys say hello
oh to each other in a funny way it's groundbreaking stuff leg
blurry picture of a sponge bob and like thinner get socked all
his eyes
you know cold pockets of course
basically the yeah i think far you've been five years spoiling you in the greatest generation they would get maybe one mimi here kilroy yeah a little awkward stalingrad corpse
learn mad about x box or her
like that guy kissing the girl at times square and v j it was the only mean america had for the entire nineteen for the rosenbergs
classically well i mean that was for the common people rich people have pretty much had a stadium out of me and proportional to everyone else for a while that's a bohemian grove it's if you're making means of each other henry's dank memes
when you finish suck off an hour
blurry
very blurry picture of cocoa shoving a golden a corner
polish aunt in latin
before we get
this year's crop of ads and there were some there's some disease that are worth discussing i am reminded of the guys remember this is from two thousand and ten there is a doritos add were like the kids smacks his mom's boyfriend or something kids off my doritos i remember that yeah i remember that front of the show
dennis prager wrote an article about why that ad was bad and i just like to read from it right now a little bit this is is ed article is the doritos ad was not funny
by far the most popular add shown during the superbowl
was the doritos house rules add tens of millions of american saw it as hilarious that is unfortunate anywhere aware of anyone aware of the manifold social pathologies the depicted did not find much to laugh about and then he describes the the ad and he goes here are the major elements of dysfunction this ad depicts first a child smacking and adults
across the face is not funny
it is in fact one of the last thing society should totally
someone has getting wailed on going to say that
i will deal with the widespread defense of the child's acts in he was only protecting his mother later in real life a child you it's an adult needs to be disciplined if a child good night
if a child did that to me
i will grab his offending our client are forced to make it clear he will never do that again
i don't either
new jersey karate move and back flip off the wall and than actually something really cool cool off if the child that to me i would do a tactical take down and use felix were those he's fantasizing about finding a child as do the tactical take down and then attach one of those balloons are metal ghosts
everything to recover else and recovery system yeah and then he would be whisked away to the child discipline center
so he goes
after i mention this on my radio show some psychotherapist send me emails disagreeing with you
the police came to my
they noted for example that violence breeds violence some cliches are true i find this one meaningless the truth is the opposite immoral violence violence moral violence such as just wars police work and appropriate parental discipline reduces violence
i am well aware that the vast numbers of americans and europeans believe that engaging in any physical discipline of a child is wrong i held this belief for most of my wife until my sidekick
i never hit or spent either of my sons i have changed my mind because of all the find people who have called by show or written to me about how they were spanked and now believe they're better adults because of it look at the i turned out fine other did his favor
it is a given that i do not defend physical or any other form of abuse against a child of all the world's evils child abuse may rank is the greatest he just said reverse child abuse is the greatest
turn abusing it
because on like this and if he goes the doritos kid deserved a physical response from this man
in pressure on the offending or with regard to the argument that this man was not the boy's parents and the terrible fact that there are far too much hitting an abuse of children by step fathers and boyfriends i do not believe that only parents may physically respond to a child hell yeah just vigilantes to drop kicking children and fucking parking lots cobra to
they take his gun and he just goes house to house disciplining children and so he goes out reviews in this guy defense corrective rape really dark place where outright well we actually read already and about and literally he wrote a series of two articles part one into that we've read on this show way back in the day titled what to do when a woman isn't it
the mood of the answer is have sex anyway yeah oh okay yeah so i was right
all the question my raped darn then
always been having a normal one
he brings up with the second part of this commercial and he says
the man acts like the man who the kids slaps them an axe and speaks like a lecture and moron and the woman should not have exuded sexuality for a date in front of her little boy
fluid it's like the reality show
her as sexual fair about centers secreted sought sauces and said he agrees with those a twitter means that really
my man crush monday's my son
sick of these to reduce as urges dripping with raw sexuality
adding that to horny you even watch the game is actually copy islands in every bank
so just just a number that jim from the memory banks
to bring it back out bring been dennis back into the p
choke a lot about people becoming like highly literal in this particular moment but this is a man doing a deep read it they doritos
with no sense of humor whatsoever and like no sense of irony know oh look how silly it says i'm i'm you know the bell hooks of snacks commercials it's completely fucking in seattle little
that's the thing and we're going to get into this more but lake whenever there's an award show or a music video or like ads and liberals are like oh my god this is so important and it's good or cry because of bruno mars is crushed velvet three piece suit it's actually very important about masculinity
my name is should have ever seen and then i see a conservative is like bruno mars is crushed old a three piece suit proceeds three decades of fatherless but this is a cancer in our country and i'm like oh there actually is something lame or you can do with they're both playing in the same pool of shit
i think that's funny is not only that the dennis is critiquing is to reduce commercial so intensely it's that he wanted the doritos commercials to depict the men strong arming this child and disciplining heaven or proper way during a doritos commercial played for laughs in a superbowl
i though i love just my ideal the readers commercial the dad gets into a gun dumb and launches of the kid into orbit and then there's no chips in there anyway
one of the and doritos
it's like those those car commercials words like a little girl who's like i have leukemia but i want to be the was a dead and there's like a minute long like very heartbreaking seen or the like her parents like crown her president on her deathbed and she dies in everyone's crying and it's like oh yeah by the way hug day
let's talk about that
forward to the andrea yates three those commercial for next year
are it will talk about i will get some of the martin luther king one will help the martin luther king that's the one that most people are talking about today this was
there's one either want to talk to us that i thought was even weirder but this is essentially a martin luther king's speech played over just images of like the classic american a bullshit to sell dodge ram pickup trucks and and it was at several points during one of the speech
the officially licensed martin luther king's speech to dodge ram trucks they showed at several points during this commercial troops and my troops coming home
the troops marching information famously an airline
if i wanted to see prius tried one up then by using a stokely carmichael speaking as they you know if they wanted to show real america they should have just showed all like tom and michael's facebook guys that are like i'm doing me
so yeah that was the biggest goddamn america moment it was really horrified martin luther king's words been licensed by his his family had family i've looked into this and apparently it's like a split in the family between one half of them controls the licensing and the other half controls like the museum or of like other archives are like
things but anyway they lessons that to dodge ram
to hawk they're awful pickup truck and again dodge ram drivers big demographic for people who are sympathetic to mark with one thing he said about the content of the character it because it means affirmative action is bad they like that quote the one thing that my little digging it and now this is the second thing that by other the king said that they can remember which was i don't know something about believing in i just go
i don't even remember what the fuck unquote was in the thing
i'm glad i'm glad it happened like i'd definitely a brand acceleration is because like i think people need to know that they don't love you are speaking of brands caring about you i think the next example is even better
i don't which was the worst of the this was even more nauseating than the martin luther king one this is the hood and i add in which they said it was filmed like at the superbowl right and they said that we replace some of the metal detectors with hope detectors and attack detectors picks out people out of the security line
who were hung guy owners are driving hundreds of families it's evil or then removed from the line from security taken through like a concrete tunnel so an interrogation chamber in which like you that someone who is holed into a room before boarding a plane and ask if i
had been doing any journalism in syria as soon as that happened to me it is a very real chance i would have volunteered out of anxiety imagine if you will you work and the quiz on where you traveled what you're doing away he believed in but instead were showing up lifting video from cancer survivors thanking you for
having a hundred
i why can't you can't
that got failing
you know her anxiety inducing it is to be carted off by an authority figure into a windowless room i have no idea what the message of that is it's just incoherent it's like a mark lane or store
that's actually what the onset group and started out as we detect do we have detected
his presence of hope that you for buying a volkswagen
i had out outtake i live they were horrible out
on the pavement fraud
you know they're going to have one where they take people out of the crowd and drag them into a tiled windowless room with a with a drain in the middle of the
poker ever get back on their neck but then when they pulled the trigger a flags come out that says don't litter
at approximately thirty hunter thirty hours the day suspect reach for their pocket and i unloaded my f nine hundred to stinger missile on
please get another cancer patient they were killed in the blow back of the disposable rocket disposable lot and tape weapon that i fired as a follow up shot
i guess by take away is that it's good that it shows that stadium security or airline security is just so pointless it so it's are such cave added security theater yeah weak land where the interests of use it for a cool little marketing campaigns that francs before and after people who were water boarded then told they were beautiful
all in charge of airline security we get the exact same all
okay how about have a the the t mobile add that featured a bunch of babies to eat or a lullaby nursery rhyme jane got us are based on nirvana's all apologies yeah which is largely regarded as kurt cobain suicide yeah it was just like i can just keep going
everything that this is the one thing i'm a very deep acceleration as i want them to exploit every beautiful thing on earth until people finally getting oh they're saying this is all western civilization suicide note
well that's the thing it's because that's our expel shots hated that commercial so that means it's good
woke to like it and he was at a carnival contract despite them it was one of the better
like gotcha commercials where you watch something and it's a nirvana song played his alibi and then a bunch of babies at various races and he watches for thirty seconds and then at the end t mobile
have like no idea and it's completely fucking insane and it was kind of weird and called teach you that there is some narration over it's like you will be able to love who you want to learn yeah make equal pay
kara south this guy and a fuck pepper a mask is like drive a truck into a team emotions luck in a cell tower
oh god i'm not talking about
i said what you call this that i called it as soon as their commercial and it i thought some child is going to call it low t mobile and fifteen minutes later that guy who's the real clown prince of the all right oh and benjamin who was at the fucking night of freedom yellen about murdering pedophiles or something hilarious like that
he did it he said more like loot t mobile and then just just the next sentence was just soy
gone from soy like they have this half cocked pseudo scientific floor it's basically modern day fluoride paranoia about our soil makes you a woman or something because leicester which is true but now it's just a free floating signify are you just say so out and said something
you don't know noble is soy the heck incredibly powerful wealthy individuals who own this multinational corporation or soy their islam do you think there is going to be like another
an equally reactive spike from like the work clubs who just going to by like fifty phones oh yeah absolutely there was then there was there was one add that seemed to be pitch towards the mega people but very subtly just with ah yes i know it when you're talking about and it was the one where it showed the building a factory
oh yeah the first shots of it are they putting up the exterior walls of the area and it's very hard not to a nearby
watching that the thought that they're building of the wall
and then even when you find out they're not building the while what you do find out as this is a company building a factory in america bringing jobs back it's all in the narrative of mega so that's clearly like somebody realize all these fucking to walk ads that are just pissing off like half of the book potential customers let's put it towards them suddenly enough
though that we're not going to fatally alienate the woke but we will baby subtly suggest hey we're a few oregon
oh it was actually it was a spot purchased by baron trump and it was used having the guys act out his minecraft an issue and think just flashed at the end it was something actually they kept doing so nice arrange detached things like america's defenses some some ominous namely oh yeah it's for slip mats anti slip mad
for your car for
but i have almost one hundred percent sure that his a factory makes rubber mats for the floors of cars floor mats floor mats okay but like but that only and slipping high elf for floor
can real of our tactical for man
they picked bell at like if i remember correctly it looked like this is a border town
the he saw was a loser
wall yeah it's clearly meant to evoke the is added someone taking over a water bottle and then
racist easter egg roll the guys building this building why are they all have punisher teacher
you know this companies back on the up and up not because of trumps because the tommy boy
i've got
he sold all those the car carburetors that he finally got the hang of brake pads
but that that the t mobile commercial that's the new type of commercial the two new tabs the commercials are the post modern ones are like oh
it's like oh my god you break the fourth wall is everything
the
here was tied we didn't get on a series of ads starting david harbor right addie from stranger things that it was like is this a beer it is it a sport said what if it's a tight but but the other type of like those that's for like the younger set who are like this is exactly what comedy bang bang
is also really like it takes all of the comedy from now that's really funny like comedy bang tim and eric and his leg
what does the terminally own funny thirty five year old duisburg made this but the other type is it's like a bunch of vignettes which are also made by cocaine addict thirty five year old who got into ads because he wants to tell stories and it's like a phd in philosophy from the new school yeah
he's he is like
you know it will be a multicultural collection of babies or like a father talking to his son going like daddy
why can't mommy be poised about and then it's it has nothing to do with the product they're selling
will be like at the end like flashlight and
be the america you want a busta
that was beautiful inside one was weird though because we thought maybe they would address the tide pod thing but bet well because actual i guess a couple babies have died
i guess they consider that a bad thing
race bad pr for them so they they're trying to get as far away from the type of thing as possible i think they should have gone for at the elephant around that like we're making the tide pods like a turret brown color
the child will not put it in their mouth were make it less look less like candy issued of they should have done that what does the pod do use thrown in the washing yeah i was an improvement on i don't know why my asking
deal is liquid
tired of pouring and laundry did thirds
why shouldn't for a problem nobody was widely used to be solid that's how you'd you'd you'd do the laundry detergent would come on a solid and then it became liquid and that was this huge innovation our back to solids
that's a slow
there's a gas tank is all its surrounding a liquid it's both i i think the gas completes ago that dialectic
i think we're all hit die of inhaler i have
i'm i'm or evangelist i think we should go back to watch boards and close lines of people get comically caught in running from stealing a pie
oh it was through community and key unitarian and oh i mean think of all the good music that you could be yeah
an artistic can you imagine if instead of doing this shitty pod guess we all were overalls and straw hats and one of those plays the wash
one of those plays a bunch of clothes it's like a guitar
i love the moonshine jug
one on youtube editor
you would be one of those guys with a giant drum just back and yeah you'd also be playing a tuba of the same time i let my bad i would like to be the watch or guard because i invented this idea of the washboard guy in those bands he was like the cool guy he was like the vocal he got those who have gotten laid so
we can hammer playing the saw with an old kid
absolutely the vote this is the last episode of the body
i'm not here is maxed out loud for one thing after the were pivoting to country band right
about an hour over the chalk and cheese bad going to be mumford and sons and daughters
mumford failed
i think there's one other add that was maybe pitched at the more explicitly at the trump demographic and that was the the ad for people who are sigh curious
i'm sorry you of course about the church of scientology had a great add that was just like hey ever wondered what we're about all your that's my mother gang gang style
i love have their fetching it like you're probably wondering because you haven't heard anything about us before
new we just started with me here
another thing called science
yeah it also was another one that was sort of assembled stock footage which i thought maybe they would try and do a little bit of they show the meters in the ad the day that's all that there was also i think just a lot of like people walking you an old person doing yeah a woman
picking up a child's just stock footage yeah i think they lost all their like hollywood directors after going clear came out that the kind of like that show the meter thing because that's the new thing is that you lean in to what people say about you like little pump with a harvard graduate thing just put the meters and the ads and yeah put like the which i tied pods entire
she's gonna type of a bitch doubt i think they should have gone when key self preferential hobo
a parody of the office only michael scott is he new
the office john phones
and as the gym yeah
the highlight admirals and ask galactic leader mug
it's like kind of awkward and wacky it's like a they just cut to david miscavige you just like because the does the little look to the camera as he passes and people who are like cleaning a cruise ship with toothbrush
or his wife
there are seventy of the bathroom banging on the door
love out nor them that will be ryan yes
well i've got to see the other disappointed me the most just it was a missed opportunity was the danny de vito mm add oh right now
i mean was pretty good
the funniest it was good it was fun like danny we're always happy to see what i'm saying if your idea that the screen if your make if you have this technology to turn the m and m's into people why wouldn't you use it on the green eminem
could you imagine this day she stacked
our world
i am going on deviant art right
old out as of amsterdam
you can't even imagine how it should be as a burger girls the m a i think you should write a medium more you are really expensive writer and you have thoughts a i can never put into words boys
your fit a blast on the green evidence
or maybe it was good that they didn't have the green it out because what if they turn the green eminem into a woman and it's a human woman as just a let down because there's no without human woman that could possibly be as beautiful as i think it was a little economy and desire
but you're right
she is the and she is incomplete
you're an object you please
damn little am
let's talk about something slightly more brain damaging what do you say yeah yeah
megan mcardle
yeah that i noticed i notice everyone was criticizing me regard old today
say if you don't like megan mcardle one don't you make your own
oh shit be taking part in this negativity
megan mcardle you can
we're going to take the kitchen appliances and spread of more
and you'd and build that power
i am i am looking forward to the expropriation of all of megan mcardle kitchen gauze
so i think so
this gave us today because little bit of kismet meghan came out today just today with one of the worst twitter threads in lawyer
it was real dog unbelievable basically boil down to mega these attempts to say yes i am a rich new york city private school kid failed child but because of that i know what it's like to struggle and scrimp and budget because i spent years after college like with prepared
some point so let me tell the poor people what they're doing wrong then how their fate as their own faults which is the hope but underlying premise of all of her bullshit
he he had some really funny things to say about how
the years she was unemployed she felt like really scared and afraid even though years living at home she was living in her parents palatial apartment in new york city
access to all of their wealth and then she says when people point this out well i didn't feel like i saved in a do oughta do you want to talk about that
girls and i want to talk about left in it
the witless this the absolute just mindless oblivious this of just not processing it when people point because her she starts off by saying i understand i was born on third base but anyway it's like know you're done you're born on third base you can't you do you have your experience is
not relevant here
he describes it she says as long as your class trader it's fine but i would have sounds of class yeah other wonder we would have killed well a long time
i'm exactly from the same background as mcardle accept my dad was in the legitimate business and
otherwise known as being a spectacularly corrupt head of the new york state new york city building contractor yeah there's nothing shady a vote here
legitimate businessman yeah her father's name actually is francis x mcardle and for seminal nation of his
for three can sit like a mayor all administrations in new york from the s on he was managing director of the general contractors association which is so fucking crooked that they tried in the late eighties to have the states organized crime taskforce tried to have a permanent make a new permanent investigate
of agency to look into it and france x mcardle was quoted the new york times saying he was unaware of any pervasive patterns of corruption regarding his group and that he didn't think we needed more people tripping over each other in search of glory facts or whatever
he said while holding a briefcase with a bunch of one hundred dollar bills sticking out of so is she describes her experience of
poverty are working hard in scraping and budgeting she says in my late twenties i managed to strategic retreat from the upper middle class financially i graduated from the rate march
i graduated from business school with six figure educational debt and a job that promptly an argument
you didn't have a snooty i spent two years during your uncle lawyer and a little bit attack work she says during that time i was uninsured i have a bunch of chronic health condition as your pants that pay out of pocket he says i have a bunch of chronic health conditions for which i had to pay cash i was living in my parents spare room that was impossible by i have heard of any kind of serious
okay emission you would not have been able to afford paying for them in cash so as they cost more if you're not insured or evidence of being now and self diagnose out and brain she had a home to live in and could pay all her medical bills yes and by the way megan whatever i also just doubt she paid her own medical goes live as long as it's one hundred
why she says i was living in my parents spare room which was a bit of luck imagine that he had to grind for this
says but i was very broke and very scared of whites
then she says this is even worse she goes eventually i had a fantastic bit of luck i went to a blogger meet up and a woman who worked for the economist website and met her and i said if you ever have a job opening please let me know six months later she did that is not lock not an hour that is the professional managerial class
fucking networking system you went to a networking event probably a lady networking event these things that exist in new york i never been to one but my friend likes my friends like to text me from them because they're terrifying do you want to go to mine
your lady blogger meta also sees us i mean
she is someone who was one of those coke funded propagandists that whole time i think on the coke they are will she was on a fucking conveyor belt at no point in this in this narrated of her can really in poverty did she ever mention what exact time she became a fellow at charles and david coax institute for humane study
i'm not mad about the networking thing because my life stories kind of similar i went to networking event called the beer power i met will who gave me a shot he said hey i think you can do racism with the
while and then i like that i was only paying it forward because i was originally put on by a little guy and in the beer nerd
yeah are lucky enough to be nice to be a nerd and like just passed through a membrane into a world of influence and but you guys all mad at a networking event called iran club
that's pretty nice
i here's just the last two in her in her and and her epic thread talons basement
i'm sure to be the last few things here that meghan says she goes now the fair thing is could i have asked my parents for money yes and these days when i tell stories about being uninsured or some desperate thing i did to stay within my budget the month of rice and beans was the low point my dad will
ask why didn't ask for help and i always tell him the same thing it honestly never occurred to me that i could
so i could have and knew that if i lost my job and everything went sideways they would always take me in i didn't feel like i had that safety net so yes i do know what it is the script no now you know her act no incorrect just because you in your own self regard had created this like amnesia
the self hypnosis that says that you were unaware that at any moment you could fucking pull a parachute and be fine that doesn't erase the fact that that safety that was there yeah that you in a secure position that you could never fuck up that bad he was like something out of every in the position of an actual poor person who's
could literally be ruined by one bad fucking decision because there would be no backup that that never ever was part of her life while she misses that she was uninsured or whatever and she always brings this your parents pay yeah yeah i think she always brings up the fact i know it it's like to be uninsured when people call her that she spends most of her a good port
one of her co space arguing against things like single payer healthcare or a public option at the very least because in her mind it will stifle innovation while he's like look you can go uninsured people are dying from lack of health care and her dad will write a fucking shit
well if we have single payer healthcare than there all be hours even months to get into a blog networking of
even after she got that cushy blogging job she was still struggling because she had to pay eleven one hundred in rent for an apartment that she says was a fantastic steal it took her nine months to find
i like the she also said like somehow i knew that my parents were always be there to take me and like yes as i was living in their how yeah you've lived there and also for most people like moving back in with your parents is like
relatively traumatic step backward they don't have like a fucking like spare room
the fucking upper west side that it's basically like living in a really nice fucking apart and again i have like gets like you live in the basement now i have to stress that i have basically the exact same background as mic make in and was also after i graduated college and leached off my parents for quite a while however i'm not fucking lecturing poor people about how they need to
put away twenty five dollars every month so that and ten thousand years you can have a down payment on a house because nothing in those intervening years will come along to take away alien as well
right because that's the thing is one of those stupid things is oh you know one month it's a bus pass two months
healthcare unless something happens to you later reality happens as that any setback is catastrophic jan what means that kind of that kind of busy oh you're you're you're not you're not the profligate at grass and over again there's nothing
and you know righteous about like you know never having taken money from your parents that's fine it's hard out there who gives a shit and most people benefit in some way they with the parents tim help him yeah yeah like and parents want to help their kids when they can but with a fucking idiot for acting like your
parents didn't help you will know that to stay in the palatial mansion of a joke are made about megan's parents and her dad and particular is that she she never called home to us for money because she knew the phones were bugged where the theft
meghan sub asks me about all this money that we definitely don't have a wink wink
megan took away a bugged lamp like meadows
i think it has been the
didn't your time on your organized crime just worse at this point a month listening to her or she is
all blog she save your dad's life because the hot shower aged on her case was in for a monster you have been like while on a marginal level insurance corporations are vogue and blew his brains out in the room
oh patient person was responding to me and said i think you've downplayed really important differences between you and like a poor person differences between a privilege person going through a rough patch is not the same as a person suffering from generational poverty and her responses how does it change the math not your emotional attitude towards the math math itself as usual
matt like twenty twenty oh she's talking about the math of if you save twenty five dollars about that still twenty five oh yeah but that's because she has the back the backdrop of her parents' money and house that she lives in that means that she can save that money on again i'm anti saving i don't think people should have to save so like
i literally think people are like while you know people are trying to be frugal what a few bad with money you still shouldn't over and not have out that on earth over one hundred years ago jack london in a great short book he wrote called people are the bis people of the abyss where he confronts the devastating poverty of the east end of london and trust
like go and live i'm sort of like gonzo journalism a very early for he dispenses with a lot of these concerns about thrift and the poor in particular and he makes the very good case in that book which i recommend reading that basically every time thrift is council to the poor by the well off essentially what they're saying
his demonstrate to us that you in fact can live on less and then you will yeah every time you're like as you're you're showing oh i can scrimp and save just this tiny little bit more to get by proving that you can get by with less and that you're owed from it's like working really quickly one day then comes your new internet into the
that twenty five dollar thing and that was something about jack london already also talks about an entire chapter about quote the thing that happened and he talks about like there's a lot of people that are just sort of like at the above of just literally sleeping on the street maybe they have like an actual bed to sleep in occasionally but they're always just one thing away from complete destitute
and that's what's completely missing forget things out oh man matic less than that it's not a real math it's megan has the response you right here you still haven't said anything about the math of living on the money that i had given that i did not get alone coach signed or asked for financial help i will absolutely agree and maybe less afraid but it didn't alter my purchasing power as experience mad free
she had free housing she either
ability to pay for health care at any point from or para that's everyone's primary and like budgetary like need his rent and then and then the emergency thing is health care and then what smith
okay let's talk about the rules guys rule the about
the okay it's megan's new rules if you thought that was wasn't inane then there's a treat there's more for you this week begun came out with a great column for bloomberg view saddled after forty five birthdays here are twelve rules for life she's trying to get it
niger than peterson
yeah i noticed that little thing there so it
all the time we spent with maggie and don't you think she's a good person to give you advice on how to with a three and real misery yeah
so here she goes yesterday was january twenty ninth meaning that oprah winfrey and i are a year older sixty four and forty five they're actually twin she's beginning her column by just suddenly mentioning not subtly at all but just referencing the fact that her and oprah share a birthday now both business mavens both
strong black women
self made heroin
she says forty five is somehow a very definite year there is no question that you are middle aged at forty five wouldn't take stock the building years of your life or over and what you are narrow is pretty much what you're going to be terrifying thought age age
oh dear forty five of folk with a vision family build forty five on resting on your loyal laurels of building
so she doesn't like sister here he is your twelve rules for life
she goes i oughta have some rules
these are what she's clean and her forty five years on earth
rule number one
be kind rewind
be kind mean is easy kind is hard okay this is this is sort of setting the tone
really
she's setting up that like yeah it's it's too easy to be cynical and we need to do the hard work of being kind i was like establish before were being really mean to meghan which we have been doing going to continue to do so megan is one of the most cynical hate for walking a whole alive
she has not an ounce of kindness in her doesn't but as as evidenced by that last bit of just utterly witless blink heard
self mythology and which she is somehow struggled in her life she's in anyways hertha everyone else they don't understand the math and therefore they deserve the same day
thoroughly mediocre a person who literally wrote a book about how she's failed so many times that she's now successful and doesn't really make her entire family are as a cellphone yeah by her own ability and a hallway so she goes somewhere in eighth grade many of us acquire the idea that nasty put down
on the superior smile the clever one liner the signs of intelligence and great personal strength
one grade when everyone started reading those garfield can't i went to eighth grade with a young christopher hitchens oscar wilde and that's where i learned that she says but this kind of wit is to borrow from the great john skulls a he's that way they're ready player one guy like him yeah
epic bake is like a red shirt while you're there is one of those guys is famous for the emperor and of blogs and ninety ninety nine where he talks about
he's famous because you broke the story about how apple have a new type of headphone into those and for that or they should just an entire sector of people who should be given their own autonomous region
us when she goes that kind of with is to borrow his phrase playing the game on easy mode
she's going like all just keep only relentlessly make when i culture and as they're doing it easy what's really hard is writing incredibly convoluted bloomberg articles about why any attempts to regulate the economy or have a more humane stop people from hurting the that yeah are in fact wrong
be chain and flick it number rule number two politics is not the most important thing in the world
it's just the when people talk about the most that's because everyone shares the government only you are married to your spouse and kids knowledgeably expound on their habit of gnashing of soft boiled egg and catch up into a disgusting paste
your scissors it out of these and make that alone
her intimate live right in more socially sieges game either good throb
hard boiled egg
beautiful taste has been as she has like a william sonoma feed bag
she she's going keep some perspective about politics it does it matter as much as the real people around you again this always as if not only how many have a well i think this is mega attempting once again attempting to in some way extricate herself law of the ghoulish things that she's helped accomplish in the world like the
iraq war yeah wall street bailout and just the general on going and misery my neck night and in america yeah my net negative effect on the entire world that doesn't mean as much as the fact that i'm a good neighbor yeah exactly and that on base the my husband who and you i slurry
i actually do have some sympathy for those idea for people who don't have any power if someone doesn't have any power at all and they have done backward views who gives a shit her first rule was be nice to people and that her second rule is all these things i talk about it doesn't really yeah
person that rule number three always order one extradition a restaurant an unfamiliar one you might like it which has responded if you don't like it or you loss was a couple of bucks
nine hundred bucks every month so i was you know he he addresses if she goes if you can't afford to order that one extra dish than the restaurant is too expensive for your budget and you should find a cheaper of go out and waste a meal every
when you go to hard hearty use get the box prize and the monster suits you never know there are some weird disordered eating pathologies in that household
rule number for give yourself permission to be bad i'm glad you've created yourself that are worth behavior
that is why for people deserve to live and how well she said it was generally talking about that and she's talking about herself boca
she goes toward messed up out riding to anyone except other and megan mcardle yes you know what you're really good at things you've done many times before mastery is boredom unfortunately we feel we like feeling like masters we hate feeling like idiots so we keep ourselves board in order
protect ourselves from feeling stupid this is a bad a of the car and alliance yeah i know this is just describing her reading whatever she's saying that like when you're playing your favorite verse earth and play a different class than you're used to oh well that's good yeah i agree with the okay number five
go to the party even when you don't want to nine times in ten you'll be bored and go home early
i was enjoying this i didn't really care but now she's she's trying to tell introvert loot
you fucking piece of shit
i feel too much positive energy towards people that's why i have to stay inside and do absolutely
stupid piece of shit you know it's like to be an introvert
but the tenth time you will have a worthy experience or meet an interesting person who just happens to give you a job with the economy
i find it arguably of megan mcardle gets invited that many parties all the third thing is is that either at least a while ago she was part of a very vibrant social scene and dc with all those other blogging nit wit
it's easy to hardy there where it was chronicled in the harmony korean movie kids
is based on a glaze is just the man i know that those guys would hang out and i just i always think it'd be like it would be like one hundred and twenty days of sodom puts the party mark to fuck him by graphs and shit
horrible
pop up all not eating seen and that but it's the egg slurry
okay rule number six and this goes back to her advice to poor people save twenty five percent of your income
no don't tell me how expensive your city is i have spent basically my whole life in new york and washington dc was the vet paying living rent free you can save if you want to what you really mean is there are all these things i want more than financial security and you're right you do you want them more than a financial security right now but when your comparison
shopping brands of generic dog food or begging your parents were alone your wish you save the money so cut out of the things in your life that matter less than financial freedom that will let you take important risks was sleeping easy every night
yeah there is someone who lives on you know sixteen thousand dollars a year sleeps easy every night knowing omega when he decided to be something wrong with buying generic dog food
suffering yeah
yeah i mean you might as well just killed
dogs content eating junk out of the toilet this is a warning to anyone who's seen her dog grade i will conquer
i will blow your fucking bruins
just let your go free in the neighborhood to take dominion over in a fucking joke i'm going to do the feeling i get to read ran as a pit bull
i want to be one of those the one of my five aren't it after their second divorce got like five adopted pit bulls that attack that shelter and that's my favorite type of person that diverse and whose only political issue is the vilification of
any what do you what do you think about the thing about the election
actually the noisiest dog
i only a bad owners their little beautiful angels
number seven don't just pay people complements give them living eulogies
my sentence
our i just killed the club
give them living eulogies
i would certainly like to give megan mcardle a eulogy
so while i'll tell you what tell them an oxymoron tell them exactly how great they are and how many ways embarrass them here is a funny do not break eye contact get two inches from that hair is a funny thing i have learnt by being just a little bit internet famous it doesn't matter how many times you hear the words you're amazing and here a
why it never gets old they do not go out of style you'll be wearing them to your eightieth birthday party along with a dazzling smile
who is telling an early as thing also like what does it like to receive tons of praise and not immediately think this person's blowing smoke up
why does it like to just take a compliment i don't know what that's like gets back to the essential point every one of these rules for life that she's doling out is just how she wants other people to treat her as i never questioned her politics always be nice to her never just the question any the honorable thing she said
or written extra that he had given her extra money then or give her dinner treats and chain or compliments and all the time
a sadist is gas lighting her by telling her oh great she was alberta i want us to all go to one of these awful parties and and go through and demand that you give us will each of us living eulogy megan
rule number eight that thing you kind of want to do some day do it now i mean literally pause reading this column pick up the phone book that skydiving session right now i wrote it to go to florida to take flightless
this one is really really stupid and pointless not going to read the rest of it
number nine
somewhere around that same eighth grade barack when we were all experimented with being mean we get the idea that believing in things makes you a sucker that good art is the stuff that reveals how shoddy and grasping people are they could politics is cynical that realism means accepting how rotten everything is to the core the cynics aren't exactly wrong
i'm still employed so that was just my little material injection there is a lot of shoddy grasping rotten this in the world but cynicism is radically incomplete early modern his critics used to complain about the sanitized unreality of nice books with no bathrooms the great modernists mistake was decide that if books without sewers
we're unrealistic reality must be the sewers
can you follow that when was the last time this person read a book that did not have a horse on the cover
i like their lives sort of coming together to me and it's lake
could just be called like the power of three like a religion that will smith invented after leaving scientology just complete asinine or shit like
positive it is i should have the most radical thing you can do call a suicide hotline and ask the person on the other and how they're doing
with the fathers isn't i think it's actually worse than that especially with this rule number nine which again i think she's attempting to to read con the culture to make it more hospitable to people heard people like her what she's saying here is that art that confronts the miserable conditions of the president or makes a stinging critique about the world we live in is fake and see
cynical and good art that actually smart people enjoy is nice and has a hopeful message know when he shifts and you can believe in things like austrian economics
soccer i think there is something kind of to just horribly boring media people would soon with the navel gazing movies about people who have bad sex in brooklyn and people like that so realistic and it's like no it's not just you just have a bad life by all the other side of that is megan want
it's equivalent tv show about like a blogger going to nice dinner parties and ordering two meals at everyone here
i've got two meals one for the will hurt
now the movie is definitely the nora ephron classic julie and julia the audience for megan mcardle is er rip towards air on thirty rock
that guy's got it
rule number ten don't try to resolve fundamental conflicts with your spouse or of room
the low as three aware of that general egg paced and leave it just let it fester own one day blow your brains all over your delicately pointed kitchen
cynical a wise man once said chaos is a ladder
the only people who win marital arguments about bedrock values are devoid divorce lawyers i mean you wouldn't say i have a free our i bet i could solve the israel palestine conflict and still have time for a spot of tennis mcardle probably has written a column or she attempts to resolve the israel palestine conflict or where she did it yeah it's rooted in prague
pretty road road so why do you try to use the same our to convince your spouse that potato salad should have pickles in it if you want pickles in your potato salad chop up some pickles and put them on the sides you can add it to the dish if you have radically different so that's yeah that's a that's that
not a meaningful fucking conflict okay as and given up on her dad rather than ari
really the best parts of relationships is arguing about stupid shit not getting matched yeah an arbitrary present are the arguments the people out here alarm cards that acts those are fun i want to see like one day of the mcardle household with just her her game or husband playing world of warcraft and grunting at her
whenever she says something which has their eggs
she just she just sucks it up and she just goes on the pit of despair or she takes out the william sonoma catalogue and just orders every kitchen appliance she and the after after she's rebuffed again by the game or husband she goes into the kitchen and plays a series of amazon dash buttons like a giant
our house is filled and it like that
just eighty one
paper
since time
what of ice cube trays and funny shapes
rule number eleven be grateful no matter how awful your life seems at the moment believe me bag and i can play
you have something to be grateful for focus on it with laser like single minded devotion of focus on it with the single laser light devotion of a dog a porter house this is a great great writing right here
or you've been granted two billion seconds on this planet give or take you are a billionaire holy shit
leave
you know he thought no port the
because they have rented two billion dollars this is called the time economy
in trade with one of a make and we trade with want to log i'm so grateful to robert mercer for letting me least these two billion in the second finally rule number twelve always make more dinner rolls than you think you can eat for some reason dinner rolls loom much much larger in our imagination than in our stomachs
that's rule number two twelve always man
their own a while as get dinner rolls after this actually
dinner all with some nice sorry
they are the best thing at the school jake they said a lot of bad things about the megan mcardle but will say one nice thing as well the show that were mature she should be shall overcome
yeah i keep keep keep in mind on her rules about being nice and being grateful for what you have the next column she writes about how
the downside of maternity leave
the unseen costs of free daycare is starvation really that bad
anyway

if there is a power guess the jon lovitz oh wow
yeah he would have a they really have something to get mad about complaining about trans a steak
on one end victoria jackson
rip funny like that whole generation of us and people early nineties
first post eighties renaissance go to go people they're all reactionary psychopath our nighter rob schneider generals rocket would have changed his name charles martel
to discover that was actually slightly earlier
they're all reactionary to talk to a one handler said
always was a it definitely in either smile
miller victoria jackson
i'm glad we don't get to know what chris farley his politics he was a right winger at the time you did he did fund raisers with newt gingrich oh really
that's just like fat guy solidarity
who's actually like whoa beard is out after that
we'll be talking more about the the pod save america guys a little bit later
but just to begin with
well first of all sitting in this week let me introduce their guess it's a star of the same medicare for all campaign dino welcome thank you thanks for them
also from philadelphia
three from philadelphia mean the guy that eat the shit greatest
it's the greatest city in the world goes i don't know if he goes watch sports photo they won the superbowl recently which makes on the world champions of all sports i don't understand why is this oh so good
the superbowl what makes it a rest in peace tree bro
really
so yeah how how how did that shit taste oh solicits i mean it was it was all the better when there were literally three million philadelphians in the streets
you sort of it was there a lot of left us who are like you know it's too bad we couldn't get people to do this sort of thing for a political thing but i felt the opposite i was like this in in seemingly it shows how fragile like the city government and the state is this the city was totally overwhelmed with just insane people and
all we needed to do was win a super bowl like we could we could definitely do that again i don't know i mean i don't honestly i don't think the cops are just going to do the same they're not going to treat people who were like writing or and super bowl the same way they're going to treat like a popular uprising now been a popular as praising would include the people like we're eating shit oh can you imagine
provisional government we are
the the lead in his late don't doc guys and all those cops and in philadelphia the reason they're not going to crack heads there is because they all have on the on one arm they've got the eagles had two and then the the nazi eagle was just one tattoo
now that either wearing out
eagle where he riot or skeeter as yeah man oh man day the regular races in the patriots are the fascists are aces and obviously the correct position is to root for philly
russ folks ever frost supporting risk business model yeah
eagle like he defected to america before hitler committed suicide and as part of operation paper clip your like we have a job for you you're dealing with ads in the parking lot know you're good of the football
old logo we're going to give you cosmetics or
i did that was one of the best
right up
because beautiful
i'm in philadelphia people are amazing i was watching local broadcast the year to ago and the interview this woman the parking lot and they're like so tell us what you're here for and she's like i had my baby girl just and so we're doing jello shots and park and lie for gimme a
the resilience if it is
the funny really joke but it is like that's incredibly resilient like that and it's like stalingrad that's a
for free it into the less serious topics than sports philly philadelphia is now world champions but for some reason the world is continuing this charade of another sporting event that's going on right now where they compete for some reason even know the outcome is already were determined and philadelphia one
just cook as
net she looks you guys watch the olympic opening ceremony the winter olympics ceremony the parade of nations
what were your thoughts my thoughts were was just another piece of evidence that china will destroy us all because the beijing opening ceremony has proved it was a show of force it was a show of social solidarity and power and know people have come close to matching it since then
when they tried to do you will the human grouping thing that they did in beijing but with a fraction of the number of people a fraction of the choreography it was it was a virgin
olympic opening ceremonies to the chat opening ceremonies of beijing china china's opening ceremony other year
incorporated thirteen point eight billion
meanwhile it was just yeah it was like watching a community theater production frankly heard to china but
the walkouts i guess
no one really no one really to me
anything that tongue and guy the guy was pretty wet
valid reason he was very least he was getting you're very attractive but like you would be like a slippery fish there's nothing i could deal with that
well he is presumably not wearing the oil in his day to day life and i you think yeah but you're trying to conceptual allies this thing and it's just like it's very it's very graphs
mostly whenever i watch so opening ceremony as i just watched the micro nations and i just get annoyed micro nation around and i'm like
why are you where you why do you exist and get over your fuck itself
should just be absorbed you should all be absorbed your precious little little boutique it's basically like oh we're like colonial williamsburg but we're going to have a passports fuck you you should just be part of the surrounding gunter i actually disagree i think the big countries have to get over themselves and we should have three hundred dollars
small countries
i think the entire world should be like the break up the austro hungarian empire i don't care figure it out
the future offend is nice and so is the future of nation states
for me it just the results are with is almost always the case is it's somebody with dual citizenship who live somewhere else and it's from there but sell and can't make the olympic team there so they go oh i'm also from monaco or whatever so that they can walk other bermuda shorts in the thing and then get hosed
the he should be was just so you can wave a flag
there's an entire industry and that was leveling passports
it's very big with gymnasts
so that they can compete at the olympic level yeah because they're not good enough that it has learned about this country naval matt was the only person who didn't clap at the end of cool runnings
key air is pathetic
yeah i mean we went through the entire ceremony and
no we saw a lot of those former eastern european states where they love being nazis the pm is a room
they seemed happy to be there and it's obviously late whatever you guys get up to over there whatever whatever keys is about coming together yeah and when it keeps them from for grooming everyone
this winter olympics too and that's like there's are you telling us like al rocha that said it knows bryant gumbel travel a lot of doctor saying correctly that it's reverse affirmative action for white one
if you look at the summer olympics it's all like amazing sports that require supreme coordination and ability it's the judo weightlifting boxing gymnasts i like curling but it is bowling for fat and orestes yeah
yeah all it's all okay what do i don't know what are the winter olympic events it's like playing janko
marilyn think of it they all
everyone but curling requires incredible out hard hardliners hockey
visitors and he's alive
i business guy he children do it all
i like figure skating is an ultra gay homo but it's not a sport no incredible athletic again
it was out as you you lads who a bunch of ass holes to determine whether you did a good enough yes
i believe in creating a competitive
basis for something that is essentially a fancy art form yeah exactly you're trying to report to put the number on something that is on quantifiable so it's not really i just found out the speaking about affirmative exploit rule
only two countries in history from below the equator have won a medal
at the winter olympics
he guess what they are australia yes
yes
the way what to say wait a white settlers colonies are the only ones that have won olympic medals the they will literally settler colonialism a laser for hours
but just broken let's go around what's everyone's favorite winter olympic event
by avalon
store so my under right on rules is that the one with the gun shooting skiing
simulating the winter war basically between finland and run anymore
it's entering just lurking is the white death and having injuries and snake yeah
scandinavian gang
that's so you do
yeah
oh i was going to say it by off along because it crosses shooting and cross country skiing i mean that's nice but i love it
assume by arthur on i'm gonna go to man
where it's just you're literally on a tiny sled and it's just lying down as an another them lying on top
yo gives you get and like
i honestly think that the guy on top stays anchored just by having a big perfect
the socket yeah and roddick spawning at high speed
going like one hundred and ten miles an hour yeah like it's extreme spinning india
yes the best way to have sex
you know what soaking is outside the mormons do or the will like oh man will leave his dick in the one policy for like two hours this is a learning
like tensions sex those and not even that or even moving honestly scotland
what says she can
her her
whatever mormon faith in his can in fact his penis or something there's a lot of weird science behind it it's cool
this but i mean that's obviously my favorite winter
my second favorite mormons a better grade winter i left back oh my god that's all they do all they do is gone skiing vacations and should and make like little interactive photo albums on facebook with a song you can turn off
my favorite i would have to say probably snow boarding or skiing for the same reasons and that all the competitors those boards are just like fucking happy little working dogs
such a vacant there are so happy
they have no internal monologue or anxieties are fears just like when they're walking out you saw them this year in every year they're just looking up at the root of like he wrote all around
they're so dumb and beautiful and happy it's really nice i think it's nice that we have better then for those people yeah it's nice and a chance to shine
i would say figure skating but again not a sport but i like watch it is the premier events of i don't deny that
not a sport it's an art
so i think it said i will actually go with curling because i like any sport you can hold a beer while doing yeah i don't i also like patchy horseshoe this bowling ah great the stopped mid western heroes of curling are always from create an entirely new olympics just for things that are like kind of not really sports like curling shuffle board
curling game he looks like you in fact damon had a baby matt
oh yeah that's what's his name peter peterson has the brothers the mixed the mix curling team the us weeks curling team his brother sister and they look like extra from fargo it's pretty cool i will to say if fears games that allow them to say ice dancing and take the going to go gayer than ice dancing is unbelievable
yeah they do all yeah and
judging of it i don't know somebody was mad about the fact that they're judge but the judging was insane the judge was like well you see they came around the corner there and the one blade was four inches too close to their partners played as they did a triple axel so they're going to get docked points for that which is just like i don't know that's impressive it is impressive i just don't think
it's a sport
see out just best of what's all the countries
everyone play hard and croatia
fuck to the crow it
serbia will rise ahead
i can't wait for probably we're going to be limited to the world deserves four years where every the entire world is greater serbia and different districts have greater serbia competing against each other
serbia serbia middle east serbia antarctica just all the serbia franchises entire world covered in serbia
so yeah that's the that's the sports report for the day
let's move on
some less serious issues of life death and politics in the united states
so do you guys saw about this week goes where are my favorite things the the inauguration of a new a new group movement a new movement yeah new grassroots movement to change the way healthcare exists in america and ensure that all americans have access to quality health care
quality affordable healthcare i'm talking of course about the united states of care lords yes there once we were going to save us from the twin horrors of republican austerity and democratic and austerity no
the republican as thirty and though
the overly political horror of single payer it's to political right people get all riled up and political about and then
you don't want lotta you want a non political solution to healthcare that's what they're going to give us with the help of the fucking richter soil so i bumble bee men and i'm john tune and i'm current united states attorney general jeb so sure they're all part of the united states
i started this because john fade star of pod save america
absolute chump and room of the highest or who you know someone who claims know on his show and in public that he has it been not even being the coolest jon favreau he says he's he's if he supports medicare for all and he wants that but he has also lends his name and platform to this united states of care
her again grassroots activists legitimate which has which says it has no policy yet
it's got is blue sky and it whatever it was so are not criticizing ideas
heather with with andy richter and the pods america as hall and bill frist and a bunch of healthcare insurance executives going to cook at ourselves than one or whatever
three highly specific principles united the united states of care that hit us with a star are one of my headphones
affordable source of care every american should have an affordable regular source of care for themselves and their families left order to lord of all yeah diplomacy as affordable i am yeah like every to for like a portable doesn't radically differ depending on a person's income is this is my grandmother make the
very of your term is affordable than you're already talking means testing because you'd have to you because some people can afford more than others yeah you're already opening a can of shit worms that got us the which has already been gutted and was highly unpopular and helped lead to the destruction of the democratic majority of this thousand
you're right we're currently beginning did they have some focus group with people who lake
it got lost in the lobby of the land and gordon
a few years ago because affordable care yeah it's literally in the name of their signature bill in and just the jury
my friend saying actually diane von furstenberg has really good sales amber when you're trying to give me to blow money on a dress
affordable case in your mouth like tap water you left in your room for three days
a little bubbles it's like up
a lot of something going to be on i grow grass right after my tap water consumption
you think i keep it suddenly started to talk you into coming into a restaurant and animal it's a little far away it's affordable that's that and enticements will know that a focus group was probably like do you guys like affordable healthcare do you like taxes
because if those are your options
you know it's not a tax paying three hundred dollars a month to jared kushner his brother for insurance you can only get covered if you literally have to buy for sticking out of your forehead you can only go to hospitals where your wrapped up with all your home is and your leg is elevated in year and a full body cast with
one i peaking and you said
pay five grab in deductibles yeah yeah it covers pellagra and miners lawn and
like damage shit affordable
technically bankrupt
lord principal number two
protection from financial devastation
all americans should be protected from financial devastation because of illness or injury how does that differ from the for that is the best part is that they're assuming that even you can achieve number one number two is a separate be possible the as if we have affordable care we might still financial devastation so right right
the brain trust the pr people were sitting around there are like okay so what do we stand for and then they say with a really good they're like can we had this out to three
two thousand and three have a rule of threes
as a big internal debate between count jocular and trent lott over whether they should should say it's good or bad if people get wiped out
i also like again the the word devastation it's just like people are getting cranston lag horrible ways and you can say they're not technically devastated there's a lot of wiggle room with that station and so i'll just say i not not destitute and homeless the last one leg you got the other one though they hop around
and i guess minor medical bankruptcy was okay under principle to yeah if you can
final chapter seven right it's fine if you can get yourself out of minor medical bankruptcy but utter devastation it's like as long as two law firm a shitty repo man movie doesn't literally come to take the oregon with a transplant and a new than you're fine no repossess your organs that semtex for that i've already wet
we've we've in this magic trick
you've now seen the pledge
turn here is the prestige age group
third principle political and economic viability
hawk and home policies to achieve these aims must be fiscally responsible and when the political support needed to ensure long that terms with buddy
but a you already have of my boy pussy with politically viable
financially financially as are fiscally responsible my go about it
as a koreans because the other thing that they say over and over again on that page is that the real goal is to take politics out of our take politics out of healthcare to make it not political to put people not politics
very first thing in their mission statement says the mission of united states of care is to ensure that every single america has access to all of our and he goes in new non partisan nonprofit we are building and mobilizing a movement to achieve long lasting solutions that make health care better for everyone
to care will make that happen by working with americans from across the country policy makers physicians and other clinicians caregivers and business and he goes we must change the conversation and create a new narrative that puts health care over politics by redefining the goal in human not political turn politics is is is conceived carried out by of
series of robots that we've built in supporting a positive practical and lasting approach there is also a frequently asked question section that i also checked out i just want to say that anybody who reads that and signs up i can excuse a dollar like andy richter when a rather more on celebrities they got on this thing yeah i'm a new wipes his ass with a live rabbit
all i want to make it through the opponent but anybody who works in politics or claims to know anything about it like favour oh they should be fucking driven into the sea for that kind of malpractice he can say that anything that involves the distribution of scarce resources can be taken away for the political you literally
don't understand what those words mean because they underestimate people they know what it means they're just it's entirely cynical it's one hundred percent that's true i don't like people don't like politics are they like a human's politics bad
like the boilerplate thing of like yeah let's get those washington fat cats out of here yeah it's like it's like the populism you would have on like a children's cartoon it's very service level and lane but i think the most telling thing about is that it's sort of stuck in the mid nineties
like something that would be in the in some sort of like reform party campaign ad you know let's get let's get politics out of all of this stuff politics is is rotten zoo at islands x in these pilots that is such like gender
your intergenerational warfare is reactionary but that is such generous and boomer mindset when you're like oh politics is but hey that means many and kicks means
he's
it's the opposite of congress
progress and that sort of like limp dick
apathy but it's still moralizing it's a loss of faith in an actual like populism and it's honestly display such like a contempt for people like to believe that they're stupid enough to swallow this and you have to like wrap this turn in sugar and then lead and now i was following this and i was falling save stars are reactions
this because a lot of people who are pod save america fans were actually
upset by this and they were like hey like if you want to support an actual medicare for all campaign there are many grassroots groups right now organize around this very issue like why you signing on to what is obviously like an astro turf an astroturf attempt by the health insurance industry to claw back their profits from a potential because there are also very him
now let me just finish would favour said is he saying look it's going to be it until at least twenty twenty until we can have any kind of positive move it like at the very least twenty twenty and to have any kind of positive change in regards to health care enough people to actually support make medicare for all reality so i he says i see
port that but until then i'm going to do everything possible seemed like help people and make everyone's life better and this group is just one way to do that like we're open to all things and all solutions and halo get this i heard something that's in direct competition with a far more popular and far more progress act well i mean he would say like why
i can't work with people who i don't agree with to do something positive but they never actually see what that something positive is
see the list that's one thing i want to just three hundred things one more thing here from the frequently asked question section why do you support principles and says naming policies the guy is oh i love that leading as question
or do you believe in it
stupid policies but he goes their response here is we launched with the focus on principles to keep open the largest range of potential solutions by remaining focused on the outcome vs getting attached to a single policy ideas from the outset we believe we can better find a path forward we will evaluate policy i
vs on their merits and alignment with our principles and their ability to make health care more accessible and affordable to everyone part of our work in evaluating and creating policies will be done in partnership with pen el di this week we published a paper evaluating several recent state level attempts to provide healthcare coverage to more people including single payer by in and
expansion policies this review is the first step and or partnership and we will do additional studies on multiple approaches including examining costs were really just in a fact finding phase right now
however the principal based system is not inherently wrong
right include the principles have to be actual principles and actually dino if you want to talk about it was going to say i i think it's kind of funny because we did the same thing if you go to medicare for all the yeah i like it is actually kind of funny because it sounds like they they they copied and they copied but we have five
oh yeah
five zero five three and then we spent the entire diaz a budget on those last two birds
worth it
but but our principles are actually like they help explain what medicare for all system means and it's important program magically in education wise to do something like this but we actually say we want a single health program that everybody is covered with comprehensive coverage for everybody we want it free at the point of service we want universal coverage and we won
a jobs program to have a just transition but all of those things unfortunately are are very political and they require political models
and as as you can't get a bunch of stakeholders together to hash it out behind closed doors you know look i think that politics is really best when you get a bunch of elite harvard educated folks to talk on on a nice slick website to try to convince people of their of their policies so that's what we're actually going to do we were invited john favour and he's going to now
in our camp and he's going to do a gas next we talking about why medicare for all is better than us of care so we think that a work
the larger issue here is i think we should i mean the the united states a care lords is laughable and any effort that has on its director douglas holds he can and bill frist is not going to produce any even cosmetic only positive result for how any any person who needs health care in this country
now how do you know that bill frist has a huge ideological shift over the years
you don't know if you could he could have rosa image in his display name on a secret twitter right now those cats that he tortured to death as a child came back to him like marley
that oh he had a revelation
the broader point though is i think we should look at the fact that the united states of care exists as a very positive sign in the fact that they are that they're clearly and this is why people are rightly even his fans are angry at favour oh is because this is obviously an attempts to forestall
if medicare for all not even a public option and healthcare this is a transparent attempt by the health insurance industry to forestall a the growing popularity and political reality of something that would call back their profit because the only this is a classic example of what sort of reaction kind of shooting itself in the foot by just
not taking yes for an answer obama care was the only viable free market reform and to healthcare the could plausibly be said to increase access and affordability and stuff and it was hated by half of the population for ideological and mature and reasons and hey
goodbye and then he was destroyed aided by anyone who had to use that plan also hated by people in disillusion anyone who is supposed to help because it was shitty and it left a bunch of people on a shirt and other people forced to get coverage that they couldn't afford but it's the only way the oh so now that it's collapsing now that i mean the mandates gone no one thinks it's viable
we're in a situation and republicans say this and the right like lindsey graham wattles out and says i'm afraid now that the only alternative is single but yes it is and so these guys are basically good just going to try to frankenstein obama arrogant
because all the things they're talking about anything you're going to talk about in terms of it's all just going to be subsidies or if i had no more committed to half measures than they are any politics but so it's going to be rabbits season and duck season forever
to be blue way they'll get in there and they'll be some new hair brained shit that will still help a lot of people because the current system is so fucking bad by default any marginal improvement help a fair amount of people but just not nearly enough people still go bankrupt and that change will always be something and if we're gonna we're going to license to be
software for for arc and ambulances were going to for we're going to force you know going to force you to keep a savings account to pay your kobe's and shit and then it's going to be duck season again the republicans are going to get in there and do the running man
speaking of over though thank you for bringing this up
true though
i am always bring going i showed up
user at liking online who did a deep dive a the main force behind this guy andy slavic who out it slave it yeah that slap slap slap who is like was a point man in in fighting against a repeal and cause some good will on the left save several as oh you have saved health care doctor
yeah
love that websites and he is the got yes he saved though he saved the website
and that he's the guy that sort of love it is pointing out to like this is you know this is a real friend and he's involved and and i'm happy to support anything he and this
guy is also an investor and one of the things he is investing in as a new fund that put money into health care start ups that are built on underserved communities this is sort of like micro lies for healthcare which as we all know led to thousands of and now in a internet farmers jump
wells when they couldn't pay back their micro hi i'm montel williams so i'm andy slab this is from an article or new project at the news that like your mind found
talked to slap it about his investments one of them wasn't a company called circulation health which is a non emergency transportation company to get patients to medical appointments
and slab of pointed out that the common theme these companies as that they provide much needed services behind their technology is quote there is room for cool innovation
what is air be and be doing what are all those companies doing they logistically give people more opportunities these companies that are about improving people's lives is uber a tech company is air be and be a tech company in a manner of speaking yes but they are but it's really about identifying services to make people's lives better say over and every and be for healthcare i know
what i want in a healthcare experience is that it is cool innovative yeah not that you could just go into a hospital and get fucking fixed speak for yourself i want to revolutionize health care in the way that a full cycle changed cycling clauses it's i want to like location of healthcare china direct i want a nightclub called
the music
i want to who i want to cool environment of other young professionals when the doctor comes in with his little one piece headset is like all of you have to stop eating golden brown food that are gonna die but don't mix
the love it says well we can't do anything positive to two thousand and twenty so you have to do something in the meantime well nothing creating this shit is not going to change the dynamics in a white house and in the funding in the congress what it's going to do is maybe provide something for people running in two thousand and twenty two point two and say medicare for all is a good guy
goal but we're not there yet and this is a good alternative that's what this exists to provide yeah i think it's really important to realize that i don't think that united states care i mean they've got hammered since since they came out and rightfully so from the left which i think is excellent but i don't think they really care about about winning any sort of popular support their aim is elite
politicians their aim is to say to to point to democrats and arguably republicans as a website claims and say hey here's a triangulation point we know you can't support medicare for all but you can support our three vague principles and that's a triangulation point for you to say i'm thinking about i'm researching it but i'm really on board with
mr mr what's his name slightest
yes it was a great very thick yeah
i know that you know i think that's a great point that i mean this is aimed at convincing democratic politicians and it's into creating to give them some kind of cover to like say to their base which is increasingly more and more in favor of something like medicare for or even single payer or even about nationalized healthcare
you know like to see only mode and rebuild the healthcare in rural areas where the national national should be the goal of is the absolute best yellow of course but like medicare for all right now is becoming increasingly popular like a realistic thing that could happen would you a lot of good in the short term yes however it's the biggest
little reform and the littlest thing extra for yeah
yes
running up against that die i want to highlight an article that was in vox this week the headline is spike guillen scott and the headline is why donald trump makes democratic voters uneasy about medicare for all and i think this is an interesting piece to highlight because it's interesting to sort of sauce out what's going on
here it's about a poll that was let me just start reading here
rick a fifty four year old school teacher who lives in washington dc area believes in american institutions he voted for hillary clinton he supports obama care and he believes healthcare is a universal right
democrats believe in healthcare barack obama he they quote rick is saying anyone here in this focus your with me like i would help you just like out how my own family because i think that supposed to be representative of what our nation is about and his belief in healthcare as a universal right is indicative of that
a single a single payer healthcare gains currency and democratic circles opinion research or michael perry gathered to focus groups of eight clinton voters last fall to interrogate six seen people sixteen clinton voted for on the cutting edge of the parting yeah and had a lady who said they will never ever happen
to interrogate what ordinary rank and file democrats think about single pair and other proposals to expand the medicare program to americans but surprisingly some of these democrats do not fully buy into a medicare for all plant blame donald trump
rick said he's seen president trumps administration chip away at the affordable care act after seizing power his faith in the government's ability to deliver dependable healthcare has been shaken before this particular administration i had a lot more trust in the government whether i agreed with what they had are not uncomfortable with the system that has run by the government and i would have said
that without equivocating rick told us but right now i'm a little iffy about it he wasn't alone i was going to say the same thing said ken sixty six year old consultant which government the rational american government in the past three decades i felt pretty good about but can wasn't so sure about donald trump's government trumps selection has left
lot of liberals on board they don't have quite the same faith and democratic norms are institutions that they use to the fact that from could be elected at all and dispenser the parts of obama care he disagrees with has shown them the frame seems of our political system you can get a sixty six year old consult on board
yeah were black pill they added really
ah submission
yes who can forget the logical reasonable government that went to war in iraq because fuck him calling paul hold a flashlight under his chin and story you know what though we shouldn't go to dracula lives and beg the i'm glad though were these guys are on board for abolishing the military
is it stayed well here's what you know they also the government also can be transferred that right what did the can't be trusted with healthcare when we stay with any of them are getting a year that like trump and largely hand in hand with the leadership of the democratic party has led quote liberal voters so far to the raid but there now like i no longer have to
trust in a national health care what the the institutions that they do have trusted are the fucking f b i and essay and they love those now more than anything but there are a bit iffy about
any government that could have donald trump was later i don't trust them
a you know what everyone laughed when people can gradually marco rubio on those third place wins and primary
we didn't even know it you're getting the by he is automatically one the democratic primary that's all those motherfuckers now they're all marco rubio yeah know this is such a reactionary talking point because it's just like the obama care what were those depth
that's exactly what this is like if we have medicare for all under trump the government will just like i don't know just have death panels that they would have had under obama but obama was a good guy so he didn't do that he wouldn't have killed your grandma or he would he would have killed up poor white folks we would have to because the deal said nugent
you want to execute man
it's fine it's fine for him to do signature drone strikes in the morning but then he's going to turn and he's going to signal
right on a piece of paper that you can't get an m r i also like i like the idea that this is indicative that anyone and our and the phrase that really jumped out at me was rank and file damage yes but there are now rank and file democrats we do not have a party system where people are members of a party
like there's literally no such thing as a rank it it's like rank and file a localized are incorrect yes yes exactly that's exactly what it is it's consumer choice yeah it's not even a political commitment you might register as a democrat you can unplug anytime you want you can vote for her however like there's no such thing we have no we have such an undemocratic party
system that the phrase rank and file democrats is almost insulting to use it means nothing also only talking taxes sixteen people and weather was a sixty six year old consultant the peace goes on said
to lay out the increase in popularity of something like a single payer bow of the talk about bernie sanders has made this more and more of like a non thing to talk about and then i guess to the end of the peace and and says democratic voters are receptive to an expanded medicare program one available
on the obama care marketplaces they could be receptive to a single pair program but they will still need some more convincing trumps selection has started to unravel their belief that the government could actually run such a system again i don't even think this is true or not but i have what we're seeing here with these efforts at polling and consulting in the console
putting rocket which is what the democratic party really exist those are the real rank and file democrats as he says and this fun it can be used as a consultant is that they are deal as you said they're looking for ways out of this fix because there is nothing that they you her more than a voting that really wants something that really wants them to know
with they want that knows that they want and that are would respond with scarf thing and skepticism about a group that just says our goal is to make health care better and will take any anything available as long as enough people agree to it when things that we're hearing back from like that canvassing campaign for medicare for all is that has
shockingly easy easiest yeah oh it's wildly popular i mean like the polling also is it's one of these pulling tricks where if you say they have it right here in this article they say a single government program and if you if you phrase it like that a lot more people are like mature but when you say medicare for all it's wildly popular because people know and trust medicare
they think that it's a good program that they have somebody they know that's on medicare that they feel like you know some sort of relationship with the actual institution of the state and a relationship with an institution and state that does something good for you rather than ice in the f b i and the police force and so it's just remarkable that that
among democrats we know it's wildly popular except for among those democrats who are like the mysteriously only upper middle class people that were polled here or not have been polled self selected for a focus group except among them which they don't really care about medicare for all because they have pretty good health insurance if you're in the upper middle class and you live in where these people from
dc you're probably a console for some major go and have a decent health package but if you're a worker and you're a regular person or a young person even if you're not a particularly liberal young person you want medicare for all you want free health care at the point of service and the only reason to not advocate for it is because you're in the pocket of big pharma you're in the pocket of the me
major industries
the backs of this favour a line that like hey look nothing's doing until we elect enough people to pass the legislation that we all want and that's not happening till at least twenty twenty this idea that well there's little while i guess we can't do anything until then that he's like what you should be doing remarkably entry and favour really supports medicare for all you should be putting his name
an effort to medicare for all program activists were actual grassroots groups that are organizing around this issue not this transparently fraudulent or she's like not sure that like like workers movements in this country have historically made a lot of games under right wing administration's not lately but
it it fucking happens this idea that we have to wait for the right time to do something like build a campaign especially when you're working in a grass roots situation where you just i mean in in philly and east bay in that people i've talked to you who have canvas even in small places they're just scoop him up
like you just they thought it was going to have to be a much more involved conversation canvassing and people are just like actually it's in really easy you get good door as you get bad during most of people like oh yeah definitely will and sanders name helps a tremendous milk so many people you know i don't i haven't seen the recent polling that as far as i know he's still the most popular politician in the country
three and his name
has so much credibility among folks when you're canvassing for medicare for all that you just mentioned it and they're like oh bernice plan of course i support bernice plan like he seems like he's got the right ideas
but no instead we should i mean i think part of this comes from the fact that the way these people conceive of politics is that it happens behind closed doors with policy wonks yep and until we can get all the policy wonks to run the right numbers we won't agree and they don't even think of the mass of voters as like a potential obstacle or someone to be
one over they think that at all is going to happen in some machine that happens but also as love it's big checkmate to anyone who was yelling at him the other day was do you have a planes in love it or favour
awesome position
one master blaster piece it's like lotto
are fused together a bit
yeah i consider them like me goes
cannibal
lot of excess access so whatever whatever one of the slugs is being all oh pretentious and very condescending to everyone who's so naive not to understand what it takes to get things done this is what's your oh you want this to happen what's your plan for for achieving it electing the critter
number of people who support it and then they pass it that's how it's always been done
you for that little wiggle room than you think are during during the campaign years because once you have enough broad support for things you can lay out a fucking red line and just be like you do not meet the standards and until you meet these standards you will not get the votes you can bully politicians you create i mean that's happened with other issue
choose you create list litmus tests and you can't possibly run to these people in this without gay rights warning that in yeah i don't worship to yeah people were just like know where we're drawing a fucking line in the sand and it push people like hillary clinton
but you fucking what elections
the the liberal the liberal legacy that these guys are so proud of her the twentieth century was passed basically because of two elections nineteen thirty two and nineteen sixty four and what happened was that some guy and the scenes machinations there's some complicated
interest group of balancing the one overwhelming majority is house and senate and past things that's it that's how you do it you crush them you defeat the forces who oppose the thing that you get enough americans to support that's it i mean i think speaking to that same idea seems like they think that
the best solution
is this like if everyone if it both sides are angry that like it must be good and they have this fundamental allergy in this united states of careful look this idea that you can remove political issues in the realm of politics it's also this idea they have like a complete allergy to ever identifying who the enemy is equation there's no more of the actual
malefactors that have made health care in this town
vaccine bad an amorphous concept of politics let's not like i had people come together and have learned how of their had an immunity politics happens and that makes it bad people had good and will know you scientists who have their health care is extremely complicated and yeah
anytime there's a failure it's because it's so complicated and we don't have enough smart people to think about how to make it better yeah that's true it comes down to the thing is is that when you do that thing where you say we'll both sides are mad we're creating a compromise what they're really does is make people disillusioned and makes people check out which is fine for the reactionary party
smaller electorates help them but your shedding people who you need your putting yourself on the back that you guys got a good compromise through like
oh wait a minute we got clobbered of the midterms nobody showed up to support this what the hell's no one gives a shit yeah so either you move or we will replace you will you will not replace the and drop shot several this activity torch
it would be like an elite the door
that is greener
they're doing a shield the wall in front of the aetna headquarters
the they're standing in front of the fearless girls that you there
well another thing about these liberal politics though
the big myth that they want one liberals to believe a liberal voters is that there is something of an even playing field as if the chamber of commerce and the the the industries are not on one side of this deck so when they act like we have to bring both sides together which side is more powerful which side actually has the ability to get shit done
it's not the liberal walks it's going to be the chamber of commerce and whatever they decide is the best way forward and it's like yeah like the these people they exist to prevent anything even remotely like universal healthcare from happening yeah well i cannot see angle of it it's just like absolutely shocking like my pure
anti european chauvinism really leg rears its head with this is like you really think this is an issue we can't haven't figured it out you really think the french are smarter than us
excuse me
oh god universal healthcare by somebody doing occur to you
someone to him a hard at it until they had universe is less some of you
muhammad thermometer for a dick
and have you had like
damage around his head of use like the melody do this love and
was originally like a french socialism earth single payer vs
public pro mix stupid system and they did have a united states of care
pepe le pew fulfill old
the andy richter
the idea of like an obstacle of intellect or ideas it's just like so offensive to me
you talk to people especially after bernie they all know it's it's absurd it's completely absurd check well there's not going to be popular support we won't get the politicians on board like there's more of us than than and people are completely aware that this is a bullshit system and we are dragging behind the
world in turn has of healthier than hearing here's mine like like incredibly like barely developed countries but have lower literacy roots the most yeah although we have a pretty low literacy
let's keep up with
they just said
low concept of people's imaginations they seem to think of the average voter as this year would sometimes and noble savage and other times sort of like a medieval person who only knows about the lanes they till and
you couldn't if you told them about like a drastically better existence that good what's next pal you got a bridge to sell a yeah it's like know that tell people talk about all the time is of no one had to worry about those like maybe people's taxes were a bit higher but like everyone was no one had to think about it in this way that something that like
increasing amounts of just normal people talk about it fits in there but we don't need normal feel it people feel x we need raytheon democrat damn thing is about those guys is that they do run whatever means our democratic party they running and and their existence in it is predicated
on politics being
i guess the metaphor i would use is like retail vs wholesale so like they have a vision of politics where it's well we need to get everybody together to create a policy that only wants really understand that we get we have to pay a bunch of other people to figure out how to sell it to the two words
the fifty percent plus one of the population whereas you have another promote wholesale politics were what if you get a thing that's easy to understand very big it will drastically improve people's lives you don't need those middleman those guys are basically like any itself justification or likes only singletary already sales and their little ones that guy in between the wholesale and you and they're just taking
the fucking the profit meaning like this these phony baloney jobs that allow them to become rock star fucking pod cast kings like the fan of road love it and all those terms they're just they're literally parasites on the political process and it has to stay obscure and it has to stalinists guaranteed is as has a
they incremental otherwise it's too easy part of why they don't have a job yes well and you have to paint the people who are for the simple ideas is insane radicals so this is from an interview and sienna slavic says when needled on the question of single payer in the past you'd support a single payer needled on this question what i believe is that there are a number of ideas
including including new ideas
that's not necessary to get to where we want to get i believe that's going to take a number of years from where we are today so for someone who believes in single payer medicare for all i hope that you can also be for other things that are good for people and those things might even build the ability to get their drivel
man who hails here that madelyn that was nothing now it's just like oatmeal how it is just a little sense solutions
you you gotta give solutions to get
to have solutions yes it's not a solution than yourself
they hadn't cut him off you would have started talking about the respect you literally is the ideas are of
yeah i do acknowledge that he he rightfully acknowledges that there are indeed ideas
any energy without even new ones you gonna lie without a drone strike in nursing homes is this isn't like that to be a very full weight of healthcare this innovative this sort of like word salad it's leg has been fucking up and on the big enough oil
millions in divorce but like you know and he he commented on
twenty six year old girls and stupid
he was like hey trouble
and his leg this is the word salad of and in trouble man
you know sometimes certain solutions have priorities that are on top of ideas but when those priorities face other ideas on the horizon we want to bring ideas that horizon at the moment and when i said you're so tiny it in for occasions that communication
it's all about communication it's about it's about respect respect mutual respect that's a big thing you know separate bathrooms mutual respect
his of ideas and managed to save a marriage the marriage you have to sort of bringing to the brig
to be married their new ways to be married
i hope that if you're for marriage you will also be for other things
alternatively if folks are not interested in years of care lords would suggest that they involved with the essays medicare for all campaign and you know right now we have over seventy vs say locals four of which were just kept canvassing yesterday and a sizable portion of what is a now nearly thirty six thousand strong membership in the organization so if you want
involved go to medicare for all da da se usa dot org and tear got our five principles we've got two more than us of care and none of them overlap
so you also if your essay locals already endorse the campaign you can sign up there if you're not the same number you can also sign up and we can we can bring you in to socialism so please check out the website and i also just want to recognize meghan swab and been phone who are on the organizing sub committee and i've been doing a fantastic job getting out are organizing kits which include every
that you need for your local chapter to get started so if you want in organizing can't please go to the website and soon we will be doing a matching campaign so if your local as does not have the money to afford and organizing kid we will be hopefully raising money for matching kids to send to smaller locals and especially college chapters around the country we had shirts
what's in the kit yes are way more about the kit in the kit everybody loves kids inside the kit you get a medicare for all organizing guard which was written by the campaign committee at five of those you get one hundred and twenty beautiful glossy pamphlets which will help explain to people this extremely complicated idea of free health care at the point of service
five t shirts you get twenty stickers for for canvassing forty pens and a bunch petitions to go out and start collecting signatures because actually the way to change politics is to get people to know about a program get them on your side because turns out most workers are pretty progressive and i actually want medicare for all so it's not too hard to do so please do get involved and yet
none of that is going to end imperialism so don't do it
i wanted to address this this is something that i've seen coming up people are saying i don't know about this matter here for all movement people you're just leaving imperialism there you're going to going to have an imperial hell state with universal healthcare than where are you and i think people need to realize people who are not extremely online people who do not make politics there
lives who do not who do not interact with politics as a way to create a sense of self worth and a sense of purpose enormous that best idea the best definition for enormous is people who don't make their politics into an identity and those people have heard that we should kill them
all those people respond the politics through the lens of self interest and they vote on self interest or they don't vote because they perceive correctly usually that it doesn't matter to their self interest of the vote or not they need to be engaged in turned on and nothing is a better way to start that conversation nothing is a better enter
three point two getting somebody politically engaged and saying we can this this
the healthcare system that is crushing you like it crushes everyone can be different we can make it so that you have the benefit the tangible benefit of living in a place where you can get free at the point of service healthcare and how much that can help you and your family's lives and that starts a conversation and then maybe you wonder what might have in a white haven't we had this before then you can start talking about how we have more people incarcerated in this country than
the rest of the world we have military bases that one hundred and seventy fucking countries then you can tell them the truth about syria
actually start somewhere
the fetus sort of the cynical criticism
healthcare canvassing that it doesn't take these things and new account if you start with those things you're not starting on the basis that normal people really to politics which is self interest but if you start and a thing that people understand that will benefit them it opens up a conversation that maybe not maybe maybe we'll be nazi germany with healthcare
maybe we won't and the only way for were the only way possible for that to happen is if we start these conversations with normal people re energize them make them realize politics can benefit them and then from there build solidarity that is broader and it moves beyond the horizons of what we think is possible
and get someone's car out of the ditch just by given him more gas and buy gas i mean about imperialism
i don't know yeah i am sympathetic to the idea that we don't talk about imperialism nearly enough i mean one of the most brutal effective propaganda campaigns last generation was the post nine eleven propaganda campaign because it was shit like twenty four booze also shit like homeland zero dark thirty that imparted and
serial mindset and just sort of the nor me to npr tote bad crowd but mats completely right you're not just going to you're not going to deprogram them all the norm is just by telling them the thing that they avoid thinking about the most on purpose
is bad they know it's bad that's why they don't think about it but they're beaten down there not engaged so
twenty nineteen we're going to fix all the problems i know it's only eighteen
but more real she a back a little bit we're getting we're getting a jackson around twenty thousand team is all that ducks twenty and healthcare we're going to get healthier tone twenty nineteen imperialism absolutely gone two thousand and twenty somebody twenty twitter weekend shaven out here two thousand and twenty ross is going to make a song me too
i don't know that
he's he's a rapper
to close things outside i saw a lot of about health care day but i want to have some a switch gears slightly and just talk about my other favorite thing other than the united states care or that happened this week folks i'm feeling like jesse
my
nevermind for are now when john mccain in two thousand and eight said we are all georgians this week we are all for ours we are all just lot of a lot of jesse come lately is this yeah
of just come lately
if you've been if you've been a farrar for our fanatic views you seen the silly farrar
in jersey for our piss off everybody you seen him anger you know microbreweries
assume anger mom bloggers just anyone anyone the democrat rank and five hours but he thought to myself boys they're from anyone has given over self tough possibly not even learned this this this week or just keep a bronze hammer app runs and reply to a charlie kirk tweet about turning point you essays
campus conservatism and he said college republicans you know their head tells heads held under water until they
charlie corrupt was like wow this is terrible i can't believe this is funny and then he disappeared again i am not joking
came like the cause of the week for like bullshit campus culture war shit so much that they were talking about it on fox and friends and i think now the perfect denouement to weird twitter is that we are now one thousand percent certain that donald trump was angry at a bronze him between during this week's morning executor
yeah kelly had to read a little with fifteen track darts to stop a pretty sloppy jesse
nobody go off kings is garbage stream no one watches it just he's not even good at those games that while the interesting thing to me is that from what i observed these weren't am kind of disingenuous reactions he's weren't people being cynical thing like look what he said
they thought that he meant it yeah well that's that's jesse's talent is is that you can't really it's never people really do fake outrage to jesse usually can really does push he gets people man because there's nothing you can do to
really do shit him while they tried to it's so funny he has in the past written for dead
i think that's why it all started because he's got the blue check mark in there that we can shame the liberal media for their hypocrisy and he hasn't written beds been for a while but they still contacted a fucking editor at that's very much as could eat at a very because the instinct at both sides the instinct of scumbags from both sides both sides do it in terms of mainstream politics is getting people fired at low eight
meaningful do that by the way you are a class enemy absolutely unless you see like the bus driver shooting up before he drives don't fucking be and now even even then
let him double cop all these drive
yeah children will be fine the hell the hell rhetoric
it's the cycle that cannot be broken of people claiming that the other side is being hypocritical and like the real think kirk was trying to get that is worth a republican had done this there or to the hell the pay and it's like okay you created this hysteria also clearly like this already happened i know now i seem to
think that there was
a very anti politically correct
university professor who said that really wished that his students would i'll get triggered committed suicide and and there was there was no hell to pay he kept his job and cleanly know he did between we did osha the answer lies the professor on a
are on a twitter that identified him as an n y u professor and there was no hell to pay so i mean the the other i read either way i'm still being sued the other already of course doesn't leave it literally like a go to any the comments to any article it i r
or got news or any of the daily or hall or daily wire daily caller and he decides to tried to make a out of this any article just any at all and you will immediately see dozens of jokes
just openly fantasizing about murdering liberals are throwing the amount of helicopters yeah again i'm not bitching about backs i don't give a fuck
another with call and not get it's not politics has guy and it's the hell world of online it is online rhetoric it a communication

and the tending to people exist to fight campus culture war bullshit and get college republicans to play the victim because they're mean fellow student because basically nobody likes them because the lowest form of life imaginable is a college republicans
so this week
a fellow t p usa you know comrade or folk her member of your toilet paper usa
charged to do this thing where to gin up outrage and get a professor of fired or harass forgiving comments on a personal essay she wrote that seem to correct not her writing but her point of view to say that people kneeling for the national anthem and nfl games are in fact cracked and you would have got
and a if you had agreed with my liberal point because this comes on the heel of them making a big push about how there's there is systematic discrimination against conservative ideas in college classes by professors that was the claim and of course that lead people to say is there any evidence for this and this was the attempt
this has proved it was conserve of students are being are being discriminated against because of their ideas i'm not going to say it was an essay it's about two and a half pages doubles pay
christians are like yeah
it's like a new in korea is right down the post screenshots of these professors comments which of course everyone could see was just very basic suggestions on how to write something that sound like the person
the lamb is a t p usa person and before i get into this like i had some brief paying people were like hey maybe don't make fun of the the show she's just a dumb college cambridge is true but she's also a fucking op one thousand your sanity
he leaves you the app fetish i eat the because some of these some of these apple cheat children are fucking the youth boon seasons either movie the white ribbon okay we should have drag those kids learn and i have learnt you mean the op as an operative or op as like chief keeps are both okay cool
both i mean op and both senses of the word okay so this is a i'm just going to read now her essay called standing up for freedom her essay which was wrongly docked points because of wrong think that's why because because those double plus and good wrong think by a car right for you jump into this
this is this is t p usa can stay famous for you remember the famous diaper god it's the kansas it's and cancer that's not to be as a kid stay that's just the most famous brain okay but she took place in the diaper protests the woman who wrote this article was blowing bubbles in the next to the adult they heard that a woman who who put it out
okay okay she really wasn't it wasn't the student she has a t p as a person but she sent it to the kids stately and then she put it out that okay now read from again this is corrected but i'm only going to read as it was originally written the original mass us standing up for freedom
ever since i was young i always stood for the national anthem and so did everyone around me
when entering high school i found myself frustrated at the friday night football games when someone would talk or were a ball cap during the national anthem
i never i never thought i never thought by the time i entered college people would be taking a knee during the national anthem for me and my family it felt like a punch in the gut not just the punch where you can punch right back but one that you aren't expecting and it knocks the wind
this perused so evocative just the regular punch but what of those approaches where this been there are rooted that
you and you go through the ceiling
you're in the other floor and there's a big lump on your head
birds flying i honestly if this lady just talking drew a picture of thomas the tank engine running over call and kept running families dealing she wouldn't have been done they wouldn't have done nineteen eighty for the animal farm do or what
i'm going to be more concise than this bullshit i believe everyone who is a united states citizen should stand for the national anthem out of respect for the men and women who risk their lives daily for the freedoms of the united states that
well this is a very interesting lake uniquely american thing to that i've heard other people saying they like you've turned your national anthem into the dead troops and them like we're just like with like baghdad
you know we like it's a much it's more like the porta rican flag where they just have it because they like it well in every other country
i mean americans favorite thing to do is to get pissed and the thing you can get the most pissed off about is managing people disrespecting soldiers we have
i'm not saying like economically or and ugly but culturally we have the most psychotic only found the politically and it wasn't so we get culturally care lord right right and we have we have this same militaristic culture but it's sort of filtered through this like weird outraged i'll thing i mean every voters
weapon icing for agility and i think one of the worthless
saw that mainstream culture was people just extrapolating things to to mean that they were offensive the soldiers and offensive to be the attic reverse that's definitely like that i think i mean that's definitely the post iraq like biggest phenomena that talk about it
like enforcing confines around people you know
the first link they did with iraq was like what do you think about the war but you have to support the troops which is perfect completely nebulous canada nothing it doesn't mean shit
what it means support the war that fighting and that's a good support the troops is affordable care for conservatives you know it's a meaningless term that they can just blanket over any well you say it's meaningless but let's see this young lady has to say about what it means to her see what on see we're talking points knows guard coming to college i never
pictured a conversation topic being if people should be standing kneeling or sitting
now that's three this sense again
it's easy run that that
coming to college i never pictured a conversation topic being if people should be standing kneeling sitting or any other form of a lot of sharing one of the national average
my
that's the journey toxicity rucker
my first semester i saw your pet out i thought this yeah
i got an end up being this is blink one eighty two small things watching saturday
anyway eight so i will not go stand on the field
so how
my first semester i saw multiple protests over this very subject in the first month of classes i got an email from a classmate that stated join the student power coalition and woke which stands for here world of colored empowerment colored spelled with a k i just like i say that already this
i hope
honest if if that does exist
i
debbie's of can't you find that that's a hair
this is terrible act that it's not as shit others that's like kappa donna that's a fucking ninety's rapper
that type of misspelling purposeful not allowing this felt like such a battle for something that seems like a simple courtesy surely take the scenic route
i stand for the national anthem and the flag is my country oh shit because i was brought up in a home that is rooted in a military background i was raised by my grandfather who is a veteran of the united states army she goes on to list all the people she knows who served in the military know nothing about how there's anything stupid fucking ass
them in the first both the flag and and this is it's just the anthem has become the dead true and them the flag means many things to so many people but to me it is something more the united states mag
is a symbol of freedom commitment on her bravery sacrificial love and dedication the flag though it has been changed many times over the year
still encompasses these bases that they're headed why don't
i've got i've got it
you guys ready for this next sentence don't go for it
when the founding fathers came to america to form a more perfect union
this is for an english class
i can think of one thing wrong with that while they are know but see that's that's from the gettysburg address so it's actually very literary let's call called an illusion
they inspire when the founding fathers came to america to form a more perfect union they inspired generations to come to stand for the causes the believed in they inspired the flight from the man that is obviously still on go on the may
i a cop
black people on in this graded paper the phrase that she puts includes the man is just circled the question is to it
so the flag was designed to showing the strength of the thirteen original colonies in the stripes and the fifty states in the stars
it's no no no the original thirteen colonies fuck it rises
does she have cited saying she already acknowledge that the flag is changed so now she's well
it hurt no she says in the stars showing the unity in progress of them i stand for a flag of freedom hell yeah
i believe that everyone should stand for the national anthem to honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice of their lives i would think this statement alone would be enough to convince people to stand but unfortunately it is not i believe everyone should stand because everyone knows someone who has risked it all three
are so privileged as the have the option yeah we've all known somebody who went up to the girl with reading at the bar
the girl who he just knows she's never had a man really who could satisfy fire yeah i am very i'm to that to dissipate and a break dancing competition risk at all
we are so privileged as to have the option to stand and honor or protest option
i think that out
a year ago
get through this whole sense because men it is a car wreck we are so privileged as to have the option to stand and honor or protest in disrespect unlike other countries
a we have the privilege to show pride in who we are as americans in what we say do or where other countries like north korea have no have no access to a public internet or any way to show their pride for a country of censorship wrong wrong
had a ride with the archive the sand and you should have career you have to stand for the eighth of what we started to say you didn't have to have the hell off for their national and you know like the yeah we started this i was talking about really impressive national display as the solidarity
by the way in the winter olympics the breakout star of this year's winter olympics are the north korean cheering sections who have these really cool like coordinated chance and cheers for their country and their flag
really love that that's a privilege and do that instead of things and dour song about rockets they're out there there is a funny article that was like
the dastardly north korean propaganda they pick cheerleaders based on attractive
jones's cards and our country
they just america reading that i would never do that i think it is wrong to protest the national anthem for the sole fact that people died believing in the flag that we stand for
they believed that the flag exist
koreans died for the fuck north korea
a lot like a way to you i believe it is wrong for people to protest the anthem because because it is disrespecting a symbol of our country's pride america is the best country in the world with the most freedoms to protest and disrespected ever do is absurd ever do it people believed so much in the united states
the flag that they literally gave and risk their lives for and if someone believes anything means more than their freedom they are wrong to their lives to the institution of chattel slavery what we should respect that flag
why that's why you never note
grand ole opry people risk their lives to secure layman's wrong for the german people we have the duty to at minimum stand for an anthem that people literally gave everything for us
oh my i will continue to stand that encourage all to stand for the united states national anthem to honor the one person they know that served or serves i will encourage and remain standing for the anthem of my great nation as it is the right thing to do i will stand for my friends and family who believes in my freedom so highly they were willing
to die for me to have my privileges and freedoms i believe everyone should stay of the united states national anthem because someone believe so highly in this country that they will die for a stranger to be free because life is precious
the bible and us americans that as an equation of going end of cottage that's not really any worse than most freshman fuck him writing because kids suck it right that would actually writing how would you grade this over while i wouldn't because i teach freshmen writing and like basically i give them out
a lot of time to revise and a lot of what i do is say read this out loud
that is how you learn whether you are making you know the language words for the ears and the eyes or whether you're just vomiting up weird sounds good
this is like if i would say this requires revision i just want to read here the teachers comments at the owner this awful live professor clara you make the same point repeatedly and do not take into account why some people are kneeling i am also concerned about the contradiction decent right in but look at my notes
sentence
while that's an incredibly impolite that's marriage and that snow any argument you have has to like that that is like the the most obvious criticism any argument you have has to actually address the thing you're arguing with which she affect us once and that and also it sounds insane
it's horrible is humorous but the thing is that is that the main loop
the chief sort of conservative critique of the academy you like the last couple of generations was will turn universities with these self esteem factories for these kids we don't leave make any requirements of them will we don't want to disabuse them of the false notion that they think well i'm smart enough to be because you have to know that you're not good in order to become better but
and we're just creating this culture of permissiveness and and no intellectual rigor and now people usa is basically created a rubric for a conservative students to go to college and say walk around thinking you're already a genius because you're a conservative and any criticism and a bad grade you get is the result of liberal bias
how the fuck is that going doing good anything other than absolute soft brain idiocy like this woman is never going to get any better her brain
as important as it and it's not and gets a trophy yeah if it is participation trophies and they want him for being pulled literally politically correct
so in conclusion
i'm going out and i'm who are flag
you that i am doing me i am man standing for fly
do you know thanks for joining us we will have all that information about the medicare for all campaign in the show description if you are interested or want to get involved or further involved but just continue to stand for us americans chop pose and the fact that we willing
q die for your rights and privileges to not stand for us so consider that but stand them
from i just think it's wrong for people not to hear the d j smokey song for them to think of all the people that they know or didn't know who didn't make it to the premium feed
couldn't afford it but they did anyway and they died doing that so when you listen to the premium for you you have a right to exercise your for use but you listen to it
five guys well








oh
it's me met an ember and joining us this week is professor richard wolff are you doing
good to be repressed or wolf how did you what was your road to damascus moment
coming to marks you're sol paul moment
well i think it was partly my family and my father and mother were refugees from europe came here united states the run away from world war two
and
when i was born my father was pushing a wheelbarrow in the youngstown ohio sheet and tube steel company he had been a lawyer in europe but when he came here that counted for nothing
he was lucky to get any job and you got a job as a steel worker
and
the rest of his life
was the denial of being able to do what he had wanted to do and i think in one honest way that shaped me to understand that the world can treat you really badly and you have to try to understand that
if if you can think about it when i used to talk with my father and ask him you know what do you think about what's going on
he kind of tutored me and understanding that if the world had been organized differently that wouldn't have been nazis and that wouldn't have been war and that wouldn't have been refugees and there wouldn't have been and
i could see i couldn't put into words of them but i could see that the way he got through the trial most of his life
was by understanding telling a story to explain why it happened was almost a kind of therapy for almost a way of coping did he talk about these and explicitly political sir yes yeah she did and i think he came to politics because he needed to explain this
for example his sister died in auschwitz okay
it's a problem you've got to cope with wild pandas i mean picked up off of street of paris and wish the off and never saw her again he had to come to terms and the way he did that i mean to deal with that horror i mean how do you do that he used his head he told the story he made an explanation
i think i'm a teacher in part because making an explanation
i could see in my father was his way of coping with life so part of my coming to marx was i began to ask the question why is the society work the way it does i did it in high school i began i continued in college i certainly wasn't a marxist like it
the study economics and and call and all i want her as a freshman i took one course and economic i thought this was the dominant
i'd ever heard i couldn't believe the teachers i thought it was a joke and it was waiting for the punchline when it never came it was all these lines and graphs i had been the mathematics student i wasn't intimidated by the lines in the graphs but this was childish what was being said it made no sense at all so i never took another course in college and economics are kept away from it
like it was a disease i didn't want anyone near there i majored in history because i'd i could study and biggest reasonable histories of story that's right the story that's right and history is economic history and political and cultural history you can really want that was exactly what i wanted to study but the more i studied the more i understood
if you don't understand what's going on the economy you're missing a major part of this story and my teachers didn't didn't deal with it they didn't handle it so i'm a little bit also shaped my damascus
by the kid who can't get the cookies out of the jar become very attractive get the so if the teachers are avoiding the economic story they are avoiding the conflict between employers and employees master slaves lord serves if all of that is kind of swept under the rug which it was when i was going to school
then it became even more interesting for me why am i being kept from this why am i not been told about this and i had enough people i could ask who gave me a book to read or an article to read and i began to figure out toward the end to college that we were not being taught what was the most important and interesting stuff and once you're into
a that you find marks or relating to find marks and then once you walk through that door and like that in your mind the missing part of that story falls into place like what was it like what what was missing and what was articulated by coming to marks that i'm excited you're interested in a basic thing was a
a that what goes on in the economy how people make a living
is a crucial part of who they are what they think about how they relate to other people
and within that there is a crucial part which has to do with conflict between the employer and the employee ear
and all of that and i wasn't being told anything i was actually being told that is a wonderful
perfect arrangement in which the interests of the worker in the interests of the employer other same and they are working together and they're all getting a fair cut of what they do together it's a happy happy store is made no sense to me at all
as you're reading history of this array of calm violent conflict here well what are they fighting over this if it's all so wonderfully worked out why did all of this conflict that one of the old stupid they didn't get it usually make no sense to me it really at a certain point i realized i had to do this on
i had to go read this stuff and find it which i did i wasn't the only one i had other students who did it with me but i went to i'm a poster boy for elite education in this country but college i went to where i didn't get what i should have is called harvard
and when i finished my phd at yale and he's like a joke
yeah know i am the product of all of that so i went to the schools at claim to give me the best possible bad adapt and they were terrible in this regard they were frightened
know it was the cold war i went to school in the sixties seventies eighties
to time when americans were scared shiftless about the evil empire of the soviet union that was associated with marxism and the american response really was
to make believe it wasn't there at least in the schools it was so evil that you wouldn't get near it wouldn't talk about it wouldn't teach it so i'm part of a generation
the has no idea what all of that's about it so evil that you never ever get anybody to teach you anything other than how and why to dismiss it on why did say it's silly or it's warm words bad it's really childish more than more than bad politics it's childish
fearful education
afraid to talk to the students you know i used to say to my teachers you know even if you don't like it
the biggest country in the world by population is china and the biggest country in the world by geography is russia those two countries take this stuff seriously that's enough of a reason for you to teach it
people going to have to deal with those folks so why don't we understand how they see the kemal this isn't rocket science is ought to be part of the curriculum they had no answer for me and i could read in their faces they would just scared later i discovered i was right they were scared it was hard to figure out your career
is over if you expressed even in my earlier career you expressed interest in marxism in a critique of capitalism
people looked at you as if you had an s t d
day though devoted important to people who distance so he had the flu or something really bad team will and don't hire you don't give you a job
academic and professional a prophylactic as well to keep it from exactly the keep the whole thing from getting out of hand we don't want one of those the i've always had jobs as an academic have been a professor all my life but that's because of another quality of the united states which is deference to things like harvard and yale
i get a job despite my politics because i got a pedigree and that pedigree in academia counts for a lot so that's the only use a handful i didn't get a very good education but very useful to wave them pedigree whenever i get myself into difficulty it has served me nicely and i i appreciated for that reason but
the education know we've been talking you a little bit about how you sort of came to understand marks and
missing piece of your education that was filled in by marxism and an understanding of the world that was different from what you've been taught but i want to i want to go back now to where it where this all began at least as regards you coming on our show
repressed or off what does the film boss baby tell us about contemporary capitalists ideology
it tells me many thing
the that underneath the pretense that everything is working out really pretty well
there's a pretty good understanding as in that movie
that there's a lot of bitterness a lot of nastiness a lot of struggle a lot of weird kinds of belief that are widely shared for me the best moment in that film comes early when the bad new baby
having arrived explains to the older sibling who is not quite understanding what's going on
he leans across and he says there's just not enough love both of us remember that he actually has a theory
if it's gotta be a fight to the death between the two little ones because there's not enough that's what american working people of is not enough money to give you a decent life so you have to have debts up the was due to send your kid to college you have to do without you have to you after because it's just not enough
it's bullshit in the movie and everyone sees it and it's bullshit in the economics too although people don't see it yet
that's my job is hot and when people see that there's no problem with amount of money and none of that never was it's only a question of how you go about using it in dividing it and making it work if you don't want to give it all too few people and everybody else is in trouble but there's no necessity that's not necessary that's not
built into anything it's a political struggle a new he to fight it and when are you live with resignation and that's been the lot of people for all on on for me the movie was interesting because it it captured the crazy ideology and showed how of shape the lives of those two little ones
because of the fury of the older one being displaced and the fury of the younger one wanting to be the displaced or and needing an ideological story to tell to make it all sound reasonable and necessary when it wasn't
also interesting that the boss may be voiced by alec baldwin and famously give voice to i think one of the greatest expressions of capitalists domination and sadism glengarry glen ross
is referenced and yeah baby what he says what the cookie down cookies
it was a huge hit with have a eight year olds
but is like predicated on like the anxieties around scarcity and competition it is kind of interesting that they like okay will at the end he does not defeat the baby unified with the baby
solidarity with him that big of a throw the the boss baby bureaucracy a few yeah
the thing that sticks with me as how presents capitalism is like generative it's like apples of inextricable you can't get away from it and it exist before you're born there was a very born into yeah there's a factory with with machinery and and bosses in the place where babies are made
and then even the way that it imagines like reproduction like the conflict between the babies and the puppies because in the world boss baby you only have a kid if you want one and then like the factory makes a baby for you so that are literally creating need it like that
saying that they're not satisfy needs for children or anything they're creating though you need to go down to earth to make people want to have the kids so everything is just in this web of of of production for its own sake and the need to create demand for things that aren't necessarily necessary and that sort of the
the the generative structure of over the years you need people to consume and you need if there isn't enough if they don't need enough than you make them want something and provide that for the i would use it to teach an economics of advertising because that's what that is the company to make money has to dump the stuff it's produce
it has to have buyers if the buyers don't want it don't need it don't like it you've got to fix that and the way you fix it if you can is by inundating them with the advertising playing on their psychological problems to get them to part with their money and buy the damn thing you've produced that's why eco
comics it is so crazy when we teach in conventional economics that production happens in response to consumption
the craziness is to assume that consumption is a given this comes out of your soul and it has nothing to do with what with what you see every day on every billboard every
i came here on the subway to get through the subway turnstile i had to read the advertisements on the subways turnstile every minute we all know that we're inundated with people spending fortunes of money to shape our desires but in economics textbook of the class or production is a wonderful arrangement because it meet our needs
as if we need to pretend that the producers are not spending big bucks to shape our needs and every catholic it yet
to go and i like the more in this contrast between the world that exists in economics textbook in an economics classroom and the world that actually exists where we see the movie boss baby and even though we can't quite put our finger on it we identify with the figure of a tyrannical infant
but how does like just generally speaking like how does the broadly understood like when people talk about economics or the economy how does your understanding of that differ from what is overwhelmingly taught in schools and for what like most people when they think of it
the idea of it's in their head econ one on one eternal on one okay there's a number of ways to get at this i guess the biggest one from me was and still is that if you look around this society with more or less reasonable
open mindedness you must see some things for example you know that there are some people that are very rich and some people than a very poor every community has them most americans know exactly what part of the community they don't go in the evening because you don't go there is
in the evening their parents when they were young explain that to them one way or another we know inequality and if here in new york city as i live so overwhelmingly obvious every day that you really have to have cultivated blindness not to see it
give you another example the instability and me we're now living in the tenth year after a crash two thousand and eight kind of everybody knows that the headlines this week are full of stories that we might be about to have a another crash
seventy five years ago we had the greatest crash the system over at the nineteen thirties i mean crashes are part of it
i used to make a joke in my class that would help students understand if your roommate was as stable as in this economic system you would have moved out long ago
what you accept this you kind of think it's necessary it somehow like the rain you don't like it when we few days
water but an economic system isn't nature it something human beings organize so for me i would want economics to talk to me about the great difference between rich and poor adam smith is the founder of this science he wrote a famous book the wealth of nations he was interested why some nations are rich and why
a poor that's me i like that question i would like to be answered and i would like to be answered honestly we have a system that produces enormous inequality it always as what about that one about why why does it happen and then the logical question could you have an economic system that didn't do that
another was let's see let's talk about it because that's not only interesting as a human being but it's also very practical if could be an alternative it didn't do it oh well why don't we go via her why don't we do that these kinds of questions literally would never dealt with in my education the fancy schools i went to
they didn't do that in fact most of the education and economics department where i got my education and economics
really had very little to do with understanding how an economy actually works let alone what an alternative might be they were mostly celebrations we learned to be cheerleaders
that this capitalist system is the greatest thing since sliced bread
and here's the wonderful way it works and then everybody stands up at the end and applauds and those of us to go on to be college teachers are to the post to teach all that junk again
it's so bad this sort of rationalization or cheerleading for the system
that even the business community in america understands it let me explain
economics is one of the very few feels in american universities were almost every university has to economics department up one the one that's called economics is all about celebrating a wonderful the system is but over the years the business community got angry complained
it's very nice with glad that you think capitalism as great or do we but this now useful to a young man or a young woman comes out a year million how wonderful of is with well how it works because you don't teach that so we're going to set up another track another economics department which will be different it won't be there to celebrate our wonderful of his you do a good job
we didn't have another department that teaches people how it actually works that's called a business school
and they're usually kept on opposite sides of the gillingham as such i have a nice long walk they barely talk to each other
it's we have you don't have to history to bomb you you'll have don't up to english department you want to french department of to biology to palm but you all have to economics the but it's so silly that in some universities where they got budget problems they just collapse the do together to avoid the need for double space and double faculty but it's an admission that economics has been
for a long time in this country
a cheerleading section in which you cheat teach cheerleading to future cheerleaders who will go around tell you all of this that's why by the way i mean among the many costs of this arrangement is a generation of people who win this system does work well
don't know what to do look at it now they don't know they can explain what has gone on the stock market the explanations are ad hoc in a weird and you kind of wonder if they understand it so well on tuesday are committed to think about it last tuesday you know what bizarre but that's not really their fault it's not that arm or anything like that has been no edge
education in what's wrong with capitalism one of the flaws of this system what alternatives good because that the cold war made taboo
we're living in the country that is still just beginning to crawl out from under that taboo
i think one of the most effective things about that econ one or one understanding which is really like the best example of a little bit of knowledge can hit dangerous then really talking earlier it gives you just enough information to remains
but it is very successful because it presents these things i think like you said a little bit earlier as natural that like that these are just law like supply of these are laws like gravity or evolution or things like that
our economy is a natural expression of human nature whenever there was and this is going backward that
there was a hiring of a few that even what do you would consider like far less left economists but like laughter economists than the norm at indiana university and as a result the business school started to create it's own classes economics for business majors certainly even if you wanted to
learn about economics you could completely completely circumvent economics department completely yeah the ideology in this country has been very very strong and the naturalization the way you put it is exactly right to teach people
the way the human nature works anything any effort to make it better
goes against human nature when my students raise that which they always do i try to tell them stories i said you know when there was slavery in many parts of the world people were told that it's just natural some people are master type people and other people are sleeve type people he all slaves and less
sort of like children and you wouldn't let the children run the chicken coop and so their children then wait till they grow up the problem with slaves his children always and and that was thought to be human nature and people justified what they were doing on the grounds that we have to take care of these push lanes because they're not
really fully human but it was always natural in the middle ages it was natural to be a serf or a lord in our days it's natural to be an employer and employee or anyone one the other colonies you want people always who don't want change you either are afraid of change or can imagine it make them
cells feel better by saying well this is the end of the process of change because we're finally in tune with nature but you can only believe that if you don't know that every prior system however different from yours also thought it was in tune with nature which once you get it makes it disappear as a rationale
i wonder if he could talk a little bit about fukuyama in the end of history seems like a nice sag there yeah
was one of several comments it most of those erupted after nineteen eighty nine because of you know for most of the twentieth century from nineteen seventeen nineteen eighty nine you had the soviet union which held itself out as the alternative the not capitalist the the new the socialist or whatever
and it was amazing to everybody including the honest ones over there
that it was kind of surprising that they were able to make a revolution and even to sustain it for the seventy years that they kept it going yeah with a largely agrarian country yes very very backward all of the problems they add isolated in the world and all of that
but nonetheless they were there and but you know if you're there you're a fact and it becomes important when they collapsed nineteen eighty nine when they literally imploded
union and eastern europe with them
it was not so surprising if you think about it that people who had always hoped that they would disappear now said with the typical exaggeration not only did the soviet union disappear but all of that is no longer relevant in other words here is proof that capitalism will be here forever because this
great challenge faded or dissolved or went away and fukuyama was one that were many people who wrote in glowing enthusiasm that the history in the sense of a contest station between systems is over
and we are now in the endless realm of capitalism which has persevered
the poor guy writes the book and unless literally less than twenty years later capitalism has collapsed in two thousand and eight which is why books like that aren't written in the last ten years because capitalism doesn't look so secure so clear so wonderful etc etc
the stock is fact i would start with is that oxfam in england you know the institution that does all this research on poverty and then everybody uses the one percent richest people in the world together
oh more than the other ninety nine percent together on me you have to go back to ancient egypt and theory rose to get this level of of of inequality this two thousand billion years in the world that or just two thousand last year two thousand and seventeen their wealth went up
by seven hundred and fifty billion dollars just the stock market and saw that's roughly seven times the amount of money it people say would be needed to get rid of extreme poverty in the world we didn't get rid of extreme poverty because people who are already the two thousand and richest people on earth got even richer what kind of an economic
system
no student that i know of none been presented with this kind of information wouldn't that least admit it's important question to to raise is this the way we want and economy to work is this consistent with our family values or morals or ethics all religions or whatever it is most students will
have some trouble with that question would admit at least we ought to be discussing this this was never discussed in my education just was never the deemed relevant what's what's so amazing as is that one of the foundational what are those like exxon want to want ideas supposed to subvert her refute marxism is
marginal utility road
and if how do you not apply that to people having that much money like what is the marginal utility to these people have like the next one hundred billion dollars like it means nothing to them it could mean literally the difference between life and death for billions of people and even by your own analysis of economic value
you that money is not doing anything for these people that are literally just putting into the pile
there is no connection between well okay if he isn't doing them any good like you basically said that your commitment to models or whatever has totally superseded and he sort of ethics and morality and therefore them keeping it in this pile is worth more just because to change that distribution would be interrupt
doing these you're talking natural flows natural economic market
reality to fit the theory when in reality doesn't fit the theory well you know technically when you teach it you teach marginal utility and then you have you add a at which a text book has written down always you cannot compare the marginal utility a one person to another in other words you and
not allowed to buy the logic of the model to say that taking a dollar from rockefeller and giving it to a poor person on the corner moves it from a low marginal utility what does the rockefeller care for another dollar to a person for whom it means a meal or not today you can't do that you have to
admit that each person has he has her own evaluations and you cannot interfere with that that would be violating the person's in it livable in order to preserve this respect for the individual you'll let the guy star v it's not that you've superseded it
it is the morality that's why when you encounter students who have been in these courses enough time they become little moral monsters because they believe it it has become the lesson that they been like a like a young person goes and gets their lessons at church or their catechism class or whatever it is they
learn in school the fish
sure it's good it's it's the way and economy should work and short step from there to believing that the c e o gets three hundred million dollars a year really is worth it he does such wonderful things he deserves it whereas the guy who picks up the garbage in front of your house me he deserves a team
dollars a week
and then you become your on the road to what eventually becomes a kind of fascism in which you assign people to different gradations in a society and that's bad enough but you rationalize it as if it were necessary because the end result is that you know this is one of those things where your your common sense would tell you that human
created an economy to serve people's interests and the other way around and that
ideological process leads you to the point where we exist to serve the market
therefore morality can't enter and opens the morality as you say is maintaining these markets look it's very painful with my students to be real honest with you my students come to the shit in the office of because i still teach at a new school university here in new york
and they sit in my office and they asked my advice should i take this course or that one should i major over here or should i major they're trying to fit themselves like a round peg in the square all they're trying to figure out how to make it in society for them they don't even ask the question wait a minute
i should be doing what i love what what means something to me and i should have a society that gives me the chance to do that
they've lost all of that they made no demands on this system that trying to fit in trying to make sure they can find a place in this existing system because the idea that this system on his serve them as long ago been lost like said people who can't get the idea that the local politics supposed to serve you
you're not supposed to suck up to them that's not the way this was supposed to work and you encounter those people you feel bad for them
what's what to me though is that there is that sense that people have you know
so easily tie any university setting that this person deserves this and this person deserves acts but when you're like say try and organize a wage campaign or something it's so easy for you to say your boss makes this much and you make this much do you really think that he works harder than you know no one will ever say yes
no one will ever said yes so there's this weird disconnect between those kind of intellectual culture around and how we view work and wage and all of these very fundamental ideas and what we know to be true from being at work
i agree with you but let me to push back a little this way
it's scary
because if you follow the logic of just what you said then you're going to have to say is your next step this is outrageous that he gets twenty million dollars and i have to borrow money put my kids through college
and then you're confronted with a very bad injustice of which you are the victim unless you are than a mouse you want to do something you are now taking a step that makes it harder and harder for you to justify not being active and you are scared for good reason about being a that's an uncanny
double place for people to be and then i think a good number of them retreat into the acceptance not because they really believe that you're right but because where you are taking them if you ask them to see what you pointed out scares them well and rightfully so it was punished
i was at speaking it easily
and in subtle ways their parents when they were very little and didn't leave and understand it
taught them you know stand in line when the teacher says it do what you're told that's how your go along to get a law all of that that we've all learned as children most were very unusual all of that plays a role here to make it harder and harder i think if the universities and colleges
has had a commitment to diversity of of perspective
the way they now at least say they have with diversity of gender and race and all that then we will have had people like me teaching and lots more of them than i am many like me teaching and then we would have at least confronted a generation of students with the alternatives that they could have them thought about made up their own minds but
this country has never in my lifetime have the confidence in its own people to give them real freedom of choice in learning they've they've given them a very restricted diet and we live with the consequence what we find ourselves now adequate particularly for young people people you know i if you're like a millennial
we've we've basically as i've ever been alive we've lived in a society and government in which the classical the girl and i guess now neo liberal view of economics is they have the no auto manufacturers that we've been living in this no alternative world and this end of history world but then if you're young
young one of the formative moments in your young adulthood was the economic crash so it's sort of like the in the nineteenth century marks and they created these ideas and and like an easy history goes than the twentieth century discredited many of them but lo and behold here we are in the twenty first century
and it seems you're making a big comeback in terms of the interest that young people have in an alternate but how do we take like you know what is the next that for taking that the general feeling of disillusionment with
the way our society has organized and particularly the economy and how it is disadvantage in you and winnowing down your hopes of a better future
how to your from there to a coherent political ideology and movement in this country i mean that's a big question but what do you start well i don't want to beat a dead horse but i want to say again because it has to be said
that it's very sad for the generation of the millennium who are smart enough to engage this crash not to pretend it didn't happen are facing the job futures they have or better yet don't have that they will lead to expect they would get been are now being told really isn't there for them it's really sad that they were never presented with what the op
alternatives are now that they badly need to figure out where the goal instead of simply resigning themselves to a kind of bleak situation unfolding
having said that i think we have to learn from history look the twentieth century much of the critique of what was done in the name of socialism and communism is perfectly reasonable lot of mistakes were made a lot of bed directions were taken we have to learn and we shouldn't be ashamed those of us other critical of capitalism about
that i'd like to remind people the transition from feudalism to capitalism didn't happen in some smooth way where everybody figured out of wounded him up feudalism lots so good what to do this or that there were all kinds of experiments some of them less than a few weeks some less than a few months some of them last of a few years before they were undone either by collapsing in on themselves
well being destroyed by the feudal who didn't want this new change capitalism came into the world after lots of fits and starts and trials and errors why do we imagine that there will be any different going from capitalism socialism russia and china cuba places like that our efforts and they went in some ways they discovered good things in some ways they went off the rails
sales in ways we don't wanna we have to learn from that just like our forebears did so what do i mean the big thing in the twentieth century of the alternative was the idea of the government the private capital as system left to itself would produce in the quality and stability and then we would get the government you see to come in and kind of fix it off
the instability ease and counteract in the twentieth century the for metal evasion of that idea john maynard keynes with his economic analysis is how the government can step in this way that way and the next wave make it all kind of work out and the soviet union was the ultimate sort of step of that where the government doesn't just regular
eight and the government takes over and make sure everything goes right what really discover well we discovered some things were achieved in that way that couldn't have been any other i like to remind folks that the fastest economic growth in the twentieth century of any country was the soviet union they went from a very poor as
pointed out earlier very poor back with the poorest country in europe nineteen seventeen they have a revolution they have a civil war they lose world war one few years later they go through a horrible world war two and yet in nineteen seventy five the number two super power after the united states us the credible achievement they were able to go from poor to rich
the best example of
ended rationing before the u k did
the americans don't even know that we had rationing the fastest growing country in the twenty first century is the people's republic of china there's nothing comparable to it so if you want a society to go from poor to rich they did fat
our least they did it better than anybody else has ever done it on the other hand by giving all that power to the government to fix the economy you created the risk that they would take that power and do all kinds of things you don't want which they did and we have to learn those lessons i think to make a long story short that the problem of the first efforts in the twentieth century to go
beyond capitalism were to overdo the role of the government to make a tool and
word in the needs of the mass of people and therefore you got real bad stuff along side whatever you did achieve okay so than the twenty first century now having learned from that i think we need to go on a different direction and understand that we can go from capitalism to socialism in ways that have nothing to do with the government that
why are the government to step in that don't create the opportunity for the government but that make the change at a different level namely at the level that we mostly live our lives in our homes and workplaces so you may know we are advocates for work or co ops for changing the organization of businesses though they stop being
top down hierarchical arrangements or a tiny number of people the major shareholders and the boards of directors a elect make all the decisions what to produce how to produce were to produce what to do with the profits and to change all that and say no let's make the workplace it would go while he was the idea democratic the worked
one person one vote we make the decisions together we got rid of monarchies because we didn't want a political decision for be made by a tiny number of people sitting far away in the palace and we created something else why do we permit a tiny number of people sitting in a fancy office that looks like a palace to make those decision for the workplace if we believe in them
aqua she likes democratize the enterprise for me that's what socialism and the twenty first century is going to be all about isn't it hard to do that without the state though like at some point
the state is what they create the laws the framework in which business is conducted at some point the state has to innovate right
right but again i'm gonna borrow from history we had a estate in feudal europe we had a stay with louis the fourteenth
any of the others
but the change from feudalism to capitalism really didn't happen at the level of the state it happened first in a thousand little businesses when the serfs ran away from the lord and settled in the town and hooked up in a new way with employ years who are also x run away and you had a development from below
oh which eventually confronted the old feudal state by saying you've got to go it's histories over and when they resisted they did things like the french revolution and they were not nice and they separated so many people from their and all the rest of that i'm not advocating that of course but you get the
picture i think yes you will need the state but you'll only get the state to do what is necessary for a new system if that new system as some routes has established itself as some power there is socialism is not going to come through legal is am i think it's the only yeah and that
what we've seen as any positive movement in even a progressive direction is always a case where the government is coming in the rear and ratifying change sad that someone around anyway that's right or worse be used by the powers that be the old system to prevent the new to block the new you know when you when you walk remember
those heroic for me those who young people into cloudy square met so far from here
they had during the occupy and they had those milk cartons the old plastic milk caught and set up around the perimeter of the park and everybody who had books brought the books and they created a free library they put the books in the milk cartons and everybody was on their honor you
calm if you want to get a book you take a book out they can only read it and then you bring it back no clerks no rig them a role of free library it was very poignant because it was just at the time that the mayor bloomberg at that time here in new york was cutting funding for public library so it was a beautiful moment of say
we're in favor of libraries and then the same bloomberg
gets on the television and says i have to shut this whole down and when the reporters say why he says because they're not clean the people here
and the reporters to their credit looked at him and said you are the mayor of the filthy filthy a subway on this planet and you're telling us your shutting down these folks who aren't hurting anybody because they aren't clean you can do better than that three
days later the bulldozers came in and plowed under those milk crate and cartons with the books i mean that's the government coming in and holding on to an old system and being the obstacle and i don't think you overcome that until you have built the institutional basis that people can see what an alternative
look like can can get excited about going in that direction and demanding the government help them rather than seeing a government that is forever under the rubric of law and order and on at basically holding back a society that now needs to be changed
remember he backseat to bloomberg and the occupy wall street is my favorite comment from our former mayor was he said i don't understand why these people are protesting people who work at banks
they're good people that make forty grand a year is tellers
like the people there were like blue waiting in lines hey this checking account
why are the pans on those little change any of was the pad
i mean how stupid do you think he must have thought the rest of the people on this is a billion they're telling us to be happy with forty grand a year
bank to in hand
is something so many about i did you realize how disconnected from the universe
a couple of weeks ago paul ryan the republican got himself into trouble because he was congratulating a lady in pennsylvania who got an a dollar fifty increase in her salary per week because of the tax cut and he was explaining how happy she is she did something how happy she has asked coma she could get hurt
last comment to this is a guy who got five hundred million dollars or something from from the koch brothers for his political future congratulating and say how happy with a lady is what her dollar fifty a week
it's not it's not even horrible just that he thinks that way that's bad enough but he's comfortable saying it publicly it takes your breath away
the level of not understanding the world in which he lives is frightening and he's just all it just shows how little left pressure they're just not afraid but don't feel like there's any repercussions because they feel like they have the field of themselves yet and then he was surprised that the twitter universe
him away by making fun of what he had just said well then he deleted it replaced it with an even more offensive of whiteness that i'm yeah i've always do well apparently it was it was from the day earlier but he didn't believe this one and it was a quote that he highlighted from an article about people responding to their pay raises going up because of less withholding
due to the tax bill
a guy said
over two hundred dollar more a month and my paycheck which will help offset the three hundred dollars that my insurance premiums went up so it's still negative one hundred is this going to offset any said quote they say that the middle class is just getting crumbs but i'll take it
and he gets left that up there as proof of it theory
yeah you will you
every quarter report longer oh
but see it
better yet they pull rank and see these things in public he doesn't really hear about it and for the most part even if for gas by we all kind of accepted and i want to get back to this idea is because of this econ one or one these these ideas that had built up our culture that are ridiculous but we just accept them and you ever the old
mad magazine bit snappy answer the stupid questions we we came up here with our own if you could maybe response you some of these sort of these nostrums these canard the econ one to one understanding of the economy and economics so starting with something you on all the time
i'm
you can't raise the minimum wage because it'll cost jobs and going to raise the minimum wage
less money so they're not going to hire people to begin with albert that one just while it's wonderful i love that one i get it my classes all along
it comes out of the basic supply and demand analysis
young people are taught in economics places and as far as that goes it is absolutely correct if you raise the price of anything they'll be less purchases of it because some people will be priced out if the the ice cream cone in the corner doubled in price will be some people a neighborhood we're not gonna buy ice cream can't at least not as often as it used to cause it's more money than
they can afford if you raise the price of a worker they'll be less employers buying their labor than they did before if nothing else changes that's true they will be a few less people now you would have to then way if you raise the minimum wage the damage to the people who lose their job as a result
as against the benefit to the people whose wages are going up as a result of this most of the republican and conservative forget that second part they said it will be fewer jobs okay there might be a now we have to ask what about the people who have minimum has gone up with at rising minimum wage what about
them first of all an old they're going to be better off cause they have more money to spend than they used the for their job that they do but then we have to follow the little bouncing ball if the people who have more spend that more they'll be greater demand for goods and services and that will mean employers have higher
more people now we have to answer the question how many more people will they hire to meet the higher purchasing compared to the people they won't tire because the cost of labor is are we have to work all that out bottom line when you do the actual you actually look at what happens when wages go up you discover that sometimes they go up
are fewer unemployed other times as a more it varies but there is no automatic situation that dictates if it goes up you shouldn't if you raise the minimum wage you shouldn't do it because some people lose their job that's just childish les mis understanding how you do an analysis of this
cut and a good teacher would teach that to their students the teacher leaves it at the level of gee if the wage goes up some employers won't hire you therefore you shouldn't do it that's a leap for which neither logic know economics provide any justification and you don't have to be a left winger to do that anybody who understands the theory
would teach the students that here's another one this is this
when you hear a lot and it's one of my favorites
how about the idea that the government should run its budget like a family
by the government should run its budget like a family like we shouldn't overspent you know we have an x amount of money for the month and we can't go above that and we have we have to get the money we have to divide up if we go over that are checking accounts going to be overdrawn so like i said there's there's a certain logic there that seems to make sense but why is this folly let's falling for so many reasons
takes your breath away let's start
anybody who's in a family in the united states to they are almost anybody understands that there are very important things that a family needs to do which require them to spend more money than they have let me give you a couple of examples most american families understand that their children will have a
better future if they have a college education than if they don't
but they don't have the money to spend the roughly two hundred thousand dollars more or less than it now cause to send your kid to get four years of college so guess what they do they spend more than they have how do they do it by borrowing and they do it because of the confidence that even though it's bird
some to have a dead that's less of a lost to you then for going a college education for your children so they do it
the government is exactly the same the things the government needs to do that it doesn't have the money for it will sometimes borrow because it's more important to have that result with a debt than to avoid a debt and not have that result so the notion of an equation doesn't break down when you say gee
it ought to behave like a family because families are going into debt all the time
average american family now is more than one hundred thousand dollars and then if you add up the mortgage that they carry the automobile that that they carry the credit card debt that they carry and the college student those before major crimes of credit in our society
than the average american family is borrowing like there's no tomorrow we couldn't have people in their own homes if they didn't borrow do we believe in a home ownership society every president for the last fifty has said we believe in it while the only way americans can afford a house is if they borrow so if you believe that it's valuable that
people in their own home then they have to spend more than they earn the same logic applies to the government should be understood in those terms the difference with the government is that the money it gets is not by and large from the production it carries out for a working class family right if you go to work you do a job
get paid the government does some of that those some production but most of its income comes by taxing so the real issue is that the government goes into debt because it doesn't raise enough in taxes if it did it wouldn't have to go into debt so my response to people who say the gov
men shouldn't borrow in excess of funny i agree it should tax the money and who should attacks it from you can guess where i would call it should tax from the people who have the most money to pay the rich and the corporations should be taxed and use the punchline if you allow
ow me
when you cut the taxes of corporations and the rich the way we did in december of two thousand and seventeen
you create of course the need for the government to borrow unless the government is prepared to cut spending on everything
schools hospitals roads and everything else how is it going to get by having cut taxes on corporations and the rich as much as they did and still be able to spend what they have to spend the answer is they have to borrow and here comes the punchline who does the government borrow for from in order to keep going after cutting the tag
says the only people who can lend the money to the government or the corporations and the rich will lend to the government the money that they used to paying taxes that's why it's the biggest hustle since sliced bread
because by cutting the taxes that government has basically said instead of taxing it from you were gonna borrow it from you with this hey you back and pay interest while we wait this is a system designed by the devil to solve problems of the government by making the rich even richer
it's the real issue
perfect segue into my the last of these canard this is the last one here is moving out of econ one or one ideology and the harder stuff
yet now into the real free base of libertarian ideology and that is this is a great phrase of seeing more and more these days taxation is theft
got the government is stealing money all these people that you want it to tax the rich people corporations the government is using their implicit monopoly on force to threaten the most productive people did literally rob from them to take their money
out of their pocket at gunpoint every effort of a private capitalist society for the last three hundred odd years that we've had capitalism as a system has given to the government an enormous role in doing all kinds of things that they the capitalists either
can't or don't want to do themselves
defense
a judicial system where they can resolve their disputes without shooting at each other and a whole host of other activities
unless you allow the government to organize itself as an enterprise selling goods and services which capitalists have not wanted them to do for fear of the competition that would come from them than there is no alternative but to tax the people somehow to raise the money to have a defense to have a judicial system
they have a public works program roads at all the rest of it so you can call in any name you want you can call it that just means you don't like it but unless you have some alternative way to get these collective goods doesn't all the public part in the highway and the defense and all the rest of it unless you have some of the
or alternative that you've never told us about than calling the taxation is theft is neither here nor there you're playing with the words and i can play with those words to give you an example i can show you that the cost of producing an automobile is somewhere in the neighborhood of twelve or thirteen thousand dollars well then why are we
charge twenty five thousand it's theft i could call
why should i am i can do this i can do the same silly game that company that and afford a general motors are any of the others
isn't satisfied with getting the amount of money
back for selling the car that it costs to produce it
they want to pay for the advertising to get you to buy it they want to expand their production they want to cry robots then lots of other expenses solid jack up the price in order to cover the rest of what they do but that's no different from what the government does is raise the money in taxes to do what they are called upon to do calling it theft just means you don't want to
pay the same people who say that about the government would be shocked if they heard me explain that a third of the price of everything you buy his fat schmuck
i've got an outcome you're not complaining about being ripped off every day in a supermarket where that americans would buy that most americans feel ripped off in its obamacare if you hooked up but i think it would say that like well no one's forcing you to buy the car you just live in a society where you have to have a card you have enjoy how hard i don't think all with the force of go a super mario
yeah good unless you grow up in your back yard
you are by your life forced do is just like the only broadly now we're sitting here
in brooklyn and twenty first century america
what he think what does it mean to consider yourself
a marxist in twenty first century in america and is it different than if we had been in nineteenth century europe
yeah it is different i mean let me answer the first part
i'm a critic of capital the all for me marxism means is i've lived in capitalism all my life i was born united states have lived all my life united states i'm a citizen i think i understand this system both in terms of living in it and studying at all my life and i think that basically we can do better than capitalism just like the world
better than slavery and feudalism we can do better than capitalism and i have no reason in my life to shut my brain down or shut my critical capacities down capitalism as if it didn't deserve the same criticism that i would give to a school system i thought we could do better then or transportation system or and enter
gee system
i feel kind of proud of americans i really do that were critical of even having a debate these days about what his marriage what is gender of good those things should be questioned why don't we question capital is what is it about capitalism that it gets a pass and my judgment is you'll get a pass to an institution in your society for fifty
we've done it rots it doesn't work real well because criticism is how you identified flaws and mistakes maybe even think some maybe even figure out how to do better we should have been doing that for fifty years we haven't so for me i'm a marxist because i'm a critic of capitalism and if you are a critic of capitalism
and you take it seriously which i do then you find your way back to marks and marxists because it's the most developed school of criticism of capitalism we have mock starts in the middle the nineteenth century and he's basically saying i thought capitalism was going to be the wonderful thing everybody
thomas to call marks and there's a film by the way you can see these days the young call circular circulating around it's actually i've seen it now it's actually pretty good you know all things considered
so marxist grows up in the wake in the german wake of the french revolution the slogans their liberty equality fraternity he believed all of that he welcome this new world where we would have liberty equality and fraternity you could add democracy but he's a little later
fifty years after the french revolution he looks around germany which is way he comes from and he says we got capitalism which promised liberty equality fraternity we got to capitalism
but the liberty the fraternity not even close and equality
make me laugh it's is the anyone so he he says what what happened what went wrong it's almost as though you could say he felt that the revolution had been betrayed in some way not by some people but they didn't achieve what it set out and he said
i'm my contribution i'm going to figure out why that was make a long story short his conclusion was capitalism is not the vehicle that brings liberty equality fraternity capitalism is the obstacle capitalism thought it was different but it isn't in the past we had master slave lord surf employer employee
he isn't the end of that is just another form of that and that's the problem and we have to break out of that that's why i advocate for work or caught it's no more them and us it's the workers themselves running their own enterprise they are their own bosses it's a different kind of universe and for me
the marks i answer the question or your my says yes because i want to kind of push back against people who think that i should disassociate myself i don't does everything mark say make sense no does he make mistakes you betcha
he's not
a mythical figure body is the guy who started this whole thing and i read him with the same respect that i use when i read adam smith a david ricardo because they also understood a lot of things i need to to grass it's just they were partisans of this system and mark was a critic of that system and that's why i'm a marks
and that's all it means that he can teach me for example that the break we need is to get rid of the top and the bottom to get rid of the hierarchy and the the structure of a capitalist enterprise by a collective democratic way of organizing production for the same logic that made us get rid of mana
thirties and dictatorships in the political sphere we should have done it long ago but to this question of what it means in the twenty first century if mars destroy capitalism to class based system of power
obviously the circumstances have changed a lot of maybe lot as mean the same but like i'm just weren't interested in marxist classical understanding of what a worker in working class was who like who fits that definition in twenty first century america because obviously the workplace has changed dramatically
from the times in which marks as reading i guess i would argue with you here i don't think it's changed the technology has changed of caution that particular ways we do our work in the machines and computers and robots and all the rest of and have changed but that was true across marxists lifetime the technological
changes from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the end struck those people as unprecedented i mean they had steam engines at the end they didn't really mm at the beginning they etc etc etc so i'm not so impressed oh yes that's the best way to put it by the technological changes because they didn't alter the basic
human relations and that's what marx was always interested in it wasn't interested in the details he was interested in how human beings interacted with one another in production
and the notion that some people give all the orders and some people are in charge and everybody else comes to work does what they're told and goes on and watches tv this relationship between people is for him the problem out of which the conflicts come out of which the contradictions of this system and its flaws
com which is why he wants to change it so the answer your question simply most americans right now in the united states are perfect examples of the working class of people as marks the find it and let me just explain it in the way that i think might work
if you're looking for a job and you shut down you go to find a private employer most americans or from private employers you sit down you have a conversation with this person human relations person though the human resources that we we call it these days the boss
and you talk about all the different things about the job and you get to the the tough part how much am i gonna get paid and the employer says for example the well i'm gonna pay you i offer you twenty dollars an hour
and let's say you agree a while work for twenty dollars an hour
you know something now but you repress it does marches argument here's what you know the only reason that employer will ever give you twenty dollars every hour that you come is if what you help him to produce what you make the good
service
is worth more than twenty dollars for every hour that you work why because of what you produced was twenty dollars worth of extra stuff in this know he'd sell it get to twenty dollars pay you what he get he didn't get squat nothing sip so the only way you'll get a job in capitalism
i'm in a private employment
is if you produce more during each hour of your labor than you are paid which means what you have to face which is so hard for americans
is it the notion that you would never work for anybody who doesn't pay you what you're worth means you don't understand the system in which you are trapped you always are ripped off that's why those days when you walk home from the job and stop at the happy hour on the way to make yourself feel better you're right you don't just feel
doth you've been ripped off the work will always produces more because that's the only basis on which the employer will give him or a job this situation is the situation of the american working class and it either except sit as inevitable natural law any other excuse it wants
or it sets itself as like me a critic of a system why in the world does it work like this
why aren't we collectively producing more than we pay ourselves but we as owners operators of the collective worker cola we decide what's done with that extra rather than passing it off to another person who enriches himself that way and thereby guarantees that next week next month or next year we will be in the
same situation i don't get enough to get his drop he makes the surplus as marx would put it which keeps him in that position and that's how capitalism reproduces itself so i would argue that's while marks is relevant because he teaches this lesson and from that much understanding of the system flaws
net that's the great lakes
like just good
there's like a future way forward it's people just
confronting that sense of being ripped off because putting it in the negatively yeah pretty good and putting it in terms of people can relate to because we are and i think this i think we all we're all so obsessed with getting ripped off and we think that like welfare queens are ripping us off and on we think that the guy the used car lot
bring us all and it's all like we're celebrating our sense that we're getting ripped off it worth the alienation that happens with worden and we can't confront it because it's too dangerous that's so we celebrate it and were so they're still getting ripped off everywhere else but the place where our fundamental rip off and without happening by and if there was a few questions miserable at their job comes home and kicks
the door like the dog had nothing to do with the dog is innocent but you can't confirm how miserable you are the job because that scary you need the job so the dog was going to come up in love you anyway which is why you got that door
you get yes it it it creates of course this is marches point a lot of time it creates a very unhappy society and a lot of unhappy people because they can't confront what really bothers them then they behave in a way which some they know is irrational and crazy to write that confronted they get angry at the welfare queen and then
next week someone tells him about a person on welfare what their lives are really like and they kind of have a moment where they realized gee i didn't quite square with one eye for myself as a
it's a society that is messed up by its inability to confront what marks calls exploitation this business where you produces surplus for somebody else rather than for yourself trying to imagine the marxist image here it's christmas it's a party a christmas party for all the workers the
it's been a rickety table and because he sat around their neck and i use your apartment devon of hurt right
get these wrong
he thinks everybody all the people have gathered for their christmas party so i want to thank you all you worked so hard you made this a very successful you are profits were or whatever
in that moment this drunken employer recognizes that everybody contributed to the profits of that company he doesn't ask himself the question if they all help to produce it
why are they all excluded from decided what happens to what
how is it that high and three other people will make the decision what to do with the profits that they that they helped to produce know how come there that may hit me and the answers
a point they feel ripped off from something and they may not be able to say at the em malin be able to say it to themselves
but it doesn't go away
less than a psychology teaches you that that sits there and festered and it messes up much of the rest of the society's life and into relationships very hard
not to be overly dramatic how do you formulate a loving relationship with another person
if you're constantly either in the position of ripping off or being ripped off
you really think you can separate yourself into airtight compartments what you do with your boyfriend or your girlfriend is not affected by the bitterness is and the unresolved tensions of the rest of your life don't be crazy that's why so many people can't have emotionally equalized relationships with other
people know what that is never encountered it they live in a world which doesn't work like that and they know that somewhere but they can apply it if we taught them if we allowed the marxism
the insights to be taught so that people could think about whether they were relevant whether they help understand life for not then i think we would have been much much further ahead the loser in this country from closing us off the marxism has been this country
in many many ways it wasn't smart it was a fearful and fear driven reaction childish one you to overcome an idea by pretending it isn't there
three year olds three year old children when they're confronted by a scary dog put their fingers in front of their eyes because they imagine that if i can't see the old isn't there it takes a while to mature to get to the point the realize that dog is still there even if i go like this
american colleges
progress that they thought if they put their fingers in front of it and the joke is we now have a new movie about karl marx which by the way portrays him thoroughly sympathies that year old the movie he's very sympathetic you'd be on the thought as the hallmarks young he's hot
so i think we can just say it's twenty first century america
the dog is still there is a little scary

the clinch jaws sociopath and american aristocrat who whose sister does a yellow cake rituals and public
you three hundred generation wealth and berardi shithead it isn't a religious chop it up and see where we go it is amazing watching
this the trump administration
catch all of these dudes out and all of them going down basically with capone for tax evasion shit like manna for if prince gets in trouble for for for perjury is these awful just criminal scum bag who spent their whole time doing nothing but brutal crimes and just because the guy that they
opportunistic of hung around with the hope of maybe scoring some connections stumbled dec first and the presidency and put a spotlight on all of them and other oh going to the current administration is like the god's plan video for everyone who's ever called their doctor originals or for not giving them l alice is just going around like your blast
your book go make a deal to ever go sell your shares a building go get a military contract
provide security for the junior world cup in mongolia
eighty words you kick off the show
back into this particular well but i feel i have to even though we've already begun to show doing this
i did spend pretty much all morning just watching videos of jordan peterson talk about disney movies
and holy shit dude love disney films there's one there's one videos watching where it's just him literally sort of like an audio track for the blind just describing things that happened in pinocchio
so you know what's really weird to me is because like jordan peterson has become like the house academic of of the right
i'm not sure how much breathing room marriage between between those two but he's clearly popular among that demographic and you know the alright really grew out of the kind of like fever swamp of earlier sort of like internet conspiracy speculation i mean that which was also kind of like fascinated with nazis them and race pure
already and all that weird stuff and in that world where i i spent some time back and
walt disney was considered to be like the sort of like satanic underground like the pizza gate of its day and like if you look up like walt disney world the thirty three club you'll find this elaborate conspiracies about how that's where the masons conduct their rituals in walt disney only castle in yeah so so
it's really odd that now we've got this guy who who is of the outright who is effectively saying no on the contrary like disney is actually truly as wholesome it presents of these are are on
it was at one point where it all started with snow white nine cocked man
play nice guy to some sleeping bitch
chad comes in
the or of the thing that me down this rabbit hole there's an interview with him in time magazine
i just read this literally just him interrogating the film frozen in why it's bad whereas the little mermaid and other earlier disney movies are good and his his answer is that frozen
is intentionally trying to communicate a political message and all the other animated film adaptations are merely channeling
thirteen thousand years of blood civilization or younger kids
yeah it goes it goes pay off in the little mermaid
no one here to ask you if you want to build a strong hundred you do it or not
the collectivization reverse know only from
the uplift be asking someone with the port pull the snow means that they want to take the carrot from your refrigerator
work your to either
i wouldn't want to turn and cleaner since you discover not need a classic disney films but the classic disney afternoon tv shows so i thought i had with him
imagine a man and a large blazer wearing jeans
it's very disturbed and angry for some reason on the verge of tears a nice young man
to me and her lost and scared
and i told them you have to people through
well i mean it doesn't he was lost in a jungle
started an air freight company on his own responsibility doesn't doesn't the fundamental it goes back to it goes back to the snowman story though isn't the fundamental message of jordan peterson to all those young men that they need to use their and carrot
men are crying because the role models or married who's bald
married with the ball corrupted married with curly hair to the third and when they go into the earth is play through the first hurting
the only daughter where the move the thief
because these are the robot models they're dropping ice cream with sprinklers doubted a dodgers dress their behavior
three students brady better go care but just curious
this represents benny hill has he's here
no benny hill represents our dark masculine other a primal energy force and the nurses chasing dressed up as a bobby
read didn't want to be nominated email chaos and the union of the to yeah yankee sachs plays represents western civilization
yeah that's right and the three stooges are the super ego and he could just ask yourself please if you were if you're an acolyte or jordan peterson someone's paying less for you just ask yourself how was your life was a shambles of of alienation and loss and confusion until
seventy year old man explained cartoons
his plan homey
we are just for listeners we are finally going to do the twelve rules for life with huge next weekend but it's little little jordan jordan peterson previous will taste and just to let everyone know so you can get mad at me now i'm not reading that whole fucking
titus the shit are peruse it and i'll i'll have commentary is is that i'm not reading all five hundred pages of this gibberish
i'm come with your house to read them
you're going to do chores why
ages two hundred and ninety nine through five hundred look on his plan she has read the book and also understands things like arid and all that stuff i don't know when i got i got there at once it was a restaurant that only and see health rating
i'm a really big fan of the cool ranch dirt dirt
i know you hear that european piece a shit were roasting your name fuck you i i just want to know what the twelve rules are i just want to go through the twelve rules i want to know what they are just want to know about the rules i don't want to know about post modernism or roar inch layer most important rule is model
your life as a as a language speaking a higher thought having social primate on a solitary sea creature that lives at the bottom of the ocean and never has any contact with any other creatures other than to attack so over to my might be like ballew commands a young men
mo had the person responsible you is like stared up straight clean your room walk on two feet and put on human close
pets are optional
oh just put on a shirt and were heart
do you professions that you will never dreamed of air flying a plane
richard scare is believed her own represents the warrants are your hundred brain's reward to be or that lives in an overt he drives a being your parents to bridge party food
yeah so look out for twelve rules for living in her heard the yard with mickey mickey mouse because you're goofy i should i guess now i should finally introduced our guess thing in this week it's jake bacharach back again three time champion
know shit return ticket bacharach author writer pittsburgh native true free as a share i have now been on the show as many times as the pens have won the stanley cup that feels like it can't be a coincidence
oh that's that's how we have sets off everything is lining just right
see that so there is this thing that was going around twitter this week and it was basically this it's not an academic paper because there hasn't been peer reviewed or anything and it's came up with his publisher and this woman who is an economist is associated with the brookings institution so right there
that's enough red flags to dismiss whatever she has to say a while and nominal interest but basically like what was shared was the abstract of her paper which was about the use of next alone in confronting the crisis in america an overdose deaths from heroin and fence and all things like that next alone is it's like
it's like a nasal spray that you can use to revive someone who is overdosed from an opiate yeah yeah and the poppy at the brand name is mark and nor can slay
it's become increasingly in places like scenic western pennsylvania where where i'm from where the heroin in new epidemic has gotten
increasingly serious and deadly this
you know every police officer and paramedic now and you know from the city of pittsburgh it's more municipalities and carries the stuff and it's it's very effective
reviving people who would otherwise likely perish from an overdose when i was under the impression that someone overdosed on heroin you that a giant needle of adrenaline
and stab them in the heart with it all that this is the relentless march of progress
we have disrupted the be like
direct arterial adrenaline shot man
they can't memory may pulp fiction because i will not be nearly as harrowing a sequence just putting us nasal spray and somebody knows well you know this by itself wouldn't have been a noteworthy but the reason that this sort of semi viral and people are talking about it and sharing it was that in the abstract of this paper that wish the woman who wrote it share
she seemed to imply or she's just outright stated that the like there's a moral hazard effect here at work with the
the now of the proliferation of using new york and to treat heroin overdoses and she seemed to me he implied the moral hazard was nor can allows junkies to continue living after an overdose and continuing doing drugs will you be more risky and yes yes yes i meant which is the
basic moral have any moral hazard argument right but of course the paper i read the paper
the data
backing it up wasn't available isn't isn't yet public presumably it will be made so if the paper is submitted to peer review and actually published in a journal somewhere there are there are a number of figures that seem to possibly show some correlation between basically stay
eddie levels of mortality among users and the use of this of this drug this or or or antidote so to speak
there's the causation that is
insinuated throughout the thing there's just there's just no evidence to support it and ultimately at the end of the day when is it true that people who don't die from using intravenous drugs will potentially continue to use them in may at some future point i yes but you've still i mean it's also true that somebody who
is successfully has their cancer treated into remission is going to die of cancer
the the
a political argument that's being made here is really basically saying you know these people are drug users who commit crimes and we're creating a perverse incentive by saving the lives here it's like this get out of jail free card for being a heroin addict basically now now you know if you have this you don't like there's a you can save yourself from
someone you know from having oh right
and then there's the story
this is you put you hit me do this because the paper begins with a story from your neck of the woods said i was hoping you could hear ya
so this is like this is a totally
an apocryphal story
it was reported in in local media and it was basically the idea that that
road users are now
throwing nor can parties
where everybody gets together got kit gotcha little glass in bag everybody cooks himself up definitely a bigger don't know that they should take because
getting because overdosing is it feels great
let let me tell you as cynical outline or yeah yeah
exactly there's there's a cultural precedent for it so so they do this and then there
they all the revive each other
and needless to say this is totally preposterous there is there is no evidence that this is a common practice i compared it to back during one of the teen sex panics
the the old rumor about rainbow part know
we're all like queens like go into a room and suck a dick with different yeah rainbow lipstick
start thinking about the mechanics of it and you're like how the fuck would that work
it's the same but different color of six and they all kiss the same
yeah they would have moved their lives
don't know how like dicks
it wouldn't be like times i am pleased
yeah
sharing a ball
in any case the whole the whole paper is
what you would expect to come out of the brookings institute
a a sort of like when late pitched level counter intuitive contrary an argument that basically says that something which is an obvious moral good that which is saving people's lives when they would otherwise die is in fact complicated a it's also what are you this is bad
i mean they also love it because it is sort of american liberalism is of
there's like a little bit of a high tory element were any social welfare has this sort of paternalism to it and that's what all the apps and means testing or about their about well you know let's just see if you can get your act together to get this and this is this is the highest expression of that going well you know if we just bring you back to life where are you going to do it again
and just for all the like these are the same people are like you guys we need to raise awareness of mental illness and addiction whatever that they love the logic song words the suicide hotline but they don't actually believe that no one really actually does with that but they especially because if you really like thought this was the public health crisis would your answer be like a parent who
it's their kids screen time because they got a d well and you know one of the other points that the paper makes is it says the resources that are being expended on york and our could otherwise be expended getting people into treatment programs first of all there's there's no evidence that
that much money is being spent on this stuff in the first place and second of all treatment is deeply ineffective so you gotta save people's lives well that's the thing i mean frankly there's a lot of things about this that sort of on their face
wrong one of them is that a lot of these additions or fenton overdoses and they're saying well if you revive people who overdose of northern more likely to take that know but it's getting cut in and people don't know it's not seeking it out necessarily so your whole idea but even if was true even if you could put the numbers on a letter that said this definitively increases over all negative things
overall no amount of crime or whatever overall risky behavior you're you're still arguing that people first responders who would have the ability if they had dark and to save a life are instead supposed to watch someone die that that would be a better thing for them to do and that act is
more corrosive to the idea of social obligation and social connection of any kind than any negative cause by actually any negativity caused by by reviving people with market and that is the real idea behind this shit and that is why megan mcardle predictably grab this thing and immediately wrote a fucking article
who we can we can tell people to let let their fucking fellow citizens die in front of their eyes this is a perfect way to continue the steady march towards total neoliberal subject where you have no obligation to anybody else but yourself and that is the real and point of these sort of who he contrary
slate pitches social studies i think that her
anyone is the opiates any type of editor all they should be loaded into an airplane and if to jump out naked
i have to jump into circle and find a gun and maybe pants
and there's a storm and circling that we create with darpa weather machine and they lose one point of health the harbor way every time there in the harper machine they lose one point and there can only one left in the one guy left gets the narco but you know what to be totally seriously though how
that is in fact a comic exaggeration of like do territory so how how far a step is it from saying we should just let these people expire on on their like vomit soaked mattress while while the paramedics like take sell fees to hang around to just saying you know
just empower the police to extra judicially assassinate anybody who's using drugs
this is my sister's the terror take as planned
less appealing and everybody
god's plan that's a new thing that i'm going to want to kill myself
i cannot hear it from two weeks until there's a not all guess what i'm going to get like ten more things for my fortnight
and you can't go anywhere with anybody
whatever the ballet i thought of going to be it a fucking van with him
right hours in a car
we'll get ready because they say i have a lot of top donald's always have my my sister's boyfriend is an f t a y m s
probably shouldn't say is don't want to get him in trouble but he saves people from oh dang the and he he is tony that speak of dark and he has responded to multiple like o d calls in which like it's just someone like fallen out in an alleyway and the police got their first now
be the year now all carry nor can with them which is like i said is like a nasal spray and he said he has seen multiple instances in which cops who just literally sprayed it on their face
and it's just like he just like mace or something they just makes the with an arcana they're still lying and in l a concert
that's like it was like the famous pepper spray cop out like a berkeley oh yeah
he was putting round up on
love imagine just stupid you know cop loading big of new york and into his gun and shooting occurred
fucking moron
it's almost like they can only relate to citizens as people to be subjected to the violence so sorry you need to stay still ok okay stop global seeing ivor coded my broad sword with nor can
do you like the highlands
show me either movie i thought was kind of gay going to punch you in european guys weren't skirts but wall now than the future wear pants pretty cool
the way they can only be wanted to you that
but all i know we all know that sort of paranoid folk idea that you shouldn't mark
yourself as an organ donor on your license because then the empty will rise by drives are you off and busted open like opinion
and of course we all know we have an intuitive understanding that that's absurd because that's their job is to save lives but if you tell these guys yeah you just watch them die then they're probably going to search his property open and taken out your fucking kidneys because you broke in that fucking obligation between people because a child told you to markers and organ donor because she gave me brain
god's plan
fuck
well actually
god's plan
move on from home nor can appeal it crisis well
briefly odds
checking in on the president chicken and how's he doing what role
our little party
just two things first
earlier this week
trump said
tell everybody going to meet with kim jong un face to face first time ever the american president and the leader of the world
you know god's plan
like what are what i've read that i was like holy shit like this isn't a huge deal like yours
face to face meeting between the president united states and the leader of north korea i think it's great because like so i'm a game and my boyfriend and i have pretty much the same body type and we are able to share the same wardrobe and i think that trial
and i absolutely darling oh my god they cut out there that they've also changed switched
oh god oh my god you're cut donald trump
yeah but the ball yeah they both have kind of way
for cubes yeah yeah
i it for men
before we get north korea they could read off a really good joke i saw the how to from ah
my favorite comedian my inspiration my kid and it's miller
wow trove just announced the north korea's will be held at story daniels his apartment
went there he went hill
oh
now i'm i i like the moto reaction to the deeply arcade
like this are really work of cannot handle
the john birch society
basically she
imagine the the worst like tea tea party like
like anti john kerry propaganda that's basically rachel mad our now about donald trump
like he just doesn't have the guts to just like stand out it because i am
here's what happened
apparently
south korean official who is meeting trump at the white house told trump that mr kim would like to meet with you
delaying that message from north korea south korea and official trump interpreted that apparently to mean that this is the first time this has ever happened he's asking for me
personally because he knows i'm the deal guy and i can get deals done and he was just like yes let's do it
make it happen and then of course he had to walk back for about a day there were i was singing about this happening i was like wouldn't it be like the best troll ever if donald trump actually peacefully ended the korean war by meeting with
because of course they're saying oh no now you can't this is what they've been asking for years and years and years if they meet with the us president it it's it's like to legitimize them and i'm like who cares
is the alternative nuclear war
that's the weirdest sort of like centrist liberal to sort of like neo conservative line which is that like this
going to this is going to legitimize their government
that government hereditary monarchy that has been taken place
last half century boys and a half century it's legit it's bad right
there's lots of bad stuff about any trouble for
my father jacob
the say
dougie i voted
or
but seriously it's like you can have objections to like the way that the north korean state is organized but the one you can you would get wrong that the one thing that you can say is that the is that it's an illegitimate government
the saudi monarchy is naturally yeah then then the kim dynasty or is a legitimate government they will they love they love this
usually legitimize the was and things like you think that they're just going to break up it's like a bandit got together on craig's list if they're like well it's been been a few decades
no one's the junior ministers got a pack it up onto the next thing well to be fair to the lives i think that the legitimate fear at least than their mine is bigger than the same room together
his adult painted senile man
i'll be tainted with fire
kim is a is a man in his prime with with at least average intelligence and those two men and a room from was probably going to get rocked somehow
somehow it's north going to win the negotiations but so what if they do what do they want that would be a disaster for us or anybody i mean realistically i mean they're not going to take over and of south korea but what we give them some more food aid or so but who gives a shit we've made the deal with lifetime
the my wonderful friends in the democratic people's republic of korea they will be executing graydon carter
we now we now have a formal statement
from the leaders of the d p r k the republic of korea and president g my great friend admitting that i could have had guilty and eighty two
yeah i want you okay trump that's going to come out of the room he is going to disavow olympus has fallen
that that movie was racist
his career
and that's going to be that i mean okay so they lose if trip loses negotiations or whatever that is vastly superior to them continuing to not talk and continuing the tweet brinksmanship and kill trump decides to send dog the bounty hunter to pyongyang
came with the fucking crossbow and ignite world were fucking three seats i've seen this guy gordon ramsay do so many great things you have that starvation problem over there general manager told me about he's going to do your whole country unfortunately president came to the kitchen nightmares
chef ramsay has been equipped with thirty to thirty five fight and hybrids and three battalions of us marines and he will be bringing the london gastro pub experience to you
i don't think it's going to happen
true
gives south korea
it's evident unify the entire korean peninsula under a theory and in return
winter is for the dogs
look i just learned a lot about how they do with people who betray you
now i don't think it's going to happen because they already walked it there are other are they doing the same thing that they've pushed it to have we're not going to negotiate until you are until you basically agree to our terms which isn't negotiation and probably that i honestly kind of think that that it probably started off as just trump
it because yeah they've been making this offer some clinton and they've all said no and they just did it again because trump has an ego maniacal moron he said sure
i honestly think it's to make them more reasonable to keep like chinese underside side i don't think so i mean sure you'd love to get him in a room because he is going least you want to eat him i mean she has talk to him and if there's any contact between me and him he's like do you do not know if you tell this guy that his tie looks good he will fucking decide that you're the greatest
leader of china's vegas and it's easy
it's like all i got to do was throw him a parade and if there's one thing they can do and it's not a fucking break a million people making his face
there a all like placard are objects a giant
just death to see
that idly somerset
the gap and saying this out it nine eleven and they did two things which is projected stupid fat head on a hotel and then just like funneling money through funneling money through lobbying groups and this trump trump associated law firm to pay off which like we said his imagination and so small if you give him like fifty thousand dollars
like i've changed my mind you didn't do nine eleven so what little old is north korea have to do know by jerry's building the triple six hour drive
no i ran into a giant here
everything is coming of shared now we knew work for you me we love you
cnn an article today there was like silently jared is cleaning up the swap
i thought
it's like from one of the people they made in the lab with toby layer
like blonde conservative twenty somethings and it's like that has to be like double a minor leagues of be a conservative young bonded is like you get jared be the journey because not even mega people like jared yeah he has a constituency of vodka
besides i looked at facebook page called jared kushner fans
the biggest one i found had nine one hundred likes nine hundred one after church by
yeah but i either already the other mad goons or in his ears
preconditions and it won't be mad
you probably won't just fine but if it does hoo boy especially after after they kick out h r path and stuff yeah
alton and yeah
because like
barry holy terror of i only scary the only thing saving us from the like the queen drag heads of bolted and haley just the neo cons of moment i is that trunk thinks bolton looks like shit yeah i was like part that she doesn't like the mustache think
but then gorka had that he that's cool go to power is alpha seagal david clarke gorka it's a power ring or oh yeah yeah my thighs your speech reminded trouble like a bear caught a was
oh that's how i might take a little by the middle that's the best part no one tells you put it back in the box make charity
with facial hair is it's euro is rolling the dice if you present yourself a facial hair a trump because he has very complicated feelings about because he clearly grow any of his own because of hormone deficiency which also why isn't the red sox and then he gets weird feeling for some reason that that circular thing he finds calf some profit
i think like a regular must she just feels in someplace he feels the inferiority of himself that he can't grow it out as i said was never ever speaking of our president having sex this is the or rubbing his penis
penis against the woman's belly button because he saw it on soft core cinemax said
yeah i went to third base with her yes i wrote the small back
the for news or the week is the persistence of the story your story which i had one we forgot already really late but it it it's sticking around because it it seems like strawberry really has the could smoke this this enormous got receipts yeah and
not so much about what was great the sweet but god trumps and lawyer michael cole and show
he's such a great like mid season addition you know where this guy he's hey he is that your fargo character
well i need the thing that i've always liked so trump the thing about him is he has like all the upper middle class attendance that a rich guy has like that like he has his doctor he is lorries his accountant but the thing about trump is he never pays any one so he has to find like the shitty weird type of person who will just accept no money and be able to
make his get is not by living off the rift and trump world so his doctor is like that guy the guy with a weird long hair or his account it is probably going looks like brent spine or an independent
he has his account is account is probably like a drinking bourbon advocates that his lawyers michael called his lawyers a guy who appears in one episode of justified tries to buy a bunch of obviously for that's what
well as he says is like now just because i support our have dropped does not mean operate nearly shot and
events in truck not paying any one was the incredible the one hundred and fifty grand that they apparently they paid stormy the animals in hush money right before the election was it michael cohen to get a mortgage or his house or some time actually
that's a story daniels out of his own pocket
apparently still hasn't paid him for this
sorry sorry about that michael pick up her next dinner okay remind me to get used for that i can't work van baron won't show militarily to arrange this michael cohen
sent the emails from the trunk campaign he knew and apparently three daniels attorney
says michael cohen
was not even license to practice law in california where this arbitration to place for me
their claim now and court is that he didn't even sign it the right yeah but if it was drawn up by a guy wasn't licenses would even be valid
there's multiple levels
the document anyone can drop a legally valid document you don't have to be an attorney before the are somewhere to to drop a contract between two parties long as everybody signs off on them but i i'm not sure if i mean an arbitration is cause i legal proceeding i'm not i'm not sure it probably depends on state law weather
or not you can conduct an arbitration hearing
if you are not license to practice law and while i think trump things just being jewish
they're everywhere the bar mitzvah
all that you're passing the bar bar mitzvah they give you your license and you go practice law i mean to be fair as you could probably tell from the comment that i just made that's actually true
as we do believe ourselves out of it
the upshot of all this is that get yourself ready to see his dick
the she's gonna do this is all a prelude to her selling a bunch of shit that she claims to have and she said so far has been proven to twenty eight april first ever presidential nudes i well it's like no one of those creatures that lives on the sea floor and just eats the like little bits of whale
that filtered down for thousands of feet of clay that thing that angler fish is tangle out of their mouth catch the other one i can't wait for the reaction before it's like first you're going to gain entry or if ryan will president
do parents issues but has penis length of three point eight inches and a shape that it as a corkscrew is quite don't
and then like all the manga people are going to change their display names like deplorable mag a micro penis
how would a tiny pick is alpha as shit yeah you will give a shit about the pitches pleasure image or balls look bigger
no according my wife loves my clock
as as if the lab is like the black swan to wide school to have a swans exact
by by the way i'm actually a double life
this is actually a perfect segue we're talking
mustang club like creatures floating and tanks
the ancient of genetic destiny and bug once i'm talking about dune
i have a theory that actually there's there's a sort of narrative jared
connection because i was just thinking about like jared jared going to meet with with like the qatar is to get like the most precious substance that he needs to continue to run his empire so it's like palm what the even like sovereign wealth fund is the spice
jared successfully bribes a zoning commission or for the first time he goes to the father the sleepers
who is a gurney halleck the jared
oh that's a good question
doesn't have one i think that
he has no retainer he has no a false sort of warrior troubadour i've always gotten
is the hooker that his dad high as traffic
cafe to say that is straight out as powers in three there no woman born child has ever called this many times jewish sleep wake
many many have tried to sell six six six park avenue they have tried and
six six six park avenue it was created to train the
the killing word is you know who bike dad
yeah up
we knew you were coming on so we had to make some time to talk dude
for for give us listeners if you're not as and books as we are well i was june bananas international in canada
has influenced the lot of chapa there's been quite a few references throughout jake got me into doing and
we just it's it's a love the all share so if you're not familiar with the books or even the david lynch movie or later sci fi many the ministers
starring in the second one the one that they made about about the children of dune starring young james mcavoy who later went on to play the young charles xavier
he got his where he got it's like that had our
but i agenda for anyone who isn't familiar with the dune can in the frank herbert verse
could you describe roughly what do you mean is why it's economical of suffered know or yeah yeah said
dune was written in the in the sixties in that sort of the sort of like
early ferment of like the ecological imagination and the time when people are like getting interested in mysticism and you know it's like eastern mysticism
the various oriental isms that go along with that and frank herbert who actually knew quite a bit about environmentalism it was really interested in it wrote this
this epic science fiction novel
set in a sort of like measurably distant future tens of thousands of years hence when there is a sort of cause i futile
galactic empire
rule nominally by a powerful emperor but largely controlled by immensely wealthy families who who sort of own hold planets and the planet dune which is officially called rackets is this desert planet
controlled by a sort of villainous family called the har conan family
and then the noble a trading his family from another planet are are basically given it as a thief by the emperor and this is immensely important because doing is the only place in the universe that this
really kind of a mcgovern this magical substance called the space is produced it's the spice is just literally the comb of gigantic were yes yes although at the beginning of the book nobody actually knows that i'm not sure where it comes from they personally offer it later you need the space to fold space for it to make internal
lactic travel possible which is the undergrowth into the whole galactic empire depends on it but it's also a really tight for him loose and yeah
it it permits all sorts of kind of like semi superhuman abilities so you know there's this mystical thought society of women the been a jazz or it who are sort of like a a sisterhood like based on based on nuns are kind of medical order something and traveling pants yes
a sister hood of the travelling like his jobs actually a way to sort of described in the in the in the novel
they're sort of power brokers behind the scenes and they have various mental and physical abilities
it in thousand certain people who have the right genetic background with limited ability to see the future and that's basically the story so they a noble family takes over the planet from the evil family though it's all really a sort of double crochet yeah they're they're setting up a treaty to fail they are eventually ran
invaded by the evil family with the backing of the empire the father was killed the mother and son flee into the desert take up with a group of wild bedouin like nomads called the freshmen and at that point the son of the treaties family paul
discovers his late and prescient abilities become the leader of the freshman and ultimately conquerors the empire becomes the galactic messiah thick yeah it's away and then subsequent volumes which god describing the plots we'd be like all week but then the subsequent volumes follow the story of him in
his descendants on for like thousands of years and become
incredibly weird as frank herbert gets older and more interested in writing about his ideas about sex though
everything anytime sci fi author talks about their ideas about sex it's fine
find their the most normally normal sexual guys in the world or thousand i don't want to get into it too far away from the original up from the original book and story but there is there was an amazing scene in one of the later novels is duncan idaho climbing climbing scenic were or one of the characters a character from the first novel named duncan idaho
are great at names i don't get on could save a whole
he is he some handsome compatriots are trying to kill the god emperor who has the descendant of of the original paul more deemed and so in order to do so he has to climb are really high cliff so he does this and these two women who are his compatriots and fellow rebels are watching him do it
and the one of them
as as he crests the top she experiences such sexual attraction to him for this physical feet that she has unmitigated orgasm while standing there watching a guy climb up iraq
yo yo bitch so i'm inclined to kill the emperor is you were granted
silva has to play duncan either in the new had been yeah if you haven't seen the original david lynch movie you'll be seeing the new dentist villeneuve wave
the movie or movies he said he's making tool you really think they're going to let it make to i hope so i don't even know
is the first ones not has to be do better than literally every other movies ever made some good luck
he hasn't really made a successful know he has said the thing about do know is that when you when you read it as an adolescent you know you you identify with the park character you know he he is the sort of special person with special ability is that like every adolescent henry hire you will check
wants to be and he has this amazing abilities and it's all great and his family are noble and their retainer deck and are servants love them and the other family is this evil her and family run by a fat fe homosexual village so fat that he can't even walk he's carried around with like anti gravity devices
i've been out by it he has to buy two seats and spaceship
so so they're the sort of epitome of evil and the and the atrocities family pulse family are the epitome of good until you start to think about the way that this universe is set up when you realize that the entire universe is being described as like a brutal eugenic aristocracy in which the person who is the hero of the book is himself
the product of like a ten thousand year long human breeding programme manipulated behind the scene and it's joy division
and so then the whole way that the sort of
morality of this of this universe is is constructed begins to like really care
the to like pieces of fiction from around i was like twelve when i was sixteen link the two things i enjoyed the formative adult who the formative move into adulthood was realizing that tony soprano you should want to be like him and that paul is like a bad guy
well i think this is cool but the dune books actually like as you get further into the series isn't it becomes way more complicated that like paul becoming this global messiah figure is actually not so good
like galactic hitler
guy he is he's galactic hitler in fact that one point and even even muses allowed you he's talking to he has these memories that go back in time
he is talking about these past dictators and naming them many names hitler and he killed you know he was only able to kill twelve million people and like has his lawyer on retainer who's standing beside him says well you know nothing compared to your accomplishments the lord think of the hundreds of billions that you've exterminated on all the plan
not very good then his son takes a bunch of the spice turns himself into a symbiotic with the sand worm transform always be of all transforms over thousands of years into a giant worm god there are actually speaking again speaking of sex and are like multiple times where he explains to
that he no longer has a penis
like unbeaten is like i no longer have a human genitals
end of the second book paul is blinded and that sort of like castration metaphor as well yes yes and and then forced to walk out into the desert yeah i'm really annoyed because i've only read the first when these are all spoilers and fucking furious now i'm not going to be than either
i read those the to he totally got along yes car right now
not a fan i remember her own thought this june messiah children of dune got a book on tape or read by jordan peter
matt i understand if you don't like that
bring my ex box in the car and i'm going to put the chat on speaker so you can be michael like all the hudson's as talking to each other about god's plan
they will it
god's plan could have been the alternate title
it is this like the question for paul is like weather like it's just like he does he have any choice whatsoever in starting this in jihad or whatever it takes over the entire universe does he have any control over it
is it says it will happen anyway i will happen it'll happen
because once you take the spicy begins to have this like consciousness and more for linear time and past present and future sort of collapse into one theory a plane and the future has already happened essentially so there's hundreds of billions of people there already there are already dead has no
you might as well throw out an arcana
the have throwing spice parties
hands and boxes
no i know going to talk about aware it's like a sexual thing that the boxes of the web so pall mall make you make your fingers do a combo hit her
it has played the box okay so at the at the very beginning of the novel
paul's mother is supposed to have a girl and she is going to be bred with another royal family and they're going to produce the prophesied messiah but because his mom loves his dad she's like i have to give them a son
so make of that what you will so she has a son and the sisterhood who the been a jazz or at who have been kind of orchestrating this are fucking pissed but they're like still good genetic material so we were going to we got to make sure that this kid is okay we've got a test them to make sure that he truly
has the ability of a person of a station so they bring a box a dark scary box and they force this kid who's sixteen at the time this boy and they're like you have to put your hand in the dark box and don't remove it or else will kill you with this poison needle so he sticks his hand into the dark forbidding box
and suffers excruciating pain from which he for which he bears the scars for the rest of his life and i have to believe just knowing frank herbert and as attitudes towards sex and women that there was something going on
i think that fictional
paul put your hand in the box as eyeballs that's brain
so in the book became like it was kind of like a because of the time it came out it was although it was written much later obviously then
lord of the rings it kind of along with lord of the rings was sort of like taken up by hippies
and became like this real part of the like sort of like sixties counterculture and the thing is although it's actually it's a it's an interesting science fiction book it has some interesting ideas and it's like the way that it thinks about ecology the way that it uses this like this fictional substances like a metaphor for like carbon extreme
action all of those things are interesting but frank herbert can't write a fucking sentenced to save his life and one of the important things when you're like when you're creating a fictional universe that that talking for all of his faults was good at and herbert was not is like coming up with interesting names and languages for things and the best that herbert could do was basically like give
goofy fucking names and occasionally like throw in some borrow word from arab yeah and that was about it
and it makes the read like especially when you go back to it as an adult really yeah because that's the thing i didn't read it as a kid nerd shit as cool as job as a sport worth reading all the jock authors like derek
i don't regret
so i literally just reddit a year ago because these guys kept talking about they're going to get the fuck and references and yes the pros is absolutely brutal well here's the thing hurtful frank your perfect and herbert was a newspaperman by trade you using a newspaper
journalists and i think it's like a gift to curse when it comes to writing these blokes because i like the way he reports on and constructs this universe is like i think very credible and sort of like interesting like the details of it but his language is terrible
history x three desert race breaks down
read all about it i know what it's like it's written like what it's like an article in the atlantic
like a like a like a ten thousand word you know like here's a story about this place
in goa or whatever and it's like you know and it's root for the the western audience it's the it goes through like all of those kind of like long form like journalism ticks where they like established the setting and who are these people are what are the different factions are and the dialogue all sounds just like in one of those long form articles it's like the sounds like a rica
creation of like of the words that people actually use that has the sort of like still fitness to it so you can definitely tell that he came from a background will journalists say fi and fantasy or kind of like nineties rap because they love taking normal words in just replacing every see with a k
like fire spelled with a y instead of and high that's how you know your fantasy psi or kappa donna album
but for i guess for me like doing is kind of like my other my favorite series of anything metal gear solid because with metal gear solid like a lot of that dialogue is clunky because the first or japanese and then it's brought over and que jima is an insane person who just watched a bunch of movies but the
building is so interesting and the can't like the concepts are so unlike so many other things in the genre that i don't care you know doing is one of those things where it's kind of like
oh you don't how people like anything that's like sapphire fantasy
wikipedia articles are like written by people who know a little intimate details like everything about the world like it's the truth talking to like if you really want to just like learn about the world building of the dune series without like the excruciating necessity of the first book i think is quite readable i would recommend people read it the ones that follow you got to be really
dedicated the read
oh man that's a slog getting children to the general part of our
tough while it's because they're basically just hiding and like nothing now hands have been case of my like some tigers to the desert or some shit
so i wouldn't want to wrap things up talking about dune is so jacob he talked about how it was sort of adopted by the hippie counter culture in the sixties sort of like lord of the rings now like in the twenty first century
of the rings has become kind of like right when door like tread can pop culture yeah i live on that gates of vienna
yeah all that stuff when they all want to be habits you know like that's their ideal like come tyranny
you got internal community
you guys had china me on here there's a great i forget the title of the article but he he wrote a really great sort of like both admiration and take down of i'm talking that's definitely worth looking up especially coming from him as a as a fantasy writer i my dad he loved of the rings and easily well you know the homes are clearly jews and
other the smartest and coolest and breathe and i'm like are you sure
i'm pretty sure the jews are the ones that they dig out of my i thought
i don't worry their focus token shit i read george r r martin because they fuck that's all comes down to nobody and token a sex everybody is fucking
the song of ice and fire so that's clearly superior work and that's the one i actually read george r r martin strikes me as a sex nerd all totally okay so who is he goes on in my life
terrifying my question is like what you know where it is due slot in like the twenty first century the fact that we're wrapping it so hard i remember
early on in the run of the show one of one of our biggest fans who shall not be named by me right now
use the facts that felix had a screenshot for the david lynch movie is like avatar to as evidence that felix bieber layer is hilarious g hottest is a hilarious nato running dog fashion because herbert is larry of hitler in fashion
everything is yeah all all and to all entertainment is is fat i mean it's not not fashion but like will know what it is pretty fast
hitler hitler in is just man is the worst or me
boyd way you know what it what does what is due to offer us in today's today's i think do i think dune slots in very well with the with the in the sort of like oh right area i mean they don't care about the environment and herbert cared about the environment but you can sort of ignore that stuff
it's all it's all part of the world building but like the central plot line that runs through dune is about of like these sort of like you generally excellent people in racial destiny
out about racial destiny and about and about the sort of like innate characteristics of certain groups and races of people and you know like so the idea that like the freshman you know who are i don't know how you feel about them because they're clearly arab but like you know they they have all of these like very particular and like rationalized characteristics but
even though herbert sort of describes them in some ways as like
he describes him as a certain phenotype they have these certain characteristics and lots of they're all like that and i think so i think that that and the fact that this universe is clearly constructed as a sort of futile universe in which everyone knows their place and people sort of like place at birth is destiny
slots in really really well with a lot of ideas that are my kind of like you find bouncing around on the sort of like alton far right and also the idea that it is it's it's us right it's the far future
first human diaspora doing this yeah the idea that we can go back to those sort of raise it higher while in fact there actually in the later in the later books there even a point where the the the atrocities character that of ruling family who comes to rule you know the whole human universe they actually a trade is is apparently
a corruption of atria the house of a tree us from falling at the bloggers a blocker
no from
frank herbert even predicted
really
so in the book i mean then this goes back to the
the whole like rome athens jerusalem thing it's like they literally the ruling family traces their roots all the way back to the sort of like bronze age rulers of ancient greek sick
twenty three and me must have gotten really fucking good in the far future because that's a lot of generation father the puck all his clinic this row
just it to wrap things up with i was going to be clear here that for us and anyone listening to the show
if you enjoy any work of art or like fiction in particular that doesn't conform exactly one hundred percent with your current political beliefs and postures you can't enjoy it and you should get rid of it you should read it and did you forget about it the delete this episode dune is bad the dune is perfect but
you can't watch it because it doesn't the you're like the perfect ideology so here are the things you can enjoy that fit the correct ideology as of march the tenth reports of march tenth four o seven pm eastern standard time the last boy scout with bruce was amazing the glimmer man with them
sick all white chicks with other ways brothers don't be a menace
south central also wins and then finally we got the classic reign over me
i
wow that was great i love talking do
but let's talk a stock david brooks about that
there's something i love more than going a whole week avoiding every fucking person linking to a fucking david brooks thing coming in to do this guy their show and having to listen to this fucking human avatar of the turtle that you were supposed to draw to get into art school
i'm afraid you whine about the liberal college students and why why it's actually intimidated by his younger wife so yeah and again he's talking about you know liberal student mobs campus activism
and the reading series this week which is understanding student lobbyists by david brooks modest lobbyists
i can't wait until the only remnant of of colleges are are just a few shacks on the few remaining human settlements and fucking oil tankers fucking refugee camps and these guys are whining that bill too rude to the fucking instructors
it was running into their instructors so good to david brooks here he's rates students across the country continue to attack and shut down speakers at a steady pace from this one fucking got them thing
this guys are freaking out about a fucking script in summers there is a five second fine
i was getting booed from two weeks ago that she then she gave the speech after that she was attacked she was killed separate fuck
up
sorry because you know how some of his dad she was killed
plays in pleasant epic based mom murdered by no scope head shot
this he says
ip larry summers and killed him in nineteen ninety nine at oberlin college when me and some other people yell at a little bit when he tried to make a speech which he made anyway
thank god these people were kids
traumatic thing that they saw the thing that read the world was we are we are all getting shot by jack ruby on national television and the now in their damage it's christina hoff sommers getting yelled at jesus
fucking christ was he goes goes here
like this he goes to shut down speakers at a steady face from christina hoff summers to jordan peterson like that from to the shortest distance
the same person
like there is no difference in their beliefs they're like the exact same figure he goes i confess that i find their behavior awful my gut reaction
my gut reaction is that the student modest managed to combine snowflake fragility and lynch mob irrational is enough and snowflake the fragile about every fucking op ed writer on earth having a collective nervous breakdown for a solid month
about one person being rudely spoken to a college campus will the christina hoff sommers figure or the jordan peterson's or bench shapiro's or whatever of course are just stand in for david brooks and really what they really don't like and what they're so horrified by is the idea of kids just being like doing the jerk off oh shit every time they open their mouth
like that or or the digital equivalent of that which is twitter so he goes they have combined this fragility a lynch mob irrational isn't into a perfectly poisonous cocktail
but empathy is the essential character trait for our moment
guy who is never felt everything in his life but i guess so i thought it might be good as the moment with empathy what i thought it might be a good discipline to try to see things from the students perspective to not just condemned recycle analyze them but to try to understand where they're coming okay
i'm my favorite now my view or my own do not reflect reflectors of my employer but i do work in higher education and you know when when an older man is trying to into it his way into how the young codes are thinking particularly when it's an older man like david brooks who married someone who
barely out of being a fucking coed than like there's something else going on
let me let me let me just do this just do this experiment
professor of virtue studies with is shining bald peyton and manly classes and knowledge of classical literature he's a fucking sexual dynamo god
i just really need to have a pillow fight right now i just i just want to pass my top open for him because he is not losing t a drastic rate every moment
he's a virile man god
i would begin my stab at understand
just sit on my couch now with we all have a talk about the stabbing stabbing
can i just haven't via acknowledging that i grew up in one era and they grew up in another okay now i came of age in the nineteen eighties in that time
this some shaw
i'm not sure if i believe that
when it is like is is grinder profile he's got his age listed as like twenty nine and
like ninety seven
time
distant past of the nineteen eighties there was an assumption that though the roots of human society we're deep in tribalism over the past three thousand years we have developed a system of liberal democracy that gloriously transcended it they put reason compassion and they can't provide has three thousand years have not been a unit intellectual history
from from from tribalism from like living in hunter gatherer bands to like
question time british parliament like it
history moves in fits and starts and in different cycles and there have been all sorts of different experiments and government and social organization like there's a whole history as crack we must in with
the three thousand years of culminated with america and the nineteen hey to his which transcended violence in brute force and put reason and compassion
yeah the nineteen eighties were definitely the most compassionate time in american english we talked about this last week every fuckin movie was hey how are we just have a guy covered and baby oil murder five hundred for us
because there was also an assumption that while we might disagree on the means we all wanted basically the same us to tattoo game so
you didn't get a to mine managua harbor
for example contravention of you and law for example though america was plagued by economic divides we all wanted a society in which social mobility and equal opportunity where the rule
though america is plagued by racism we all wanted more integration and less big and we all wanted a place where tally that the people who are fleeing fleeing to white flight suburbs and instituting a fuck a draconian racially determined to drug war wanted integration
isn't that what we wanted was a place where talents in character mattered more than skin color and prejudice we want to we all are the guy who has the one line from the fucking martin luther king's three as the entirety of their social conscience and ideas
has given those assumptions sophisticated people in those days wanted to be seen to use scott alexander term as mistake the arrests
this is reduced goes it goes it goes for the rat like the rest of this described a different scene
six theorists and what he calls conflict theorists
i might read this shit because it's already too much is that it stands out where he's like i'm going to attempt to understand what the people yelling at christina hoff summers are just booing her with they really feel even know they repel me and i think they're awful i'm going to try to discipline myself with empathy so rather than actually like talking is any the any
one who doesn't like hoff summers are jordan if peterson or bench shapiro he's like i'm just instead of going to talk about a bunch of ridiculous jargon a about mistake the okay i have not read this thing because i try to avoid this like an asshole
but just from what you're saying
tell me if i'm wrong
these two ideas are the people who are opposed to us politically are mistaken
or they are resolve openly opposed to us are those the to what does he wouldn't the kindness kindness as mistake the mistake theorists are people who who believe that progress and human achievement happens largely by mistake and compromise an accident and just like oh i have a vial for
of democracy and i have a i have a beaker for capitalism and i knock them over they fucking hit each other when the fun says a steak theorists believe the world is complicated and most of our troubles are caused by error and incompetence not by malice yeah ok okay yeah and problems are caused by mistakes in all what the same thing some people goof
you have a holocaust
you send a few crates of machine guns to know rapists and in central america this bill so he says in the conflict theorist world view most public problems are caused not by errors complexity but by malice and depression the powerful few keep of else down the we all have caused by different material interests
different groups of people have have have different interests based on their material circumstances you know i'm i'm sure that there are other that there are complicating factors but that's at the root of different people are trying to get a piece of the pie class fares so they aren't they are in conflict with each other in a society that still has
scarcity
there remains scarcity of resources in our society and so people have to figure out how to apportion it and unless you a portion at equally to everybody
system of rationing then and through room central planning then then people are going to be in conflict and that's what it is you know i'm skipping to the end here he goes if i could talk to the students david talks your wife she could fill you in here i try to persuade them that mistake theory is a more accurate and
effective way to change the world than conflict theory but i probably wouldn't persuaded so i just asked them to take two courses the first would be and revolutions the french russian chinese doesn't interest all of the other ones that there is no such a course the level to be cherished memories wasn't a hardship revolutions corn on the smell
there will be setting the french russian and chinese and american revolution because those are all those are all singular erupted historical events with no context or connection to other historical occurrences which you have to understand in order to understand the revolution we're just going to start at the at the moment the sa
sans clothes fucking storm the bass bastille and we're gonna we're going to end the terror and were and then we're going to move onto the next revolution will yeah so that we can teach people the revolutions are bad yeah he doesn't he doesn't have the american revolution in here he just says the french russian and chinese and all other ones that unleashed the passion of the mob in an effort to overthrow oppression
and the way they all wound up waist deep in blood
like the things that they revolted against like there were about ankle deep and boy
they got up to their way through high it all got bad that's what happens you know we start getting serious about oppression and injustice
the idea that the people doing it to us are bad and not just mistaken but meanwhile the students on college campuses are not revolutionaries i mean a few may have pretensions of it but most most politically active college students in these let's be honest largely elite institutions that we're talking at all because like you know go to like
big state school and things are very different
but
these people are like these kids are interested in controlling the intellectual life of the community in which they live and they are opposed to certain people with objectionable views in their own minds cut coming and and propagandize in for them on their campuses and
all of these people have outside platforms anyway but the idea that students are like our or a step away from the terror
or from like or from like i don't know enforcing the a ukrainian famine unlike the entire center of the united like the entire mid west is preposterous so what does this argument even have to do with what's actually happening on certain campuses or the other point is that like like this christina
last summers thing is a perfect example of it because the like
well funded right wing student groups invite these figures like friendship hero or peterson or whoever to come give a speech
the full knowledge that they want people to protest it and then people protesters or and will blue or heckle and then they can have their video clip that they can share and then they'll go on and give the speech anyway so i mean i think it's another example of like i don't want these fucking like griffin is using the university that i'm a part of to hawk their idiotic
see both worlds see here's the other thing too is that like part of this is also and brooks is like an avatar of this part of this is a weird
american culture of like difference and pull it has to to power and to people in positions of power and while there's the you know
i certainly am not going to praise like british politics or british public discourse which is a fucking cesspool at the same time like if you watch like the british parliament where people actually do harass and harangue and blue and yellow at the prime minister or like think about like the british tradition of like public speech and debate it's like there's there's a culture there of impolite
it's ok to happen
a shit who fucking cares
they need them to do it that's the other part of this
pro wrestling they their barnstorming these campuses it's just like when when the heel shows up and says this town full of you guys state like are you know
isn't that doing that on purpose
he'll shows up and says your apartment smells like
either point that i think was a good one that was general buoy actually made it this week where he was like he put it out that we're now pretty much a generation removed from the first round of like campus pc panic which went on in the nineties and culminated with a little film called pc you pc
classic know that pin and have
the first ball that
the moral those moral panics the exact same content and tone and subject matter of the things going on now you know the idea that this campus
nazis or like language police saying we're all going to be so politically correct and and it's like that was narrow twenty years ago all those people who came up in this cultural revolution and no graduated and guess what gone off to continue in maintaining and running are rotten economy and races society so what do you fucking afraid of
the same thing is going to happen with these kids flood know i honestly do think that it's like a fucking it's like it's like wrestling it's a barnstorming rustling circuit where the fuck kids are the are the audience throw and shit into the ring and the speakers of the heels and the fuck and shapes and brooks is dumb ass
run around with their backs turned while guys you live in a steel chair and it's all just part of a thing they all need each other it's also not all of them of them have a job or thing to watch on a friday night if they're not all they're doing that

yeah i know i hope she can assist this year
as met said once and for all finally washing our hands of this incredibly tedious i'm going to do it again i clean air clean my room
i cleaned virgil texas has room lawyer before we get into injured peter said i do have the fact that you may or may not know she you had a sort of a disaster befall you recently my house burned down here i bought a house burned down i mean i don't know of jordan peterson was involved but the house did know
you in felix are actually a member of the arson community arson
i didn't see the last meeting
kind of have my own or
this is only cow innocent boy
your house burned down when you are quite young yeah and that's why you are the way you her so yeah if you're considering yelling at me for anything
my house burned down when i was for no one got hurt except for my sense of safety
anytime you're like you know you have a policy
politics pod guess you should follow the news no i don't have have is david flares up sometimes and it causes me to not read or catch up with anything only play fortnight and watch every day stored on complex now know anything that's going on in the world not really care still still say a lot of slurs but that's because one crucial now
honestly in nineteen ninety four was interrupted for me it's so now you know the rest of the stories huge you're welcome to the community
you will also be displaying the symptoms soon so long he the already starting will ya he is coming out with little boat to what do you think i can't wait right
but i'll take into this way you are you've been made homeless by fire mankind's oldest at me i was homeless yeah i was wandering i was lost
in a heartless world and then one generous man to me in that was virgil taxes you're walking the streets of philadelphia he didn't actually take me and he's not there
before he said he left he said well i already have you will meet him there he was bragging about his incredible act of altruism that he was let you stay with in his house after he left it
and it's like the house that are you just want to say that we're going to get to one of the one of the rules is that you've got to clean your room and virgil texas is someone who does not follow this rule i'll tell you when i arrived the the weirdest thing is that he loves to drink these like bottles of electro light infused water oh yeah well my athletes but like he only drinks like
two thirds of the bottle and then he'll seal it back up the ass leave it like around the house and finding like like dozens and
and then it was also finding like these little like things that look like some kind of electronic device that had like human bodily fluids in it was a mechanic and to replicate it turns out is just his pen cartridges which is scattered around every corner of the water
i think is so true every time he comes with a gigantic bottle of water will take like a couple of sips other
cold society and hard for a forget about it leave it there but he these it there because he wants to have a bottle of water close at hand matter where he is any moment but he likes that old or water tastes odds finally i need water and got a brand
that's a real kind of us trove profiles for life i'd let it mellow
not get me smart smart water again i think the molecules are sharper than the other of war
he's still doing nothing else with this essential to massively own out the subject of his fake knowledge of water
we have laboratory test results indicating that he does not know the difference between these their water again
unless they say your your your house sitting for virgil he's letting you do this set of the kindness of what about taking this
it's ever been right now and i still have having you get the bail one less than one last detail i would love for you to share with our listeners what was on virtual to bed when you first arrived okay on his bed was some kind of creature that when i picked it up
it came alive
and started singing and
they had a friend too
i don't know what they support that's hurdles part of the unknown
was an angry bird yeah
all other animal is some overlap so
i wish i did the fucking it oh that's what it is the one of the fucking so characters i've over watch as a bird sidekick but the what the talks is a poor he enters the picture as a as he was leaving and he literally he like tuck the evidence of day
yes
he didn't put sheets on the top
oh they both have for
exactly
so you're making yourself at home you're you're in the park palace
again they fixed it makes the virgil in welcome degree and it stinks of versa for his charity
he said he went ahead to allay were meeting in there but he wanted to spend some time with his mother a lexus

okay
most get down to business here let's get down to the twelve rules for life
if you listen to the show we've talked about your and peterson for i'm sure you're familiar with him i don't think he needs much introduction can i just said there was an article in l a times recently about him that talked about him as being
he is the dark professor yeah but he has been referred to as a member of this article called the intellectual dark web yes either
this is like i think it's dave rubin his self christening him sam harris jordan peterson empire no fucking
i don't always go and snow on yet going dockers alpha yeah i'm already wide guard
absolutely our really is dark
hate it when the flag from always sunny in philadelphia
i don't know if these guys know that the dark web is where like you download child porn and higher hit men and like identifying there like an electrical movement with i'm glad you brought that up the intellectual dark web
mullen you are all these guys but like peter sit in particular i think is the perfect avatar of this because it's like yeah who is he
dark and dangerous like these these these controversial ideas she's putting out there all like he's just too dark and intelligent the fundamental facts about him overall but all of these guys is how own barely tedious and vacuous their actual thoughts and writing are okay let me far from being a danger
just so dangerous if you're trying to fucking stay awake or makes sense of end of it i did i did read the book and let me tell you is basically a combination of like the secret and the bell curve
if you if you're in a market for some self help bullshit with all the kind of narcissism and navel gazing and mysticism that implies but there wasn't enough social darwinism and for this is the book for you don't respect yourself have contempt for others
our devotion and makes that's that's what i believe in
just start things off like might the main thing i was curious about this book
it's a tome it's a door stop this thing and it's it's a genuine and you know hit in the published now is one on amazon for a while
reviews were raves i think it's a are five star rated boat except i wrote a review that was one star that i asked people like if the if they found it helpful to up vote it and for like a couple of hours it was the second most helpful review on their said my man has literally no idea what
he's talking about where you work in from purchaser you are going to learn her to read the book and the jordan peers and fans mountain a campaign to get it taken down yeah i can hear what happened in the marketplace of ideas
know i mean of course he is like all these people embrace that taken up the mantle of free speech in the open exchange of ideas and civil society but i'm both him and his fans are just about the most thin skinned darts and reactionary imaginable
who again like if you make fun of peterson or even just discuss him in any way that short of absolute reverence will throw a fit and again just take you on the road to peasantry the speech thing is something they really outrageously pedantic about because like he he's famous because
he said he wouldn't call trans students by their preferred pronouns
and like every time he is pressed on that he says i didn't say that i said i wouldn't call them by any pronouns are dictated by law
so what the fuck are you going to call them like i mean he's totally willing to obfuscate what he's actually going to say in service of some labs traction well that's a very good as any this is sort of like his ruse and i think it speaks to our to his popularity in like for instance
in all these interview clips of his that have gone viral sure you've seen them he genuinely does get the better of the people who were interviewing him most of the time because they're largely unprepared and they have they do the standards of liberal thing where they're like you're really believe this to you and we've talked about this before and then he does that thing where he just speaks really belligerent the in quickly
and it just sort of like plows right over them however unlike words about statistics that like most people don't know however what what he does is there was a famous one the one that a lot of people shared it's like vice was interviewing him and he was talking about like sexual harassment in the workplace and he was making the point that
lipstick when a woman whereas lipstick the point of lipstick and make up in general in women to sort of britain reading the cheeks and lips is
to convey sexual arousal it's like they likely to convey to exaggerated sexual response so he sang like when women put on makeup and dress up to go to work they are signalling their sexuality in a way so we shouldn't we shouldn't lie to ourselves about what's going on there and then like the interviewer like will just try to pay like was so what does that
why and he's like or i'm not implying anything i'm just really acknowledging that but it just like he's setting up these sort of like thought experiments and statements that would seem to imply that are women are asking to be have their asses pinch just because they wear makeup to work but one could just as easily say like when a man wears a suit like a blazer taylor jack
it is supposed to make your shoulders look wider and give your upper body is certainly a sense of symmetry and proportion which is also sexual signaling i wasn't gonna say anything will your outfit proves a jessica focus on mood
it's a new one with us track pants your and even look at the out one
that it goes in the jungle
separate what does the man and were when he parked here as he puts on a pair of sweat parents were you see exactly how he's been circumcised
this kind of guess it is appeal though is because he's talking about these taboo subjects like and it's exciting for some of his fans that like he's talking about the sexuality that slate lying behind seemingly normal situation
and they get excited about that
just accept whatever like money will get on a in a very vague general sense of course that's true but it's just like what is he implying here and the thing is i don't think he really knows what he's trying to imply i think his fans like pick up on these little cues that resonate with them because it's like exciting and controversial but i think he very strong
honestly tries to avoid the implications of any of this because like i said i think he's just incredibly tedious it's just like when you're when you're a kid and like you have a substitute teacher who like uses mild swear words you like wow that's cool he said oh you like that's basically how these guys are responding to him as his kind of like paternal authority
your who was a little on the edge well for like a lot of reactionaries and both good few years i'd say you can really rip shut up and my dad in audience and by pointing out how shitty the modern world is sparking terrible like most people who listen to you aren't happy either completely unfulfilled by their existence
they have no fulfilling relationships in their life but for most of them life for a lot of the all right guys it's like those stirring the morning
it isn't mark zuckerberg stock doesn't this is in vogue and stupid that
the only avenue of politics is like that sort of cultural consumption which marvel movie season this fucking stupid and tawdry don't you hate your life and they sort of like lose people because every time they all meet up they look stupid and kill somebody or you talk to them long enough there like and the thing that we do about it is we blow up a home depot parking lot
with the peterson it's that he just goes and sam harris
through bo sake bullshit
that it's not that his fans really super interested in what he has to say after he points out how shitty modern life is it's just that you know it sounds like something that smart and they're mostly hooked by like yeah my life is shitty i think with with hooks and also it's one step one is you identify discontent and that is where of
he's small less successful reactionary quote unquote thinkers stall out as because they really only have a spurious diagnosis he has an action item and it is just self help it's just it's just take control your life but because the life of a sort of under employed
aid relatively economically stable middle class young person is one with basically no supervision no structure and that allows you to basically do a thing like game until you let yourself because no one will stop you from doing that in except for yourself and he is acknowledging that and saying you have to be the one that
truly intervene in your own life and that is that's incredibly powerful either because people literally don't get parenthood any more like parents don't talk to keep their children about about these kind of things or people grow up so wedded to the the rhetoric and communication south of the internet that nothing is real and
they see it online so their their parents can tell them locally in the room all week and it's just going to go over their head but when the youtube and friends tell them to clean the room it actually resonates i'm not sure which it is i'm not one of these guys there was that the most famous interview he did was the one on the bbc with cathy newman and there was that part
i think she said something about are like well you know most fortune five hundred c e o's are men it's very exclusionary there are a lot of women on there and he said something like well yeah most men aren't fortune five hundred c e o's either and like that's true and if you're not going to be able to like offer a critique of a structure that has it
extremely wealthy people an extremely you know disadvantaged people you're going to get caught in places like that yeah well that's like whoa
you know like he's a reasonable one that's why he's not going to go away is because the other so i gather to mainly dominant culture of horses like the reactionary one in liberal and liberal one can't point to the world the culture it's created you go
actually you love it it's great
america has already made jordan beaters it's going to be around like forever until i don't know he starts a colder he he finally does like he intersects a mass suicide with haley's comet at the right time i don't know but yeah he's not going away because they have no answer to him because he offers a structural critique and it's
wrong and but it is and it's jubilation it's hard but it is one that seeks to offer an explanation and an all cultural come conversation on the the main stream is not comprehensive it's just individual think pieces an individual reactions to specific discreet events and
all coming from this sort of vague cultural liberalism
and which really just it has nothing to offer other than the status quo is basically good we could use more diversity but nothing that actually speaks to anyone's real discontent on any level other than like not seeing enough representation and order some ethical peterson does is like you said
and because like
he hooks the marks as we've described earlier but i think what he offers is this kind of union psycho and analytical thing trick where it's just like you can with this knowledge that i'm going to impart to you you can recreate yourself is sort of a character in your own heroic narrative
that connects with these subconscious ancient sort of almost biological truths about humanity and this is where it gets into the reactionary part is because all these truths that peterson thinks is unchanging absolutely true and any attempt to alter or
go outside of them will lead to disaster are all things like you know just hierarchy is natural rather than traditional family is natural and like these are like we need to hew to these things that are all true because they've been true throughout all of human civilization this is something that actually like he viewed with sam harris about because
same us fans all like requested that he get jordan peterson on his pod gas you know like when my two dads to talk about his allah forbid dad might transfer dead and so he went on and he just said a bunch of gibberish about archetypes and the collective unconscious and sam harris was like what the fuck are you talking about
that doesn't make any sense and everyone was this point in the email exchange where peterson was like talking about slaying dragons and shit yeah he really loves the he loves the slain the dragon well that's the thing is it and i even eyes like the paris fans like you peterson how many i want to know what percentage of these peterson fans are guys who until peterson
showed up would have consider themselves
guys like were loved logic and reason and thought those were the ways that you figure out the world and then this guy shows up with the dragons and the fucking subconscious and this you miss others have either like fuck me up buddy
what it shows is that what they really though they don't really care about logic or reason they're just a totem because they want to justify traditional hierarchies because they think they belong on the top of them they think they aren't on the top because evil cultural marxists of interceded with with the truth change
the culture undermine the rightful place and they want to get back on the rightful place the same way that like the shah's regime before the french revolution was with had a natural order they feel the same way but the the enlightenment came along cut all those heads off and we don't think in terms of divine raw anymore so we need something to replace the
divine right with and can only be in a modern context so it's gotta be reason and logic but if another guy comes along and he has the same hierarchy to defend and but he does a more a more sparkling job of it and he's talking about dragons and archetypes i'll take that whatever it is whatever can justify the higher
turkey is what matters
you know who else had a natural order lobsters
okay
oh i get into this now because like the book is called twelve rules for life and ever since it came out it's like all i want to know what are the twelve rules
actually found someone who just has done all twelve i forgot all them okay i'm hoping your life was fuck fucked up since you've really have a burning down your house would still be on our the
never got her one never finish a bottle of water
if you have water out of your home if there's a fire you could pull it out quick this is this is a real quote from peterson's first book of maps of meaning chaos my favorite halo
another voice were chaos is what extent eternally in without limit beyond the boundaries of all states all ideas and all disciplines it's the forerunner the stranger the member of another girl for russell in the bushes the hidden anger of your mother
okay
order cause chaos is symbolic the associated with the feminine order by contrast is explored territory that's the hundreds of millions of years or hierarchy of place position and authority that's the structure of society and this again all this dragon well so i'm just going to say here chaos is the fire that
birds don't choose house
her is the pork converge and the water
listen here's the way he puts that in the new book which which is full of like that that type of stuff about you know the the balance of order and chaos in the world
he says order and chaos are the yang and of the famous dallas symbol to serpents head to tail
order is the white masculine serpent chaos it's black feminine counterpart
now what
what
i don't i don't think you gotta be a friday to white masculine serpent and draw some kind of conclusion
most logical unreasonable i don't know write about this logic the reason by the way check out my new website why did
collaboration not jordan years and
real logical men look at black wednesday jazz
the this look at the fucking diagrams or in his first book it's like literally henry the fuck yeah henry
henry darn sure this is like the diary of a madman
it's like you're just like linking all these things this circle represents the kingdom of order this circle represents the dragon of chaos between it is masculine and female truth belief energies
that's
i don't fucking love logic and reason is that these are the like but these are like those hotel means where it's like sex sex spirituality energy and
like you people fucking but they're writing books and other claims that he is defending the enlightenment tradition with this shit he keeps saying that the cultural marxists are undermining the enlightenment and this is what this is what he is calling the enlightenment is this insane gibberish from his ed about
about the chaotic female i don't know if he does a good argument a he has no idea what these philosophical schools and he's constantly referring to you actually are who was part of them what they what they represent of the enlightenment ways i've never studied modern european history you only watch youtube the enlightenment
a time when all of the guise of europe are old friends george washington
francis epic bacon all them got together and they said why don't we have in a exchange of free speech and logic called you to which has been around for three hundred years well what it was what the enlightenment was worth people using logic and reason and an observable reality to challenge an unjust hierarchy
the society of order and saying that this does this shouldn't exist and been answered by know it's always been and god has ordained it and now this guy under the guise of that enlightenment because it is such a penetrating and powerful idea that has persisted in the west for the since its inception he's going to use that term to
defend that same fucking hierarchy is just replaced hobbes is divine constituency to god king with a surfeit sucking its own dick
i just for our own
this part sheriff to nathan robinson who did a great take down peterson recently and this week and current affairs this is amazing though in in pearson's first book he includes an epic graph that is a letter to his father and a risk going to read this year
i don't know dad but i think i have discovered something that no one else has any idea about it i'm not sure i can do it justice it's scope is so broad okay you know how often you jerk off with your right here and what if you put it
brown
sap i sat on my end and it was like i didn't know it it was like he was a stranger
it was chaos
because it's scope is so broad that i can see only parts of it clearly at one time and it is an exceedingly difficult to sit down comprehensively in writing
anyways i'm glad you and mom are doing well thank you for doing my income tax return
cut taxes are easy you professor bitch
i didn't used to give a shit about this guy now i'm now going to the rules for you you have to keep you don't do online baking it's easier than any time in human history to keep track of your expenses poco feelings
i was ever i would i read his letter to his dad like a struck me as sort of like a miniaturized version of the eight thousand pages now scarred novel or it's just a letter to my father such a poor man's now sky
it's gerd know is gerd his book about cleaning his room that's just one book in a fifty fifty volume entry about his first twelve years on that letter honestly sounded like an excerpt from confederacy of dance
riley shit i'm on the edge of something mother and father have on the edge of something i can't even comprehend it
i keep talking about the roles i want to still a do i want to go through these that
euro okay these are these are these are german peterson's twelve new rules to fight the chaos fight fight the cast which he has said his female he is telling his legion of it so dark fans that women are terrifying other the must be tamed
that's a good reason home boy it's not a fucking graph that he made with human shit on the side of a wall you can tell from lipstick
so i you need to put your finger on of the g spot play the legacy
in chaos a triple digit order then you say that that like he's he's representing the feminine represents like the dark bottomless abyss of chaos and men represent the light and reason and order and you would say well that's a fairly misogynist like pseudo philosophical drivel and then i think he would say he would point out that know
you misunderstand me i'm saying we need order
the valley the thoughts about the synthesis of either
these that say synthesize the cow fight the cat sometimes the hardest fight that fucking marcus lapan guy he know how to fight the chaos i keep delaying this here the twelve rules rule number one stand up straight with your shoulders back okay choose you could you can you do you remember this and can you explain this one okay for one thing
the role model he wants you to emulate when you stand up straight with your shoulders back is literally lobsters yeah
this is the famous his famous that they don't have they don't all paul bunyan or don't
but they don't stand out your though you're being pedantic they don't have any would man and i actually book marked a
an excerpt and my dog eared copy of the book here
where he talks about the lobsters and i can just read to you what he said yes please share okay lobsters have more in common with you than you might think particularly when you are feeling crabby ha ha
now though
hi matt
the light and of all love
lobsters live on the ocean floor so england you they need a home base down there arrange within which they hung for pray and scavenge around for straight edible bits and pieces and whatever rains down from the continual chaos of carnage and death far above hurdles apartment ago
if they want they want someone to secure where the hunting and gathering is good they want to home so this this this is the basement when iran was fucking be heard
to play video games and the carnage of mom and dad upstairs stuff order and chaos and biting into hey when ordering last fight each other
what we going on and spend weekends with order
i'm a genius because you know what they call lobster cages
bedrooms
why do they will listen this can present a problem since there are many lobsters what if two of them occupy the same territory at the bottom of the ocean at the same time and both want to live there what if there are hundreds of lobsters all trying to make a living and raise a family live in the snow on crowded path
spite of
cartoons
sponge bob bob goes to work every day
in clocks out other creatures have this problem too when songbirds come north in the spring for example they engage in ferocious territorial disputes the songs they sing so peaceful and beautiful the human ears are siren calls and cries of domination a brilliantly music i burn is a small warrior proclaiming his
sovereignty i'm so sick of these birds that only thing about bitches and whoa
so listen what happens next in the book is that he tells this story about how what he was a kid he got a tape recorder and he made a recording of the songbird and then he played it back to the sod bird the cyber attacks

okay
so that he that he brings it back around now runs in lobsters are very different lobsters do not fly sing or person trees long occasional added mother
has a seizure we we have to censor the sky
dangerous
more important than the first amendment we've got to stop this book from the era and friends have feathers not hard shells rans can't breathe underwater and or sell
and they are seldom served with butter however they are also similar in important ways both are obsessed with status position for example like a great many creatures the norwegians zoologist and comparative psychologist and i can't say this guy's name this and ask guard yeah
now is got to every man man or is now had already on this girl can else guard said back in nineteen twenty one even common barnyard chickens establish a pecking order listen the determination of who is who the chicken world has important implications for each individual birds survival particularly in times of scarcity the birds that always have prior
you to access to whatever food is sprinkled out in the yard in the morning are the celebrity chickens after them come the second stringers the eggers on and the wannabes than the third rate chickens have their turn and so on down to the bedraggled partially feathered and badly packed riches who occupy the lowest untouchable stratum of the
chicken hierarchy those guys are such man i was the lobsters go what the fuck okay what he's doing here is he's implying he's having a stroke he isn't hair
i'll never forget when chaos on mother stopped me from testing runs breathing underwater this is this is postmodern yeah ok what he's doing here with with all the lobster and chicken shit is what he's doing is he saying in nature there are these fairly ruthless hierarchies
govern who passes on their genes and is sorted out largely through violence and domination and things like that and he's extrapolating from that that essentially that is the natural way of things and a human society
you should be like the victorious lobster because he the lobster gets physically bigger and struts about when he is clear it is that all lobster warren for this kind of a downer have a point but like is low stratum of chicken society he literally calls untouchables yeah which are like literally a cast yeah people in india who severely
oh they have coming mcgarry they got out packed i traveled and partially either
even if you want to pick fucking birds there is just a new study out about how ravens survive through a very complicated system of cooperation rewards base reward system based of cooperating with one of his man we shouldn't even have to talk about the fucking birds really you know yeah
because heard you have been his age because are social animals that fucking give the power of speech and a creative civilization but again like this works because it's true and a very banal sense that you know all animal species homo sapiens are you know they they are governed by these like nasty and irrational darker him
impulses and we sort ourselves into these packing orders and human nature however the fallacy is that like that that's because it exists that it's good and human human civilization or society is in ultra ball is that its own habitable an inevitable
and again of course you could do the opposite and pick out any number of animal behavior is that are completely alien from human beings and be like oh we should emulate that as well yeah we should be like bonobos and just stick our dicks and each other hastens whatever we have a commitment
okay so that's basically the point he's making about lobsters is that as you gotta talk about it off
to have alpha pile of presented on and say your space on the ocean floor and is somebody please back a recording and face attack that the locker and but he was when he's saying stand up straight with your shoulders back he means like you know as a young man like that
more defeated you are psychologically you will reflect that physically and sort of like closure your body language up and sort of hunched over and if you just sort of projected more physical confident she would feel more confident just the other thing see that's true yeah and that's a perfect example of his whole deal he hasn't actually useful if kind of obvious piece of advice
vice for you know your slumped over basement dweller that might not even thought about posture before this and the he smuggled into it a bunch of insane social darwinism
at the same time with the form
you do like a version of the virgin in chad be like a bunch of been seen circles
rather have a mother chaos
okay the chat is order rule number two
treat yourself like you would someone you are responsible for helping okay i mean that's just nice
you know a good attitude to have now the health care
this is like the guys who like who like they turned thirty five and they're like oh my god i did thirty two hits of acid
when you're nice to people don't be nice to you
i got it was like god was talking to me i mean the thing is he's he is a psychologist so he doesn't do therapy with people so you know half of what he says it's just really basic ways for people not to hate themselves and hate their lives and he's just like let me just
he smiled racism in the rule number three make friends with people who want the best for you
literally your friends that kind of is a defining care yeah
i will only befriend people who want to see me die
you know my toes keeps me ready whenever he owns a friend if a person i keep my circle small your only with a few laugh with men
thought for jack i wanna see the peterson versus a mere in america
i don't make friends with any yards or for my friends my wife fit enough friends with myself
there's a there's an anecdote he tells in here
that part about it how he like
childhood friend of his came over to his house and he brought a friend of his i heard of yeah
he says it was his friend i really remember he was spaced he was bait he was stoned out of his gourd his head and are nice hot me up on goof balls
did not easily occupy the same universe
and then he just goes on about how pissed off he was this guy was in his apartment and then he takes his friend aside and says you need to leave and take this useless bastard with your something like that so this is his attitude towards friendship no no starters in my house
okay remember for compare yourself with who you were yesterday not with someone else is today that sort of like he he's getting into this eat pray love it will know i mean i think i'm honestly that's fine i mean it's fine to see like don't beat yourself up by comparing yourself to others but he he is he's spins that
out into this extreme individualism right the not only should do not compare yourself to others you should cut yourself off from others you should you know
elevate yourself a bow others like the first chow eyes on i can why would young white men who have been conditioned to think that because they know a lot of things about star wars and are good at video games are the natural rulers of the earth why will they would appreciate someone telling them that they should cultivate a delusional sense of superiority
that doesn't have to come an unseemly contact with other humans that might this abuse them have it again this rule here is just like very basic like boring
you know race advice however i can imagine where he's going to go with this is extrapolating it to the political sphere which is like i think i've read him say things like you know socialism is not about loving the poor it's about hating the rich and that like it's this idea that it's envy it makes people advocate for a more just society or
or more adequate distribution of resources yeah he's constantly saying like don't blame capitalism don't blame society all the you know what should you even blame frozen away
he has yeah and of blades
it's like okay capitalism isn't the problem to then fill the space of wall okay how come everything sucks so bad with well a bunch of a bunch of french postmodern us got together and change the content of disney movie
yeah reflection of like the most kind of foundational neo conservative neoliberal idea that there is no society as margaret thatcher put it like he's calling on you not to even consider yourself as belonging to a community where you're a lobster on the bottom i think i think you made
the absolute correct observation here is that he's critiquing sort of activists in people who want to change the world gets into rule number six i'm going to skip ahead once i want to talk about it he says set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
the point you get exactly right he's like
don't criticize capitalism and don't criticize injustice criticize on cartoons that aren't as good as they used to be like that really is when he's enters the new or across tits or so that the say your house in perfect order before you criticize of the world again there's like a half truth there that i think is applicable or even a okay criticism of the left
maybe start your own shit out for each i take all the problems of the world but when he says set your house in perfect order and then when he will say that of course people are always in perfect so the never try yeah so this is constantly receding horizon of things that you can't or shouldn't do and he says something about him where he said like the sixty
these a really bad because they just gave everyone the idea that like if he carried a placard like you should have something to say even though you've never been financially independent and you're only a student or whatever
that is like you know how much small business experience should i have to have before i can say the vietnam war was an atrocity earn it segregation is bad and should be confronted criticizing someone else is house isn't the only thing you can you can also help people set their house and or some people don't have the house
the only way he can think about it is we're in these autonomous fears and we can be critical of each other yeah that's all we can do we have built solidarity doesn't exist
okay i'm going back one rule now remember five is do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them
this is actually my favorite rule yeah you remember what that was about
i'm not a parent so i don't have a personal relationship to this ideal but how did lake
raise your kids
chapter where he fantasizes about beating up a small child at a playground oh yeah he has a story about how he was at a playground and there was that of adoption child who was causing his shenanigans and he had a fantasy of kicking the shit out of the kid and then thought i wish i could do that
and since i can't grow it
yeah i have the excerpt rate air he says i remember taking my daughter to the playground once when she was about to he was playing on the monkey bars hanging in midair a particularly provocative little monster of about the same age was standing above her on the theaters are she was a result i watched him move towards her our eyes locked
he slowly and deliberately step thought her hands with increasing force over and over as he stared me down
damn that's awful
an awesome what's wrong with that is she's in the space that he's supposed to art of the ocean floor that's it for he's been lobster you should i find this
they locked eyes and he's been staring down by a two year old
and he goes
he know exactly what he was doing up your his daddy dad oh that was his philosophy
blasphemy
also have a say what is it with his is like rockabilly flag this is a good two year old out have philosophy
only hit a ball control he had already concluded that adults were contemptible and that he could safely defy them again he isn't included anything you don't have thoughts
a three word
only two year old has done the calculation and like i think it's pretty safe that i could defy these adults around a very literal happen to me that's all i've weighed the consequences of his stepmother peterson have a discussion about the nature of myth
figures that looks at it because you're witnessing a great i because
he does
he already concluded that adults or contempt of on that he could safely defy that too bad that he was destined to become one that was the hopeless future yeah their children
that was the hopeless few sure his parents had saddled him with what to grow up into
give our give my childhood
you aged two zero old three there
she was great and salutary shock i picked him bodily off the playground structure and threw him thirty feet down the field
he just pointed this guess is fantasy which is totally normal court
no i didn't i know i didn't i just took my daughter somewhere else but it would have been better for him if i had
yeah
i was alone piece of shit who had no al contempt for humans until a stranger in a public park across a playground
then my life was great after that how many life stories include a violent inner interaction with an adult when you're a small child and then things just getting great a two year old was the dragon and peterson was similar korea and
a baby was also disrespectful and peter just uses
the press down on the soft spot
like a fucking
like a video game he was also conquering chaos he was about the size of a cooper just jumped out at the koreans of honor of discipline him out of his body
i had a playground remember about this chapters is a section called discipline and punish which is literally the name of yeah because that is better ah which i think he doesn't he probably doesn't even know that or he hates yeah he hates photo in derry to who he says are marxists and who he was essentially controlled the
the the we the whole world
proceeded after the nineteenth yeah that makes sense that makes sense
cabal of fresh postmodern theorists with a combined income of like a club sixty five thousand francs a year who wrote books most undergraduates don't even read when they get assigned just like you want to fuck it taught well as had a reason
what does a more plausible explanation for the course of matches through a screwdriver
the last thirty years the vagaries of global capitalism
the forces that control the production of everything that we consume and interact with or a handful of french ass holes going to some colleges that most people don't go to changing the content of disney films and turning us all into these horrible
made us this theory either like it comes from like these neo conservative think tanks
who blamed cultural marxists this is like the frank for a friend was very er and they said cultural marxists they meant jews but you know they had this whole conspiracy theory about how marxism got turned into identity politics which then took over the world jonathan chait believes this yes yeah among other people and peterson just add as this thing where he
turns marxism into post modernism even though most marxist will tell you they hate post modernism and people who i don't know a single person who calls himself a post modernist yeah but people who are into contemporary theory or often very antagonistic towards marxism yeah village on to reconcile them you might have been out of the academy thirty fucking years
get a marxist interpretation of anything
but the reason that this is even surface level plausible the people is because the neoliberal turn happen simultaneously with the liberation of minorities and women in the west and those two things one of them of coke the other one and so people can point to the problem and say well look what happened once
we got rid of these hierarchies as opposed to look what happened when you know
western capitals and one in to prolong crisis and it was restructured in a way that radically destroyed labour power and analyzed communities and the industrialized and and scattered everybody to the fuck and four wins and turned them into eternally precarious subjects who who's had no real economic security no ability to class on
long term security to their children
that is masked by the fact that well yeah but now there's more women and in movies and black people and will allow this is coming from people in the center the democratic party hillary clinton rewriting that history to the point that like you know that the black panther party was a think tank
they're turning the is very radical movements against racism for feminism for sexual liberation into just kind of
poor policy driven
democratic credit goals the black panther party is not think tank is a movie studio putting out some amazing films that were all very proud of right now
henry henry i want all this and every fucking june it works at pixar
all the carnivals argues they changed her name when they got ellis island
i would actually like now
the i'm sure the malaria and i sure it was really money really aids is frozen throes of is it is anyone seen frozen i am not seen frozen chris seen frozen okay what do you know of propaganda what what he hates about posts structural is
but he he hates it because it's sort of like a revisionist fairytale in that like the message the movies that like the princess doesn't need a prince
save her or become self actual eyes there something yeah there's no fucking song about how there is nothing outside the text and gender is constructed
that's a funny thing is that he's like yeah this is this is a departure from the classic tradition of these ancient folk tales but it's er hans christian andersen thing as much money
he knows this he gets so much shit just plain wrong yeah store cool facts sources citations i mean academically the guys it is a total charlatan yeah ok
sue rule number seven and rule number eight i was going to go through these pretty quickly i remember seven pursue what is meaningful not with his expedient what good luck out i rule number eight we've all we've all wrapped up that finding meaning thing that that out her rule number eight tell the truth or at least don't
lie
and again like i again these are just incredibly pompous ways of restating like incredibly bland boring yeah true isms okay number nine assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't that is something he does not exist
something i've never seen him do for contempt for anybody who has not same on board with this and as fuck and fans now in this thing where they think he's such a goddamn genius and i'm honestly convinced that's mostly because we don't teach humanities the kids anymore this is the first time that are encountering this stuff like i think that they i think a large percentage of his fans
i think he came up with others archetypes shit like they don't know the carl young is they don't even know joseph campbell so they think that he is just like i got i went my room for a while and when i came out i had these charts like that proud add capacity that have gotten idea
they don't realize that he's just for courage attaining this
this relatively
well trod the territory of frankly discredited psychological concept
rule never ten be precise in your speech now this is the role that mr peterson probably could use to bone on this is that like he has this will be precise in your speech but every time you're critical of anything he says his fans are like well you gotta watch you know
ten thousand and right there on a situation where you can legitimately that such a fucking genius that anybody who has a critique that they can't answer they assume well it's in there
one of the things he said because he has the whole corpus of knowledge so it's your responsibility if you're going to criticize him to engage all of it you're not you're not you're not qualified to talk about him unless you have absorbed his entire and you know what i'm sorry if it's transparent gibberish what kind of what of violence am i doing to myself to to to
subject myself to this video that was making the rounds the other day online of him summarizing a scene from pinocchio yeah and the scene was literally one minute long and you haven't two minutes some arousing well that's what i love about what did the mythic art type stuff because at the end of the day i think really what he's interested in his cartoons that said he loves talking about opportunity
he had reading mean these are his maps of meaning he's headed yeah that's all he is he has an idea of what a fairytale is that he thinks is is eternal and truthful
a logical unreasonable stock and he thinks anything that comport stewart is good and anything that goes away from it is bad and even that goes away from it is doing so because there's a political agenda that is not truly artistic the only way we truly artistic is to replicate the same fucking troops that have existed for thousands there's another video or he's just listing disney movies and it goes
brilliant a beast great they really nailed it
little mermaid mailed it lion king some problems but nailed it and one of them like the problem is he's grading them basically out how they conform to his idea of the fanatical fairytale motif so he's just the fuckin he's just a cannon yeah i can lose an awful
child who i would a head start with no second thought i'd had i agree on what leaders link
yeah he's like greg turkish origins character or onset of
he loves you
hercules surprisingly an underrated our bags of popcorn
chirac lots of great things in there for a here
okay this is greg speaking of cartoons he has he has to take on the simpsons
we've been added fine but i see here
there is a serious she was like
isn't as i as an eighth i care about the fucking simpson nathan robinson pick this corn colonel out of the ship pile so us to him again this is his take on the simpsons without interruption king of the bullies the
what
had i never really given it was voted the guy now i'm mad nelson is clearly a seventy runs below off kearney it afternoon jumbo are the israelis are all ships really lifted the nation out around me and parents now and socks or peterson there is only one reactionary respect his name is josh schwartz welder you will stop butchering his work okay here goes
without nelson king of the bullies the scored be overrun by the resentful touchy new houses the nurse assistant intellectual merchant princes soft chocolate garage german children
an infant io raf whigham months is a corrective so it's point there is a bullying the week is like that's like another k i wasn't getting a new works out white masculine serpent
so that's i think that all have those people was key children all have bad things about them
but the bad thing as being a sadist is nothing compared to being chocolate gorge
oh yeah oh how it is during barriers and feel about the real life real life child gorge in german child came dot com
the last two rolls hear these are these are actually to me the ones i'm most interested and i can't figure out what they mean remember eleven
do not bother children when they are skateboarding now this is a role that taken at face value our one hundred percent agree with
i think kids should be allowed to escape or whatever the fuck a white perform citizens arrest
on i
this isn't really rambling incoherent china and i lived for a while i lived in an apartment building and there was a fountain in front and kids would do grinds are was really annoying
my old man christmas
this is the chapter where he goes in all in on post modernism and i completely agree with i can remember where he was skateboarding at all sorry okay
so kids should be our area i think kids in more a little bit more freedom a little less supervision little bit more danger in everyday american life that's what i believe rule twelve is the final role and again one that on face value i agree with entirely pet a cat when you encounter one on the street get powerful i got allergies man
can't do what does he saying with this is he literally mean pet every cat
you know it's just stop and smell the roses cliches it's now can stop and smell the cat
know a sniff the cats ass
you see your friends you know take another issue to take some time start their toes
enjoy life
so those are the twelve roles and i guess just the to wrap it up here
i think you know i want to restate
the majority of the most salient fact about jordan peterson is how unbearably tedious years as a writer and a thinker however the reason for his success and the fact that like this again pseudo philosophical drivel is having such moments in our culture right now
because as you stated like the sort of i'm on a cultural and political liberalism has largely failed and for the young men that he's talking to
nobody in the over of like romano culture is talking to them or addressing them the only people who were talking to them is youtube yeah and he's talking to them through youtube and he's telling them a story that that makes sense or acknowledges some some truth that aren't being addressed or disk
aug elsewhere that they're not getting and i'm not saying that he's right but like he's like there's enough half truths and all of these things to lord the rest of it
rest of it ended and flattered prejudices that they already have it doesn't it challenges them and a superficial way in in that they should clean the room or do so in some push ups and start naming every four hours someone's paying attention right somebody wants to make sure that they're doing okay but but the deeper sense they're absolutely there he's absolutely flat
every lazy prejudice that they just got for like i want to go over there because it's not just liberalism that his failed but i think quite frankly the left has not done a good job or has failed in this regard for the most part telling a story that connects with the lives or make sense to most
people yeah and i think the stories being told it just doesn't have the cultural spotlight it doesn't have the outlet that there's really nobody doing it in a way that is accessible to people right
a cabin yeah i love tag producer gross topic by the way to yeah
so i was watching queer eye for the street the other night the new season which is a very good i'm loving it finally if people are loving it it's connecting with a lot of people and it occurred to me that the story that it's telling is what people take away from it is basically the same thing is what jordan peterson is offering is that you have these young men who either men of all ages reader ground too far into are somehow
i've jumped the track of like the society you suppose added dads were working three jobs and when we sleep three nights and because of the religious upbringing married the first person they met and have five kids and they have no sense of self identity or somebody who graduated wasn't able to find work or place and is like unable to struggle in their work life and you have
these people come in and crack open the door and show them away out of this like prison of they are constructed may illness in society
that's libertarian this way that that cast some kind of story about taking control of your life
having some kind of self respect and putting shape on this chaotic off off and literally like messy world cleaning their rooms and in this case it's these game and who are like showing their form of order in the chaos and it's a more liberal tory order again it's a cracking the open this door and showing them a way out of these prisons
and i just thought that it's such a positive mirror vs this kind of looking backwards
as you said like reactionary of embracing hierarchies thing instead of saying clean your room so that you may embrace the order of classic systems it's like living is cracking open the door and saying like the become a prince an ancient monitor that are like crack open the door and bow down to your agent
yeah yeah it out down there
yeah i just thought that it's funny that these two things are resonating at the same time because they're very much the same thing of like order and chaos and there is a place for like finding order because modern life is extra incredibly chaotic and can you can spiral out of control for no reason of your own doing in feel totally out of control your own life but
i would you say you know get a facial scrub and clean yourself up better and then maybe feel better instead of like embracing reactionary mindset of up your pinocchio and also there should be a sixth fab five who is the socialist bad vibe
the other thing is that you still is that as at the self help thing is good to give you a sense that you're in charge of your life but then you also need to have an understanding of why things are the way they are and how they could change and that is where socialism comes yeah and that's that's the only thing that's on examined in the show why said there should be a six
the part of it is helicopter ring in one hundred thousand dollar homemaker
that business with the help us need find these people's lives and it's it's really affecting like the other thing is that peterson does talk about he has a thing about like hug your dad or something save your desk save your dad saved every your i homeless that every one of these queer eye episodes has a moment where one of the guys turns to the subject was like
so i noticed you have a dad and the guy just starts balling
because they'd either they have not let anybody talk to them about how they relate to their parents or nobody has tried to just that like breaking connection there that there's like a paper thin wall of emotion between them and their even the concept of having a father is another point of resonance i thought so yeah i like there's a reason why these things you know resonate
with people or you know an emotional level and that's why i think i was thinking about what you're seeing that and i felt like you know when i was in my twenties or earlier like i felt like sort of an earlier more embarrassing stage in my life like christopher hitchens filled that role like guy who i love watching video clips of because i thought he was so smart and like i love seeing him
own paraphrase and own people and mice controlling his channel yeah he that he like someone who has a systemic critique even if he doesn't play right
i love is the idea of being so impressed by how smart and call it like this guy was and i think that's the way a lot of pearson's fans respond him because he's this like well bearer of like i mean kids room the sounds like he some is caught his dick
i can't i mean he is to me that's i have the hardest part getting is how he became a youtube celebrity sounding like that and crying all the time if you see me other you tube celebrities
yeah
it's weird or somebody else like just know those of good radio
they have them out there us
but not have shown are really good of us
oh and were were weeping muppets i just wanted as mario molina
fucked up that's the real me want to come back to the intellectual dark well
because i'm just thinking about buddy of mine who orders pharmaceutical drugs on the dark web and they come from just like guys who somehow get their hands on these chemicals and have fake moves of the actual pharmaceutical pills and just pack them in there and then manufacture their own bills sent
to you in the mail
and
that's just kind of what this book is really an inconvenient great way to get ready for your big cross country flight my makes me a card

okay job on track agenda action item number one little boys and girls it's your champ up for this week the introduction of the show
we're coming to you from l a where of course out here as the first leg of our west coast tour
and gotta be honest you folks are the top of this one if you were expecting this episode to be informative
or you know
really a good deed to die or insightful or anything like that is full it anyway
you know keep listening
it doesn't matter because we're here to have fun we're here to keep it loose as a goose and it doesn't matter anyway because literally just as i'm recording this i just received confirmation that john bolton is our do
her doesn't need to be confirmed i either how it on advise the wall within that or is probably telling trump as i say this to attack north korea and iran at the same time up they'll never see it coming
oh how are the are the episodes year old did while i was away
but there were a gamer great actually great yeah they to the one we don't really free at lucid have felt better than it has a long time ago it was it was almost like we didn't have a bunch of three quarter for water bottles hanging around her neck
that's really unbelievable
it's a person's home is their castle and you take one rent boy
the sanctity of your castle
you have violated the sake of the stern
well i yeah the last laugh because i reported shoes for doc sing
that's been banned from twitter
finally get him outta here
i can only wonder what he's doing a ganymede right now
i i mean i don't think it's time for us to old like petty resentments
he things like huge and not in the board
we'll see what had been up since we got here to l a
fill you in on the details were we were doing a little this
that's true
loan to clean and area we were having to room as race
okay yesterday i had my first ever i'll walk into a store front the gold drug buying it was so cool now
that's not really illegal drug use if he's just go to bodega and buy heroin from the guy behind the counter and that doesn't make it legal even if he has a cards manner
we'd it over the counter of a bodega like on some like wink wink i'll have the ice tea please
but this was like an actual we'd start this is the fall california weed store oh yeah it was deck
it was glorious
treats and eats through heart's content it was so oddly sterile the stores very professional they take your d when you walk in the marijuana plants are arranged by type and potency
there's a magnifying glasses you can see to observe the crystals on them and the only really you know the weed cultural thing there are these framed posters of like counterculture relics like going to our crumb dropped just on one bear wall yeah it was very well
weird seeing this kind of thing rican texture realized in a commercial setting
like here hello this is the drug store here is the drug culture that goes with it it seemed wrong
oprah it's like a t g i fridays approach run out of bullets every every place gets like a couple of old hippie bullshit to put on the wall i appreciate the novelty of it both practical matter they should just sell it at wall greens absolutely
i do like somebody told me that the thing that has all the magnifying glasses examine the nerves brother lives for tourists because they are so enamored of this experience
go on a store really want to have done is done i went in there was looking through all gone
i've ever seen we get it and
they really should sell a wall greens along with heroin
oh boy it's all weapons that sort of thing we're agora us now
going to the weed store
well this is a is it good news pegged to to our shared experience here apparently jeff sessions or attorney general probably maybe in an attempt to keep his job is now officially said he is considering the find the death penalty to certain drug dealing really
god bless him
that the toddlers bray that our president has where there's all this drug problem
execute the dealers
you have to execute of the way they diabetes movie so you have to throw them off of buildings are fences or something or electrocute them by kicking them into a substation you can do a regular execution they have to be dropped from a helicopter into a volcano
just sort of angry at the plagiarism i mean talks you can pay once a year ago
is the new dennis leary i'm just yeah that's the worst
oh man and the other funny thing that was going on today
you know this i will apologise for again
we did last weekend's episode with the one who showed up in the one who violated virgil home
tim threaded you know
for that is keeping can animal abuser he's been kicked off twitter
fucking jordan peterson is just still at it
even better
i can just put it pretty bad yeah we wouldn't have to talk about what didn't i tell you guys do you were right to keep going even worse off relevant with overs hilarious
he's is such a funny person now it like every time move like that guys like their search and elevator whoever people we've made fun of before i was sort of a crisis of conscience like in talking about giving them the attention they so desperately want even if it's to be made fun of so viciously are we in fact contributing to their sir
raising their quotient
but at the other hand they're just too funny now yeah i'll talk about a very funny and german peterson just weeping openly
you while you file paul trying to vote by the literally the day after the episode came out jordan peterson had like five or meltdown online because of a negative review of him in the new york review of books
in which he was you know you could hear it years as he was taping it and he threatened to slap play the critic
don't want the tears fall you will still dark the out
this is the guy who
his response to being accused of being a fascist is to threaten political violence on somebody is is how do you say i'm a fascist i will beat you up i'll slap you silly i'll gladly good with physical combat and i've basically of fascism is do will go behind the c and i'll fucking work here
your ass bitch
we are not doing your and vigorous dan quinn yeah we got to build
edit that are built our mind palace enough yet we're taking the listeners on a journey
i'm always try to slam it here
clay around peterson
so essentially the import of of this entire meltdown was peterson misreading the phrase romanticizing the noble savage yeah which he took in context to mean you're you're fucking you're indian us because he emerges
he is he claims to be inducted into this indian tribe
he has intimate relationship with indian communities that he basically defines that kind of experience as romancing the noble savage which is a thing of this column a lot of fascist ideology of sort of fetish icing and also other ring
what is perceived to be like a pre civilization pure human like when a brief stalls photos of of the tribe yeah of other side messiahs i
that that's that's what it then continuing continuing on with this again that the clip of him just crying
now my new favorite picture is just the him with the tears welling up in his eyes
at the idea at his idea he is he's just thinking about his conception of the individual and that's what made him cry it is the exact equivalent of when steven seagal was brought to tears by the screenplay he wrote it's the same thing this video like originally wanted to come out it was a blog there was of his blogs oh before it was
or he was his the guy was during his ascent because he started off he got his initial
audience through through flogging through you tubes and this is the stuff that got him his original profile we need more of this weeping
i mean we've been kermit who apparently thinks that the sum total of all male relationships as a result of violence and that you have to be able to like imagine yourself beating up anyone who you meet and you have to be able to resolve to violence offenders enter any like disagreement they can otherwise be solved you have to always been
willing to do violence will and is other thing is if you're dealing with a woman had better that whole equation is out of why i use violence against their
his his fixation files for a guy who's like eighty pounds eighty pound done nods voice quavering nerd a use a geek well manny pack yeah i was pretty small maybe john peterson has a similar explosion of athleticism and the triangle defend he's just a bag of skin what what is intimidating about him and he's always say minds
yes out but he's always claim he is going to be physically he's arguing i oh i will come to you what i will slap you sir he means with logic i mean have you ever seen professor charles xavier lose if i get out
they based peterson and the reason or another bit
today about are putting brained what i mean again and just now consider the fact that this man is being advised by one of the greatest lunatics
one of the most war mad cool
those who is maybe it is our lack pill death worship or so this is this is charlie kirk interviewing donald trump
about the issue of like campus free speech and this is hilarious because charlie kirk's entire existence is based around this idea that conservatives are being persecuted college campuses it's why is turning point usa is given god knows how much money have god knows where so kirk asks him he gets the interview the big boy himself
set this thing up on a t and a knock it out of the and he he says the trump it's harder than ever to espouse support of your presidency in the ideas you're fighting for so thank you for what you're doing to give us the courage of our convictions to fight against political correctness but what advice do you have for young patriots and conservatives on campus that support your agenda
that are being ridiculed and silence because of administrators that are clamping down on free speech
big the beach ball on a key here
is going to just queue up and he's going to a nice he's a big old clothing they be like
fifteen different me he's giving you they step on one quoted to fifteen me he's using trump that puzzle that they give to people whose brains got home by these were just three big pieces
come on you can do it make the train so
burritos response i can you see the fatal flaw
the harley's question here yeah man it sure is hard to be a supporter of you had public a lot of people really don't like you yell at people when they say they like
you might as well be like president trump every time i go on campus people are saying that you couldn't have had cheryl tiegs and eighty one
you've been the fake friend anna wintour
so your ears trumps response
i'm just imagining charlie's like big smile just shrinking as this goes on and on so he says i think the numbers are much different than people think i think we have a lot of support if they have one campus or two campuses and we know what they are in it gets all the publicity we have campuses where you have the vast majority of people that are perhaps like many of the people
all in this room you could call it conservative you call whatever you want but there are people that want free speech if you look at what's going on with free speech with the super left with anti far with all of these characters i'll tell you what they get a lot of publicity but you go to the real campuses you go over the country you've got to the middle west you can even go out to the coast in many
cases we have tremendous support i would say we have majority the words
overalls university the cowboy boots technical college and then it did here he just says i think it's highly overblown highly below
pizza
no offense but the entire burden of your life is complete just from said that charge down your gullet annihilate fucking farm
charlie i actually think there's literally no reason for you to be on you have no purpose in your entire issue is hysterical gibberish and the funny part about this though is that trumps same the issue of free speech on campus and conservatives being persecuted by our of control pc left yeah culture he said it is highly over
blown and been fucking that teeth jonathan chait had an adult down today of being like oh so you agree with donald trump tower
this is an issue is that i agree with it
some obama or he says like all the killer i think girl campus
is for a dog barked all point of view
i know about barack obama actually got mad at overland when they got rid of dog general be inappropriate him
okay
so what you have the strange loving and madman
surely just portland
as part of his interview he should trump he won't start any more wars so okay i'm sure he'll he'll take up about five seconds to get around that one but disappeared you know this would be a good time to check in touch base with
the white house and the trump cabinet
the executive branch because you know there's been some some turn over for some of the jobs
maybe you listen to felix and derek
over the life and career of
living turkey want
i hate seeing regular say oh but i love watch him leave
is a big booty with no sodas and as a fucking huge hug yeah as a legit the caspian sea of oil and that bitch
rex pillars in as a type of ass where you wake up in miami in a guy's air and be where he spent his whole tax refund on it crowded to go up for the joke
go up on twitter
apparently fired on the toilet
and then i think the the ongoing theme here is no matter who you are it's trump fires and embarrasses and humiliates you and you leave your white house job in disgrace you immediately become a good person
and this was the the cancer of the wrecks to listen was i think best summed up by the guy who is like imagine your rex stoner said you were running one of the greatest companies in the world a statesman a businessman respected now fired while taking a shit
a good it's like that's good you will you only spent the majority of your life beating back climate change research bribing corrupt officials being part of the military industrial complex and pipeline occupation complex
ruining the environment making hundreds of millions of dollars
overseeing people from the global south dying on your rig
and
heavy having have deflated clown
punching bowling pin type thing for a knack
that was sam stein right yeah yeah who also had a great one to that was
it's not acceptable to make fun of dawn juniors divorce
that's safe side
that guy is ted way i for i don't even care if i get ratio
i'm using bullshit and crises
seconds and of course we have to have decorum and rules about what's acceptable to talk about at who is acceptable the time i'm sorry but i'm talking about it because he cheated on her with a chick from danny kaye which i was
i mean you've told me before that's your favorite group as their own rail for you as a surprise surprise breaking news here man had to explain to me to the fuck aubrey o'day and cane or i know that you guys don't remember making the band i never watch regular with a little reality show these little pockets of your pop culture knowledge and surprising when we come across as
just some things that good seared nearby there was a show where puff daddy was the host and he recruited a bunch of people together to make a girl bab and what it was a boy bad but once he was a grub
it was basically reality show about turning them into an actual act from just a bunch of people who are edition will lead singer was this woman aubrey o'day who then was part of the bad that the show created called danny became and i believe now she is the solo artist its as a solo artist that she had a song on her album from twenty
fourteen was titled d j t it was all about how i was a little love with you but you keep me a secret and you hired me why is that i like outages everyone in the trump world is just so bad at code
they were doing pizza gate they would just be like do you have any of those not children on the way they even though even even the gamal is just like average is going to put your initial on a whole body
like dogs
who got that email hey would you like to have some russian people over to talk rationally about scolded rush secrets that goes if it's what i think it is i love it
some of the greatest journalism i've seen in my lifetime
steel which found an instagram post all got that woman's feed them around the time they were said she was sleeping with mary downey jr and it was just a picture of of of a couple of feet and the caption with something like he's keeping my feet safe onions
oh and
this author this this would word or time
cross reference those feed the man's feed with a picture of don juniors fee as out irrefutable on i think the same tootsie the guy who wrote that article probably his entire life he's like
have this crippling foot fetish like the only way i can get off that relationships whole part because sexual problems or it i can't control myself and summer like edges i have to run home to jack off when i see women in a row notes and such a curse why can't just be normal and then he these emerge he does the greatest story of all time
you know using his imperfections as a weapon god bless you sir it's amazing if there's ever a journalism or in chrysalis his name
when a lifetime achievement
now are you telling me that vanessa trump i mean again high turnover in the administration had turned over in the trunk family need somebody to vanessa trump did like a karen from goodfellas the shit again she said that she then there's something about some gas of article that says that she called her with her kids on the line
i told her to get your own goddamn
but as a day is this mistake diddy
yeah man
added
danny kaye mr deity
but
we should we should make fun of it because it's hilarious
and that was that was a line proffered by many that
who is that other idiot noah noah scout and at bear know that man from danger room or wherever the fuck he writes for its dangers oh david the taser southern it okay
he was like there's one thing i just think about the children or like years to really revealing of character it's like you to laugh at some has divorce and it's just like what so that their kids are going to have to live in two incredibly big garish houses
did they won't have the full time attentive parenting of donald trump junior it's a true the dom his son of donald trump won't be there all the tide to show it to show them in for wars video die
so much the prospects of their lives read so much better by the less time hang around ah junior i know i do think the kids are off limits so because in a in a just perfect society they would be taken by the state shorn of their last name and educated by bob of aiken
and they don't have that privilege i think we shouldn't work towards a society where that would happen where we brainwash the children of really educate educated not actually educate for the first time the kids there's brainwashed there's nothing funny about a woman from reality t v and odd fucking be extremely
gummy son
dom president now and may writing a song about it that like thirty people listen to spotify didn't this
there's nothing that you think it's funny the donald trump is going to show up in court wearing his keep calm and jive on sure when they say that he can't he can't take them wolf hunting in alaska and we can use it that's funny
jr is going to cry during the during the chives st patrick's day celebration next year yeah oh the funny thing about don jr is you know you look at the trump kids and you think was a dumb when it's gonna be airfare
what the actual like habsburg
oh no eric's the minimally competent one on the dumb one who is who is very transparently desperate for his father's of black hole in he never gets it and i really think that that interview with charlie kirk came about by a don judy her
just pissed trump off at this college glad she just walked out of game is gave a dirty
da junior think his dad for a retreat
think about that
that's usually the people who do that who are like know
tweet like by donald trump tree to tree twelve fifteen like those are usually just the most lonely
the polio vaccine dread whose families don't with this
his first born disorders like oh
to by real daughter that you that you youtube teenager who something acts jeff tutorials yeah the tutorials has been retreated more but a town
yeah like like a the first the fed squad has been returned
a junior get on the real alpha shit guess what my dad asked me for me for this is a happy story though the nasa if you follow her twitter feed she's live in her best line
they're all these mega guys in the thread though there are like you think you're going to get it man that ever get you think you're going to get a gummy guy you are you ever did
that was really funny i think you're ever going to get a guy who gets stuck at a chinese finger trap with his brother at thanksgiving
i don't think she's i think she's going to live with larry david
a hunch
was one of those weird things i mean one thing we all agree we said before the children are off limits
want to be clear like their third just the children are off limits on to play off your are off limits on just going to name them all right now real quick donald trump the third kind madison trove chloe sophia trump trusted me lo stroke
spencer frederick trump like the idea that interested me los and spencer frederick maybe because of this diverse won't get to shoot the last living african white rhino with their father and then take pictures by its carcasses either
it's sad and if you laugh at that i mean it's like you're revealing that you're a bad person yeah how would you dare wish that upon interest in trouble
yeah trinket isabel and all the other kids like it's tough dude in my parents separated and honestly i'm still dealing with it
so that's knowing that there's a tryst and trump in the world has taken something out of me right now i just met you've often compared donald trump to napoleon the third yeah i was a little there is donald trump the thorough
this bruise yeah actually you don't done jr is on like some private thread on the locked sub form of one of his hunting message boards like it's like the the hunters lounge sub form relationships
a bunch of other guys really like she's a gold digger do just i don't or it's like a are fifteen terry is going to happen to me to sometimes i just go fucking crazy
the pattern or we're seeing here like whether we're talking about tiller or don jr is that like everyone in interest orbit who are all equally evil people if not more so
great thing about trapeze he's the only one that can really fuck over and get under the skin around other monsters asshole like the f b i guy mccabe all ethnic fired him right with his pension
my own
and the people who were like worried about hit like every up the guy who gets fired is going to do with all f b i guys do which is write a book called like courage and dignity and my struggle vs muslims in special education classes get like seven figure book deal but
yeah they were doing go find me
that the other like does it going north carolina g o p officer in there are like this brave patriot we have to make sure it gets the
the cave was just let him have left going to seal around the world right after this congressional hearing and now what happened is that in addition to whatever ago fund means going on
oh wisconsin democrat hired him to his security staff for his office for a week so that he would be qualified for his ball with all manner of just any type of teenager holding an unidentified box is within one
and he mccabe is going to maybe accidentally hit three civilians
the i was not pervert no one's perfect but we just or see us gas and their weeks
but like best of luck have fun with that other guy that's a trump st mccabe right now
yes so as soon as like anyone comes into orbit and then
swat it and spins out of it while the in crashes and burns they all become now she said
ritual where they're being inducted into the brotherhood of decent society again and that their sympathetic the other isn't even done one of the most revolting people alive yeah like he's always going through a divorce so we can't it's not funny to laugh at i think i think it's an article of faith that people are made are rendered
sympathetic by following like that because the alternative is that there is no redemption
like there's no hope of recapitulate in society
like the fractures that we have can never be mended if we can't forgive well he reminds me of this reminds me of like the sort of robert e lee rehabilitation and shit the things people do with rommel about you know actually didn't like hitler
great general are like
it's this weird thing where i know it wasn't he sucked yeah that's why he said that's why he was in north africa yeah it's like oh this guy's the greatest baseball player of all time he plays for a double a farm team but it's is i think there is this very good human impulse to want to redeem people and that acknowledges many things are horrible and degrading and pain
we acknowledge of war is the worst thing that can happen but because we're so hierarchical and or mindset we don't go well maybe like for the average soldier it was awful
nazi germany is terrible like with the more is awful and like we we did our own war crimes and dresden in like we should avoid ever having a war but because we're so deeply hierarchical were like actually the head guy was pretty cool
it's the same thing here where it's like you can have is very really impulse words like
modern life is very painful people are barely very alienated everyone is watching all the time everyone sees your your you fall it sucks
deeply admires time but instead of looking at that for like the average person it's just like well not like the head guys there's still people the guy above me he's still still guy because we also this boot liquor thing cooked and i mean the fall of one of course is only part of the story fall of one
rise of another so for instance tillotson out of the state department in make pumping out here my pump hail coming over from the cia if my pump hail
a religious fanatic
lunatic i get another guy who believes that like we're at war with islam yeah like not not countries that are at war with islam the religion good luck with that thing a billion plus adherence for what it wasn't of their greatest that from my compare it doesn't really he's all those guys though is screeches and squats about
about a are you are you condemning this moderate islam whatever there's a tenner
sort of like global sophisticated version of what about black on black crime yeah yeah he's at the state department a john paulson is the national security
oh god or jesus christ and then when he's out at the cia
who will now add she will have to face a confirmation guess is what's your name gina haskell gina haskell
and again sinner haskell sorry for your has seen a hassle
similar to the dungeon your thing or the sympathy that's engender for these rotten people when they flame mountain spectacular ways because of their own hubris and let's be honest voluntary involvement with donald trump an industry it's not even like they quit out of honor literally wanted to serve until donald trump is like sorry you lose goodbye so similar
gina
there are certain a lot of people in thailand but now she is being now held up as the country and you know hey this is the first ever woman cia director yeah
like the line was sort of surprising
the certain quarters he talk about breaking glass ceilings are suspiciously silent now yeah and it's like this person literally was running the cia torture site in thailand where they were like drowning people and doing christ knows what else and again and then of course the
censor that is what it was legal at the time and was she was ordered to do it now they are trotting out there she was following or alison events and they're like you know she did her job with the he served competently and the best thing she good and it's just like
if you did that and continue on in this career like you have no fucking soul knowledge as a husk of a person with like he's been scooped out completely and just hollowed out by yeah bye bye
he redeemable war crimes yeah i will give credit with virgin asshole thing like a lot of cores that we expected to be like well you know while it's the first woman like the lives they were like now
when some women are evil
i'll read this the people were doing that were more like the nuts at boot liquor types will justify anyone doing torture but it is interesting like people who it's the same thing that happened under bush you know when a republican is in there are things like torture things like the murder of civilians or surveillance it suddenly become
it stops being a pragmatic necessity and a you stop congratulating the breaking glass ceilings they do see that it's right and wrong they just happened to excuse it when it's a democrat in there obviously with trumpets worse you know they're killing more civilians
there's probably more or going on but
i think a lot of the reason that was just specific to obama and the decisions that he made when he came into office because bush
supercharged the national security state to a level that we had never ever seen before and obama faced a critical decision am i going to continue with this or am i going to take active measures to draw down and restore some state of normalcy that perhaps would resemble the clinton years when the military budget was actually
falling and he made his choice and the people who were never with him fell in line behind it in the hassle thing also reminded me like the perfect day
representation of this mindset
that nicholas kristof tweet where he references the fact that like the cia agents who worked at this black say they had to water board someone like seventy times in a row were like crying and they were all my guys like you know what he you say that's not a sign of weakness said it's nine hundred and yeah and it just like how they felt bad about what they were doing so a huge years
if they were laughing and being gleeful say this that would that would that would be disturbing but the fact that they're like
do this
well they basically have an idea that yes there should be a taboo against torture and things like that but you also have
philosophical do to our fellow man to if there is a dangerous enough situation and there's something we're the only way to get information about it as torture if we have to be able to choose to do wrong in the greater service of preventing a terror attack so it should be issued feel like us transgression and feeling like it
transgression that means it's being regulated basically by your conscience and it will be brought back in the line if you don't care if you just step out of that line without any kind of concern than you'll just do it over and over again it is the fact that they feel bad about it that's going to keep them and resistant from doing it again unless they really really have to either simpler explanation they were crying
they're week
weak people and cowards crying is toxic masculinity i'm just going to say right now last time i cry about a abuse data
other guy
so yeah i got gina and at the
wonderful institution my palm pay oh the car dealership owner who wears pull over wind breaker and aviators at all time calls waitresses read and smoke show
look like one of those guys look like a suburban like hands the sex
yeah i think i have faced the hand faced
suburban middle class has really taken over the white house
the whole executive so that's that's that's fine policy
you know everything overseas yeah more closer closer to home we've got my main man c n b c's money fucking monster hundred k a week snow fucking
yeah
calvin paid in full larry kudlow few pieces to wait
wasn't economic advisor they're presented his hand of the national national economic council the head economic is why the so in one of the economic equivalent of the at us so is it is advise her in one ear as he said his bolton like attack iran and north korea together will everyone else also be distracted and will be too
total commitment death
all commitment or the other aerial you've got kudlow who is literally thinks the only thing that can help the economy you just cutting taxes
it believes all recessions are caused by not cutting taxes
and breaker
right up until the day the stock market crash out in two thousand and eight it was like never mortgages
folks yeah yeah
among the most adult lunatics like a total fanatic
man who lives in cloud cuckoo land i can't we a total supply side hardest media i can't wait till kudlow puts the white house as a escrow for a credit default swap
just like the president she wins it
my my main man is going to take over this year because larry kudlow like all coke addict sort of gambles it away
kudlow he's good at brigham much you'd like cocaine guy energy to the whole where he's going to just be walking around sniffing talking about how he's going to start a restaurant this year
donald trump's like i just had a great meeting with my economic advisor he said i'm a beautiful person whom he loves and that we could really actually start a record label we're going to start importing denim from japan he has all these wonderful ideas he for some reason pulled bear an aside and told him he's the smartest person who knows
it was great
to for hours talking about the economy and all the movies you've seen recently
it's going to be one of those big stupid meetings a trump as if the cameras there but it's going to be kudlow wearing an open bathrobe playing jesse's girl for everybody
what troubles like no he's right let's do lyrics i thought
he's right about these albums you to want to listen to this is the order they tell you that you can sit up
i like about kudlow is because of his truly heroic cocaine habit he does have that sort of like preserve that kind of yeah yeah that sheen kind of the are no moisture know it is there at all it's just like a his lips any more he's a lap yeah it's a good look i told totally
he is actually i think going to shake things up more than anything because up until now the truman administration
didn't have that that edge will also don't like drinkers you know or t totally was even worse a downers ministry like it's all people who take three be because they think will get give them better sleep and drink like for michelob ultra it's because they're being healthy now and then just like di maria barter romo i want to marry
are you with you so perfect
literally fell asleep on my father was my elbow darling a normal so pleased to meet you good supercharged this with of fucking uppers yes norton
massive rows of go it's like a fucking first baseline worth of yet larry larry
larry kudlow is going to be taking adidas least size rails and he's just get it
the last thirty minutes of good fellow for the rest of the administration the only upper other day
like like larry kudlow mr hutton love that helicopter is marine one of course it is following
we needed those executive orders thought
nothing except that the only the only other uppers user in the administration has probably whole picks picks is probably like every other ambitious yards
like an adder all probably really boring
up your place not like what larry kudlow is into into the real shitty i hope he does it so that you can stay up on like cleaning your house or just entering numbers in a spreadsheet or something away
jesse spanner did yeah
saved by the
coco you need the god like euphoria to go along with the manic energy that that is alec baldwin and malice shit
i can't wait till the next two years of the drug administration they're going to be like it's going to be the boost with james
james woods can actually be there for this one will not only that there is a good chance if he keeps treating james with will end up in the trunk administration oh yeah facet yeah because like now it's like he there's some other there's some other fox news host these bring into department of veterans affairs it's just people he sees on t v that he wants to around killing israel people who he sees on t v
that he likes and who say good things about him and not only that this is funny feeling this
alan fucking dershowitz has been on fox news every night for the fly high know
i didn't break and it's legal illegal illegal children
oh no this is all around
he just his name was on those fight like that's all along with donald trump more
no clue and
guys be a dude so dershowitz has been on fox news like auditioning for the role of like white house legal counsel like the john dean roll by saying that like i just quit
dershowitz has been on tv saying like you know trump has every reason to fryer more any be totally justified in doing it and might i know i'll defend him the mad for it just like i did for oj costs von bulow got down or whatever his name was he just the resigned as had council for the rush this investigation because he can't dishonor hymns is often
i know he's at the way out bring the dish and i love it there
you get off the bench i love oh yeah dershowitz is he was respected his lawyer for a bit now lunches know it was a good lawyer yes
not as
officer of the court thank you
but he now you just like for the past few years he goes and fox news and he's like it's interesting that people accused of racism when actually if you think about it that way moeller is being racist against president
like now the man is now in the position the only person in the world who could make ready player one reality he could just take people off of television and bring them into his room he is literally surrounded himself with other figures of pop culture he likes the master he's laying message from yeah
know box
l that goes in i urge cabinet meeting guys and engineering seventy two this year big big year for me yeah
if that's that's the celery
they're all there's new there are some new faces in class some transfer students but there is a few people that it was just started lake
been been children been doing doing nothing wrong of under the radar no drama nicky nicky haley's the one
the no drama had a slight snag this my personal favorite ben carson who housing and urban development and he's just been sort of like laying low and just hopping of occasionally dismantling the entire just
yeah exactly this basically an apartment he overseas and just servicing occasionally a say things like we don't want public housing to be tonight that we don't want people to like living there
they should be a spy
yeah of the ground everyone's mad enough to kill you
cause pain in the puddle
just enough for you okay
those those are the most hard working reporters people who get the actual quotes about how it out of curse and because they're really thirty one hours of tapes surrounding that were always like a jazz boats percent seven hundred talents of gold mines but you know
always have my doubts and that was probably a hundred six
very difficult to operate a conveyor belt in this time but they had the technology
he popped up this week because a thirty one thousand dollar table whoops that was purchased on on uncle sam's i know a lot of people criticized me with the table but thirty one thousand that's actually the number of for skins day
the stands and if you think it's too much
disagreeing with scripture not
humans
i think
everyone can have a dining table we all have been a big dinner party will all your friends with everyone you never know who died they they can come up and ask you a question and we can take some jewish traditions or we had the and they can find it give them a hundred dollars and that's when it's thirty one thousand dollars and thank you
but what what i do like about carson's i have a good over good singer here
a sixteen thousand dollar dinner table who made it judy chicago
oh
yeah
amazon gift card
a day goes them virgil this
added amazon gift cards
that's really funny
they want you to chicago everybody to for a delightful treat after this episode gets bad at the show
oh that's that's a joke
so are here for
vertical everybody clean comedy consultant
will the punch lines of the ben carson story is that he blamed his wife up
you said shopping as she wet book people of this observation he use the the women be shopping
congressional testimony
there's that but again
who who cares about the table let them let them by the nice table who gives a shit i mean it seems like seems like the real the climax that we're all i know higher mall or hoping for dearly for is him finally just firing robert
all that will be the apotheosis of twitter and the internet we've talked about it before but like at this point why wouldn't he
okay
that asshole jeff fuck yeah i was like on twitter and he was he was like i beg you sir like do not do not fire rubber and create a constitutional crisis like the congress will use remedy known as impeachment rover know they won't serve a gigantic a he he should know he must know by now
pelicans in congress are not going to allow him to be impeach know they're not going to have any that's a used car dealer in their district will beat them in a primary by saying he voted to open the way that big sweaty boy a at the actual nazi he just republican and the illinois
what yup when the entire rest of the country is like this can't get any lower illinois is like on a bat
jay pritzker purse wrong or who almost lost you pants lipinski
liver and you're your at your are your elections in politics want do you think do you think that he would be impeached by the republicans in if he fired me loud yeah
i mean it's safe to say because flake was the only one to come up and make it very explicit like way if he does this yeah i will vote to impeach it right
it's up for reelection right and the real question is paid your bill obvious answer originate in the house and requires two thirds for that are such just a simple majority i think i think it's a simple majority two thirds of a sudden i mean india in what universe does if if paul ryan is a speaker of the house does he allow that to happen
what university do enough fable republicans
allow a discharge motion
this happened before they actually actually patient most i think is a privilege motion so i think the democrats could just you know
their own impeachment which they did earlier this year and they got like eighty democratic votes on that something like that so you would need the entire democratic is plus what forty republicans i don't see that adding are happening it's possible but i don't see that
one thing i think one of two things one is the actually do go through impeachment
and they joined the have you no shame at long last her crowd or we get the final break from of between republicans and the dc consensus beltway reality op ed page bullshit that never actually fucking matters that has absolutely no impact on
people's lives and no reflection of what the majority well in this country think yeah and is that break happens that her hobbies are like we don't need you you've always hated us fuck you fuck everyone who believes we are principles it doesn't fucking matter we have a massive base of of wanting swine always vote there was no our wider
we have we are doing the bidding of the ruling class are way better than the democratic way bigger bang for your both were always going to have so much money to run elections so we don't give a shit
absolute lately i forgot
cannot something but i forgot the other addition he brought in tv fox news letter guy joseph degenerate who's another boat detail like fisher
and other hand
now mr president when you got that pig
to the friendship but the other shit you can pound that shit all day
surrounding himself with the best oh yeah but come on
the other thing is if he fires mueller i think it would actually
move the numbers a little bit in the night of the overly critical i don't think they could do it i don't think you would be decisive is i think it's already been decided but i think it would be recognized that the voters are now
connected to trump more than the republican party here but that's only like thirty thirty four percent of the people who are black people as the people who win primaries period for republican yeah i'm sorry i'm talking about the general election but i would say that what's going to discipline them is the knowledge that they have to get nominated first before they get real
oh sure right
going to kowtow to that feeling oh i'm thinking if there's any practical consequences it's not impeachment it's the democrats winning an even larger majority yeah this election it's true
how many people really are going to change their vote based on a mall or firing don't know i mean i only assume you just in energy fact they're like just come together to how is how he the intensity of likely you to say had a republic i mean already like why something on the level of ten percent or so of
voters are moving over to the democratic column but i don't you know because of mahler shit that's not families and bullshit i didn't follow through on his promises i'm saying that's already happened and that
these aren't the these are the old just take whatever these are the more lightweight suburbia
the tax abortion thai people who just had a reversion to hillary clinton and did not particularly like trump her fall for all the nonsense
i'm wondering if that number becomes twenty percent if mueller as a beach or meal is removed while i think we're going to find out either way
because he's going to have his horseradish stirred up by these guys in his ear kudlow else
fucking gag to the brains of like a
you guys got white chalk hand prints all over his face the speaking in a dead language i mean how does that make it a driving over the edge next week
you know i've done a lot of growing in this administration and i've made up with the noise
with the it is the new hugs
i've i've actually been given a list of names and the dan quinn universe i'm hiring all the jets the water
it was
oh yeah
when we realize bolt was coming in today we just started reading this defunct twitter account by think is a railroad name's it's all the names in the dan quinn universe dan quinn all these are real people by the way i even talks about the quinn in a while so could give a brief a reminder for me bollywood owed very simple dan quinn is a
mid forty's former notre dame college football player who says he was set up and expelled because he made the play the most legendary play in college history
college football history by lou holtz calls lucifer lou the says looks like hitler and conspired to ruin his life and then after years of doing math and fighting amateur boxing matches he discovered that when you take the natural sure and replacement steve yeah and blended in water removes the toxic pollutants soap cancer it can also be used as a cocaine substitute furthermore
if he smokes blunts dusted with stevie a he is both impossible to knock out and has blazing fast hands speed dan quinn asserts that he is a black boy trapped in in his words
he is in tone to for lou holtz lou holtz have you ever seen a white boy advance like this
claims that one time he was just running around a track at a high school and several school children cheer them on in an old man new trucks idea he was the fastest thing he had ever seen he also claims to have invented a pussy
the violin where he can give women triple digit orgasms sometimes because little to be hospitalized it doesn't know i furthermore he has interior said that he would like to be reincarnated as muhammad ali as an honor to them
he's already dead
well this is oh okay
the thing about dan quinn is he makes his videos towards a lot of people who makes them towards like joe rogan or dana white but the supporting characters and dan quinn universe they are very strange names and lives and you think this guy being nuts it's like no one could be named up but he look it up their real guys it just he bends reality to cry
a world of stupid name's it's around and i wonder why we're so obsessed with the sky
yeah these are the same power that we have these are all these are all the supporting characters from the quinn vs
yeah clean universe on the amateur
which has waited since two thousand and fifteen i think you just go mad studying these ancient but rick
sheik
dr craig to sure
billy
sheds the wallet
your calorie version
scott toggle
grumpy grumpy of the northern jordanians
keep in mind that like as felix said these videos are often address to these people who have all in the trade him in somewhere
he made it there is a biker that he was taken in by who good ago i was called crazy job but then they obviously had a falling out and then beta video called crazy jones folly
i kind of an artist right like that's kind of art
if i wrote a novel that was
my for our friend frenzy jay said today
if donald trump reaction to job biden a beat him up is to say crazy jones fall
okay continuing gym or trans
matt josh
christian print up
rip up my cards and his brother keith
dave ernie
tara chow which is actually not a real person there was so incantation dan
jumbo galloway
rick virgo not a great one ronnie lott and mike stone breaker
so for a closed fonzie oh that's a real guy yeah as a defensive coordinator for the vikings have the ninety ross the clifton colony the most beautiful fucking dog in the world
don bunch
dave hobo
pete
which maryland doctor her bakers bark brand and from tequila sunrise tree the sample crazy joe shadow iraq
sexy hot three sixty nine data five thousand and nancy stake hymns bond look through a tube spawn i'm not
ross perot now murray the liberal blip it got lou holtz red river team by be diego sanchez paul harry go paul rick cheek
wow
for any of you still listening
and i was that was the full dan quinn universe you there are more yeah you mention in the middle of the joke about sieges joke about crazy joe's following that isn't anything today where joe biden said that if he had been in a locker room as a young man and heard another young man in the locker room talking about
i'm in the way down
does he would have had some problems he would have checked him physically uranus caught those hands if joe biden said you know if did donald trump if you went away without doing a check in with me you have to move very careful very carefully indeed
and then trump did the epic clock back or he literally said if joe biden for me now i would lay his ass out like a you've been a fucking nightmare oh my god of her heard it would just get worse and worse for you oh my god
message board five
look like a hundred years old
really the most pathetic thing the warlord people have said donald you have basically black and okay i have always said i'm a black trapped in white skin okay if i could smoke my plants that are laced with steve year i would perform a legal kill on
that's not doing that
perform a legal kill on this other dan quinn is obsessed with the concept of illegal kill and a gauge like if you kill somebody in a fight it's legal and if it's on indian soil
came up with this idea he was like i got an idea for diego sanchez and bad boy which is and emma may apparel company to make a lot of money how about a cool jacket to only fighters can wear
now too expensive but one hundred dollars and if you square up it makes the shape of the bad boy logo so people know that if you're wearing it there's going off the fighter so the judge that you kill the guy is though you were wearing the jacket
yeah i'll by idea that is a trump idea
because like a special murder jacket but
now these are both ancient men donald trump is probably never even like shelled my what it will be like a rake falling i a bag
it's just they have not just one of them as a pony old bag and the other one is this suit sack else yeah he's like hey joe biden he's like i was an athlete i was a star you know division three baseball player black back before they didn't let like anyone but sort of scrawny irish guys pay to play baseball
lol knock you out
joe biden are doing the equivalent of doing serious as eating anything other than potatoes that's not true job by then he went twelve rounds against the notre dame logo
against the i think i be
the bengals the other foot the other really funny thing about the joe biden calling out term for is toxic masculinity is like he did it right after he gave a woman a massage and and yeah you know because like joe biden was a hands
albright went and either press conference and only if you're going to touch a woman let's keep it above the bell joe biden one into that press conference looked at every woman or ordinance like where's my how get any way down to about fucking knocking loud dude well the thing
where's my hunger bug
asked to do that he has because he has decided he's running
and he said that his tactics going to be he's going to be the sensible centrists alternative to this crazy sanders ask left islam is going to be the one who doesn't blame the rich and it's good to the middle class because he thinks that people were grateful i think israel has he doesn't think he's credible on the left which she isn't and i guess he recognizes that but so since he can't offer any robust criticism of the status
well they get excite voters he has to get people who hate trump riled some other way and all that's left is empty bluster and threats of violence just to look like you really hate him even though you don't really have an agenda virgil what was the tweet
one guy oh oh my god okay
this is doctor eugene to empty joe biden saying he would take trump behind the gym and beat the hell out of him is completely inappropriate and encourages violence among males
i just love the ideas of kids play just the choking each other out because they got riot by these grandpa the job by rumble jill parted so fucking cool down are like him
i think that doctor goo a surgeon scientists hoping to cure heart and kidney diseases and babies would know a thing or two about masculine aggression
it was the joke
original air it's like who can forget the uptick in violence after grumpy old men came back
really good and the man that would suck if like you were going in for like an appointment
a heart problem and you're like going to look at my doctor
i thought was
that's the first time goes by the satellite is blocked by real donald trump which is it's an indication of how the internet poisons your rain it's a self inflicted mental oh yeah don't don't be like this guy be like this guy could have cured a heart and kidney diseases and babies by now instead he just post crap like that all day
yep be like i don't even attempt to cure a child
her heart know i could if i wanted to not gonna do
yeah what do you think we'd be doing if we didn't have a line brain poison oak i know so that i would have come up with a cool jacket ideas so we've we've oh no no no i'm curious about this i like to think i would be an archivist oh you work at the internet way back machine the older wouldn't be an internet where he backlog there's no internet
i would be the book away back fishing i think i would have been like a special type of green beret
i believe on the weekends to star in pornographic movies with the sand
what about you man
if you didn't have internet brain poisoning oh god what would your life be
i would obviously be ignatius riley yeah you would be buried and tomes and trying to write my own sort of my own grand thesis
in a basement somewhere as the thing that making of hotdog water that book is so dated because that guy today would have a ten thousand dollar month patchy on a youtube channel or a blogs wearing a clown mask about that
dr psycho
that's what i'm saying is that i would have the same compulsions but i will have a more of worth had a stuffy and awkward way to express of through book rather than me
my brain on the internet oh i'd also be really into miniatures you will get more one saw guy who on call violence all could move i think i would have probably been like a lawyer in finance
not be but now it's really sad
your honor i want to fuck
oh no that's i respond to minor inconveniences that way because of the internet i think i was pretty lake level headed nice child before the internet
my mom can knock on the show and sammy i gotta say if i definitely would have read more than five books in the last two years as for sure
i yeah but yeah but you know who moved my cheese and twelve rules for
those are two important book oh i also would have invented the board game ticket to ride
it's a truism
board games as well as german board games
oh all man you already have something as exciting as board games but it's made by germans to and
oh well what about you
this is called real actuary calm but it's funny because they are like
i mean you know what what
i would have been a successful will get other
so that's a vision of things it could have been and up until now we've been discussing a a rather dark vision politics
i mean we're keeping it real with you folks we're not going to sure
six
however i do you want to talk about a different vision a different vision of politics and if only we could allow our hearts the dream of perhaps these problems wouldn't seem so bad perhaps you could roll our sleeves up and fix the problems bigger problem solvers in this country album solvers caucus activate i'm talking of course about east coast was swamped with
a snowstorm and today
when you know it republican jeff
democrat cory booker spent the afternoon snowballing each other
and i don't mind getting and others malice while they were figuratively
i have to
go now
i play it over these random road started way later than we planned on are you being serious i know i have to have dinner at that requirement that you would run this
listen i wonder if only there to know he's making deals i'm not i'm not making the i'm just having dinner with my buddy from mm main journalism are you doing god damn

mr have been regular normal online for calling in and letting us know how normal he is okay is only ever having a good one it's amazing he broke richard nixon's record for the most consecutive days i think a very good day always good to hear from a move
and shakers and the actually laughing right now henry
just coming back to the gym
there are jews there was some something of that richard nixon getting epilepsy by accident
he he has he ever heard of him tell you what a load that's way
he he will yield the no child is because agenda is when children
a clapped pops is sitting over there
tentacles goddamn this thing have ever seen i've been fighting gets these people my entire life they won't just show me the tentacles so moving on from one corner the media is the other i think vince
well end up this week in such a perfect constellation that i think it would be a good idea
she should have a deep dive into friend of the show and editor in chief of the atlantic magazine jeffrey gold
a jeffrey the great helmsman of of mainstream liberal thought yeah the west or east coast in general and you know what is going to be people accused of being a negative segment but i do want to say goldberg he's an impressive guy he went from being in the w w e to being the
editor of the top magazine an orthodontist waiting room said
so never never let anyone tell you what you can and can't do that's what i got was jeffrey had an amazingly busy week lot of ups and downs lotta ins and outs mod but i want to begin with his interview with the new saudi crown prince muhammad bin salmond
another front of the show
now you'll remember when we covered thomas friedman's
sit down throw job with the crown prince in the pages of the new york times i think jeffrey goldberg has topped if you'll allow that phrase even thomas friedman and just how sloppy he can get to this beautiful new prints are precious boy goldberg and talk about big boy in the early kevin was there that
we will probably why they got kevin fired because they're like know too many big boys in one place we will get this kevin saga a moment i visited a very epic i did see a picture of m b s
in his jeans and he is a large you know
they like six five and sick
out of size fifty levi's yeah
he the other thing about that picture it was probably the most disastrous part of the saudi pr push the be as heroin reveal all my
my hairline it's receiving a little bit it's going to be fine i'm doing natural holistic treatments it's going to be backed out where it's supposed to be right in the middle of my eyebrows but cavity will cavity williamson whoops sorry wow good solomon which is the
he as soon as the english version and and that's why i got mixed up his hairline looks like chicken wire
his hairline looks like you need to take a hacksaw to it and go over the top
as you discovered your hairline is currently just than enough to not be able to do corn rows for comedy gags and spoofs be as so you know to all the people who say like oh you'll never know what it's like to have like us or something
actually i do i can't get corner of my hair's is within this is why we're gonna do go fun me for hair plugs so that fields can do cultural appropriation we weren't we weren't getting quarter rose just to have may have corners it was for a video about will little corner
but now i want to get hair plugs that are permanently corner rows just i didn't i small just staple than there so
the crown prince is doing his charm offensive america right now it's part of his big this huge pr push that we've been talking about an issue for a while now all the way back when we talked about saudi vision twenty thirty is bold new plan to reform the kingdom and make it a little bit friendlier que
important allies in the west namely america or rather the american media civic and stop covering the country like it's a you know
totalitarian theocracy that did nine eleven
hello dad doing a genocide right now yeah and are also doing a genocide right now they put out an entire magazine in supermarket shelves across the country that we as a national enquirer i think public yeah it was fifteen dollars and somebody took a picture of it i think it was nebraska or something can you imagine some fucking corn oscar
he's got his mountain dew and his and his mega size doritos that he's waiting for the checkout yeah we know trump country and he sees this picture he sees this thing like wow this guy looks like he's really going to reform the middle east i better take a look i wish i could bet you money on how many trump idiots bought it i bet it's no less than two thousand
oh yeah because cigars and i would think about how i felt that are i think about how many people shot their career eggs or just did whatever idiotic thing like when into starbucks and said her name was the constitution
they probably saw that it was like oh he's nice to trump yeah he's the guy who's going to get rid of all the terrorists because he put trumps fat face on the side of the bill i think what's important now in addition to doing a circular and every supermarket in america the real the real goal here for m b s
the go to guy is jeffrey goldberg if you want a he's the plug if he's the plug he is the plugs so like the one of the most prestigious flagships of the liberal media and is also a committed partisan to the whatever the israeli conflict does or thinks so
dominant partner so that the idea that we don't want to reform saudi arabia and its leaders is very important at a time in which the united states and particularly israel has to tow the line on this rotten country because we all have the same enemies in the middle east and jeffrey goldberg is perhaps one of the most reliable conduits for
for that particular one of thinking be it from the american or israeli intelligence community is this is what this guy existed you it's why he's the editor in chief of the atlantic which i think we'll get into later so let's let's let's begin in this interview here the headline is saudi crown prince iran supreme leader makes hitler look good
you make hitler look good as the beside to give love a bad name
well received the interview begins this much at least can be said for muhammad bin salmond the reformist crown prince of saudi arabia he has made all the right and among those who would celebrate his and are the leaders of isis al qaeda hezbollah and hamas four year olds in the value of quash as well as yemen's
rebels and all of them to sway over the entire clerical and military cigarette models who just want to be left alone
and it says here it goes on he says our conversation took place in prince colleagues living room beneath the painting depicting the nineteen forty five meeting between for president franklin roosevelt and king abdul us has it been south the founder of modern saudi arabia was d j lead shout out to that reference to adam curtis and
film bitter lake which takes its title from that very meeting in the suez canal between roosevelt and the founder of the house of sound and beginning of a beautiful a beautiful relationship that is really blossomed into so many wonderful things in the modern world the collaboration between the postwar united states empire and
fanatical theocratic oil rich saudi arabia has been awesome for lots of fun franchises all over the world you've probably visited their locations and afghanistan the caucasus region
anywhere they just you know they're like when a doctor gets really into franchising subways now that the interview begins where he tees up a nice big easy softball for and b s by saying could you start by talking about islam and the role you think it should play in the world gives him a chance to say islam is a religion
peace
and then go on to say
our duty is to spread the word of god but we also believe in freedom as well but then he says now today and the triangle of evil and goldberg says the triangle of evoke an m b s's yes i will explain in a moment in this triangle they are trying to promote the idea that our duty as muslims is to reestablish the caliph aid to reestablish the
mindset of the caliph it that the glory of islam is in building an empire by force but god didn't ask us to do this and the prophet muhammad did not ask us to do this so he's talking about how fate mindset and he wants to reassure of the readers that saudi arabia and islam the modern version of it does not seek to establish a caliph it by
source
goldberg says about the triangle and yes says first in the triangle we have the iranian regime that wants to spread their extremist ideology their extremist ideology they believe they spread it the he didn't he mom will come back again and he will rule the world from iran and spread islam even to america
like yeah you know all the things that were accused of doing actually it's a ran it's doing it and it's the she
and he's bringing up our good friend the hidden mom everyone take a trick
because you know that the people who actually did try to establish calif it by force very recently
might have remembered hearing about that they really definitely were in favor of all of the she ideas they were very she from when they were they were worshipping fire doing all the bad things that they do i like that
you know they're not accomplish iran his goals on any geopolitical aim they just have to collect the dragon balls
get there one wish to bring ayatollah khamenei back so the first part of the triangle is iran the second part is the muslim brotherhood and the third part where are the terrorists which are al qaeda isis and everyone who believes in calif eight months later
i'm confused
i think it will reveal itself as the interview like the molly it's like in advent calendar
oh week we guards area oh god yeah
oh we get the biggest piece of chocolate it's the mahdi now goldberg is of course a serious journalists you know he's not going to use this opportunity to talk to this young prince not pressing one some hard tough issues
per crown prince salman kinda cause she's six ninety of the n word and bloody as jeffery he says isn't it true though that after nineteen seventy nine but before nine hundred and seventy nine is well the more conservative factions in saudi arabia were taking oil money and using it to export more intolerant extremist version of islam will hardest ideology
be understood as a kind of companion ideology to muslim brotherhood thinking and b s responds first of all this will have his i'm pleased to find it for us we're not familiar with it we don't know about it
define the word please
do you use it in a sense
goldberg says what do you mean you don't know about it
the says what is what hobbies and goldberg says you're the crown prince of saudi arabia you know what will have isn't this them and yes says no one can define this wow of it's like neo liberalism
you know people use for you know that is an old line that is an old line thing that will hobbies is or and then it's not a real thing and they're just normal islam which is pretty cool i mean if the guy started my religion got kicked out of his village for so many women to death i'd probably be like yeah who's that bitch i don't know when
when you're when your main she finds your second phone when your main family finds your second secret family
hobbies and you'd that second family doesn't have to be secret that we talking about will have islam or marco rubio folks marco rubio allegedly so he presses it hobbies i'm an m b s's no one can define will have isn't there is no will have risen we don't believe we have wow
we believe we haven't limit we don't have the thing that we don't know what it is yeah we don't know what it is but we don't have it to define it even if we did have it we believe we have in saudi arabia sunni and shiite we believe we have within sunni islam for schools of thought and then he goes on to talk about those schools of thought and give it a sort of filibuster this long
meandering answer about all the different schools of thought in sunni islam you've got a
and then goldberg gas but what you know he's pressing him here you know this is real journalism today i'm a journalists he says what about the funding of extremists and yes says when you talk about funding before nineteen seventy nine you were talking about the cold war you had communism spreading everywhere threatening the united states and europe and also us egypt had turned
that time into that sort of regime we worked with whomever would get we could use to get rid of communism among those is the muslim brotherhood we finance them in saudi arabia and the united states of america finance them true very true wait does he go on to say they stopped doing it after seventy nine know he well in the cold war they were doing it
and then after the cold war
that's like when they when it became its most coordinated that's kicked it do a his ears and seventy nine after this year the grand mosque
after they were like we could take over to about men and send them overseas the proxy wars and accomplish even more goals
because we have more money now that will holy shit that was the cold war when we had to the fee communism as
yes tells you we
the america funded the muslim brotherhood to this is making a lot of sense to me and this is the first time anyone has be able to explain middle eastern politics to me i'm sorry if i was i was talking to those other girls were and i didn't know you're like me like that
for nineteen seventy nine
so they have a little back and forth but these the funding of extremism and goldberg gets a chance to say this line i spent a lot of time in pakistan and afghanistan in the late nineteen nineties and early two thousands banks jeff wow
you take any interest in cab rides other jeff
about a you angling for an internship
you have a global perspective
my my summer abroad was the most wonderful experience my life so they go back and forth of this and then goldberg says you think you'll ever be friendly with qatar again
as it has to happen one day we hope they learn fast it depends on them
so here's what it gets really good goldberg says it gets to the heart of what goldberg really believes in and wants to get out of this scenario he says you speak extraordinarily bluntly about iran and its ideology you've even equated the supreme leader to hitler what makes him a hitler hitler is the worst thing
you don't want to hitler dude
ib says i believe the iranian supreme leader makes hitler look good
goldberg really hitler didn't want to do with the supreme leader is trying to do hitler tried to conquer europe this is bad goldberg says yes very bad hoping
oh but what does he say that he says hitler tried to conquer europe but what around of you is worse than that but what is as a that iran is your as it is it he doesn't say they want to make the a oh no
in the triangle remember the triangle
right right right
that's why phil jackson and the manager
no to he does sec goldberg says yes very bad an m b s's but the supreme leader is trying to conquer the world
he's trying to counter the world's done a pretty shitty job he believes he owns the world they are both evil guys he is the hitler of the middle east in the nineteen twenties and thirties no one saw hitler is a danger only i including his family who receives him warmly in a close relations with yeah
have heirlooms that hitler gave them that they bought but
so could be nice turned to take over the world mean he's dead a commie and am sorry
i know the supreme leader over i just woke up they should have more than two letters differentiating the learn name oh yeah well that's what makes them worse than hitler yeah well actually the thing you know he was as bad as hitler because is hitler and himmler and they did that to confuse people who was like rabbits season and duck season maybe khomeini's and really dead baby i'm right about that dragon ball
what they're going to bring him back to life when they collect the body balls around is trying to take over the world and we have to stop them before they do just like him doing a very shitty job yeah control like one point five percent of the world have a military budget that the fractional so
the instructional to just look at a map of the nation of iran and persia over the last thousand years to see how many times it's expanded his border
they were really close to taking over the world during the peloponnesian war was young and the first one harvests the spartans stop them
okay so he says here
we want to avoid war and goldberg says is the problem in your mind religious and i b s's as i told you the shiites are living normally in saudi arabia we had our internet
have it and more i wake up i make my key i get bulldoze the job i internal security agents and it has no problem with kids like you said they're living very normal yeah as dollars no shiites no problem so he goes on
he filibusters again very long very long answer on what obama thought about iran vs trump he basically says they both believe that iran is a problem but they are different approaches to see he avoids criticizing obama goldberg said then that ass speaking of painful decisions are you making the situation in yeah
worse through military actions that are causing humanitarian catastrophes there is a lot of justified criticism of your bombing campaigns that is a really artfully worded question and it does bring to mind the freezing and that the new york times or other outlets will use to describe what's currently happening and gaza right now where it's just
like some critics might be saying that your of war is something that they might consider genocidal or the new york times this is a real headline from today
sporadic rifle fire from the israeli side of the gaza border made clear that the palestinian protests could elicit the sort of response that killed twenty people
so going on and b s's answer to this is first of all we have to go back to real evidence real data i'm not a read the rest and be as just scrolling through screens minority report style and half those greens are just instagram models and he's throwing arts and commenting like i love you you're so beautiful home here
the other side of the screen just google like how to pretend something doesn't exist wealth rob
many of us to leave fox dot com masthead and so yeah he let some skate on the idea that he's marina nice entire he and genocide in yemen
and then you know is now much more in the center he gets some to say that israel has a right to exist in saudi arabia has no problem with jewish people either
and that prompted david frum to say that m b s is now officially better on judaism and israel than jeremy carbon is right
as the head of the country where if you were jewish you're not allowed inside in and if you practice the religion openly you will be executed well he is right though i mean this is a better friend to israel and jeremy carbon that's true that's the thing that's all that matters when people when from and goldberg talk about being good do not talk about being good for jews are talking about
creating an environment where where jews are open in a society they're talking about supporting israel that's all that matters because the whole goal for all of these mother fuckers is to get all the jews in israel eventually and turned and just the steroids or nuclear power house down there every single do in israel for a huge part yeah that's the idea
well you know when to big boys get together you get a grip big belly full the truth
i don't care so has all this money to spend on propaganda but they still sell the tabloid they don't just give it away they sell it's because they're in america nothing if something's free it's worthless that is what we know that much about us to know how many fires have you've been given a new
they of thousand yeah we're i would have you followed up on probably the only the fire we are giving out to get a new host for the show gonna
i've got a filing cabinet full of them in one of these days when i get some free time going to go through now
imagine imagine they're like the smartest as they're just hanging out around convention centers selling the b
handing out the issue of now but it's classy and there's fun at the national arabia in it there's garcia
why it's murder money last word puzzle for before we get it the more jeff oh there there has been this in a molten month long posts where b will talk to whatever shitty liberal journalists whether it's goldberger friedman et cetera et cetera
the one thing he got that is worth more than a thousand of those combined
is the rock code sign you up he got code signed by dwayne the rock jobs johnson doing all rock johnson as he is now called it's a very bill maher joke with put it in the real time how about this why doesn't he just by the atlantic or any of these other publications and more than enough money to do it remember when people told us we should run a new site no one wants to get into that business
now you say for this propaganda
effort makes sense that they would sell this fifteen dollar glossy magazine
as counterpoint to that i will direct your gentlemen to the book that i have displayed on my bookshelf
jean paying the governance of china a book that includes many glossy photographs and a fairly high production value high quality given out for free by the government of china can you believe how benevolent here
yeah so i don't know who's doing better president gee baby has which may be the greenest world leader of our time
i am closer to conquering the entire world in iran or saudi arabia and also unlike saudi arabia iran deserves to conquer the world then the interview with m b s there was a good kick off to jeffries we put it wasn't even him just letting this asshole say iran wants to conquer the world with absolutely no push back whatsoever
not even close to being the most embarrassing thing that happened to jeffrey goldberg this week
the most embarrassing thing for sure was the hilarious implosion of the kevin dee williamson saga and his unceremonious canning from the atlantic almost as soon as that fucking
the merciless as we've been calling and that's not a this pronunciation people were saying oh man it looks like a hairy pussy the very smart joke you need a high cute q to understand a jesus christ
so jeffries role in the cavity williamson's is underrated because people have been largely focusing on cold stone steve austin the fan people's eyebrow
is the the el nino of big boys
if if focusing on kevin and and also the intolerant lives and the intolerant lives in weather kevin's a martyr or not but there was the real the real player here is jeffrey goldberg who made the decision to hire him to be a contributor to their new ideas section and when the controversy first started coming out party
luckily kevin's comments regarding that you know women who have gotten abortions deserve to be home hand sorry
jeffries response to that was in effect i don't agree with kevin but it's a tweet come on people it's a tweet you shouldn't judge people based on like a throwaway comment or whatever this was the same argument that brad stevens made and jeffrey was implying that you know again the rules are being too precious it's important to hear other
ideas even if you disagree with them and basically said kevin was talented but he was just trolling he was taking a a needlessly provocative position in an attempt to sort of older with her own lives and stir intellectual debate
are mostly on the lip yeah then it came out kevin williams had indeed said the exact same thing on a pod cast that was a bridge too far
and in jeffries response to it he seemed to say that a tweet is one thing but him saying the exact same thing in an audio version is too much and he said here
he did not want to judge people for their worst tweets are assertions in isolation
but then on thursday mr goldberg wrote in a memo to staff that he had come to see the writers or marks on twitter is something more than merely churlish the editor say the pod cast episode from the same month in was mr williamson elaborating on his anti abortion views the tweet was not merely an impulsive deacon textual realize he did the moment post as kevin had explained it mr goldberg rose for
furthermore the language used in the pod that was for allison with what he runs contrary to the atlantic's tradition of respectful well reasoned debate and to the values of our work just because he was sweating when tweet it it doesn't mean there was any heat in the moment
a quick aside here treated the moment
i'm reading for the new york times coverage of this but it has this little nugget hear that is just too good to pass up the pod cast in question was in national review show called mad dogs and englishman hosted by mr williamson and charles seat of you
the title of that pod cast is more offensive to me than kevin comments on capital punishment for women oh my god that that would be the name of mornings and crew show in the raj if it's still existed
oh my god yeah that's what god that opie and anthony would be called and victorian england just very upsetting
it's hilarious about brothers were is probably like a whiskey review corner or something oh god we have no knowledge in english all the was yeah yeah they drink is jane they're probably smoking really shitty cigars while doing it
given mess of lupus is thinking you have you actually part guess you find a more controversial opinion from kevin he walks back hanging the women and he says
they showed tie them to train tracks
in line with his he's a method method of doing things but what's funny about this is it reveals jeffrey goldberg is an absolute fraud because his hoy whole thing and trying to hire kevin in the first places like he's provocative were a liberal magazine but we're not afraid to challenge ourselves and have ideas from outside the bubble and
then when confronted with kevin's actual beliefs his defense immediately is he's just joking he doesn't really believe that and then he has to walk it back when it becomes obvious that yes indeed he does believe it so it's not about us look and respect someone like jeffrey goldberg has for conservative idea that's that's just it it's that the thing that needs to be
gotten away with completely is the idea that there are any ideas being discussed or were exchanged in any of these things i'm in the times op ed page at the atlantic there are no new ideas being transmitted no one is learning anything you are you are intentionally
riley up an audience for response it is just a click bait model of online publication brought to the mainstream that's all that it is it is totally vacuous that's and that's all that it exists to do that's true but like the other important thing about particularly about what the kevin saga tells us that
the current state of the liberal media is that they are at a crisis point in their crisis point the media
in their sort of self image and conception because the atlantic is a magazine owned by david bradley who is committed ideological neo conservative but souls in pitch to an audience entirely of cosmopolitan liberals new york times has sort of a similar dynamic of with it
the thing is what they are selling to their readership is the fantasy that they are smarter and more open minded than the bang idiotic hordes that are beneath the voters this is was that's the thing this is why it is most the most important qualification for kevin williams center brad stevens or any of these guys is that they're against trunk
here's the problem
these people had their only influence now is with liberals the conservative movement and actual body politic has completely pass them by there is no such thing as a you know anti trump conservative now not on the ground and on the actual going out with any actual influence over government or policy every single anti term conservative
has a column some more exactly there are probably like this is not an exaggeration i believe is my best guess i would say there are probably between five hundred and a thousand people in america who think trump is bad but the iraq war was good
so it all these people have counts and their own influence is with a liberal readership however
the the one more the abortion particularly still is the red line because lives can you know they they're happy entertain thoughts of foreign intervention or cutting social security or free markets however things like wanting to hang women for getting an abortion or just the right criminalization heard demonization of
abortion is still something that most people who read the atlantic rightly one nothing to do with not even nothing to do but like they don't think rightly that it's an idea or a thought that should be given serious treat me like feeling in the magazine that makes him a liberal pro choice exact well they're going to the record away that all this other contrary and islam does it
exactly and here's here's the thing though is like there's no more need for people like heaven dee williams and outside of these sort of you know hot houses like the national review or things that has pitched solely to ideological conservatives have a certain variety
what the fuck use does it have for the new york times of the atlantic the hire these people just a goose their liberal readership and to considering whether maybe we should criminalize abortion these people have no power they have no influence over policy or the conservative movement anymore so what does their value add to a place like the atlantic of and
it's flat in the audience it's to make them feel like yes that are more broad minded than either the looting swine who voted for trump or the anti far hordes of of elaborate leftists and but thing is they still laugh lines you know they still have a lot of things that are unacceptable there have to be because
anything that what the fuck are you you have to have some sort of container and so there has to be a line i think that's beyond the pale and yeah he fucking one across it be in his zeal for triggering lives congratulations you triggered the lips and they don't hire you know because you did it you you're to go to triggering the labs
go back to the national review this dynamic about conservative intellectuals i want to read a little bit from a post by henry feral from this week
that i think really does a very good job summarizing this settle who has any use for conservative intellectuals i want to refill a little bit he says
the conservative movement perceive the need for intellectuals both to hold their own fractious coalition together through fusion isn't in the like and to justify their goals the liberals who dominated the space of serious policy discussions and could possibly stop them liberal policy types for their part needed to understand that what was happening among conservatives and perhaps perhaps hopes to influence
a little the result was that the conservative intellectuals were in a highly advantageous structure or position serving as the primary link between two different spears which didn't otherwise come much into contact as network sociology one or one will tell you this allowed them a fair amount of arbitrage and enough slack that people like jonah goldberg were triggered a serious thank god
remember that
the problem is
saying like
the never trump people number they defected en masse thinking that it was a fairly cheap gesture of independence we all remember the never trump issue of the national yeah they they were born defective and they never stopped not only did this damage these intellectuals personal ties with the new administration and the conservative movement but it opened up the way for
conservatism that basically didn't give a fuck about policy ideas and the need to seem serious any more the result is that conservative intellectuals don't have all that much influence over conservatism anymore the problem is that without such influence over conservatives these intellectuals capital with liberals and the left is rapidly diminishing too conservative intellectuals don't have
much of an audience of that conservatism itself why should people in the opposite side listen to them anymore they're actual ideas are mostly not that strong some of them are good writers but good writing only go so far the only plausible case for paying attention to conservative intellectuals quite conservative intellectuals is that perhaps the pendulum will swing back
after trump and the old regime will be restored that might happen but you wouldn't want to be betting serious money on it and i think that gets it exactly right about this sort of panic that asshole
everyone who has invested so heavily in the idea that it's really important to engage with the thoughts of the other side are at a point now where they really can't continue this charade for much longer because conservatives never ever pretend to take seriously the ideas of of course roles are the left and if you're going to war with they ever ever
even conceive of hiring like a left wing voice to write for the national review or weekly standard and if you're going to pretend to care about the other side's ideas then the other side loves trump get some actual pro trump fucking conservatives get bill metro go to the one
there are zero pro trump columnists at a major mainstream like liberal audience thing so you only have these these ideological unix who have no influence and speak for know what i mean if you're really interested in representing the country get one of those freak ish positive trump reply guys get one of those children look
get well our kids you can't seem to watch their face or wear shirts that fit and just reply like and okay would have loved trump and stuff like that put them in there are no one cares no one knew yeah it's going to represent way more people than yes nightly whiplash or homer simpson in the landlord costume
the other people you're hiring but i think they should be noted that both david bradley and jeffrey goldberg are ideologically committed neoconservatives which means they're happy to fucking deal with social liberals and they don't mind it at all i don't care but they don't give a shit about it they the part that politics doesn't interest him in fact all domestic policy
six are entirely negotiable to them it could shake out any way they be fine as richard nixon
refer to it it's building outhouses and peoria
that's domestic politics to them jeffrey goldberg as even said as much during that i think the two thousand and eight election he said the only question in the selection is what the president will do to prevent al qaeda from getting nuclear weapons everything else everything else you know taxes education infrastructure that's all just window dressing it's the only
question worth addressing and then of course unspoken and that is how to confront iran's militarily as well i object to one point though when you say that kevin williams and was just triggering the lives with his outrageous abortion robotics about his day of the rope fantasy for women
that's not the case this is a very personal matter to him oh that's
the front of the show the baseball crank has been one that have been williamson's are indeed the global defenders recently and correctly points out that you know
consumers have been hearing for years from the left that you know you man should not have a say over women's body this is a women's issue that's what abortion is
apparently that's not the case this is this is a major issue that impacts kevin reading from the crime was kevin feels who voice kevin feels especially strongly oh sorry
now he's that's coming into the little sick but
this is precisely why this is a sin match recall kevin feels especially strongly about this issue because he's a sort of person who could maybe wad have been aborted after nine hundred and seventy three they extend no similar empathy to how this affects him
personally and
links to kevin williamson's big article about the issue which i'll read from right now and the national review this is from twenty fifteen about that twenty week abortion bill adult the house republicans this is the forty second anniversary of roe v wade i never need reminding of which anniversary it is it's always the same as my age i was one of those who entered
the world through a pregnancy of the sort we call unplanned though i do not object to being called the result of human action but not the execution of any human design i was bored about three months call it a trimester before row in my case the result was an adoption mine wasn't as it turns out the sort of success story you'd put in a brochure my adoptive parents were divorced only a few years
later and there was subsequently a great deal of unpleasantness of my home upon which i do not intend to dwell some had happier families some far worse eventually i discovered that i had certain talents which friends encouraged and teachers helped me develop i i could food upside down
that wasn't visible in mirrors i had the uniquely american experience of playing high school football in west texas for what was the longest
friday day walker lights were my friday night frogs
learn to trade at the mighty mighty daily texan at the university of texas and then moved to india to apply it i was editor in chief of a small newspaper for it was thirty and started daily newspaper in philadelphia few years later i failed at that but it was tremendously fun and on are better days we put out a more interesting project and the enquirer i published a few books had a few rejected
i walked in the foothills of the himalayas and driven a convertible through the alps gone into a bar fights pick plated packs preclude as part of a classical guitar do it i would work at the only magazine i've ever really wanted to work at and bill buckley once asked me for a word he was unable to call up at the moment there have been a few rough stretch
cheese and some that have been nearly perfect none of it was optional
papa papa
bought a king is it possible to give somebody like a five hundred trimester murky abortion well that's true that that is the most depressing thing i have ever her okay oh yeah you want to abort me guess what bill buckley placed his lizard hand on my shoulder i got i got my book rejected i've been in a bar fights i've
had a little drug called key law i've driven a car
oh yeah i could go to the movies by myself like that i climbed the gentle foothills of the
get off of the airport the airplane in katmandu congratulations you're in the foothills of the himalayas
i've got into a hot tub without my key shirt on
yeah i think if you're if you're a pro life position is you need to ban abortion or else kevin williams that will be aborted your fucking up because he's not really a sterling example of the people that you want to have have around the this is great to i love the he takes it personally because he could have been aborted because it's
the guys who were like yet dude don't insult the military i actually almost signed up for the national guard up
could have been the
nike fucking crawled out of a dumpster high they all that and who is an after they like scraped him out with this was the climax of the article people like me we unplanned the millions of us now live the first part of our lives outside the protection of the laws of these united states are he's areas of the dred scott
our lives and very often our deaths are instruments of the convenience of others that was different in my case by a matter of months it is impossible for me to know whether the woman who gave birth to me would have chosen abortion if there had been a more readily available alternative a nineteen seventy two i would not bet my life neither good nor bad parts of it on her not choosing oh virgil as you rightly pointed out
weird place now where genetic screening is able to tell earlier and earlier if you're fetus will become a national review columnists and we're in danger of losing them all of them ma'am your child will be perfectly round
things man your child is already trapped in the uterine elevate your child
will never be able to write the new york city subway
two things one he could have been reported before row
a idea that there were no portions before row fuck you're a fucking idiot if you think that people were having plenty of abortions they were just unsafe and and often dangerous for the mothers they would actually throw the baseball crank after that so i am so against it
and to anybody could have been a fucking abortion this idea that only only unwanted that or only a poor women are only people who who who go on to adopted kids might have been plenty of people aboard plenty of women have abortions who are married who have children already it's a choice the tongue thirty percent of ice some estimations of them
african woman and made any of us could have been fucking aboard the idea that he some fucking special to the cinema escapee from logan one are you saying we're also in the protected class of we are a whole lives
guys oh my god we're everyone in the through were all survivors anyone in listening right now i just found out i survived a near death experience
i don't want to protect
my actual send nudes actually would like to talk about this recently personal perspective that you mentioned does the pro life movement no favors to have kevin williams in as they're either as their spokesperson saying the thing that they all actually must never ever actually say which is that if abortion
because criminalize women will be punished with to have to force of lives if not executed
certainly put in jail as is the case in every other country where nothing is illegal like el salvador there are women in jail for having a miscarriage and yes it like that
in indiana to yeah i've done that
not on the law just not on the law and way but we do you do that but also the idea that like had i been aborted i kevin williams and wouldn't be here sharing my brilliant thoughts and writing with you is perhaps not the dust sales pitch either kevin makes the point and his defenders have done this as virgil pointed out there was you're getting into this big debate
this is personal for kevin because you know he missed the cut off by about a week now he's out for justice
and he's out for justice okay the privilege to move it will do better to not use kevin as their spokesperson but me because i actually come from the exact same circumstances discovered i was pouring through a teen mom and adopted very shortly thereafter no i don't i'm not saying i would prefer to be dead
i now that i have my life i'm glad i have it i very well could have been imported but however i'm a few so you were born after road and yeah but that's not that he's assuming he would have been a porn or not will or will order will looper him yeah it's actually a time paradox on my own father and i was i was actually wills by law
your parents i also loop heard i went back and keep going you're doing great dog see this kid i need all hang out if that's right and anyone is is is a survivor of abortion then i think we should go bigger i think you should be tom hanks and they should put these big billboards up that say hey america tom hanks could have been aboard
like all his movies now imagine they don't exist but i mean like for me personally like i know it's i i i believe abortion should be legal i don't think it's a i think it's a moral decision that
woman has to decide for themselves i don't know where i would come down personally on the issue if i was ever involved in a pregnancy
however if you ever have sex will someday we'll find i'll find out hopefully knock on wood however is a tried for years you and me at a thing is the point is
why would an existing and not existing for the moment of conception is so then they could be said about everyone and i'm sorry like if my life just blinked out of existence at the end of a doctor or a unwanted pregnancy well then i can't say that not existing really bothered me before then i actually i'm with character guard earn i'm sorry i'm was shopping
our i think you would have been better if none of us have never been born well like i said now that i'm here it's pretty good and for now for now but again
cheap maudlin sympathy act that seventy williamson is going for by being like i could have been aborted is the cheapest fraud imaginable and people are calling him brave for saying it and it's just like yeah
i love the idea that now he's wreaking his vengeance on the women in the world but now he's another knowing that his defenders have taken up in this his grotesque idea as virgil said his day of the rope fantasies about all the horrible it's out there that would have killed them if he had the chance is defenders are saying well you didn't listen to the full interview he goes on to say
i'm sort of squishy on capital punishment is an idea he sort of waffles on whether he's even in favor of oh yeah
he waffles in a pancake city omelet that oda
he says he says he's not sure if he favors capital punishment but if we do have capital punishment it should be hangings and execute like beheadings rather than lethal injection make get a spectacular as yeah he wants to see the old style capital punishment and then he said he also said that he doesn't believe laws can apply be applied retroactively so
defenders are saying oh he doesn't really want to kill a quarter of all american adult women he just thinks they deserve to die so all of that is totally incoherent by it just made me realize way to me minute all of kevin's politics emanate from him hating his birth mother and fantasizing about murdering but she's not a portion
doesn't matter to him no know kevin hates his adoptive parents that that is definitely true if your readers articles about his relatives in lubbock and how the uttered hatred and can can tell you that he really he hates having he hates his birth mother and adopted mother and all moms everywhere yeah so he hates all parents he's he's like the conservative memes
about david hog and anti
yeah he formed his politics when he saw the beastie boys videos where they throw pie in the mom's face for telling them not the party
it's a gun
i this entire williams that thing though it is a great
you know that museum exhibit where they give you slices of the human body and you get every little part works
this is kind of that for the conservative victimhood complex because there are whole thing or whole thing for a pretty much my entire life has been like oh you're liberals are a bunch of pussies you just come up with these new identities you could go into slot yourselves into make results protected class but the moment it turns around on them it's like no i'm actually in a
abortion survivor
either you know
they who spent years and years and years trying to get everyone fired the fucking dixie chicks that everyone i've i've just kept running have a more recent fucking collin capper nick the second it can be turned on their like you should never go after someone's job and i actually like i'm more sympathetic than most people like i'm more
more negative towards getting anyone fired than i think anyone in this williamson debate from those fucking people who did that more than anyone who pretty much got the ball rolling on all all that shit
whenever it can be possibly turned around and then suddenly they have every type of identifiable
identity quantify or and they're just so opposed to going after anyone's livelihood and the enemy and who gives a shit kevin williamson is going to be invited back into the castle
while he's liberals landlord and also i mean sorry jeffrey goldberg you fired him but once you invite a kevin williams and in your magazine he goes
get some fucking garlic buddy one kind of parents medical thing though
i would like someone to explain someone of the of the connor fry corps or brett steve
people by the way is a molly hemingway brought this up is connor fry core is he going to resign from the atlantic you really should going to resign design connor resign be principal buddy but there i need them to explain to me what what or tweets
our tweets an example of the budding hive mind of a liberal neo stalinists enforcing political correctness on people or a place to blow off steam that doesn't mean anything
which is it because the people who are saying they're just tweets like brad stevens wrote their tweets the guy written approximately five million columns
about the awful tweets of the left that prove that were headed towards blogs so what the fuck is a tweet is it only a tweet when it's one of your fellow media class schools and when it's the hoi it's pitch works maybe that's i guess that's the thing
certainly per he made a good point about this a while ago and he brought it up again with regards to the williamson just like going i sort of said it earlier but people in the liberal media class are very invested in this idea that they are charitable and open minded to their colleagues on the right so much show that they invest this idea
to invest so much in this idea that it's just intellectual debate it's just tweets they don't actually believe the things they claim to nobody could possibly i believe that you could execute a woman for making a painful but personal medical decision
no sorry there are plenty of people who really do fucking believe that and what's more this whole like abortion pro choice pro life debate on the question of punishment is actually a very good one that i think we should be having and that i think the pro choice side needs to be asked quite point blankly what punishment pro life pro life started
well
it's it's easy to confuse other
that's both the people who want abortion criminal lions should be asked and they should be made to answer quite frankly what sort of criminal punishments will be in store for not just the doctors are the women who procure them let's say you drive a woman to a clinic let's say you give her money to get an abortion
are you an accomplice to murder as well there's a whole litany of crimes and accomplices that can be opened up now and i think there should be forced to delineate exactly what kind of punishment is in store for these people should roe v wade be overturned and they get an abortion in a state where it becomes illegal because it really does expose
fundamental problem for the anti choice people that has been kept at bay just because it's not it doesn't come up because it's on the context of of roe vs wade the the the implications like the actual legal implications are sort of pushed away because it's still theoretical but
the because abortion most the hinge on this question of whether a fetus is a person and it is something that is metaphysical impossible to know all you do is you have intuition is one way or the other and those sort of shape your politics from it but two people most people intuitively if you told them who has more rights
pullman woman who like you could talk to him who has a name and a personality and memories
can speak words and and has like bob hope
tv or whatever might be a real gamer girl exactly has a favorite book
and a dime sized collection of cells
people will intuitively say the woman and that that understanding is i think what goods the sort of ambient pro choice belief that people have but it's all kind of soft because there's no real consequences to what it's all just sort of i guess but when you put it in the terms of okay should a woman to get
the portion be killed or thrown in jail for years
the incongruity between the life being protected and the life being either ended or basically destroyed by prison is so vast that people are able to make that oh okay now i understand i'm pro choice it should also be noted that even in a pro row american society and from you know much of human history he
even religious institutions like the catholic church for instance regarded
terminating a pregnancy before what was known as the quickening as to be not abortion before they've seen highlander to rely know the quickening meaning like when you can feel it kick like
returning to meant see i mean what are the most covertly evil associations everyone america the may we can thank them for a lot of our current abortion debate framing and then i ever get out there and they said they sort of pushed the line as terminate pregnancies are unacceptable or like it that it's ending a human lives
one to killing a baby a like infanticide am a rock stood wonder why we don't wonder why we don't why our healthcare system is sort of like a cruel practical joke rube goldberg device or why we frame abortion is like you were trying to kill kennedy williamson thank you to the may also starting the method
anyone just can't become a doctor we could do it
i think we're we're almost out of time here but before we go i wanted to bring up these to quote you asked me to source oh yeah over yeah so
when closing thought really said before we go back into the the jeffrey goldberg story i just think what all this proves is whether it's like the new york times of the atlantic are all these supposedly liberal institutions who want to challenge their liberal leadership and open their ideas to critiques from outside their comfortable bubble
forget this bullshit on the right right them off completely if you really want to challenge people who are liberals challenge from the left that would be useful in a civilized liberal society the debate should be between liberals in the current democratic party and those on their left everyone to the right in that
they had no have ideas they have cruelty and corruption that's what they offer look who's president look at the movement as it actually exists not this like fantasy parlor game that you have in your head write them off completely you're not closing yourself after like being open minded by writing them off it's called exercising judgment and just a
bear level of morality
yeah and i want the pages of the atlantic to be a sparkling debate about whether the labour aristocrats of the core capitalist country
can
or spread out forcibly spread out throughout the rest of the world that's the fucking debate that's worth half and now it's certainly make their readers uncomfortable he addresses they're looking way or than fucking breath stevens part about another column of all college students seriously though if you want interesting people in there who actually have an audience because i guarantee you know when it's clicking on these other
fucking articles get brianna grey alex press or ryan who are so many people you could hire that would write interesting things that people would actually read that will prompt the beloved parlor debate you love so much that burning is excellent at trolling the lives lost all my name
he still lives let's get him on there you know but again you fucking put jason a who ruin their no seriously i really i'm not kidding either may want to interesting in there i want my was third world is them to be something that these guys have to grapple with and set of something they've literally never heard of none of these people actually believe
that like the institutions that they preside over should cater to every conceivable view so just quit lying to yourself and keep the right in their own little silos are they belong their own little funny farms talking to themselves you don't need to engage them they're not they're not intellectuals they're not they're not serious thinkers
they're not serious writers like i said they represent cruelty and corruption and that's it i'm talking about williamson people might have this might have cost him his job but if you are talk about his ideas hanging women have had abortions is literally the only idea he's ever had the distinct
like william sony and as opposed to just bog standard conservative massage therapy which is the rest of his fucking i'll put you wanna pick somebody who would actually really piss people off but he wouldn't do it just advocating has been sort of woman genocide actually interesting and actually right put it all read in there who oh mama
you would piss the lives
i'd funny how every eight over he could actually fucking right but again it gets back to the essential dynamic at play here which is that for committed neoconservatives like goldberg and bradley and the people who run the times opinion page what is really out of bounds is the left they what they think out of bounds is hanging bankers who are responsible for the finance
so disaster or for the holes who started the iraq war that to them is out of bounds and that is why that they will always continue to play for see with these
oh fait ball the just tubs of it have de williamson or up
with h l merkin
let's go back to the north to the story of jeffrey jeffrey origin this is a funny know i assume you've talked about this on the show before in your in are now what this is a two hundred assistance for one hundredth episode where we should have done something more fuck we had like fireworks at the start i don't know
okay you may have talk about this but he's had an interesting post college story i'm reading from a ring from our posts made in the atlantic actually in response to glenn greenwald calling for comment clarification asking if he took a loyalty oath when he joined the idea of here's the quote
as a teenager i felt a bit like david ben gurion set adrift on long island i thought that israel might have been meant to be my true home so i moved there in my early twenties only learned that in israel i felt like george washington know the rest of the paragraph does not make that makes sense
why did he gets teeth pulled one of us are here
here's the money quote from eggs this is from an interview that was posted on his website but taken down for some reason
i was a social his eye and it's growing up on long island i lived in a non jewish part of long island and i are the usual or something between usual an unusual experiences with school yard anti semitism and those experiences sent me in a way to seek out some answer about my jewishness my parents but sooner or later regret site and take me to israel for my bar mitzvah
what i was there my eyes were open to the idea of jewish power i didn't put it in quite that way to myself that but that's the way it worked seeing israeli soldiers jewish soldiers more to the point jewish tanks jewish machine guns was quite exciting to a powerless thirteen year old boy suffering at the hands of irish pub remus children
about wrong
rock broke the irish were slaves walk the irish did the hall
well that is very edifying though because it hits are very very western pathology politics or not the execution of power and opposing forces and division of resources it's personal discovery third all the palestinians i really have to find myself as a growing up i had cool tanks and machine guns it was bad
it's not business as you that there's nothing ennobling about about being abused her pressed because this guy got punched by some oh doyle brother and then he decided to go to palestine isaac beat the shit i would say what the scientists that person to say said kristallnacht has nothing to laugh about us even save getting punished or beaten up he just says schoolyard bullying which just means they're probably
being a little butterball yeah yeah
the cast of and burns movie called
here's a here's what is so telling about that quote about like just being around jewish tanks and jewish soldiers this little pussy had to fucking travel to a foreign country and then be the scans in what he regarded as his own personal military state just feel any shred of self confidence
that just even be safe that way then he had to assert himself on prisoners on armed shackled prisoners
isn't this a zionist eat pray love but with jfk is it just eat eat eat eat eat pray love
so he goes in the early nineties he joins the idea of him loose israel and then becomes a a prison guard and here's what he says about this
it was hopelessly exotic for me i mean i'm from the south shore of long island and then all of a sudden i'm in the negev desert by the egyptian border as a prison guard in what's probably the largest prison in the middle east record scratch charting the future leaders of palestine it was pretty exciting
hi you're probably wondering how come to hot dry american summer
so yeah i know he felt like i said he was a fat kid from america is probably a nerd probably never got way probably felt inadequate and he had to join another country's colonial military force to feel good about himself is like wouldn't make love and hung out with the cops this is wonderful says
enriching journey of self discovery if jeff goldberg have been bored forty years later he would have been that college aged woman who go try to fund raise crowd fund her second birthright trip
man that is deep twitter long now it should be noted that in two thousand and twelve he tried to walk back what he wrote in his own book about being a prison guard and he said he says here in an interview about it he says the actual title of my position was prison counsellor men or not
i saw
i got to go to the big counsellors deaths he goes a proper translation is prison counsellor
i saw the just across the lake to the woman's prison
oh and counsellors he goes i know a lot of palestinians think you might have a state one day i'm going to tell you it just doesn't matter
doesn't matter
that
jokes on you critics the actual hebrew translation of my job title was prison virgin
so all of this just leading up to of course jeffrey was a put your hand in my pocket your lead is mine
jeffrey of course then went on to become a huge boost year for the war in iraq saying in october of two thousand and two in five years i believe the coming invasion of iraq will be remembered as an active profound morality nailed it
reality morality
you know what maybe that self discovery in the prison really paid off very present lead little jeff in two thousand and two he also said of people saying hey maybe this iraq or is unjustified in a terrible idea he says here
arguments made against invading iraq are made by people with limited experience in the middle east their lack of experience eaten up a single
lack of experience causes them to reach the naive conclusion that an invasion of iraq will cause america to be loads in the middle east rather than respected great called you have all the all the people who made that call who you know just by accident were one hundred percent right they never had the self confidence that you get is a fact
in long island who was bullied by the brothers big mall and
showed it up and gets the to the blow job from a board idea of conscript a man all those articles feeling for the iraq war that was self care okay who were you to judge jeff goldberg just quit the atlantic put a cash on me link is bio so anyway jeffrey goldberg exercising the same judgment and his kevin williams and higher
as he did in his iraq war predictions hard to say which one will prove out to be worse in the long run
well you know
had that seventy williamson saw his own shadow and big boy season ended
right so that about does it for our a retrospective on the career of jeffrey goldberg and our profile of abortions survivor having millions and if you've learned anything today all the members of the show abortion survivor so please stop us
i actually survive an abortion and a fire

did you might you be changed his interviewed she just in memorial barbara bush like your thoughts
do you remember when the superdome happen she was like well this is like better for them
they get to live the jack with hot
in houston a here's the thing about me dude of your fucking problem with this i literally thing barbara bush bush's the same way she was portrayed in the simpsons
counter argument to that i thought not feel i say she got you on spin magazine confusing it with the rapper a logic i love those i love that happens
one of those things that only gets funnier to me every time he's one of those guys he's like a good technical rapper but he's like i'm going to talk about i'm going to rev about psychology
when he was and
the rick and morty rapper
you mean the cool one is the hierarchy rapper
there are going to be a rick skin and four
no but i've already unlocked the bill maher




hello friends it's your shadow for the week
we've got a jam packed show for year we've got a double shot of interviews for you for stuff is dan fan
to discuss the rather serious allegations of anti semitism been leveled against jeremy carbons labour party and then after that we'll be talking with eric bonk about the oklahoma teacher strikes that's going the future that and as well as teacher strikes on going around the
the country but before we get to either of those probably the most pressing international news at the moment regards our recent airstrikes against syria so without further ado we finally let felix tell the truth about syria chopper let's go
i was laughing that assad is stupid fortnight guy because one of three in the article it was like
parts of it it's like they hid his secret chemical weapons base and it's like sounds like a pretty bad secret but then i was thinking about assad last year at conferences
use like
whatever you do don't hit my secret base yo yo can know about that one
when they hit it
we use like damn this is such a hassle reminds me that that they're actually as a way that we could have stopped this i mean some people have blamed us literally in part anyway for allowing this to happen when not talking enough beforehand about how the attacks on syria prompt does lives every athlete alerts for us so that's what i read
lies though i think obviously that's not true nobody in positions of informed citizens listens to the show but fortnight
you felix if you could get baron
on your fortnight squad
and then tell him the truth about syria he would then tell donald and that could literally save the earth yes i am not i'm not bumping anyone i'm apparently so
saying that donald trump isn't involved father yeah lay down trump talks to his kid at all yeah i know i'm sorry but barons like okay but i'm not bumping chat chat was a halo when we were para baroness okay
that is bullshit night again
you think he's like a good panic those are amazing i guarantee you baroness an amazing for bipolar
i look in his eyes and i see it he's got that shared this is the expert he's talking about i wasn't
many where we get accused again of skirting the most important issue for us to talk about fortnight
you know the united states with great britain and france
launched about one hundred quote precision missiles at syria from cruisers in the mediterranean on friday night
we saw about nine o'clock trump address the nation and said you know the gas killing animal aside has gone too far and we're going to do strikes against his air force and chemical weapons facilities
sort of a replay of almost exactly a year ago when the trump first launched airstrikes on syria this is i guess a slightly bigger version of that we don't have casualty numbers yet
it's still murky like there is a reason that you should immediately react to every input you get on this war because everyone's like oh it's the most documented war in human history and it's like
you can still be misinformed you can still not get probably because of that yeah
but
yet so we did hit apparently we had a very populated suburb but i don't know what the casualty numbers on that and probably will come out right is supposed to damascus
and there's debate over whether we actually directly hit it has a has a camp or not
if we did apparently was totally evacuated the point is a lot of it seems like we had a lot of empty buildings and a lot of the response i've got that i've seen from this has been oh well you know this is what you stand up against hitting the empty buildings and it's like oh yeah i know these strikes really kind of
stupid side shows and away but we did a lot of similar strikes like this on iraq in the nineteen nineties and the reason that they're bad is because it sets this precedent like that all the strikes before that it is well like all the times under obama we had them or when we drop that fucking bomb on the mosque in a lap oh
that wasn't against the syrian government it was against newsroom
still killed a shit load of civilians or when we hit mosul like we did last year and just fucking iced hundreds of civilians
the reason all these are bad and the reason that you see people freaking out about these in particular and you can make a lot of all all this is hypocritical i personally don't think the antiwar movement in the us is so strong that i want to talk an armchair quarterback it right now
but it's because it just becomes a normalized we love that world word now normalized running things like al yeah every year six months we're going to hit this part in syria and then when the time comes that we actually do a ground invasion because policy changes you know but we didn't always we didn't use to have such a strong oversight and
role in the saudi intervention and yemen under bush and than we did because if there is precedent for these things and if there's a running thing that we see is normal becomes easier for the say to do it yet felix i agree with you and i think we talk about this lot about hypocrisy not being a good holiday
cool strategy first of all because no one likes a smug asshole
and second of all because people aren't consistent ever none of them doesn't make any difference but there is something truly shocking about like
okay france is there which is hilarious because half of the people freaking out of a trap during this i like micron is my boyfriend like i mean it it there is
there there must be a way we can point out the fact that there needs to be some kind of consistent attitude towards war without being well you didn't care about acts because those people are also completely politically useless that are not going to bring anyone over it
i mean we really are starting from scratch right now trying to produce an anti warmer than i literally have no idea how to do with what i find interesting about the reaction to these korean airstrikes and the fact that trump is doing them
see when i watch that press conference his address the nation on friday i felt sick to my stomach thinking about what might happen should this idiot decided to take too big of a bite and actually kill russian soldiers or artillery or something like that i mean again the potential for this to spiral out is of course
gray or it could just be one of these and i think that what you said the word normalize this kind of almost ritual quality to these airstrikes in the way it's being talked about wanted to two examples of these sort of liberal foreign policy establishment that consider themselves anti trump consider him a the grave threat to american
secrecy and agent of russia etc but nonetheless support these quote precision airstrikes on a side because they think the use of chemical gas is so beyond the pale and so ghastly that only america can enforce those norms i just want to buy provided by the way
rebels also use gas on kurds
in this exact war and we've hit opposition groups before but we did not hit them for that powerful do er jo and marie slaughter and samantha power slaughter in power yeah perfect dickensian names for these two emery slaughter says i believe that the u s u k in france did the right thing by striking syria
over chemical weapons it will not stop the war nor save the syrian people from many other hard it is illegal under international law but at least it draws a line somewhere and says
just really and legally in defense but at least we're weapon at our decks it put it out and then the next one son at the power says i see the case for opposing us strikes and hash tag syria trump is anti muslim deceitful trigger happy he lacks a syria planet any seeming regard for international or domestic law
but please share views on what the us should do to deter chemical weapons massacres nothing he may be stupid as fuck fat lazy racist and cheat on me but he's still my
i mean we could get rid of our chemical weapons as a show of good faith that's one idea does a starting point did not sell them what you go there is well
there are other people might not help other countries do use them be nice my favorite thing i saw was this the slaughter of power was like i'm surprised that iran would backup assad power after you used chemical weapons after it was used on them the iran iraq war and it's like first of all i wonder who is
the bill of sale for those that
check out but also like what a fucking dumb argument it's like oh yeah
it's pretty surprising the united states government's use bombs after so many other marines died in beirut know
is while you really got on there but i think is so interesting about power and slaughter here is if the both acknowledge that this is illegal i mean i know international law is of laid up can't believe what they're saying sorry it's her baby
the illegal by the standards of international law unconstitutional by our own law slot or even says it won't help the syrian people war
know why they all think it nonetheless is right thing to do because for them like the thing that absolutely cannot be acknowledges the idea that the united states can't really shouldn't try to stop these quote chemical weapons massacres like we are the absolute authority and the world to to enforce that norm by
any means an arbitrary norm because
a fraction of a fraction of people killed the sort of war been killed by chemical weapons
and you could kill another one hundred two hundred thousand people with with conventional weapons and it wouldn't cross any lines so it would be fine but i think what it really shows is so much of the elite opposition to trump is we know it's a aesthetic they don't like him being president because he's a grotesque but beyond that the even know
deep down that now is he not only are you only grossed out by him because he's this disgusting huckster but you don't even think he really has power
you this guy that you know is corrupt and ego driven maniacal and possibly senile possibly see now at least deeply stupid you're comfortable with him and send in cruise missiles into the heart of a
it's the other nuclear powers
and not be too worried that it's going to turn a world war three and because you know that he's not really in charge of us he knew know that this this imperial military system operates under its own logic and under the supervision of its own real deep state the military state and that he's essentially a hood ornament
so it really makes you have to ask people like this
why do you give a shit about trumpeting more like when you care that he's corrupt what do you care that he's dumb if you know that he's just the asshole and the front front of the white house mood around the steering wheel without it actually piloting anything that why do you fuck and care i have a theory about this i think it is to maintain that
the exact same foreign policy in line etc
and to maintain the status quo but to say yeah by because they know it's very popular i mean this is not going to pretty is
you know the sort of daily life that most americans are extremely excited to wake up and face by with truck there they can be in charge yet also at a greek people's complaints about the way the government is operating with well it's because it's this guy let us let us put together like a sensible
republican you know maybe just like just a moderate they would could have easily find a democrat who would have the exact same policies easily what we know for fact that hillary clinton presidency would have involved strikes and syria by now at least as many as we've seen i think be in venezuela
maybe maybe you don't hold don't hold your breath because my pump palmdale gets in there i mean we're already in there in some capacity were already in all these places in some capacity we have over fifty five hundred contractors in syria as one contractor for every us troop we have their and all these places and work
or operation condor to was just starting but i've got to say that his book but her emails that's right he tried to already all when she was running for
oh god shut up
but whatever investing about like what you're saying what you're saying and the slaughter in power line and the sort of foreign policy blog that considers trump a dire threat to democracy but nonetheless seems to support his ceremonial bombing of a country in a civil war which as you said also includes russia and iran
is that like there is this almost ritual quality to it where it doesn't matter who's giving the orders to send these cruise missiles into syria what we're really doing it doesn't really even matter who the actors are what what they're really doing is an acting a kind of ritual by which america once again gets to say that we are
are the elites that decide what is good and bad in the world and we just by shooting those missiles like we are telling not just the rest of the robber what we're really doing is telling ourselves that we're still good and that are far and elites and in charge whole thing is a ribbon cutting ceremony yeah i mean that's very unfortunate
president donald trump
he did the independence day
oh how cute because he loves a ribbon cutting ceremony like i get to sign something he did that did the independence day speech but we have to stand up to not let people be killed with the center with their friends is real john bolton to not let that happen
and then he talked about how he could for carol tiegs a gun to do harrier jet and he just crash into into the ceiling
i mean he's ready to do the vertical takeoff in the hangar displays yeah this air force guy was like mr traub don't cut to throw was like okay great very great you wonderful day i could have i was the best pilot in new york also in other said is john mccain was just doing solo says in a prop fight in arizona and he somehow
crash in damascus
if theory said if these anti trump knapsack people were a little smarter they would realize that they should make they should keep from president forever they should dejected with with stem cells or stick his head in a jar yeah you have a that the fuck it and see like oh we don't like it either they are just keeps do i can like that idea
situation is the have this horrifying grotesque ogre that you can dump all of the bad consequences of the eternal imperial foreign policy on too because he's the one is fucking up the implementation but still have the actual policies that are that are necessitated by the logical of the empire
when when trump is prison for life when it just his head on a policy mo machine
you'd be on a severe i
going up there is also had in the crowd like
new
you guys see the clip of glenn greenwald talking with eli like ours is euro he got so are you i lake
look and beautiful beautiful though some people like they don't photograph well but you see them like in motion just gorgeous
there's a point in it where you i lakes trying to say like glenn made the pray that if you know assad is so bad he cares so much about his terrible massacres are good allies israel is literally shooting journalists in the head for approaching a fence and then cheering about it in watching like laugh
soldiers watching and laughing civilians
oh and down civilians your stance with yeah and even for more than that are again are good friends saudi arabia their charm offensive they're wonderful new prince is carrying out what many are calling the worst humanitarian disaster in the world right now he was response to that is look
our allies for all their flaws are not perfect and then he tries to start in a second point in glen just goes oh they're just flawed eli they're just they're they're simply just a few imperfections there and then you are mad sometimes he played a i leave the doors open and then he follows it up by saying
i don't think you can compare saudi arabia to iran because iran is responsible for the deaths of two thousand american troops in iraq and in iraq because they gave the shaped charges
hi and glenn greenwald said what were those troops doing in iraq
and he goes on securing the constitution and protect the government says like you can't compare saudi arabia causing a famine that is killing probably a million people who are the three thousand americans have forgotten lower manhattan
who were not in vain
the only get israeli
just kidding everybody i think the black eagle did
again anyone who is trying to make this argument that like oh we just simply have to do something about aside i mean they're they're talking out of their ass like i don't get why why even if you believe that we we have something has to be done about it why the fuck was you could you possibly think that america would be the ones to do something about it or make it back
here's something we could do we could let in more than eleven refugee yeah that and refugees and are millionaires that's a lot of the ones we let in a lot out of the eleven
in areas yeah i'd still be let it but yeah we should let in then
and then a massive policy of geographic ignorance built into our public education system because people always do this down share where they like people can't even find north korea on the map and then they pull people who can't find north korea and the map and pull people who can the people who can or leg by the way we do something about then
and it's like you know at this is why you should be somewhat skeptical of anyone who claims to be an expert in any kind of region or foreign foreign policy because usually they become an expert because they're fascinated with the conflict of the area and they want to you know to a man with a hammer
and and it's just you're not going to find something you're less likely to find a sensible foreign policy position from someone who has spent twenty years studying a region it's just it's were also getting paid by one of the forces in the region with a vested interest in in proposing
their side of it i mean that clear but i mean it it's the same thing with university like with media like anyone who gets really fixated on foreign policy like there is a good i'd say a four out of five chance that they end up arriving at the conclusion that well
that means we need to go there again
when it comes to this
foreign policy apparatus they don't seem to care who's in charge as long as they perform these ritual acts of america being tough and exhibiting leadership on the world stage and they don't seem to care that it's carried out by a unitary executive it's now largely completely on tethered from congress or the constitution or even
any democratic accountability
and they don't even mind that the person in charge of it is a doddering lunatic who they regard to be a danger in every other respect so i mean again it's a it's sort of an old chestnut but i just brings to mind
the old adage the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result
these
libya iraq like the list goes on and on the these people ever think that some good is going to happen out of this or they're going to they're finally going to get to the moment where like they get to be like the way the world war two conquering heroes or something
the point really isn't the outcome for these people for just the more rank and file cable news talking heads the point for them is that it feels reassuring and strong and a way to call for airstrikes to see the to see them meted out with the same thing
precision that we always say that we have it feels good to speak with for with this authoritative manner on what needs to be done and then for everyone above them who's actually part of the state are part of arms manufacturers they directly profit off of the i just have returned to the samantha power thing which is very indicative she says please share views and
you should do to deter chemical weapons massacres like the onus is on us to be like well i don't know we can do to determine that i don't know that we should word is really good at making things better that's that's our biggest talent at in a city of it's the same answer is i don't know what we can do to stop stop fucking stop fucking up
following fucking kindling under the fires exact got their god why isn't the question the first part of her statement which is i see the case for opposing us strikes and and lists all the reasons it's insane so why isn't the question to her samantha why don't you come up with an answer about what good you think this is going to do yeah why she that way it's not going to deter these luck
it will deter oh it blew up the korean factory i guess i'll just go back to killing people by this thousands with regular bombs and guns
like the classic samantha power thing where she writes an entire book on a problem from hell us policy and genocide and doesn't even devote a single chapter to any of the genocides actually carried out or abetted by the united states that she isn't mention indonesia
in her book i don't yet know that and that's the thing we see now it's like oh why are the same people who are against these are why don't they talking about russian air sorry cancer or what they're talking about a thousand maybe because
everyone
measure that you want to pose those with his ground invasion of the no fly zone maybe that's why i mainly because we're talking about our country and what our country aid and abet but this idea that you have to condemn every single that i'm against all bad things okay great bags but by the way people who also pulled out
oh this is what about his on everything else do this
what do you think the effect would be if there was a protest with like a thousand people in america against russia presidents and syria what do you think the effect would be would it be nothing would it be less than nothing
speaking of which one can and can't affect in terms of the countries that we live in and whatnot i would say
even if you don't think it matters if there is a protest against us intervention in syria anywhere where you live or that you can attend i would say do that i think it's important for yourself to be seen and heard about this if even if it's it's not nothing but it it is something and just again be oh
only same position on this is one hundred percent opposition to any us intervention and also if you go to a margin annexing have to go to a or whatever but if you go to emerge there is literally zero chance that it will kill anyone so you're already being more of a harm reduction este in terms of for
and say
well the good news for everybody who was a little worried all these all these miss power slaughter people who are a little worried right before the bombs started following that trump of serious above his little relieving syria immediately were getting the ground troops that are in northern syria out a up
emanuel mccall has just said that he has convinced trump to stay in syria long term with the troops that we have their northern syria so that's good news great everybody i mean you can take that with a grain of salt because a man whom across as self glorifying maniac and trump doesn't literally have a continuity
thought between two consecutive seconds in his life but that's what he's saying a really really sad news and getting just after your bolton manual crown has given himself entire body cancer by stepping into nuclear reactor to become dr manhattan and and civil war era rules
the guy king of japan and let's make let's make the vatican in charge of france again i was what i thought he was like a boring like neo liberal guys are fucking hate this is guys just french trudeau and then he actually gets elected and he's like i'm actually a mortal i'm like this guy rule guys rule
cause that's the that's the thing behind the veil of that neoliberal pose of rationality and thoughtfulness and clear headed miss is that
when the when the world refuses to conform to your dictates you basically go insane and you turn a new him and humor crowd that's not all of these people are though they're all this is this is we're veering into a different nerd territory here but this is the your ale thing where they're like okay it's it's very dangerous amount of power but i personally
should be able to wield it and that's that's the lead mindset but i do actually want to talk about this to send out of here
charlie kirk who is just a just a turn responded to ted lose his tweet and congressmen
he loves to post
we had a better tweet and congressmen everyone's prospector exactly bow drill
but
ten and the use of force by real donald trump get serious unconstitutional this is not self defense in net nothing covers these chemical weapons is horrific but our constitution is not bottle
and charlie card responded to it you're a moron war powers act and eight everything he clearly as a president sixty days she's military force and so having to go in front of congress every president has he is the thirty constitutionally that last four years including obama where he stayed selectively silent
now again i don't want to be lake
well where were you then but also this does point out a wheel
problem with trying to rely on procedural us and we need to start making moral arguments against war because the procedural arguments against were don't work because the entire rule book is set up to foster war
yeah now the entire international law argument the entire you didn't ask congress permission just yeah as just like well into your wheels yeah you didn't have a cover cover page on on your report say you get an fun you're on your midterm like now it first about doesn't work like that second of all you can do everything by the book and app
salute havoc all over the world it reminds me of those videos libertarians make words like know if you ever get pulled over by a cop and are being detained
they have this delusional idea and end this is this is the problem with like these these nice lives in these nice dance who are just now discovering that like a maybe wars kind of horrific is that they think that like look if i play by all the rules i'm going to get chen you're not going to be able to just follow the rules harder than anyone else and it's like you can't goody goody your way out
shit i think a interesting point about the rules at least as it pertains to the us executive branch and war making is like the her structural point here is that the presidency has way too much power in these matters and it would be better if we had an executive branch that of basically withered away
ammonium position or a country that whether away honestly but the point is like the presidency is basically the office of imperial manager
it's basically understood that foreign policy is too important to be kept in the realm of domestic politics which is you know that that's just something that people vote on our real power like that what's really important his foreign policy and our military and how we govern the world and it's basically everything we do isn't popular even
among the right and left but what we need is a presidency it doesn't matter what party they are in or who voted for them or wide that all toe the line as imperial manager and carry out his foreign policy that is as i've mentioned completely until from our threadbare constitution or any kind of democratic input from the
cool and i mean burn the constitution whatsoever but you know there's been multiple kind of paul's on this and the engineer
class and the media class in terms of foreign policy are right wing more right wing on average than the average bumble fuck american in the middle of nowhere this is ideas that there are these like crude and educated meat heads that are always wanting to go to war that's absolutely not true americans everyday are being subjected to war
again to constantly and yet they're still last right wing in terms of war then like fucking samantha power
yeah in fact because there's been a slight right wing
blow back against trump for alex jones got very the crime and real many times didn't really show some of the the the the the saddest alright people are very unhappy about all of this but
i just wanted to share one message from a diehard trumps supporter bill mitchell for you have these things wrong any of these people who are doubting their big wet boy just because he went back on his explicit promise to be less material and less less aggressive in foreign policy and got us more involved in a war that he
he said he wouldn't and tweet about over and over again can i just said before this
when alex jones was crying he said trump betrayed us is no one in this world pure say that about donald trump
donald trump was that very moment i thought this list mean they thought he was salmon are reading and monster was was my poor boy but but
johnson the rest bill bill mitchell says when you only back your president when he does one hundred percent of what you want you're not a supporter your user
oh shit
aw bill is for really aren't really an hour with tammy wynette stand by your man
ah do that is the rebuke that is a twenty eight thousand rebuke of fake friends i'm sick of people manipulating president donald trump
but that's the end result were politics is basically your instagram feed you know he's he's just another thought that you follow
people need to get off his back is the best ahead
a user
easing that is this is what have any when your politics are formed by lake highly hostile into personal facebook means you want your you want your you want a politician to do things that you want that dude homey what that's not a friend so we'll see how this all turns out we'll be paying attention to it
again on case you needed someone like me to tell you it the only sane position here is one hundred percent opposition to military intervention in syria has any annihilating and continually yeah and anyone who tries to make the make the argument seem like it's really more complicated than that is
selling you a bill of shit
today we are here with dan thin who is daddy editor of the new left review and he recently he has something and jackman called corbin under fire
i don't know who has been following this
but if you caught that fantastic
daily mail headline
it was they held it beat route in the air and shouted fuck capitalism
now there are a lot of differences and similarities between like u k media and american media size is a huge wooden but they're both very insular they're both very sort of like close to power that kind of thing but i have to know just the daily mail not have
one you in their room to tell them that it is a horse radish for the seder plate and not a beat rate
yes like they totally did that
oh you know the political say though you may
you lie
love leavened bread
so we're talking of course about jeremy corbin was invited to a seder
with a left group that is very sort of tongue in cheek named a judas spelled do and and us and the sort of both the right wing and this sort of right of labour has been running with it and been terrified about this or at least feigning terror over so called anti semitism in the labour party dan
can you tell us about this why is generally carbon leading pogroms
well the judas though was one of the most borrowers go low some of the people who were giving note about it obviously knew so much about and subject got bass boat
cedar sieber
and of course the urge to be true to know that sort of thing
it did have a positive side to it but this here are two very obscure marginal left wing jews group in britain old song became nationally famous they managed to overtake on twitter for the number of followers
the border deputies were cheeseburger
i would say a very conservative establishment voice of the british jewish community and was one of the reasons or judas was set up in the first place that they wanted to challenge the monopoly you jewish political expression for people who are very right wing support the conservative party don't support israel would support netanyahu people who say
messages and congratulations to donald trump without mentioning any dog whistles about george soros and his campaign
those were the very people who have been pointing the finger jeremy colman along with daily mail and telegraph in the times know he's very right wing newspapers have a history of openly flirting with racism or just getting down and dancing with racism
including anti semitism
when corbett looking on the record here during the main thing is to focus on the big picture because people often get caught up talking about individual cases but the big picture there's a narrow that's been good about a large parts the british media and not just the right wing press the liberal press and while the bbc which sable own priority is
with our anti semitism top to bottom
it's cold hosts for jews that was a phrase used by columbus for the guardian newspaper liberal newspaper
it's a party for the many not good you that's fantastic that as as like a title that we would have come up with a bottle narrative is just completely force i'm defamatory
and when people are asked about this you know the question that's always put the labour party members whether their senior politicians are ordinary members they always say do you accept that labour has problem with anti semitism
and as a trick question because nobody's going to say no idea have a single member with anti semitic views starts a problem how many people in the labour party right now
over half a million so there's going to be one or two anti semite yeah it's about one percent of the population the out of population britain's now memorable a priority since this surgery membership post carbon
on the cases that are been brought to light mean i certainly have been cases of labour party members making anti semitic comments on social media especially but their courage and in the tens and twenties not in the poses and the plan
so you don't ten percentage in october one present you're not even don't break point one of one present
and of course you know that doesn't mean you should say that's fine
there's less anti semitism in the labour party under his in british society as a of course a laugh when priority should be trying harder they should be going the extra model which be doing everything they can to root out any kind of bigotry
and that's perfectly fair to say to labour that they should do that but that's not the the arguments put their the everyone has not been bought some labour party members of an anti semitic comments or even though the parties own disciplinary structures aren't up to scratch your but the leadership has been go to some failings
again the main line
idea that wouldn't me the smear that want to be an ally and i think the majority of people including cobra themselves would respond to class in good faith they would have seen as as a constructive engagement but instead of been bombarded with this hysterical still absolutely hysterical
given the impression but the labour party has the kind of atmosphere of munich beer hall in the nineteen thirties
some of it it's just completely hallucinatory just to give you one example of a story that was published in the new york times by howard jacobson was best known as a novelist
he's a very strong to tractor of carbon in the loan guarantees well he wrote an article after the labour party conference last year in which he claimed it was emotion on the conference for proposed to question the truth of the holocaust know that just never happened it was completely made up it's not even an exaggeration of something going happened on the government's floor he just made it and i would have open
a new york times or fact checkers both they allow that to get through and people must have read that and thought well it's in the times that asked him of being true
it was true be a really shocking thing to read about it but it just didn't happen
there's plenty of examples of there's all kinds of innuendo where people are accused of anti semitism just because of think they said about israel
i'm sure you're familiar with some of these arguments were it's not quite said that to criticize israel as anti semitic or people are accused of singling out israel they have an unhealthy interest in israel why don't you talk about syria why don't you talk about other countries in to people who protest against israel and low party also protest against countries like turkey saudi arabia
involved in major human rights violations and aggressive wars and oppressing people the kurds
and waging war in yemen their the very same people who are critical of netanyahu's government but they're still accused of being obsessively focus on israel and there's only real one real explanation of why they should be so obsessed be focused on israel yeah a one thing i forgot to mention that story was invited to speak today
is like i had never heard them before and i sort of reading pretty heavily about that you know accusations of
anti semitism against the labour party for a while now
and by he was invited and he brought the horseradish from his current because he isn't angel
really is the best type of seder get either
sometimes you bring what a guy
it's a different goal is to the theater
it's nice because it interrupts the traditional lake
sniping at each other out
some redoing some tax assessment or whatever
yeah and corbin is the idealized boy that you bring to your seder is he's a platonic guy he's the absolutely it's just that
one of the things about it was but it wasn't even meant to be a political intervention by carbon you know and he just these guys were his friends because the people behind judas veteran left wing activists in london a lot of them in north london
and i've been friends with them for decades so they invited along not because he was the leader at a low priority you know they would have invited mom when he was just an order it a grumpy
i'm he went along with some political calculation but just because he wanted to counter to stay with his friends i mean one of the most surreal
stories of the male got two or three days of outrage if airbus and one of the most real stories they heard was exposing the shocking fact that corbin had shared a table with a man called david rosenberg i think just first time they've rosenberg ever made it into the national press but everyone has been around the left in london with know pretty well
he's a great guy and you know he's he's a story and he does walking tours about the jewish history of east end of london
he helped organize the march for the eighteenth anniversary of the cable street demonstration in the nineteen thirties which is to jewish community and the east and came out to confront britain's fascist movement along with non jewish left wing activists and beat them all off the streets
and you know the the male models to get a whole story about the shocking fact that carbon were sitting down to stalk with this man named rosenberg without mentioning the fact that he was jewish and and they quoted out of context some some things that they've rosenberg said arguing about as i would say though narrative around
they were aren't exempt his was completely exaggeration largely manufactured and he was presented by the mail or some kind of sinister apologist for anti semitism when anyone who knows his name is david rosen back while
you know he's also have been someone has been very careful of speak up when i read or sci anti semitic attitudes creeping into left wing circles or people picking up certain jokes that they don't even understand fully conspiracy stuff you know stuff about the rothschilds or george soros are are kind of trash
he's always been very clear and speak out against that
and yeah she's know travesty by the daily mail as some kind of
galileo figure
while i think to you said curious get snag as these kind of self loathing choose to you because they like
gotta or whatever they did they did the palestine supplement to pass over prayer that kind of lake
it's it's it's it's a very common thing for left wing palestinian said that this choose to jail but i think people that and one of two ways with it like oh look he's doing this cynical pr move or they said oh lucky found the most anti israel jews he can't possibly could
and people managed to call those to view simultaneously as well
right
convenient that i guess one of the things it's kind of hard to trace the origins of this story and you saw i mean it's it's a common tactic for sort of liberals and we see it a lot of this weapon as a nation of identity politics to take down left wing figures we saw
during the campaign attempts to sort of spear
the momentum in the carbon campaign as as sexist or whatever
it didn't really take hold but this actually has sort of a lot more juice behind it i mean there's a lot more ink being spilled over the supposed edge of this bugaboo the anti semitism and labour party where did that come from and why is it still delhi
i think some of it
involves tactics that have been important new us because i'm sure you know the the way the palestine sold early activists and lot of american university campuses are targeted by pro israel activists rather than just engaging with the politically and trying to refute the arguments that you accuse them of threatening jewish students of having been
made anti semitic remarks not sort of thing and then you the university investigates these complaints
there are found to be groundless but in the meantime
people have how to expand a lot of energy defending themselves against these calls are allegations that a lot of pretty traumatic experience and very often they've had their names
spread through the internet with ease with these accusations
that was actually the beginning of
the country with the low priority also involved a labour party ceasar easy in oxford university where they were accused of making all kinds of only anti semitic remarks
you could tell right from the start up there was something it'd be better because the guy who made these allegations the main thing he seemed to be concerned about it was that labour has endorsed the israel apartheid week
tim burton some of rents some of the protests subsequently it was investigated and found to be oh by the university and boy
low parties does plenary bodies he was found to be without any basis but in the meantime
putting a been allowed snowball
i think one of the things that does give it legs is the fact that you have organizations like i mentioned earlier the border deputies of british jews
various other organizations which claimed to be representative of the entire jewish community in britain and they do represent a certain section of jewish by noon and britain but definitely not the whole the whole community for example jargon irish the guy who's the president of the border deputies as i mentioned earlier he
russia and a statement congratulations to go trunk
after he won the presidency the u s
when trees may last her election
lost her parliamentary majority in the election last year he rushed out a statement bemoaning this he welcomed when she formed an alliance with the democratic unionist parties far right party from northern ireland
a sports everything at night knows government does to the hilt so he represents a very very right wing political agenda is not just about israel of course he's very pro israel and kronor in yahoo but it's a wider agenda as well
and of course going to be completely on unsympathetic to a laugh when navy should labour party so there is a kind of feedback loop there were a particular people you claim to be represented a huge community and britain but aren't necessarily so
they make these allegations i mean it's signal boost by the tory press because obviously they want to throw as much modus they can at the lower priority and it goes back and forth like that and that's been the main source the country obviously that's why people haven't step back and said i am what is what does the actual connection between the of the moto here on the are that we've been
caution because if you ever did that you'd say ninety percent of the hype on the stereo and this is just groundless what you have is a problem which is real to the extent but you still have some people low priority we don't him on on the wider left with anti semitic views and you have to do something about that but this audio a party where it says
dammit where it comes from the leadership down the whole party is rotten with anti semitic proceeds from top to bottom it's just not true and the facts don't paradise and anyone who's tried to do any kind of serious empirical investigation as hard to say the fax number of other i wonder if there's any anti semitism in the northern ireland
an irish unionist party
any be actually they love is real
they're big fans of subtler colonialism and apartheid yeah they have they have like marvel infinity war mural of every several group cologne
then in they love with earlier
the club no have union jack the israeli flag and then the apartheid era south african rhodesian flags up there i mean it's let sam and then it's pretty clear that you can be as personally anti semitic as possible provided that you support yes i can component
dan i wanted to ask you like it seems pretty obvious what's going on like when you said with the telegraph for the mail or the right bring press in britain which will do you know will hit any stuff
stoner club at hand to hit jeremy carbon with an anti semitism is the easiest when they have now but what do you think is going on with like the traditionally liberal press in in britain like the guardian and members of the labour party who are also unhappy with corbin and are also sort of flirting with this idea
hey we need to get serious about this or we need to talk about this or make an issue yeah i mean you've got people are examined him already
there's a significant group of a ramp beings who are assigned to the friends of israel group but that's just part of a wider global agenda
signed up to in terms of foreign policy but very same m s or a very keen on saudi arabia
be very keen on of our e in colombia
they pal around with area on one particular labour and who's been extremely vocal on the subject of anti semitism
was was outraged like corbin judas went he went to turkey on junk paid for by relative
since then has come back pirating the line at the turkish government on everything to do with kurdish right
clinton the sand and so on
you know he's he's known as the
the only champion
britain
i am and
nice also extremely interest in sports only arabia i mean that's what other reasons why people are so asked to court because it's not just about opinions and of israel you know his position on israel and the palestinians on paper it's not especially radical he's engraver a two state solution as european governments are also meant to be the troll
what carbon is that people think he actually means us
he doesn't present the conflict as being between two equal sides you know he talks about the oppression and the palestinians he talks about bringing real pressure to bear on the israeli government uses but he is also a very critical of may selling weapons to saudi arabia as well
yeah i mean this is one of the the issue studies have trouble with some of his employees over that but a year and a half ago they for an emotion that i already brought forward emotion to have an investigation into the sorority war and yemen and and mean time arms sales would be frozen and this is something about britain is up to their next game it's not just a question of selling the weapons they're are being used
yeah man they got british military personnel and that of the control room helping them to call in airstrikes that level of cooperation and about fifty lay rub breeze refuse to support that motion and some of them were a bit slinky and shameful about it you know they just didn't show up for the votes they pretended that they were sick that sort of thing but summer
of them were extremely proud they got up and parliament voted against this motion and explained that they fully supported the war in yemen
completely brushed aside all of the evidence on a humanitarian disaster that it was causing and all the civilians that are being killed
so you know these guys there in there in the tradition of tony blair witch
if you follow tony blair his career since he stepped down as prime minister he's set himself up as a sort of your mom for her for the war criminals the world goes around from kazakhstan and nazarbayev okay army in rwanda
first mubarak and no cc and egypt and saudi royals all
the last week or so he's been ardently calling for war in syria to overthrow saddam some people have i'm currently suggested that it's like a protection racket because assad doesn't pay for his services and minutes
any dictator who doesn't pay for tony blair this is what's gonna happen to you
you know that's us to tradition of these people were reared in you know they don't even question that the alliance with saudi arabia and britain
is one of those unquestionable thousands of the foreign policy establishment
they really high carbon because he just asked the question of why why are we alone with these guys why is it ok to be like with these guys but not with around for example why is around beyond the pale saudi arabians perfectly respectable force you know a couple of months ago
the up and coming to the real power
in saudi arabia the young royal there he came to london on a visit and it was extraordinary been around here at the were like billboards in the street
full page ads and newspapers to welcome this kind of thing
it was sort of thing you'd expect in in really does stuff the extent of the lot to say the arabia and then with the guardian newspaper
has been better the austro carbon from start to ludicrous extends to a point where they really alienated a large part of their readership not not aimed at people who'd be hard core left wingers just people who were in some way to pathetic to the labour party has stood for and record one
and some of them along with some of the labour and peace they were quite and down for rubbish by the election result last year because it much better than anyone expected went much better than they had hoped they were hoping for labour to do very badly and this would set the stage to as carbon when you got forty percent of the vote they were there completely startled and put them back for
but it's these issues around israel saudi arabia but they started to find their boat dirt find a voice on rather
the first example actually the first time they were both the park but after the election was over venezuela summer where all of a sudden a group of labor appease he never asked a question about venezuela or said anything to do with anything and latin america and their whole careers set up an all party group parliamentary group en venezuela to demand that
corbin denounced mulder through and support an opposition and all this kind of stuff
you know us us gonna shoot after their first loyalty and politics is to nato it's to washington and all the stuff that goes with that whether it's whether it's netanyahu whether it's already on whether it's to saudi royals the war in yemen
that's about all that all agenda and everything else comes close behind it
that and p talked about is john would tack
that's right yeah yeah woodcock he was actually in a video but phosphorus global which is a weird turkish think tank that has some like weird links the isis oil
bragging like lucca just stood up for us shower to her home region woodcock but going back a little bit corbin stance on israel and palestine and a lot of misery
i feel like the service center right that sec press in either our country or the u k they'll go harder against a guy like that who will just take it sort of what is generally if you actually look at on paper like a very moderate stance like this is an occupation and gaza we shouldn't sport
but not like let's nuke tel aviv man that they'll go harder on that the kids they're more afraid when a middle of the road here we just want to give palestinians in it just like one
a deterrent
they go harder on that i feel in the same reason that they sort of when hard on the iran deal and i think it scares them to see the window in their world in their roles of respectable politics push just a little bit more than anything else exists in the world they know there are more
works extreme positions out there and there people more in line with those positions but it is more terrifying to them someone like you remember the stuff about keith ellison oh yeah he doesn't has even more like to the right stance on a lot of this is in america we don't even really have that much of an anti war movement
basically haven't had one since obama but he just says the word palestine and just fucking nuclear freak out
they these institutions rely on they're not even being presence of a reasonable moderate counterweight ethic
go back a little bit good phil donahue fired from amherst
the way that he opposed the iraq war they're more interested in even just the sort of like new deal liberal type war opposition they're more terrified at that than anything
even if you actually look at it on paper it's like this is really you
half the half people are probably calling this guy a cock because don't tell you
but that that's still too much the position the the presence of their position is acceptable is seen as an existential threat to them just like you know how the not completely embargo iran is seen as legitimizing them like it wasn't already you don't like it wasn't already a country
became there anything that threatens their general order is the most terrifying thing in the world they rely on setting the narrative every time yeah
i think one of the things that mania opponents especially don't like about government is that they know full well he does speak for a pretty big section of british public opinion
a classic example about was during general election campaign last year there was a terrorist attack in manchester and you know really horrible attack were suicide bomber blew himself up at a pub cancer killed a lotta kids really horrendous
jeremy carbon his first public reaction was to make a speech and and she said of course nothing could ever just for this and the responsibility lies with the terrorists both we have to look at whether the war on terror has made things worse and make things better and the overwhelming evidence is it's made things worse it's aggravating instability was it's create conditions for groups like al
and ice is to grow and spread on the whole experience the war on terror since nine eleven has been a failure
and when this was being flagged up the previous night i remember all the why his political commentator saying this is suicide this guy is going to blow their whole election campaign they're going to drop ten points in the polls people like strong leaders day like someone who are tough on security this is not the time to be making these comments and then the next day he made
speech she was very good at it was very cogent articulate very moderate on the apollo has done that day and the majority of people agreed with them even conservative voters agreed with him because it's so blindly have it then i remember that the i remember being like oh shit
this is going to blow the election far out and because people are know
people act rationally when they're scared and like lo and behold it just didn't happen everyone somehow kept a cool head it was like really really hardening people freaked out because no one had ever really in our modern age it really really ever did with carbon did there
it was one of the most amazing things i have seen an electro baltics in my lifetime yeah people really surprise me it's like really encouraging i had a little oh humankind are not monster a ya
the night before when it had been planned a magnet speech are deprived with this kind of getting sense of anticipation can always actually gone for this you know even if it goes horribly wrong at least they didn't chicken and then the next day when you're watching the coverage old only saw this opinion polls are watching football match and cheering
but that's that's the kind of talk that's not meant to be spoken in public because they know it makes sense so you have to just declared were bold and you can't even say these things in public i think it appeal to people because there's been there's always been a learning curve over the last fifteen sixteen years you know if this is now the day after nine eleven people can remember what has happened before
there were terrorist attacks in britain or in the us or in france and what the reaction was that the mood reaction going or boggling and country invading a country whether many people safe or not
once they can see the results so people have been watching put the last fifteen or sixteen years even though it seems pretty clear certainly reading all the commentary from
the prospect of bombing syria who last week the people who are paid to write about politics and about foreign policy and the british media have learned to ping
there's a whole generation and pundits who should have been cleared asian penchant for after they got things so wrong about iraq and they are allowed to carry on in their positions and they've learned absolutely nothing
but the great british public aren't quite as blind them and this this
awareness understanding it's not just restricted to people on the left i would say there's a pretty
wide range people and center and even on the right
you don't agree with carbon about taxation or public ownership requests like bass and think he's a bit of a bit of a loony left the but when he says these things they just know their head and say well that's just common sense as much in just really wrap things up here from from an outsider's perspective of course you know what you're
described is jeremy corbin is being knocked as an anti semite for attending a passover seder with jewish people and it seems ludicrous but are you worried that ember alluded to earlier like the original line of attack when the election was happening was a labour and jeremy corbin in particular and momentum and problem
with women in that didn't really stick are you worried that this
semitism line has more purchase or more staying power then the the idea that
a problem with women are that their means of women i certainly think it has more purchase but i think the real danger of the stuff that's been talked about so much in the last couple of months because it wasn't the anti semitism control receipts before the us
this chair or three weeks dead against the idea that corbin was a czechoslovakian spy
that did think it all because people are like cool
well it sure it should have done to death and twenty four hours
it was making this claim also claimed that he had organized the library conference
oh a gilt das this
while i like the idea of being an eastern bloc spy
but that was allowed to run for a couple of weeks and then the is there was a story where a former russian agent was poisoned and britain
corbin was accused of being unpatriotic
not because he said this death and he wasn't the russian government just because he said let's not rush to judgment here let's look at the evidence let's look before we leap sort of thing
so this has been ongoing since i would say the start of february
and it means that while labour is tired of with the stories it doesn't appear to have how much of an impact on their polling figures you know their polling figures have held up
jury moto that whole period but it means they don't get the chance to talk about their actual policies their manifesto they're gone into the local elections are going to be held here in a few weeks time and labor has all kinds of ideas for her to change the economy not especially radical you know it's not like they have some sort of revolutionary anti capitalists program
i've got a good repost social democratic program
and whenever people are asked about the policies that they put forward a very popular in their resume people and they stand against
the conservative party which was increased need discredited on every aspect of their economic record and is left to policies that are deeply unpopular
but the longer they spent having to be back these allegations and even if the controversy itself doesn't stick in the long run that's time wasted on i think a large quantities manufactured controversy is tit to tie them up and prevent them are looking at work and prevent them from using their energy stocks went over new people
finn thank you so much for joining us and
and congratulations on being i think the second irish person we have allowed to be on the show wait he's irish yeah we did not have
moscow you never can
we are here with eric blank
he has been covering all of the teacher strikes for jack of then you should go back and read everything he's written so far
we talked a little bit about west virginia when we interviewed a teacher a few episodes ago now things are going off in oklahoma
can you tell us about what's going on
yeah so oklahoma has been on strike basically for the last two weeks
very similar issues to west virginia for those who fall the west virginia catastrophic conditions in the schools do two years of austerity by both republicans and democrats and teachers and staff reach a breaking point
in response to west virginia oklahoma teachers in particular
rose up maybe a little early the he excited about trying to win some semblance of public education which has been really decimated
and for the last two weeks have organize a really massive
unprecedented strike what happened and that remains to be seen but i think the big story is that despite the lack of organization by the lack of labor traditions you still seen that in a red state quote unquote working class folks early sick of what's going on and says very similar to west virginia in that sense so i was virginia i think
coordinated three different unions
is that sort of players and oklahoma right now
yet the thing to keep in mind is the level of organization and oklahoma significantly lower as far as both trade union organization and what we call like molten minority as far as radical workers who have been organizing have more of a class to have a prospective said both of these forces are significantly weaker and it's a major factor
in the way that the strike has played at and so you have one major union which is the oklahoma education association
and like a lot of other unions most other unions it's focused on lobbying the democrats in a really effective way and that has led to an impasse which is one the reasons why we see these wildcat strikes both in west virginia and in oklahoma because the strategy didn't work the going and
pleading with the legislators and or voting and the democrats didn't work because when you did vote them and they kept on cutting taxes
people against you know what that means than is a lot of people just tune out right
if you don't see any alternative you're going tuna and that mobilization from below therefore has taken a really what people call spontaneous but really what that means that people organize without
any institutional framework to hear their mobilization and the dynamic than is that there was a facebook page like in west virginia
that created some vehicle for the rank and file teachers who want it to organize a strike on the model west virginia and said the two main forces i think if you want to think about the overall control the movement are the union and the rank and file largely organize third to facebook pages but unfortunately
the difference with west virginia is that it's remained up until recently almost all on facebook
organization building that went in to the previous drake where there was really months and build up actions a lot of really important steps to build organizational capacity that type of dynamic didn't really happen in oklahoma so you had a straight called with very little of an organizational base to push it forward and so it's a little
bit more hollowed out of a movement
we're recording this on sunday
i sort of like to the term really what is the status of the strike as of now
this idea that they may persist into a wildcat strike on monday come tomorrow when the show probably comes out
yeah that's an excellent question the current situation looks pretty bleak the union leadership after
more or less two weeks of fighting to their credit through in the tower without consulting the membership last thursday said it's over we're going back didn't put up a vote to the ranks and pivoted to same we're going to get him in november will remember november which basically me
china like democrats in november even if that was the a that things are counterproductive strategy even if that were the case you would still want to win the strike it doesn't actually make sense to end your straight and the support is there this is the remarkable really sort of tragic dynamic of the strike is that seventy two percent of the population supports the strikers winning all
their demands and so the current situation is that there is widespread anger because teachers didn't want to go back they were fighting for funding this is the crucial thing is that they had one a pay increase before the strike even began when six thousand dollar pay increase which is chump change it shows that organizing frustrate can win real
way more than beta whenever before so what they've been striking for these last two weeks as an increase in funding for public education because as i mentioned the schools have been decimated they haven't won that some people wanted to stay out the union leadership through in the towel and unfortunately it's unclear
whether there will be a wildcat on monday there's a lot of anger people have over the weekend have tried to cobbled together the facebook the some in person meetings calls for people to stay out on monday my guess is there will be probably hundreds if not thousands of people at the capitol mandate whether that's enough to really turn around the momentum which
has largely dissipated
is an open question well i mean i don't know where you're proposing the electoral strategy worked great in wisconsin
that's why now the number one place can get educated there is chuck e cheese
but what what is the thing that made the leadership essentially blink in the face of popular support and continued him enthusiasm among the actual teachers
what we should keep in mind that the leadership
was pushed much they wanted to go there is not a leadership but it is a raging for a while waiting for a strike they saw what was happening from below and they realize that the ranks would go beyond them if they didn't get on board and so
in some ways was a convenient excuse the excuse was that the republicans after two weeks hadn't given anything so their explanation as we tried the pressure we had wasn't sufficient so we have to go back now there's two ways of looking that you could say yeah that's a logical conclusion they tried and now we have to pivot but with people from below
argue i think correctly is no there's an alternative would you do you have to deepen the mobilization there's all sorts of possibilities to deepen the mobilization for instance what about state workers state workers have been screwed just as bad and there was push for a state workers initially to come out in the first day of like of walk the walk at so that happened and there is cause for that they didn't do that
there was also the case that if you keep the strike going the pressure would mount on the politicians to cave really what this was isn't and durant test he's going to stay out longer unforeseen the leadership
through in the towel really before the ranks we're ready and i think before the struggles
was over
what's interesting to me is that they got the pay raises and where they in in leadership during in the towers on improving the schools usually people only like teachers when they are you know seemingly these selfless people who are willing to work for absolutely nothing
but they are
you know they're their their sympathetic when they're saying we need these conditions to teach children this is sort of
i mean again they they walked away from the table at least the leadership dead but it is interesting that they got a big pay raise i mean was the pages so low that like public opinion was just like had to concede that no one could survive offer
yeah the conditions for teachers in particular were so bad that even before the strike there was talk amongst republicans that we have to give them something the obstacles has been that you have to have a seventy five percent super majority in oklahoma to pass any tax increases and so despite so
some of the modern republican saying yeah we should give some pay raises for years now
there have been institutional block the strike was sufficient the threat of a strike was sufficient to a forest everybody to grant the teacher periods but even then even then it barely makes up for the years of no pay increases whatsoever and it doesn't do anything to the conditions in the schools so the pay is great
poop through that like that's a real difference here and people feel good about that but what do you do if you still have no functioning chairs in your classes still these textbooks people might have seen his pictures of over a decade before you have ceilings falling in so in those conditions it's understandable why teachers would want to stab him
students would want their teachers to stay up for their own conditions as well here
on the issue though of of concessions and least the the pay raise which as you mention shows that the a straight can accomplish way more than not striking would have but by comparison to west virginia when we talk to that teacher
he said that their main thing was they wanted to pay raise to be funded by a new tax and when it ended up happening is the pay raise ended up being funded by cuts elsewhere which is sort of a pyrrhic victory because if you're raises getting paid for with cuts the social services and things that people would otherwise be sympathetic to you rely on they begin to
blame you for the first place so that they weren't able to get a new revenue source to pay for their increased by how do that
how did that check out in oklahoma
the first in west virginia it's a little bit more complicated there was a surplus of a lot of the funds that paid for the raise it wasn't that it came out of deep new so that got pushed by the republicans as a way also to spin it when they conceded and the actual amount of cuts was relatively minor so that's importance
which isn't to say that the issue you raised his secondary it's actually crucial because clearly there has to be increase revenue both in west virginia and in oklahoma if the teachers winning anything is not going to come on the backs of other people so that issues very central still in west virginia in oklahoma the dynamic is as follows
the cuts to
busy of the tax breaks upwards of estimation is that one point five billion dollars a year or last from the tax breaks that have been passed just in the last ten years that is a huge astronomical amount of money that plus the really low level of taxation that goes on on oil and natural gas these are the conditions in which there is a cool
don't quit funding crisis
people aren't dumb people see that if you looked at the signs that people up from below lesser the union leadership but the signs that people have said money for schools not for oil companies
and people know that the funds or their students know that their funds are there it's a question of putting the pressure on the corporations and the politicians that are bought by them to can see this so
the demand has been for instance in oklahoma you have to pay for the schools for instance by raising was called the g p t which is that
the it's basically a tax on extracting oil and natural gas right now
up until just as last concession that was made to pass the pay raise it was at two percent which even just three years ago it was at seven percent said the big concession that now the republicans gave to pay for this race only brought it up to five percent of didn't go to where it was just a few years ago people are talking if they were added tax oil
and natural gas can measure level to texas or alaska they would have literally hundreds of millions dollars to pay for schools so it's just a question of political will and political pressure to force them
wondering if you could talk a little bit about the politics of the striking teachers now in west virginia we haven't a very good authority that they're quite a few milton leftists involved in coordinating that strike
you wrote in
an article and jackman called reddit bahama about a sort of
a history of left activism go home and that isn't really present but it does seem length there is potential for that growing at this point now and i think also i want to have to say this point because people are extremely insistent on sorry that's wales cat
his senior year
they offer you a lovely
oh oh yeah people you to
it just paint the entire middle of the country with a broad brush and there's this sense of like they're red states and blue states and the twain shall meet could you talk a little bit about the political landscape the idea
people and between because are these dupes of the republicans is clearly widespread it's also been very disproven by recent events
people need to wrap their heads around that that mass strikes that we're seeing our by these so called
really people have been written off for decades now and we see is when there's actually a class perspective put forward people season it meant in west virginia we saw that a lot of the people who were on strike but if a child
these are not by any means imagination radicals are left us or even liberals yeah so the question of just their sheer material interest in not having to leave the state and being able to pay rent plus they're very sincere
commitment to their students both in west virginia in oklahoma push them to fight back irrespective of what they might think about the republicans many of whom they voted for it even very recently so the difference i see in west virginia in oklahoma is that there is somewhat still have a as he mentioned a living leftist militant labour to
edition in west virginia and i think that it's a little exaggerated sometimes there a really romantic view west virginia that doesn't actually correspond to the
recently i've been very recently that labour tradition
was pretty dormant and yes and so when you when you're actually on the ground right to work past people didn't try to fight for that so sometimes there's a danger of explaining west virginia's as anomaly because everyone there just remembers the coal mine or as and that's not really what's going on have a very small group of radicals who correctly
beginning in november started oriented towards a straight and i think there's big lessons there because what you see in oklahoma there was also radicals in oklahoma who have organized but they weren't involved in labor and i think this is a crucial lesson for anybody who wants to revive the socialist movement or working class movement is the role of a small group of
dedicated radicals in the labor movement is crucial if you don't have that then you get oklahoma right now in which workers were just as militant the support was just as high but the accumulated organizing experience and lessons that the leadership of radicals in west virginia was able to push forward through the struggle hasn't existed and oklahomans one of the reasons why it's
more disorganized and why the strike appears to be at an impasse yeah you brought up one of my favorite blake buzzwords earlier which is spontaneity people i i think now really love the idea of like elevate is spontaneous protests which is like one not true
like it's these things require like a lot of planning and to i deeply insulting because the amount of coordination and especially experience that goes into this is is just mind blowing and the problem with the union organizing to is that you are actually going to lose more battles than you win
that's especially now
you you loose some things in you make mistakes and you start to build organizational capacity and then you do better next time
do you think that this could be sort of like a long fight kind of kind of situation will clearly the struggle on a national level isn't over and even in oklahoma
there's no way of saying what will happen on monday and and the struggle by no means an imagination is over people are mobilized and there is a dynamic when when you have a mass drag no matter what happens the amount of people who have gotten politicize in the span of two weeks is really remarkable started to put that genie back in the bottle right
people have a sense of power no matter what happens people have a sense of power that's gonna be hard to dissipate so i think both in oklahoma and more generally what we see after west virginia is a real strike way it is a strike wave and the ripple effects of that are continuing very probably just this coming monday there's going to be a walk out of teach
teachers in colorado arizona is still potentially planning a strike north carolina is going to have a walk in may so you see is because these conditions of attacks and public education or said generalized the sense that these aren't inevitable that you can fight back and when that you can strike and when that idea has already caught and i think
we should expect that to continue to rumble across different states the big question is how we get that to the clinic cup blue states where you have entrenched liberals who don't want that to happen and that hasn't happened yet and that's going to require more organization as the as this moves to other states you alluded briefly to what some alternatives to and electoral model or just
members remember in november as being kind of a dead and you alluded to some other alternatives for these other states what were your advice be about what a winning strategy that has a potential to win would look like
right well the diverse and it says people are really like too much advice from new york are saying what i'm going to be a little i'll be a little general on this the conditions on the ground are very particular in every place and one of the things i would say about oklahoma is the danger in assuming that there is a model that you just
one two three facebook group strike bam you in that being said there some general lessons that we can point to one is clearly
strikes work
this is maybe controversial in the labor and what shouldn't be but the idea that the way you're going to win is by withholding under labour has not been an idea to save at least that widely accepted that the norm and that labour movement generally has been lobbying the democrats work within the legal confines that exist and it's been a dead end
the first thing is strikes work even threats of strikes work and that also requires breaking the law
the law right now
his makes it almost impossible to have a successful work stoppage
particularly when it's not just in one job
so i think if you're talking about the necessity for the need to break labor law the need for solidarity one of the big reasons that west virginia succeeded and why oklahoma such widespread what's such widespread support is that the teachers clearly weren't just fighting for themselves they were fighting for staff workers that all of the people on the education system and they were fighting for
more broadly in west virginia healthcare for all right which is obviously an issue for most working class people and they're fighting for students the working class movement historically has been for the class as a whole and not just for the individual workers involved in bringing back that level of melon see that level of solidarity those are generalizing lessons how you do that as as
civic moment in place it's probably best left up to organizers matters here but i think that there's a lot of inspiration at the very least going to disagree with you and say they should definitely listen to people from new york city in brooklyn and particular about everything on this and with this show only this show may or may not be wearing their slippers their grandpa celebrities insider now
i'm inside of slippers or for not everything but definitely labour strategy and salsa
we make the best salsa and fossil and now as a supposed to wear slippers
i remember
i think is no is nevada it emerged under said
and a labour talk said people are really concerned about breaking the law but when you actually like bridge the topic in your lake
you said they're like we can't break the law of cigarettes that guards item break the law like just break the law
she later repercussion who she is that there might be repercussions and you should measure out do a cost benefit analysis but this is fundamentally you know what a moral fight that you're doing and sometimes that involves breaking the law one of the really remarkable things in west virginia was the amount of people had signs
explicitly tying their struggle and breaking the law to the civil rights movement so you have a lot of lily white teachers who many of them probably voted for trump and who you could easily dismissed as backwards racist reactionaries which i don't think is generally the case
holding up signs saying rosa parks was right to break the law we should do the same thing so there's a level of continuity with the civil rights movement that i didn't expect and which again undercuts this idea of deep red state conservatism that people are such and trench racists and dupes of the republicans aren't capable of understanding solidarity with other people or even their own uninsured
just wanted to ask if there was any kind of across state coordination it seems like people are in contact but i can't tell how formal it is obviously a lake
west virginia has been building this kind of for lack of a better word parallel union structure that is more active and militant into the left of the union leadership for a very long time
and oklahoma has not but it does seem like they're sharing notes
would you say you've seen any of that are spoken that anyone who says as much oh definitely well
the first thing that says just because the strike was so recent everyone follow it very closely
the level of knowledge of what happened there
my score activists was relatively widespread and there's been because of facebook to one of the good things about facebook has allowed for people to have these back and forth relatively easily so yeah there has been active discussions west virginian leaders really to their credit see this as a national movement and feel a responsibility to reach out
two strikers elsewhere there's been a real outpouring of solidarity
hundreds maybe thousands this point of solidarity photos including by west virginian teachers you it is really kind of hearing can't where you have teachers taking their time off to say we're with the oklahoma and they really do see that they really feel like they started something and the amount of discussion has grown a lot and
i think also one of the things that we're seeing more now is that with the oklahoma straight potentially having reached an impasse or it's unclear what's happening
there's more interest in learning what actually happened in west virginia it was maybe was more difficult so even just this last weekend is very intense discussion the monks west virginian straight leaders the militants with people in oklahoma on how to organize a wildcat or what they actually do it wasn't just facebook so i think that sometimes maybe it made it look too easy
west virginia just as you said just spontaneous people rose up and then you'll have that idea it's never to every time you straight you when it's clearly is not the case and it's also clear not the case that it's easy to organize it strikes they just systematically made right tactical move after right tackle move in west virginia for months and that type of organizing that type of political strategy is
is hard for others to replicate without learning from them so luckily they are reaching out and i think we should expect more of that well because people are having a you said we learn what it means to even have a labor movement like literally i mean people even the few people left in this country who are members of union
like that basically just means dues and them you sign off on the contract the idea that carries any more of a deep responsibility or you know action that's kind of been so lost that it's like it's play dead nerves being sort of reignited to even try to figure out which means if you say west virginia is going to be very important because
if oklahoma does end up being sort of a disappointment then all these other nascent movements and these other states are gonna have to deal with that and not be discouraged too much and so there has to be learning like you say from the other movements that are room have been more successful races there's different ways you can look
you could look at this and say well was virginia
was on one off right they had labour tradition and they one that's not going to happen anywhere else i think that's not the case and the proof will be in the putting we'll see what happens in arizona
in other states but really the factor that change it was the level of organization and that is hard to build but it's doable and luckily some of these other states are also learning not just from west virginia but also oklahoma now and they haven't by a by everything we've seen they haven't thrown in the towel
in other states yet in fact that continues to spread so the political generalization of all of these experiences is going to be ongoing for months and luckily we can actually have these debates now rate in the past we had to discuss thirties or what happened back then and seemed like the distant past for tens of thousands of men
titans teachers and young people and socialist were able to look at what's actually happening and try to draw the lessons i think that's very exciting
yeah i think it's just it's incredibly exciting to me these i've been waiting for very long time for people to be like oh remember these old tools like the strike in the slow down in santa to hush things like that those worked and those are still the tools at work and we have to do i mean capital is very cagey so we still have to be creative and organizing
and everything but it's still the same tools and
literally only workers can shut it down a lot of unions if i think shifted over the shredded you sort of kind of social movement based staff which has been very kind of mixed at best and you've been generous yeah it's it's been a big fucking failure
and i understand because you want to go where the fire is and you're like well people are marching in the streets with this and that and if we do this and we can associate nino build off their fire that it flake know this kind of like general free floating sentiment is she's never going to give you the
kind of material political power that a militant organized
labour and with them well
that's the big lesson i think is that still our power is primarily at the workplace and our ability to withhold labour now that is a really simple thing we don't need to reinvent the wheel but that as an idea is something that even most socially i would argue in the country haven't yet been fully one too
there's this idea that there's a bunch of different struggles we're going to support a are which is great i think we showed we need a fight against all forms of oppression we need to do all of that at the same time when need be strategic where do we focus our energy where do we focus our work and that hopefully will be a lesson that can be learned from this is that yeah if we're going to fight and win and not just fight
bear moral witness then we need to have a real base in working class communities and workplaces that are strategic and i think that's teaching health care and logistics and either that's not it's not a mystery people have an argument is proven the putting balances question of doing it yeah nurses teachers truckers drive or is things that are not easily replaced we really do have
be strategic about this stuff
thank you so much for joining us talking about the teacher strikes in oklahoma and now awfully much of the rest of the country as well we have to be in touch again because
keep happening producers have passed through the note chopper trap else does not support industrial sabotage

can
then wrong
one nine

the
and


everyone this is virgil taxes with a special bonus episode today which will be talking about issue that's very familiar to me canning specifically then cannon candidate for the united states congress in indiana his ninth district than as a civil rights lawyer running to win a competitive primary on may eighth for the democratic nomination to take
on freshman congressman and wealthy fails entre hollingsworth tray is an entrepreneur from tennessee by which i mean he founded companies with this multimillionaire father's fortune that father joe hollingsworth also purchase the congressional seat for tray spending upwards of one point five million dollars on a super pac in the last election than thank you for coming on today
now performing it's your biography i want to talk a little about his district in the ninth is in the southeast part of the state a kentucky containing suburbs of louisville in indianapolis largest city i believe as bloomington
it is a racially homogenous district some ninety one percent white largely a republican district based on past election results in the last election then i voted for drop a sixty one percent of the vote to hillary's thirty four
from for out running tray hollingsworth only pulled fifty four percent of the vote now last time i interviewed a congressional candidate kang yelling he was running to represent a district and white i've never been to that district very blue district but i am very very familiar with it from those episodes a full house where they go to hawaii it's girls spam and the beach boys
thing fire dancing right
i have a perfect understanding what wide voters' concerns are which is volcano abolition that's sort of thing i do not have any similar understanding of southern indiana i don't know what the economy's like what the density is what sort of jobs people have what opportunities are are or are not for people my generation what struggles are unique to that area so dan my first question for you is what does indiana's
ninth district mean to you
the same of what what's going on in hawaii it's mostly volcano evolution
we're trying to get spam macadamia nuts
there and available and abundant supply
despite the homogeneity of of the district
racially a man i think it is so diverse district in terms of
the way in which we have to
in which we choose our messaging how we talk to people what we present in different parts of the so it's thirteen counties
from louisville to indianapolis basically and including are you bloomington should and are you
june ish very progressive the university
i wish you could proceed trending democratic socialist at the moment
you know and then you've got the sort of blue dog democrats in the south in the upper middle class types in the north and then there's a whole lot of rural area and the middle
so it's a challenge to me minutes or messaging challenge
you know everybody's concerned about health care of course everybody's concerned about the opie would crisis because it affects everybody and scott counties in my district and that's the county that was notoriously got national headlines for
having a now higher rate of hiv with the rate of each of us actually gone up in recent years
just ravage hope you yeah yeah
i mean that's that's something that is going on and people are talking about all the other than that you have pretty diverse things what are you know in the middle jobs are a big deal
in the north there's a lot of talk about infrastructure so
it's a challenge it's surge two hours in any direction it's a lot of driving and a lot of different kind of people whom the but a lot of good people and i think that's
we can talk to those good people and convinced them that we are looking out for them i think we went with the fable trump country that i've heard so many tail
new yorker
we get questions all time low i had you appeal to rural voters and hey you're going to get to all these republican voters and you know i personally think that we're going to have a lot of previously known voters and marginal voters and we're going to come out for the ocean and in were you know of course we're we're still talking about how do we
reach to the center but i don't think that's particularly productive conversation to be happening and yet they ought to be trying to get people out that we couldn't get before well for my analysis and the parents are building in the democratic direction very very sharply suburban voters
oh and as and republican loyalists are moving didn't the democratic column
lot of the white working class voters in the rust belt post industrial midwest areas that flipped from hillary to trump are returning home which all which points to a wave the incumbent hollingsworth one by what thirteen percent now
i would project that to be the swing yeah yeah
the i think this will be right on the costs well we had a congressional candidate and twenty six sixteen
fourteen points better than hillary to so i think that those odds looked pretty good
when you when you're considering that this guy was essentially riding the coattails in two thousand and sixteen
it is he he not very popular generally not particularly i mean he came in and bought out a republican primary from established in and republicans so even the folks on his own team don't yeah particularly yeah those fracture is still exists now yeah
you mentioned blue dog democrats and the destroying our they are successful down valid
yeah and you know what one of the biggest challenges that we're running into this like on in trying to meet his to get people to fill those down ballot
also so you're you're dealing with the situation in my district where
we haven't run democrats were a lot of the seeds in years and sometimes and decades just because they been republican stronghold seat
you know that there's been a big part of what we've tried to do in this campaign is is i think we've got about ten volunteers at have morphed from being volunteers for the campaign into being candidates in different places a lot of district and so yeah
that sort of reverse cocktail thing will work in our favor know absolutely i mean you have the tail wins on i i think any democratic and eight has can rely on these tail wins that after that it's all hustle talent that kind of thing messaging
but what will talk about campaign itself often a little bit late let's get to you
dan about you
civil rights lawyer
oh what is what are some highlights from your career
oh nothing too big
yeah
i came
to be civil rights learned sort of unconventional way i guess and went into it like most lawyers do to sort of not sure what to do with myself i'm wanting to do something helpful and so had to hit the big career default but after college we went to law school
i'm in thinking that i was going to go to work for a nonprofit
some to go something like that
and ended up being a trial lawyer working in a small plane us from doing mostly employment discrimination whistle blower type case
discrimination sex discrimination that going to at first
in short of his transition into inmates rights cases and police brutality stuff over the years
so lots of what we call constitutional litigation and as a result of doing that kind of work and sort of branding myself as a civil rights leader over the years and we got involved with doing the marriage cases in marriage equality cases than happened out of kentucky and indiana and the one out of kentucky actually went on to the united states
supreme court
the case now it's will bear to fail vs hodges that's how people know it but result in a marriage equality and off at the state
so that which was kind of a big deal
we didn't get a chance to celebrate that much because a couple of weeks later we
if you were listeners know about kim davis and eastern kentucky
we filed bad case and i teach at law school and i tell my first year law students when i was sitting where you guys are i legitimately never expected to have the rock band survivor issue a public statement on a case that i was working on over my legal career but that's what happened and the kim davis case
that was the same
we do not condone kim davis's use of the song i have the tiger
i don't remember that oh go to court with a boom box
she came out of jail with a boom box
there was a public rally when she came out of jail and shoot sugar for a couple of days and then she comes out and it's like mike huckabee and ted cruz looking dejected on the stage and it's like this big booming round of the tiger and yes survivor issued to public statements and
we're not cool with that and and like the next day waking up like really all just happen yesterday that the rock band survivor religious even so there's that in that cases the case it won't die it's still going on
pills
during the twenty sixteen election and there was a guy you may remember a candid
who was holding lots of rallies nationwide
lots of races attended i guess it didn't really narrow it down all that much but anyway
continually particularly raucous candid that came to love all and invited a soothing mob of white supremacists to beat up my black client who is there to peacefully protest him
and so they took him up on that imitation and so we shoot home
before he became the leader of the free world and the white supremacist the beat her up and his campaign and so that that got a lot of attention on twenty four hour news was that lawsuit going right now
although for the court of appeals so we won the first round was which was basically them trying to say that
trump has got a first amendment right to ask members of his audience to attack people in the protest and the judge pretty conservative judge in kentucky so no actually it doesn't have that right that's not how the first memory works in week quite agree with that but that that issue is being considered up of the sixth circuit right now as a federal case
yup
what if you were elected to congress will you continue seeing the president the i mean i think i'd have to withdraw from that guy
have to withdraw from everything as i understand people in congress or technically very busy
you are also involved and told in the medical marijuana law suit against the state of the correct discuss that yeah we filed suit under a provision of the kentucky constitution
to invalidate the prohibitions against medical marijuana and so we've got some really cool clients for that you know people that have lived in a couple other states and been patients and then they move back to their home stay in their considered criminals something happens in kentucky and indiana
and we've got a vietnam veteran that it takes medical marijuana for p s d and it's the only thing that helps him not have nightmares the we've got another guy who used to be a high school football coach that found himself as so many people do just all of a sudden one day addicted to opiates it's because the only thing he can get prescribe
try to manage chronic pain
so you know
and i really even know that much about medical marijuana for a couple of years ago when i start work on this case loose there's there's a big need for that there so we're all trying to get there by hook or by crook i gotta i gotta say cool mean something very different to trial lawyers it does to most people when he sighs and cool clients i thought oh weird old jerry garcia
well i mean
not so much it's not there's been very little of the
the sort of cheech and chong type of stereotypes new associate what what is that provision in the constitution
section two that is provision against arbitrary government it
now how has your legal were contribute to the development of your political ideas
yeah that's a hell of a question
i mean i think you know what i've had to do throughout my legal career is is take care of people so i'm interested in policies that take care of people you know
in in terms of how that
gets to where i am now i mean i think that we're we're dealing with a landscape
where you know you've got an executive that is pointing maniac judges to the federal court which is where i practice and they're going to be there for the rest of their lives yeah and it's like we can get and we can litigate these cases on behalf of individuals and we can try to vindicate civil rights you know all we want to but if we have judges that just don't care about the law and just don't care
about people
help us whole lot so i mean there's gotta be standard of accountability establish through the other branches of government i'll absolutely i mean i am a proponent of oil is oh man i recognize that's where a lot of the formal actual power in society as and when you have a president who is nominating just twenty seven year olds with no
legal experience often have been banned from dave and busters to the federal bench that are they getting rubber stamped in we're going to have to live without for probably our entire lives yeah i mean these are guys that are not qualified to preside over you know a meeting of a rock garden
so i mean the idea that we would have to practice in front of them and like something something like marriage to me some like the marriage case or a marijuana is or something like that where
that could have gone very very differently in a marriage case itself could have gone very differently in front of one of these trump point the judges than it did in front of the bush appointee that we have yeah let's go on to some issues regarding that and medical marijuana law suit you support the legalization of marijuana but you also supported in order to treat the oil crisis
can you describe how the old
i'll be on addiction has acted this district in indiana oh yeah absolutely and well it's been devastating and part of the connection there i mean if you look at the twenty nine states and dc that have some provision for medical marijuana meaningful provisions for american medical marijuana
i mean you see overdose rates drop by as much as twenty to twenty five percent really no states in a lot of it
a lot of is just common sense if you look at the way in which people get hooked on opie ways to begin with by a large it's a lot from least they're getting prescribed fist force of pills
from doctors that don't have any other choice to but the to prescribed opie way pills for managing chronic pain so it doesn't take very long to get addicted to that stuff and it's not terribly difficult to overdose on
and these pain will formulations are more powerful today than they were in the past yeah
the law of diminishing returns here too you know where where i mean it's just like my client i told you about in kentucky where you know he's taking pills and he doing what the doctor tells him to do and then six months later you wake up and realize oh i'm addicted to opium
i have a problem with this stuff and you know the whole manufacturers know that we need to pursue greater liability and expanded liability for those manufacturers
but the medical marijuana pieces it's not a cure all but it's it's it's it's a big part of something to wear somebody has a an option for treating chronic pain that isn't just an opiate so i cringe every time i hear these guys call marijuana a gateway drug because it's only a gateway drug because there's a black market in otherwise it's and
exit drug you see people successfully get off of of opiates of they have some other tool to manage chronic pain you know i just came from the west coast and were all three states that we visited at legal marijuana stores clean nice boozy store you can walk into and get tree
sheets and rapes and and just we'd right there he did on the street you know and my colleague mad said it's just it's just so civilized you made it was in chaos and anarchy and
it was born jobs getting married to each of it was dole it was like going to have small pharmacy honestly is the novelty wore off in like five seconds if i mean that sounds pretty boring maybe i should abandon them
when most people have come around to that even a lot of people in the republican party yet know i think so
that's a great example though of something that has huge bipartisan support among people on the ground and elected officials have both parties
still see it as being the sort of taboo thing when i first started running we were out and proud about marijuana support from the very beginning and it caused me to lose some support among some old guard democrats and because all around
want to give me a serious candidate
yeah it was support for legalization is what's something the sixty percent nationwide but we don't have a legislature that votes sixty percent for the legalization of marijuana medical as a no brainer
about eighty or ninety percent of yeah absolutely so bernie sanders is going to final bill that imposes stiff criminal penalties for these drug executives and are quote from an article here and this was a fact that was just genuinely amazing to me mckesson this is from stat news mckesson a drug this
said to have ship five million old boy pills or west virginia town with four hundred residents over two year span now i have not followed the old boy who issue as closely as many people have so that a staggering to me though yeah
and it's staggering
becoming more and more aware of the malfeasance on the part of these pharmaceutical companies and as well
it strikes me as more profoundly evil than anything big tobacco is die if not worse
well that's that's a pretty high bar and i'm pretty mad at big tobacco but yeah no army the point is well taken
and i mean that's part of the problem know
there is no national system for monitoring this stuff either really well
in indiana somebody can easily just drive down to florida and you know get a couple of prescriptions and come right back up and nobody knows that even that they're getting this stuff legitimately here's a little about the bill legislation will impose a ten year minimum prison sentences and finds equal to an executive compensation package if the individuals company has found to have a legally country
repeated the obesity crisis it would also oppose an additional fine on those companies have seven point eight billion one tenth the annual costs of the crisis birth thousand and sixteen estimates that a bill you would support i absolutely so the scuttlebutt is that while the last big legislative push before this congress has turned over to the democrats this year is going to be about all the lights and the
public and plan is near as i can tell is just an increase on the war on drugs now when you talk to people in your district about the old be like crisis a district that probably falls conventionally to the right of center somewhere do do people clamor for more criminalization or what what what do people what i mean for the most part no i think people realize by en la
large you know it's get it's another example of the disconnect between elected officials and what's actually going on in peoria right
so i think people by and large realized the war on drugs has been a massive failure and you know there's not anybody out there has been affected in some way shape or form a friend or family member you know everybody knows somebody that's that's that's fallen victim to this one thing that we've been talking
campaign trail is how do we sort of rise to the cultural challenge of picking this thing up out of the criminal justice box all together and moving over to the public health pots where it belongs when you say that in no uncertain terms to people they get it i think from the most part they get in we are slowly
coming around to the idea that this is not simply a moral failing thing this is not simply something that we can treat through the criminal justice system that we actually need to have real public health solutions for it
it's easier for people to process that unfortunately because they've seen so much of it in their own lives and their own families
and if you have to you know if you have to tend to a relative that it's had an overdose or if you have
your brother or sister or son or daughter that's gone to jail for the fiftieth time for you know and that's the only kind of treatment that they can get
you see that not work over and over and over and over again you know people sort of get the idea that we need new solutions you begin to understand what's really wrong with the criminal justice system and using that to solve every social ill yeah exactly well how do you talk to people about of a broader vision of social services of health care i mean
how do you feel about that
oh about healthcare specifically all about health care are generally i mean you're talking about turning the boy
opiate addiction from a issue of the justice system of criminality to an issue of public health and that necessarily means a discussion of the health infrastructure in the country and specifically in your district
sure i mean i think the the way we've approached it would just about everybody
is to say we americans deserve a healthcare system in which nobody has to go bankrupt or die because they can't pay a medical bill
and then from there we can start to talk about what that might look like
oh think it's also useful for us to ask the question of who doesn't deserve healthcare is it is the poor is it you know is it seniors
you know people who who can't work i mean who doesn't deserve healthcare
is that it's something that's just a luxury good that should be provided to a privilege fuel or is it really something that everybody on some level is entitled to and then we can work from there the i think almost nobody would say that that you know just because you can't afford to pay a medical bill you should go bank robberies you lose your entire life savings you should lose lose everything into you ever worked for
for or you should die because you know you're too scared to go to the doctor
most people not everybody but most people would say that we need a system that's better than that
i think that once we come to that agreement we can build on that obviously we've we've talked a lot about were still in the primary honeymoon phase right so we're talking a lot about single payer healthcare
that is free of the point of service that comprehensive and all that good stuff
i think that that's what we that's the idea that we need to normalize start shooting for i think that's a persuasive way to frame the issue isn't now on may eighth that's your primary primaries had a close primary it's an open primary in indiana okay any party
okay know you can you can pull you can pull a ballot for the democratic pull him out for the republicans
gotta pick one
right let's shift gears from and talk about ice and the immigration issue right now you i'm told have been involved in litigation involving immigrants and refugees and right
could you talk about that were yeah absolutely i have represented immigrants and refugees in some capacity for my entire legal career
a lot in employment cases because it's very easy for employers to take advantage of immigrants and refugees if they want to
but more recently in sort of emigration type
situations and what we've seen is what i've seen anywhere on the ground in indiana and kentucky is is increased enforcement
against your peaceful people who are not otherwise community a crime and who are not engaged in any sort of a nefarious what we think of his nefarious conduct
you know what we're seeing ice come in and scoop them up of the parking lots of their apartment buildings or where they work or whatever because they don't have the right pieces of paper to be and the country and there is no way for a lot of these folks to to get your quote unquote the right way
i can tell her story after horror story
there was a guy under represented there was from a central american country and his his village had been essentially over run by a drug cartel they chased him out of his house chased him and his family's house
and so they all came to the united states and
his he will arrive separately from his wife his wife had successfully applied for asylum
and in he had not figured out how to go through that process
the and been here for a couple of years and i think it was in january it was right off the elections he scooped up ice taken away from his family he was the sole source of support for their family
taken away from his family in in don't ninety miles away in a jail and boon county kentucky
and you know we treat people that are here without the right pieces of paper that are just trying to feed their families we treat them worse than the worst criminals that that we have that are us citizens
so you don't know under no set of circumstances would you ever take somebody and take them hundred miles away from their family give them fifteen minutes of visitation a week or whatever it was and then just randomly move them to different places in the united states where they're even farther away from their families but that's exactly what happens to
undocumented immigrants and this country when they get apprehended by so this guy gets moved from boon county kentucky where he's locked up in general population with everybody else is accused of everything else moved up to a commercial wisconsin to a jail up there with alto and his lawyer without telling anybody that has happened was just steal him away in the middle of the night
and then i think he ended up in a state facility in louisiana i mean this is this is somebody who signed a voluntary deportation order says
yeah okay go ahead you got me send me back and you still spending months in several different jails
getting medical attention and not having anybody that can speak his language not having access to a lawyer
if he didn't have a volunteer lawyer that was doing it and most of them don't
and eventually gets sent back to his village which is still over a drug cartel
it's fantastically despicable system that we have and i think most people don't have much experience with because especially in the middle of the country our communities tend to be very segregated big what's the next population there in southern indiana but there's not much of an overlap and the van diagram between the next people in the white folks
so we don't know about ice we don't know what they're going we don't know about these sort of gestapo style tactics that are going on and you know we've got i've got a unique position in this campaign and i can talk about that
we can tell people about it we can educate people that i think by and large if if decent people knew what was going on their own backyards they be outraged about rightly so
being follow the dream act debates and the shutdown brinksmanship it seems like for congressional democrats they're beginning negotiating position is we want permanent residency and not citizenship even permanent residency for the good immigrants
for the ones who came here as children through no fault of their own what get implying that is an egregious thing i thought on the first place live and who go to college and who are just nice clean people who will never get arrested even for an arbitrary reason and the law and they lost they lost that it's i believe is only
through court orders that
dreamers are somewhat safe right now
what's your position about undocumented people in this country though i think that we need a clear path to citizenship in
that's another example you can come up with countless examples i think and that's something i have learned throughout the course of this campaign where there's just a huge disconnect between people that are that are in positions of power and you know real people on the ground right
bipartisan support for a clean dream act is huge
and in there's there's an ample bipartisan support for a path to citizenship most people in fact already think that it exists
some way for somebody wants to during the country to gold are pursuing citizenship the quote on quote right way
when in fact there just isn't a way to do that and we most people i talked to in indiana think that they're it
so i think that we've got an obligation to start talking about that sort of talking about the sort of inherent weaknesses in our immigration system and him but more importantly to take the moral high ground on what we are doing to people who are here in they are peaceful and they are simply seeking a better life for their families you know it strikes me that the
people who would disagree with that position
the people i see them online who cheer you know people being dragged away from the families and brought out the country are people would never vote democrat
exactly so why bother compromise with that brutal an idealistic point of you know i mean in to the contrary we should be going on the offense on it we know that they're going to hit us with are already him jail donnelly in indiana with these ridiculous much thirteen it and there's all this immigration fear mongering and we gotta take control that message we've got to take control and message and
look there's there's right and wrong and we need to play the good samaritan here for for people that are here
they've simply got the wrong pieces of paper to be here let's help them get the right pieces of paper if they just want a better life for their families and and that's what we ought to be able to offer here in america
you know and that fear mongering you know obviously didn't work last year and the virginia gubernatorial election yeah that's right i mean i think that by sharing these things by taking a solid moral position
on something that is in my view as much of a no brainer as is cutting the legs off of ice and not having a secret police force that's just a brute squad to carry on a mission of ethnic cleansing
taking the taking the moral high ground on that is going to bring out new voters
know we've already registered seventeen thousand people to loud just threw my campaign alone her
long since last august
and that's i mean if those people show up at the polls it's going to be because they were excited about something it's not just because they want to vote against the incumbent or they're scared by the until they're scared about what the republicans are doing so there's snow that's going to drive a lot of people who oppose to but we have to provide a positive agenda that is based on the idea that we stand for something that we stand for humor
right so we stand for human values that we actually are going to do the right thing when we're not we're in office nobody thousand is quite impressive figure if i recall correctly the
difference between the republican democrat and when the fourteen the last mid term your was what fifty thousand something like that
in a be republican wave know what we in indiana we had a miserable two thousand and fourteen we were number fifty out of fifty in voter turn out and i think that i mean obviously that's bad but it suggests to me that we can do a lot better there are a lot of people out there that are just not motivated to vote and we have to figure out why and
get a moment so
me and i assume it strikes me to that isis totally unaccountable at this point and what do you propose we do with ice
i mean why do we need to why why do we need to spend billions of dollars
on
a again you're the sort of brute squad that is there to remove people
we have law enforcement that takes care of the violent criminals we have law enforcement already that takes care of gangs we have a border patrol
do we really need to spend eight billion dollars plus of public money on you know a a a secret police force that is accountable to no one that supports american citizens you know something like four thousand american citizens and green collar cardholders by accident
a year because they don't have access to counsel
kicks in doors that terrorizes people that breaks up the families do we really need to spend all this public money on that can't we do something better with it
what replaces ice in your mind to handle matters visas immigration things that nature well and we we've already got a system in place to handle issues of pieces and immigration all that stuff we had an ice has only been around since two thousand and three and the border patrol was very effective at keeping people out of the united states before that period of time
the f b i was very good at breaking up gangs
there are the mean these functions are already in place they've been in place for decades so the idea that ice some kind of sacred cow
they're really they're only function is to bust of families and take peaceful non violent people out here we've got for the for the violent offenders there is ample we've got an ample law enforcement answer to that yeah i'm sure most people could not tell you what isis or does one way or the other know i think that's part of the problem
that's part of the bomb us what we need we need to we need to educate them about that's interesting that you talk about enforcement being effective in two thousand and three because that's before the republican party and republican voters really started clamoring against all evidence for stricter border enforcement they started asking for a wall in the two thousands when
bush and mccain tried to pass a comprehensive immigration bill
they started demanding more money for border patrol more agents stay started using these udall races propaganda nonsense about m s thirteen gangs and that kind of shit to scare people and the time and time again throughout this the democrats have been willing to kill
seed so much ground to that position as already faulty and motivated by bad actors and say okay yes or no we want to secure the border to we want which in practice this means throwing more money to border patrol
enforcing stricter more arbitrary and more
undignified measures at our ports of entry more humiliating measures because that's that's easy for them to give that away users
not a strong and sea border you know position reaction in this country and it's all lead to this point where the republican party is now one hundred percent
for the crazies for the races for the you know
we want we demand a wall now that's that's the big thing so what should the left counterbalance position be what would an artist democrat position you know what did the democrats stake
yeah i think that the denny's me ongoing conversation with a kind of goes back to what i was talking about on on we've got to find places where we can play often some not just constantly be on the defensive
you know raised this thing of there's an army of brown people coming over the border and they're going to kill us all and prove us wrong about that
i think you know the counter messaging and a very crude sort of way should be like these are people who are escaping desperation and poverty and war and all kinds of horrible things that we can't even imagine
why why should we not help them give us a good reason why we shouldn't help why you're in the wealthiest country in the history of the world why shouldn't we help them
may i think that you know at it's core message should be something like that
and i think we've got an opportunity to to put them on the defensive with moral messaging about immigration
how we do that is i think has got to be ongoing conversation
abolishing ice is the sort of easy low hanging fruit in my view
if you don't need to gestapo to go out and roundup people to carry out this mission of ethnic cleansing and if if you're saying that's not what it is and that's not what they're doing them prove us wrong
now congress recently passed a faster with widespread bipartisan support a bill that purports to fight sex trafficking what it actually does is a road the section to thirty protection for internet content providers such as facebook or twitter google which immunize is them from legal liability for users do on their platforms now although the law does not go into effect until next year the fall out
has been immediate craigslist has eliminated their personal section reddit a website with suburbs literally devoted to selling old lloyds has eliminated sub raddatz catering a sex workers ward sex workers and others have also rubber their personal clinton been deleted from google drive opposition to says to have asked those mostly come from digital libertarians groups like that yeah fair
you send as rand paul and ron wyden the only through to vote against it widen of course coauthor the section two three language in the nineties but opposition has also been led by sex workers themselves as work will inevitably be made more dangerous for instance will be unable to that clients want each other about violent clients if they are essentially exiled from the internet services that we all use so where do you stand on says
the faster and as a follow up where do you stand on the legalization of sex work yeah wow okay so that
his i'm glad i'm glad that you asked that question i've never been asked that question before i don't think it's something that hasn't come up on the campaign trail
but it's something that i'm aware of and i've been watching him you know what i mean yeah i think that the way in which you phrased your question sort of presupposes the answer you know
we have to listen to a sex workers on and we have to listen to people who are going to be put directly in danger as a result of this act in mean as far as i can tell from people who are actually involved in that industry in the industry is not going on since the important thing about this too is right you know the industry's not going to go away
obviously just because you try to legislated away no matter how you try to do it i mean that as an industry that it's going to be there
so shoving it further and further and further underground is not the answer i think you see that from the
by and large as a response from the people at work
in that industry in we should take their lead on it so yeah i was one of those rare occasions in which i would side with rand paul not unheard of what where
i would have voted against it yeah i want to shift gears and talk more about your campaign your general political thought and what a congressman dank and and might look like are you a member of the usa no
not a card carrying member where their button on my jacket though we are cool but in the local say image that's confusing
it's stealing valor you know yeah listen
i think that they would be proud to know that i order a button hand
but no i mean were endorsed by two separate produce a organizations and i'm proud of that mean i think know it's something that we can't run away from right so i'm not i'm not ashamed that a label and i think that the he's doing great work
and i think that we should be expanding the tent to the democratic party into as a members and the us a philosophy do you will always capitalism or otherwise critical of it
i am i am critical of it in the sense that you know where we've gotten to in the united states this sort of cutthroat capitalism was hyper capitalism were capital is valued over all other things capital is valued over labour capital is valued over our children capital is value over our health and safety and wellbeing and everything else
so in that sense
if that is the way we define capitalism and i would argue that by a large it is in the united states i i say that i'm an anti capitalist in that sense or what do you believe to be why i guess as to questions or what do you believe to be the answer to that in terms of oh i don't know
anything that would not make us all give up your you know look i'm not i'm not a theorist and i'm one of the unknown one of the few i'm glad i didn't want any theorist to run for office i've met era
a few lawyers to that didn't graduate with a political science degree so
and to me i think that we've got the opportunity in this country to to have a government that gives people the tools and opportunities that they need to be able to live their best lives
simple as that and that's what we ought to be striving for and so i don't really care whether you call it
social democracy or socialism or some other kind of this i think if if it works if it's a good policy that demonstrates you know common care for people
basic core human values i am for it if capital has all the power and they have they can spend billions of dollars on the republican party and yes many people in the democratic party
what chance do people have does a largely discouraged non capitalist class have to combat that in the absence of you know mass movements real politics even a political party that is a party for the working class
in the absence of those things you know not much that's why we going to strive to create those things so i mean i guess the answer is we'll see
but we know that are not going to outspend we cannot fight on that battlefield like we know
you can't outspend hauling we're not going to be able to do that it is again that's a multimillionaire that comes from multi generational wealth so we have to pursue other strategies and i mean i think those strategies have got to be at their foundation they've got to the humanizing
they've got to be oriented to basic human rights and human values
we've got to him by that i mean we need to be knocking a lot of doors which we are in this campaign we need to be having a lot of face to face contact we can't afford to fight these battles and the air exclusively and we won't when we know we don't win if we do that
so it's got to be whatever movement building were doing through our campaigns has got to occur primarily on the ground where we're having face to face real human contact and showing people that were not the scary monsters under their belt because that's the propaganda that they are receiving how big is your campaign
how big is it in terms though i have like seven staffers and one thousand plus volunteer out the biggest internship in the history of indiana university bloomington which we sort of stumbled into it's it's it's around i believe three hundred in terms of this point three hundred years it's getting close to that
so i mean it's big and people respond to big ideas
go figure
it goes back to oversee at the beginning i think that people want a positive agenda for the future of america people want to talk about big ideas
people want to talk about revolutionary ideas
inspired inspiring people want to be inspired by something they don't want to just
show up to vote against the other guy
because they they don't the because they like him less than the candidate that they've all right so i mean i think that's that's where we've ultimately going to go and especially young people or inheriting a very raw deal right
so how does your campaign contribute to that general struggle beyond just we're going to like one person to goggles yeah i mean you know in this is something that we've shown from the very beginning is so we we don't run on the idea of of a person getting into office we going on
and ideas themselves right
say that the sewage usually ideas that we have for the future of america these ideas belong to everybody
we are backing them not because they're politically expedient but because they are good ideas
it has to be it goes back to washington has to be more about the ideas than it does about the personality of of anybody involved you still have to be able to get out in the personable and talk to people and have the sort of
the willingness to forge human relationships with some voters and perspective boaters and especially non voters who wouldn't otherwise be inclined to come out and vote for anybody
but but i think you'd have to run in two thousand and eighteen we need to be running idea driven campaign
let's say your elected to congress
for starters what would your constituents services like yeah that is something that we have emphasized since day one and i think it should be job one
a robust constituent services program is really important if we want to turn the swing districts into non swing districts
everytime i get a reporter that as you either win the super republican district isn't this district very read while a democrat in hell this district mainly hamilton held this district for thirty four years and then it's gone back and forth since then
but hilton at a very good constituent services program when you talk to successful congress people that have turned their districts in have been and now are virtually and the fetal in their districts on both sides of the aisle it's it's often because they've got goods constituent services
it's really important for where we are i think right now politically when people do sense that there is such a huge disconnect between the people that make the rules and the people who have to follow them
in and we're in a situation in a democracy where people feel so cut off from the from the institutions that govern their daily lives so cut off from the rulemaking process so cut off from any sort of semblance of control
that it creates a problem and it creates voter apathy and it creates anger and creates all this other stuff that you you see as a result and you can see very clearly in america now and so responsive constituent services program is his job one for me and it's something that is that we've done in this campaign where we've been doing
the locks own arcana trainings and blood drives and homeless clothing drives for the homeless and all this other stuff out of her campaign offices you don't see congress people typically using their campaign offices like that and my question to those congress people is why not you've got a golden opportunity to connect people with resources and
community to provide people with resources that they wouldn't otherwise have and
into just be there as a sounding board and you know so like if if if you need to get grandma so security hearing moved out by a couple of months then call your congressperson if you need help of their passport or obese or call your congressperson if you need to get your cat out of the tree call your congressperson will come and get your can have the right i mean that's the kind of constituent
services program that that everybody should be trying to build on the ground so we have a real future on the left in the midwest and in particular do you think that constituent service is an opportunity to help people organize for instance to show solidarity with the union drive locally grad students at that university yeah
i mean i think we're really just just now getting to the tip of the iceberg of exploring what those possibilities might look like you know i'm excited for my first couple of years and office to really get more into that and see what a good constituent services program can do because i don't think that by and large they have been used to their full potential and i think that are stairs
a whole lot that we can do of course our votes matter in the stuff that we do in dc matters but i think for the long term future of the left in the united states what we do on the ground in our own communities matters whole lot more your money closing remarks nope but thanks i male and a thanks for coming on and can in candidate for united states congress indiana

not read ron paul talking about end the fed and what you've done it nude in a room full of other naked people of the only way it was meant to be read why is the church of satan back in the news because they posted a rage comic into those and eight in so fuck tight it's back in the
felix news yeah i just always have love the jersey because
they like made their branding to do ethic twitter clap barracks like when someone to be like donald trump estate and then we're not affiliated with
so to be like
justin bieber is worse than to say and worship her and they we go big news and it was totally epic and people just thought it was like a goofy twitter thing but now the church and state in israel

well you guys were you in virgil were awake getting getting an award
you guys were in your best behavior as well you know i don't want to go around you know our party high jinks you know upset and the
prestigious stiff upper lip types
university
we were behaving like the marx brothers or for instance you know action cigars into the blouse of a wealthy dowager or anything like that though i did a classic prank
movies i had him was revenge and nerds and i sent a very credible bomb threat to the
yeah they did that in horse feathers
now what are you guys were collecting an award
i guess the thing that happened this week and i don't even know what was happening and so i saw everyone talking about it and you know it's just like oh god
i guess we're going to have to talk about this the white house correspondents' dinner movement weekend
nerd brom gotta love him i was really hoping it would just ask completely on remarked upon but that wasn't the case because you know that comedian they booked rochelle wolf of the daily show
the headlines the last forty eight hours nonstop debate about whether it was whether she was mean sarah how huckabee sanders whether it's ok to be mean to can alchemy sanders what is comedy are comedians heroes and should the whole white house correspondents' dinner be to hit with
you know a living in hell is a lot more boring than i thought it would be yeah
a conversation that is designed to dominate everything on your social media and the news and the news media talking about itself and entertainment and just like our i just i want to turn it all off i don't lick
i don't care about any of it it's just like anyone taking just to her really really hard stance on any of this is just got i just don't know what to make of it while the most and fame thing if if the fan battle star galactica of the path of a whore and all of the full happen again because fame fucking good they happen
people have pointed this out the same thing happened ten years ago with called bear when he the corresponding i believe two thousand and he roasted bush to have faith and everyone was horrified and there was a whole debate about to go too far there is such a thing
of too far where a comedian supposed to go but real have no that actually awful happened when years ago because of in nineteen ninety six don imus was the comic at the white house correspondents' dinner and he did a bunch of jokes about how
bill clinton was a horny freak and that cause the giant wailing and gnashing of teeth revoked
twitter but if there had been everyone wanted a lost their shit
the same fucking argument over and over and nothing ever changes about it if it's enough to make you go and fame because first drunk been elected every bit of real estate in the op ed world have been elite pete media people worrying about the free exchange of ideas oh no
the twitter horde from the campus police they're going to get rid of free speech we're not going to be able to exchange ideas were not going to be a lot a marketplace of free expression anymore
i mean forget the fact that we've got a domestic a stop or running around and i gilded age level inequality or an impending climate catastrophe that could and all fucking life on earth the only thing that mattered these people is whether or not we have enough shape realm work for for
respectful debate because according to these people we can't solve any of these problems unless we have a public debate that can them out our differences and lead us through a harbor mafia and compromise that can be good for the majority of people but this is a perfect example of why that's what complete rod we've had the same
argument for twenty fucking years and it never change it and it can't change it's going to be the same debate in the same side and the same argument over and over and over again because the structure of power in the relationship between the media and the white house with such that these people are always going to feel more social connection with each other then they do with the american people
and or
anybody who makes less than six figures a year for are always going to have this jocular and they're always going to want to be buddies with each other and nothing like the invasion of iraq were a white supremacist president is going to change any of that but that's going to make them uncomfortable crucial they're always going to bring in these comics were try to push the boundaries and then they're going to push too far and the never even a map into a
friend to try to reestablish the boundaries so that we can maintain this convivial relationship but then we have the argument for and nothing can change that because the social and economic structure pc means is that relationship is always going to be there and the debate is just a relief valve could mcauliffe mechanism that will persist as long as the system from does and so there is no
change and has been they're not building that anything the debate isn't creating any movement and indifferent shifting anything it just totally barrel and into them as the marketplace of ideas as much like the free market it's just this illusion of agency disguising it's discouraging a rigid economically determine status quo
that i all your human freedom or even meaningful expression because how his expression meaningful if you can't fucking anything did either as you guys actually watch any whole set
no i saw her abortion joke because concerns
regis and it's like that's a pretty good joke
really not bad but now i'm not watching not going to watch the entire thing that is
everything gives in severe mental illness but i prefer getting mental illness still fight like
i just i can't bring myself to do it but yeah this is the same stimulus and response pattern from the same bottoms eating creatures
it's always seen it's good because it you know
got one hand goes people who work for donald trump
just saying that you cannot be rude your political opponents and just no shame no contradiction nothing and the other
her and like people who think that the height of civil disobedience is late night this yeah oh yeah of expression
yeah i just i mean
we did though we didn't get a good mike huckabee because it was his daughter stake
it was his daughter
you know being rotated on the open fire michelle waltz flaming barbs and he goes
after seeing the young female hired to verbally bullying anyone who works for real donald trump
now understand why he tied pods is so popular
now level vulgarity is best had over with a mouth washed out with so some more tired pods
third pads burgers the tide pods are you shit that is as or happened ever they cannot process and that now without relating it back to tide pirates will they think they think it's like a perfect example of how dumb millennium goals are but i mean like like the all these kids are show
doug their sure condoms sooner those and eating tide pods because the internet told them to and it's like where his back in my day you're just breathing in the exhaust of leaded gasoline and dying and easily preventable car acts like every one of his mother hundred didn't have a fucking pet rock or or a pet dog
from
well i mean i mean that is i mean so most of this controversy or whatever is rotating around sarah huckabee centers right
and did he the show was attack her looks or was it to mean to go after someone who are you know
is that i shall i put this of visually appealing
that's the thing if if they really though conservatives really gave away their own feelings about their offenders because they're really worth of anything in the routine about her being unattractive or her weight or anything they all added that afterwards how much do you want to bet that donald trump has called sarah huckabee centers of pigs
all course
that really made me feel like my brain was melting of yes the same argument we've been having for literally twenty years now but the fact that it still happening when donald fucking trump is president is really what makes me feel like we can't be living in a real universe and the fact to me some sort of dark malaysian i mean literally did the carlos months
the voice and wrist action to someone was terrible for i'm sure the person but the first supposed to think is one of them right now
only care when one of their fellow fucking journalists gifts in any way and convenience and it was one of their precious try who got mark
hey i did he did a mocking our own gesture to a guy with cerebral palsy was a journalist he he wasn't at the fucking thing for a second year in a row he was at the correspondents dinner he was whipping up an arena for swine getting them a flatter who's together about how much the him we're going to come in
destroy their lives because of a conspiracy between democrats and the puck and pratt i mean it's shit again this is so easy to get like i almost hate saying it but it should like you know anyone who works in any presidential administration much less the truth administration did
deserves to be bullied in his or to be insulted so their face and more importantly than that they should be made aware of the fact that they are loads that they are loads some people and that once you pass a certain threshold of both power and evil it really doesn't matter how what
someone insults you or how mean they are two years yeah
he said everyone who's like oh republicans you know oh good but you need a safe space now for almost speech you don't like hearing about it
you when you're really hear what real comedy is about you know why you act afraid of jokes i just got to say actually that's that's very good because there is no such thing as anyone on the last are like liberal side of politics who would ever get angry about jokes or in souls or comedy or anything like that so they're all perfectly on on absolutely
the one hundred percent glacier from ice getting riled up about this or pointing their finger you guys want to hear the mike huckabee parity song i wrote when i woke up today more than entering on the world okay
woke up this morning made yourself opposed to serves arguing over who could kill dog
got the
a million got the shot gunshot more under a blue baby you also need a lotta boot
yeah i woke up this morning tied bug the forty is
died but
you're seventy years old that's the only go you kid
and the tires sopranos it turns him driving through different drive through
oh by the way i need a big boss that people to get to the main through
you need a small meal to get to your bigger
or else you're going to be too hungry to think about what your ordered for your big man never order on an empty stomach
to country secret
now with your order food
you don't want you going to be order the whole menu unless you got a little appetite for on
by the way i what how could michelle wolf leaves on the table the the fact that sarah how could these brothers killed a dog for fun yeah you're not really being gloves off of here not referencing the dog murderers and like you know a key she made fun of her smoky eye shadow and people when
didn't go to the dog mercurial her fucking law or any older brothers kill dogs for fun
it's actually a very sad story about way sarah could be sanders has that eye makeup
mike huckabee was doing one of those photo shoots where you know it's like oh my daughter my daughter's boyfriend is here to ask you to prom
the rules if he points a gun at him but it was the makeup up to the simpsons and is fired
the water
a much larger some material but you leave it for me as a leave those guys are astounding you just put a picture of him up there than you just talk about him for twenty minutes when you're done
just imagine them sitting in a lump his room smashing fluorescent bulbs with a hammer or the like homer him and barney and dressing in one giant pair of overalls and play a huge harmonica
then the op ed that would be like there's nothing funny about the two large simple minded the cruel huckabee sons bathing each other and a cloth with bathtub
absolutely nothing funny about that
but it is not forty how they constantly see to get trapped in barrels of molasses there's nothing funny about the fact they were no pamphlet winnie the pooh
yeah

although had this is devil
delights me for no reason enough to they would cheat codes for feel like here
oh man that really should win an award yeah
right are you wish they knew i agree with box
i don't know i mean i don't even know i don't know what else to say with the white house correspondents' dinner
one thing which is that the only good thing to come out of the smattering of and maybe there will be a change in that they might get rid of it
when she would be awesome
there there was apparently i saw i saw that they were considering a number of options to fix this problem one of which was hiring a singer good that's the case can i put my vote in right now for a con doing the no label song at the next white house correspondents' dinner and number two hiring one liberal and one
conservatives community and it's like of a response you know oh my god the dueling banjo them yeah
awful get that amazing
that would be fantastic
it crowd crowder in there yeah crowder and
who the whole new the loot high myers yeah how the area virus oh that would be amazing
i wow i would actually watching it
feeling he made the jokes it in an alternate universe tom liars did host the correspondence that and but it was
when hillary one and he walks bill after doing is notorious
signing up to be an intern job you know that you to joke about any hillary clinton's personally that's on top of that would be like his triumph that would be the the movie the king of comedy
singer
you could do the weekend
all his songs are about having unsatisfying sex it makes you sad and what is people immediately favorite thing to do i'll put it out alpha right now great white
oh joy
the fact that they're doing this like oh maybe we can do doing it even other things outlived their usefulness and it's totally contrary to the entire idea of an adversarial media and hugging white house press corps that hope the idea of the press quarter isn't stupid and and doesn't make sense like you shouldn't even have repaying let alone have the circle
jerk every year
can't stop doing it they can't from having fun little thing that they do every year and having all of a big important people there to hang out with them even if the president doesn't show up any more trouble i haven't been there he's the like he doesn't show up what's the point of it if the president isn't fair
but they're not going to stop the brim dueling comedians no brain from awful good from the daily show and dan mean and to do doing joke before they get rid of a fucking thing i i love i love that they're looking at it as a problem that needs to be solved because the the first premise the breakable first premises like all we are
obviously need to have this big fancy party about the news we must tell good news could tell you
come on the new companion
he does number i'm so like union broke like ten years ago called bear did that correspondents dinner it's like jeb bush in front of him and i remember when that happened i thought it was amazing i thought it was like oh was over them i thought called bear killed it i loved how offended everyone in the room was i probably get a great job he really did cut pretty deep to be
bush like right in front of them and circa two thousand and six i thought that was like a huge try out for like what comedy stands for and like the ability of you know the clever and witty individual to speak truth to power but it on i still think that speak about that performance holds
but it's just like we've come so far since then i'm just like i don't know how anyone can really get excited about the idea of comedy speaking truth to power any how were you living remember when they roast and the shit out of trump when he was of the correspondents dinner
they just shut him down when people value was being too uppity and he was going to oh you the guy thinks he can run for president on a platform of racism and made him them weren't going to shut him down and obama did all those often and they cut the him looking like a tree stump in the audience
work he was driven from the national stage after that i don't know if you guys have been paying attention to him but he added you hosting a show on q v fi
well this is the this is the argument of course that conservatives make about the white house correspondents' dinner and rochelle walls and in in their packaging all of this and he made the old same wine old bottles of this idea of like you know this is just the elites who have contempt for us and
we just feel so disrespected this is why trump this president and i really feel like the liberal media day fall for this shit every single time when because they now like have some agonize like self reflection over like oh maybe big we did go to for maybe we are just as bad as the like you said matt the people who filled the state
at the exact same time to who and i think about immigrants and anything their he tells them but the thing is isn't there are right they are an elite they are separated from any kind of concept of an american people are or anything like that in that build them of anxiety the problem with because of our idiots fucking
polarized political system all of that all of that resentment just run down the benefit of a bunch of people who are able to queue pretend could be in regular but are in every sense of much in a rapacious the league as all these fucking me at all
this is unrelated but i just found this out guys i thought i'd share it with zero zero zero down or wrote a poem about joy read
what
rosie wrote a poem about julie read called me enjoy read in all i can think about is riding the bus my sister joy read
look here it
it's really long okay
pro or anti what's the what's what's the evidence them it's bro
i don't know it talks about how much she likes her and rachel matter how and
by the end it just says awful ever i will forever wonder what i could have done to hurt her so i am truly sorry
she sort of being like i dunno i like you so much why why do you hate me
alright because one of the thing from people are funny and joy read all blog with her just being really mean to have your novel and whole or are
what back when that was the big thing of trump
public viewed with rodeo donald he was like a hog shut up already
trump is winning here
hilarious
from pay for paper baffling of yeah
so
i think that is you know we haven't talked about it since the last show the joy read thing is also funny because it's like her defense that are bog was hacked is completely falling apart and all it took was going on her show on sunday apologizing but essentially saying i don't remember writing these posts i don't think they're me but i and
if you think that they are and that's ok
and then people were just like okay cool
it's currently stupid that good who gives a shit it's more leg i mean i think the jury read news cycle was a case of everyone on every side of it
feeling as though they accomplish something because they expanded a lot of energy on this her
the people who were like really pro joy i asked her return to t the after she crossed back into the rubicon it took room
it was just like man we've all been through a lot together it's like
yeah i haven't ever it was just on the computer they hate the they did before and they before that the judge is just a stupid exercise that we going to for by fucking thursday
there was no meditation you're still get like to pull pull this shit on people you don't like people who like who they like are still get to go yeah it gives a shit about stuff they poured people that are like it's stupid it's stupid
it's completely pointless but because you were just sitting in your car in neutral and slamming the accelerator you feel like you went somewhere excuse me you say that he say
all the people getting exercise on lie about politics
patiently like being on a stationary bike and you think that you're right now probably the company and wait on a stationary bike
but but like you're on a stationary bike but you think that you're getting somewhere you're actually traveling different excuse me but you can keep that shit i'm fighting for the future of the republic by trying to in the county where deal with fleck pack
from the communist manifesto that the future politics my friend yeah i guess that's the other the other major news or the weekend or entire week now this is designed to basically liquefied what's left in my brain it's just like i can't engage with any of this i mean okay
i'm glad if there's anything productive come i guess i'm glad maybe we can now just feel like you don't have to you can still enjoy the art of someone whose politics don't align with your is a thousand percent perfectly birth been having this conversation about gallagher
but that's not bad
what's going to come out of
i mean i i actually didn't even know the somebody pointed point of alchemy when this started happening when when when can he started talking about how hurricane every they were hanging out somebody found in my old tweak it from two thousand and fourteen when i said if i had one wish it would be for continuity to become a neon reactionary and you can feel old
well i was using the crate neil reactionaries has right all right we'll even a thing of the term relief i felt that i mean i didn't remember arriving in put thinking back what i meant was how hollywood be the theme people who have pin their identity on the notion that their consumption choices are politically meaningful will square with one of their idols becoming
reactionary about would be funny to watch and it was funny for a while but what's been really stunning and heartening is been watching people confronted with miss new political car was literally now hanging out with charles fucking kirk
and treating abraham lincoln was a republican instead of having that reasonable step back from investing in consumption with political meaning have decided that the future of the republic is at stake
with who gets to who gets to influence county so it's not it doesn't matter what county fairs are still enjoy the music or whatever it oh shit we've got to save county the that's the only way we're going to get any political change like this is this is perfect this is perfect for the hasn't phillips thesis on how are culture because
futile geometrically every few years because his when he wrote that an american theocracy was that we talk about celebrities and futile terms and we see them and fuel terms that are exemplars and everything we believe in these unelected
designed monarchs who has been selected by guide and are preordained
and all of that but now worth the best part is monarchy which is when you get a mentally ill for more child ruler and it's a race
who would the court
it may be a curse
yeah
friends with segments of the court dangling big turkey legs in front of his face i mean the text message exchanges that he's been focusing are hysterical because like i love it i mean it is so perfect that he'd be a right wing now because they are the group in our society
really really love is the idea of being a free thinker if by being a free thinker means you're unaware of basic american history as an adult i'm a free thinker and by that i mean i'm terrified of everything
or i don't have a i don't know what anything mean i i don't believe that structure of
yeah i don't believe the economy as a real thing
i think that we are just a collection of people with varying degrees of whole and creativity and that determines the social order by being a free thinker and of course a guy like that is totally disconnected and and family rich with would be a track that point of view but i think i mean some people arguing about how from here all the fifth and i have no idea
i think at least part of it is driven by his awareness that politics in terms of entertainment right now politics was the only game in town
everything is filtered through politics if you wanna move the needle in terms of getting a conversation about your piece of art it half the half a political violence or no one's going to care about is all anyone fucking talks about now
a new album's coming out and i think that there's like i think i think he's doing like an andy kaufman say i mean like actually just like getting your photo taken with charlie kirk
being like this is interesting is what are the most outrageous stones you can do i mean like pretending to be friends with
pretended to like him and like target do this does seem like a man on the moon type of shit like i think maybe it started sincerely candice oh sweet and then he saw how insane we that took off when i think he's leaning into it and i think he's going to be like do this sort of a right wing thing for a while is kind of spectacle and performance or see where it goes
odd me in me introduce the crusade talked about this and it will be a tuesday
the it's called an intro pod yeah we talked about this and we we talked about its conspicuous the county has extended anything that he likes about lucky
he has said like the muslim man or like the tax but it just like ideas energy power
i don't want to preempt too many too much existing program me but there is an those in in to us as you follow him that he could mean something happening similar to what people think they could do where they post frogs in a rapidly changing country
and eventually something happens and they go the frogs did it but you can actually shift culture
incredibly dominant cultural force and i think maybe for a guy like that it's very appealing
to think what it is i'm the guy who breaks liberal cultural hegemony
yeah you can always thinking about it in those terms though
easy i mean you don't you think he doesn't notice culture doesn't notice that like entertainment is very good
very similar liberal democratic line throughout his leg
such insists yeah i know i could see you and go down in history you'd be him well that is what all those like the culture warriors and like people like ben shapiro are so invested in now like all the manga people they have signs that trunk now he's to be like con yeah i love you or whatever because they're very invested in the idea that someone
oh calm pop culture cache which probably couldn't be any higher has now decided to say a it's cool to be any are right way it's cool to listen to charlie kirk and ben shapiro or whatever or that i will calm he hasn't said that but they are interpreting it is such a there
they've invested a lot and this and i think it shows how
kind of their their disdain and hatred for pop culture but trace their own minas and like the fact that they really are desperate for any kind of mainstream validation
they conservative have all the political power of a want a cultural power and liberal have all the cultural power but they want the comfort the political power
so this weird thing or not so sure about that second point why don't i don't think they would like it in the abstract on their own tom yeah but i do think that which one is driven more crazy by what they don't have definitely the conservative not having the cultural power to know he talked about like that before
are they really are infuriating by the fact that trumps victory has not down to them getting more personal respect on their own lives and they're still getting shit on by tv and movies an artist
i mean you're going to on even harder than before because like now
liberal artists and musicians or wherever many and then think it's their duty and responsibility or just they're feeling to speak about what they hate about you know our government and our country right now which is largely ban nice people like trumped and voted for him and they think they get scolded
well fed us about the fucking correspond with thing they say your efforts to try to use your position in a cultural authority to change to shame conservatives or whatever will that's why trump one in your driving people into the arms of reaction and it's not true but it is useless it is
sad and fruitless it is it is watching people who you know they talk about the people who only i'm a hammer you have a hammer everything looks like a nail that's that's liberals right now they have culture and so everything we only solution they have is by just so i am in that buck and a hammer and everyone faith and it doesn't change anything because the
people who are resent that they're not
nobody who was offended by something michelle wolf said about fucking sanders persuadable voter but it also doesn't get anything on your side it doesn't change the dynamic in anyway so it's just sad display of of liberalism just basically wanting the one thing that have the folks who left any more
i guess just from a pure shot and for perspective it's sort of amusing watching conservatives national keith over their lack of flat and that's what makes the that's that's why the liberal panic about communism is because now they're taking the damn of actually might break and oh my god what if this does change i think felix's right if if that did happen wouldn't
con and love to go down in history of like the rosa parks of conservative cultural narrative
the guy who would not be in the back of the liberal any more possibly i mean like that when you're talking about this sort of school being about you know this is why we got trump or like this idea that
is the demonic the liberal cultures responsibility to speak to or give a pat on the head or recognize or seen whatever terms you want to give the people that they hate so much and will eight each other so much like i either voter this reminds me of an iq stage i had this
weekend with it laid sick magazines resident practitioner of this very style oh my connor
the door
walk in or and this was over and the john and make not and paintings john make gotten of course is like the official or a painter of mega america and he came out with another idiotic hating this week his last one was the one of my personal favorite is would have trouble
with its here like get like
cleaning off or ragged american flag that he picked off the football field
this new one is on a park dead what looks like a cruising see teaching young college guy a very handsome young college man about how to fish or some shit like that and people were making fun of it and connors point was like i don't know with like you know i think liberals need to ask themselves a question of whether you know renounced and their benefit
i'd like to be like this in group mocking of like you know the art of the other side or whatever and responded to him
you hate this kid she bullshit to shut the fuck up
because there's no way he actually likes john wick mountains art or other people who fucking cool over it
but it's a virtually signaling from so weird right wing central point of view and i think my only response to that is it is not politically productive to kiss the asses of the dullness worse people this country's capable of producing and like i think
just stop fooling themselves about that whether it's the correspondents dinner or culture or whatever is guess what
these people even other not necessarily in terms of culture
are united in their spite and in group loathing of liberals and you know what
it works pretty well for them getting getting what they want done so i think we should stop pretending to honor know like follow these little bread crumbs all the time or pretend that there's always some honorable interesting respectable point to be made the entire conservative movement is donald trump it's always been like this it always will
oh it's morally hideous and corrupt and these people deserve nothing what slate and you really cannot be mean enough to them the public or private be kind of them
okay me to defeat them politically and make it so that they cannot enact their will it even a local or like dog catcher got to be the goal of everyone that's the problem we're all facing now
else is window dressing you will get know you'll get no credit for humor in there surely arc or like many haberman did a whole thing making making me a call and reading about how mean everyone loved the thoroughfare do you think that's going to stop drop and value wants to call me a i'm in a dumb whore which she's done like
the fucking time since becoming president now i can honestly two days until he does it again nothing you can the fate of them will change because they're driven by bottom with bynum these people for the most part what do they hate in the world they hate liberals they've never met they hate mexicans or healing job they would never
do they don't have any that were black people who live in neighborhoods with their family have lived in several generations the current bid all a constructive resentment
bank be in their head nothing you can do is going to interfere with that nothing is going to make them rethink what if the primal driving force of their entire politics
and it just like it's so weird to read shit from
journalist or whatever who were like you know what
see what you will but comedy but like you know bullying is not ok
see you about trump billy bullying is not okay and i just like i really have to question the mentality is someone who really thinks that they can or should be objective it read any of this shit like you you mustn't know what the trump administration is doing and what they stand for and you can bully her yeah do you in bali
white house press secretary the front of them four days a week and he knew eat them an insult the intelligence
but bali someone in that position that he does the don't drop is always wearing long sleeves because he's cutting
show me before i came here handle women
an estimated dead
robert smith he's got a lot of i think you should look for one
and world if the vampire books well i do like that the entire week
i think the the dominated was the daily show woman to me or was that the resistance
the parties where the back backpack
you know can we hope con a leg
can we make this man has been having a mental breakdown for years three have irrational political thought we need to make it happen
you know that yahoo just went up
game presentation
and ran liar
yeah like eyes
about the iran nuclear deal
urging sort of a repeat of his presentation last maria i'm sorry to bother guy
round bomb with the camera that
yeah
this is all dog and pony bullshit that goes on
and there is a real horrifying thing in the background but what i think is interesting about that is that's his monkey with a broadway show
i don't actually think that israel really wants to go to war with iran
really trying to getting our concept of war now it's a trade show right our concept of is a trade show where every country gets the show off the military hardware they specialize it
you know every time that israel hits syria like they did this past week the russians get to go oh
sounds like we can finally a three hundred and four hundred aircraft batteries with sold the then everyone who fucking hate each other we've filled with armenia and azerbaijan at the same time with the saudi arabia were trying to sell them to get our
i don't think that yeah who legitimately wants to have a ground war with iran because it would be fucking disastrous
what he wants more he wants more terrorists that's very want more money for whatever proxy conflict like they've done in syria and we all now played the same game the same trade yeah that's what our culture our culture wars is they thing no one actually wants to win the culture war than is fucking
people do they want to climb this ladder of escalation that we do in ukraine and syria to sell higher tiers of weapons
the greater stakes you see the culture wars the closer you are to cultural world war three
you get to sell your as three hundred or as for hundreds or your version of american t o w is or
anti air missiles are fucking whatever which is more cable bill appearances or more more book deals or whatever
the same same thing we're we're on the verge we want to go to the exact verge of a catastrophic for conflict
but just before that just so we could sell the right are moments for through each other why everything is exactly the same fucking way
never going to get better but we're going to have a twitch channel
i think i don't i don't i think i don't think that i don't think many ah don't want to hang with i don't think he would mind if we did i think they'll be fine with him if we spent shallow of metals
i was gone and i don't think he i don't think it necessarily want to have a ground war with iraq i mean necessarily fairly but i think the damning some fucking and their shit up some degrading capacity with i i think you'd like to do that but i think you're right that always conflict and this goes back to the thing about how all of this marketplace of ideas it's just a sterile cycle that know
our bills to resolution the way that dialogue is supposed to is because all of these conflicts about culture and and politics and foreign affairs balance of power
they can never be resolved because to resolve them would be to break out of the fan of school the benefits the people who were perpetrating them and that to terrifying to contemplate because they don't know they'd end up on top of that any and then
any is that are one war is rolling the dice is bismarck said anybody anybody you want to really challenge any of these prevailing enemies
is gonna have to deal with the fact that you can't deal with these issues
the terms that have been laid out because they are not designed to resolve the problem they're not enough to fix anything they're they're designed continual status quo to drag the corpse of of the guy from weekend at bernie's across the fuckin beach and killing dissolves and until there's been enough of them
hyper extraction of resources of the people at the top of that can survive coming collapse
in their fucking bunkers and see stands and and you have to point path
that grow and path just dead sterile fucking debate on all these issues and say
fuck i don't even know because
even imagine it is to move beyond everything that we have generally understood to be with politics means right and the culture war works around those same points
what does work like be this i can't conceive i know that we're all fucking sick
and it feels like it's tearing at the seams because it is dumber than it is ever been i feel like in my lights navy oh yeah
but what comes after what comes after i don't know what comes after the proxy war as weapons sales trade shows that is the met a game
international politics i don't know what comes after any of these because
as i said the matter for all these games is to go right to the verge of for conflict never get there because you only selling the escalation and hinges hinges gene that you won't get total disaster hedging it on these apparatuses of millions of people making no human error
well fuck again twitch stream
entertainment is still available people and none of those jokes sure gotta i mean i guess the the only difference is that people would like to win the empire wars but again i don't think anyone wants to win the culture war yeah
yeah
a different culture war that is an alley terms isn't one that that generated by capitalism the way that exists now i mean just i was just thinking about how the other stupid argument i thought being recapitulate it on the internet the this weekend was because of the new yorker road
review of the new adventure movie and of course it was very dismissive of the film and said that it was kinda bullshit that was stupid and incoherent and led to a million nerd shitting themselves and how a lead if they are but
book and you will why the hell with the new yorker writer of you fucking kidding movie
it's a huge cultural moment and all culture now the big ones i mean everything from filed off in the nation's the big ones left are the things that are at the lowest common denominator and can guarantee the biggest return because of how much money is put into them
and new yorker knows when they write a review especially if dismissal it's going to get linked to a million times by outrage nerds
and that just means that this
as long of capital is dictating what our cultural expectations are and you know entertainment is like any other industry is a big investment required a big return so not only the movies that are costco i'd have to have a preexisting intellectual property that people know about so you can ensure a base
level of interest but marvel have taken the next step and with the expanded universe created movies that only reference themselves and sell each other and that number and no movie can and has to sell the next one because the next one's going to cost even more than one did and have to their whore guarantee and even higher return and show
oh but because this is built on the framework of nice interest things that used to be for nerds like comic book people have this personal commitment to it because they think geek culture still exists
when the finger are making two hundred and fifty billion dollars a day and so every fucking time the springs been going on for at least ten years so the dog so basically the person
comment but when we came out the nerve and the snout fight about how you're being elitist and they for how can i be elitist when this movie is the most of the you know this is the sum total of culture and they can't resolve but because
look how kind of dictated by the nature of the economics of entertainment so they just are you for awhile and boil goes the way and then another piece of shit slides down the fucking pipe and they have another argument and it could never resolved and they're all like that because of the underlying premise of
the market dictating the dynamics and so we can only eternally record basically until the resources that fuel run out and then nobody will be arguing about anything anymore except that the last can of beans and the gut and kroger extra for the fucking washington dc media will be in the borough
and out shell of the museum factor in virgins to the god of decorum
the museum
i mean to close out the shell because you know
let's see the accused of being too pessimistic
felix alluded to it i'd like to maybe chart a new course for like a different better culture
a way out
the track that we're all viciously ensnared and of course our twitch stream this is sort of brainchild of felix in virgil of course year
the yellow approved game masters
you know i'm into it what are some of the things that people can expect for the chop chopper twitch projects as yet to be named tentatively tentatively my basic ideas are basic ideas i am going to have a series where i play through a single player games obviously we're going to start with the metal gear series but i'm also going to play through
my theory single player games of the
early to mid two thousand like max payne one and two etc
talk about their significance culturally but also for the people who like what is now the biggest genre which i am to beat the james cameron of this jon era where my art transcends the tawdry medium my for tonight show with my fortnight friends we
we'll be doing it
i hope to out to be playing fortnight for the first time ever on on your guys stream
you you will be a guest player and fuck you mean
also virgil had a terrific idea of him playing crusader kings with matt and i had an idea having map play assassin's creed to get mad at both the abominable game play and history
that does would like a terrible game be interesting
i do i do want to play one of those super complicated strategy games with version because they can't have been kind of interesting but then i just look at the screen and there's so much stuff on it that i get a headache and i could never do that allowing him to do all of the actual button pushing while i guess kind of watch would be kind of fun i was also the
interested in putting my little spin on the twitch medium and doing a finally giving a cooking show for you guys are know if he was a listener aware but something of an amateur chef myself i'd been known to cook a few things and have been thinking of doing he sure of combination
instructional curfew show at a dinner party lives with stream so you can operate me for cooking and then berate me as as i'm eating food will really fail item that megan mcardle have ever advertised from the from that can i do not have even close to one
thousands of the things that meghan but now you're you're just impressed that i have like a whisk or an immersion i haven't of those are okay all right i don't have anything to fancy i just you know i have a rice cooker
you want for me that's not like
ludicrously extravagant kitchen item i'm mostly fascinated by the fact that you have a literal meat cleaver that is sure i do have a cleaver but you know that's good for a cut chickens have you ever use that you have course
it seems cool i want one
it's low tech now

just me and virgil a very and everyone else is off off or memorial day paying their respects to our great monuments in this country now rushmore the hollywood sign
branson missouri
it's it's version of an eye for the show and and just a little bit will be speaking to you are david ferris about his book it's time to fight dirty which is his political strategy for rat fucking the republicans out of power through procedural life hacks
are able to hack the constitution and our form of government to hopefully this power the task or eight when goals that we're currently ruled over by
for then of virtual and i were going to give you guys a little update online the see well behind the scenes or a media that we did earlier this week that i think you guys may have seen by now
oui appeared on a jesse's world
oh no that's the jesse water show it's it's called ventura boulevard just say no we went on former minnesota governor and awesome muscle man great movie star chris kyle widow owner jesse ventura is our key
on russia today yeah we did compromise that we did active measures and we got to appear on jesse ventura show our personally i am a huge fan of jesse ventura because of his film work predator and the running man or easily two of my favorite films of all time
but oh jose chung's from outer space or my favorite episodes of tv of all time so just he is has touch my life and a lot of ways so i jumped at the opportunity to come on a show even though it was a rather surreal experience
so apparently jesse host the show in minnesota had his basement or something we didn't at an undisclosed location so when we told people were going on jesse ventura rochelle there were like oh that's awesome you got to meet the body are just see the governor you know and were like no we didn't even get to see jesse ventura it was just literally
a voice in our ear as we sat in a room with a camera track we can even see ourselves yeah there was no monitor we were just talking into a black box one room during this camera reposition itself as if for an alien
singer and this guy puts these era pieces on as a thick russian
that was the funniest thing because i mean a another reason i agree to go in jersey show is because i wanted to go on our teenagers because i think it would be funny because it would make a lot of people mad and i think that's going to get recording this thursday so we haven't seen any of the backlash of yeah
real phone will be fine but a chapel trap house took seven million rubles on the chest ensure a program so versatile and i we meet in our keys i'm putting in quotes your green room it was not a green room not just a break room for their employees there was coffee and water but no treats
for home so we're waiting there in this room and they're wouldn't get your and in the chair is it about five to the top of the hour whatever this is probably one of their satellites yeah yeah i get to the analysts should have a teamster looking guy herds us into the into the kill room where the
the all seeing eye with were scanned or scan us and capture russell's so this guy gets it
rough teamster guy gets us in there and then begins men hand when nurse and threading microphones through our shirts and feeling are feeling or i saw of mine on it
last week so we get the earpiece
in your ear and i've never done like a cable news hit like this before and when it is this sort of like it's it's pre tape so that wasn't that nerve wracking that would be going out why but there's this huge sensory disadvantage when you're in studio and like the host is elsewhere because you can't see them you can even see yourself a seemingly
they are watching everything about you they're seeing you pick your nose or sweat but it's just like all you're getting is just a voice in your ear even though you know that you're supposed to be talking to a camera and it's it's very odd but the funniest thing was after he got the your piece in the sort of the voice who wasn't jesse's who has been like okay we're on in three
whatever han ethnic russian accent and it was just like google could be a good sure
boots appreciate your work undermining democratic party
pleased to do propaganda for a comrade boots thank you for helping take it down
russia the greater and me near it and
take down strategic capitalists mastermind chuck schumer so yeah but that being said the the actual interview was very fun just use a joy to talk to i did get a chance to talk about running man he agreed with my assessment that we are living in the running man
he also said before he was just very china you with us and he told us this story about how when when
he did wrestling he had to have a fake name because bag of those these heels were real heels yeah attract
which i think find you and can kill you
but so fun jesse just he was great to talk to i'm really hoping now i mean again the other reason i did as i'm really hoping to get jesse on our show would love
are the interview was like five minutes it was just like a rapid barrage of questions like reuse just like so virgil till be about how who work at a lock the documents
it's just like
really quick here again a very very surreal
so will
our kids eat the democratic and republican party
a week or why do people like you is it because you talk about real issues
so again it was great to talk to just see it was like a blurb and i love to get a chance to have like a real a longer sit down an actual conversation with the former governor to talk about his career and wrestling he was one of the few first people to try to unionize w w f under vince mcmahon it didn't work but i mean i would love to hear about some of
the early days of the world wrestling federation i would love to hear about the set of predator is the fact that he got his you measure it or he had his biceps measured on and they were bigger than arnold's would love to hear about owning chris oh
so would love to get jesse ventura on a show and really going to try to me i'd also to hang out with it seems like just a funny i don't want to go to the compound in minnesota
he lives elizabeth thief paisley part
so are are so yeah just jesse ventura is grey jazzy please come on the show
i guess now just to move on and introduce this interview were about to do again this guy is david ferris he's a professor of political science and i suspect this in you will be interesting for some
one you out of time we are going to engage in the sin of electoral islam and reform islam by essentially engaging with the idea of electing democrats or investing in the american political process through an active voting perhaps some of you will
be offended by that
i think it's an interesting topic of conversation and it's worth considering even though friends of the show host of the show would regard this as seeking procedural problems to political solutions that being said i think the book is interesting and at the very least lays out a few planks that i think
i would really like to see democratic politicians at all levels of government being put on the record is now
as supporting things like a new voting rights act the up things like packing a supreme court statehood for the state of freaky see in porto rico
slam dunks yeah the these are good thing is that i think like you know broadly from a liberal to left wing wave you can and should support you know there's a moral imperative buying those things are going to get like and what david's book is really about is not not just electing democrats but like how to change
the inherent in equities
the structural of stretch your biases that are part of the american political system
to make it possible not just you pass progressive ledge or left wing legislation but to make it possible to even do that in the first place and i think his argument is one worth considering that the even get to the point where we can elect nice socialist leader is that we all love and support and believe the thing same things we do we do
you have to confront these terrible problems that put any decent person or anyone with a conscious in this country and an extreme disadvantage it magnifies the power of as reactionary forty percent of the country that's totally fucking backwards and magnifies the power of the capitalist ruling class yeah absolutely and so
we're going to talk to david and you know why you know listener you might not agree with moralism you might think this is reformist but i think what we can all agree on is you should absolutely not email us about this
i did not contact us to say that actually and our corporate way to go and eleven years though i were not listen and
agree absolutely i mean i think again that is something that abroad
liberal to progressive left wing coalition can agree on own email us to complain about the show
so onto our interview with david and then another reading from our own book you may so
oh david harris with his shirt
com's roaches persecuted by your government
some of the talks are intentionally you manipulate the truth seekers who become discredit if they disclosed
in


okay so joining us how is david ferris is a professor of political science
roosevelt's university and the author of it's time to fight dirty how democrats can build lasting majority in american politics
we can as this conversation goes on maybe push you a little bit on whether anyone should desire the democrats having a lasting majority of american politics however the one thing i think we should begin with and agree on is that the republican party does represent a clear and present danger to all
human civilization continuing on the planet earth
you know you have another term years the girls like grand grandkids are going to spit roasted
oh fire and it's not going to he wasn't
so we're gonna we're going to get rid of him was just like begin with
the baseline of like what the current political reality of america
despite being massively unpopular you have a minority of people a political minority in this country that represents let's say between twenty five to thirty five percent of the population that now controls all three branches of government most state governments just basically has a death
grip on all the levers of power and our government despite being massively outnumbered by people who would not wish to see them in power
it's hard to disagree with that assessment
you have a minority government
they've come to power through sort of conscious manipulations of electoral procedure this combination of or two hundred and thirty year old design flaws
you know there's not a time we can do about it
the aggregate
it's very difficult the left again
power in this country because they're start off every election at a massive disadvantage
some of these problems
better that to be pretty ruthlessly exploited and pushed further other contemporary we can earn it and you trace this meddling back to gingrich in the republican revolution
yeah i think that gingrich was one of the first people to reload
if you what very vocally and openly
your opponents than call and like slimy and discussed area
a horrible human beings that that that hasn't impacted
but i don't know it wasn't gingrich
executed this year
doesn't and it wasn't getting rich white design always voter id laws that are that are suppressing it wasn't direction
the phony disenfranchisement stuff so there's all kinds of their terrible things that are happening in american politics though
they started with gingrich but some of them started record thomas jefferson to yeah well
the us said it is
undemocratic institution but under the ground tomorrow morning but we're stuck with it
so we have to figure out a way to work around somebody is flaws
the next time
democrats are and or and you know like the most obvious manifestation of this is the most recent example of the twenty sixteen election in which the person who received the majority of votes in fact lost the election but not only that democrats receive far more votes
in terms of actual voters for the congress and the senate yet still are the minority party
i mean that you know that's the impact of our to our rules
which which to do matter and really so the fact that california has thirty eight million people have the same to senator is this the seven hundred thousand people my armor is absurd
democratic theoretical standpoint and that's how you end up with republicans in control the senate
many many books and you know when you add them all up we will get to your plan for california which is probably the most ambitious thing that you lay out in this book but it's not just that you describe
these like you said these flaws in the constitution that are exploited by the republican party
flaws and our electoral system and the rules for congress etc to exert their will and an undemocratic way but it's it's it's more than that in that the republican party as it's currently constituted really doesn't see the anyone who beats them in an election as a legitimate
yeah form of government a don't regard democratic presidents as legitimately elected or should be treated as such
and they also they don't recognize liberal jerk
some records as a liquor as equal to conservative original it's jurisprudence
which is which is a real problem because if you look at some of the rationalizations or why their guts to steal america and see it on or you're right
read dimensional you're going to it and rip an asshole
oh i read the national review quite regularly sir
just are at worst but they were like oh look we can avoid this person of a supreme court because barack obama judicial philosophy with it
that's not obvious decisions or deserves
and so they've been acting for the better quarter twenty years since two thousand election
as if
he didn't democrats out of power justifies just about any escalation
normative way or even formally it's been abused
should be obvious early really long time that the republican party is the single most extreme political party an entire democratic world
single most far right political party and intent democratic world they are not a centre right party by the standards of any comparable democracy know to do it off the map in a european parliamentary to marks one where it matters
even some of these european far right parties
your to loose in the netherlands
these guys actually believed in a social welfare state
whether a terrible reticence but they're also way
after contemporary terms of economics there is no other party in the entire world
super races and
reduce the modern state to its industrial show you know let's compare to what level of public spending
that is really unique and a world i'm pretty sure good viel viel dies or whenever believes in the social welfare state for exclusively for people with jet white hair and who never wear socks with leather shoes incidents
i mean i don't feel like it's the current events little lot of people or the same sort of cartoonist look
social network effects now like so you know
eric these legislative and progressive policy goals that i would say are broadly shared from liberals to the laugh that we all should have had this idea that we'd like to make him more just equitable less screwed up society like things like single pair and what you're saying is first and foremost in order to do
those things basically the republican dragon the dragon energy people will have to be slade and the way they have to be swayed in a effective manner is by instituting these waging what you call the same kind of procedural warfare that the right has been so good at in terms of force
their agenda on a country that like i said is the majority of which opposes what they believe in so to get to the the media your book which is this strategy your plan for like six things the democrats can do to keep power and in doing so awfully make
the kind of country that we'd all like to live in a big ask is of course that the democrats regaining power in the first place which is an open question at this point but that's again for the sake of the book and the show let's assume they do
assume that there is a democratic president with full support of congress ready to go in two thousand and twenty the first thing you say you should do like the first piece of legislation that you should push out his statehood for dc in porto rico and then splitting
california into six states which i said it's probably the most ambitious thing that you describe in this book and the only thing that actually wouldn't need simple congressional approval to do before you get to the california solution just you just described briefly what is the moral and procedural case for dc in puerto rico
coming full fledged states i'm in i'm in both it
everyone is born in dc and there was an american citizen
and no urgency and work or legal representation in congress
which is just unjustifiable reasonable just called democracy should work
you know for the case of you see that to go out on all kinds of different ways risk
it's straight items out of a and budget
you know people are arrested in dc end up going to federal prison system right away it's nice to record or we go over the last year has made it really obvious to me
why he made a state because no one in dc has to answer to the people of puerto rico
and even you know
our politics are not perfect but like if if if we go have representatives in congress
you know somebody could lose their job when the federal it doesn't respond to a category five hurricane prompt chest
thousand people die so you know order he goes in a kind of a legal limbo it may have been sort of like one hundred years which is there a territory state a long list of debate in porto rico about what to do about the
and i think that there is real momentum for statehood
since this like comically i don't have a comic is it's tragic but this horrendously enough to response to hurricane
i think it's it's it's just it's easy the case to make you have people don't want to be
one to be part of the union
don't have real representation
and there's just you know to me is no excuse for not really go into the and it just does appear at like moral ethical imperative that these people need released from their condition many a drawing rights
really should have been on day one any procedural being that this would be for new senators in the senate basically yeah i mean like you'd to slammed on senators dc it for sure yeah
it may take some time for it politics to just shake it up quarter rico
a political parties that are not democratic and republican you don't change pretty quickly at the front of the union yeah and it's hard for me to see anything but like a monumental way an election that we don't get to send it was out of order to go to so i'd like to set of the books dc important
i've been made ten years ago democrats will hold the senate right now on the other gems would have been flipped and the trump administration books functionally be over i guess except for got dodd frank was democrats
confirming hospital as well tell me this so you talk about statehood for dc in porto rico but why do you have against glum
nothing there's actually nothing stopping us from making guam and that us virgin islands and american samoa
i'm going to entertain but all of these overseas turret british that united states i actually think there is something in the virgin islands for stated i mean the constitution doesn't have a minimum to wrestle
so anybody to be a the matter of whether the people what they are want to stay and i think that we could do out here
oh i thought he can be a state he started to see where we go because they have active statehood were mentioned these other places don't they didn't
when i wrote a so i went to senators from the bikini a tall
yeah so so that that's dc in puerto rico like you said they're active statehood movements people like you know eleanor
horn homes norton has been pushing pc stated forever
the california one that's the line that's like turn of the most eye popping
a recommendation you make which is make california into six states
then we get be fifty eight states in america now we'd have to make room on the flag and i am worried that would be the main objection to this republicans be like you really want to change our flag
but he just got this from home depot
but what about california is so unique in that lake in really cries out for this because i can really is did california is so it's the fifth largest economy in the world it easily swing california sits around the elect acknowledge it sits around the electoral college
one of the most blue leaning states but yet it gets has two senators what describe your plan to make seven six or seven states edit a california yeah so be seventy seven states yeah i mean it it's a unique situation
was is the largest city mean you know it's also one of the most this point the most sort of left wing stakes in the country so hillary clinton one that the by thirty points
she one orange county
which which no democrat had one since of the are so it's like this then this long term transformation of california
from a contested stadium to dig deep democratic stronghold
and because of so much of the progress of energy in this country is in california
a lot of it ends up getting all build up at least the two senators from california
telephone it clearly does not have the same kind of structural our and american national politics
why almond us
it's just a problem with it
and if you look at the senate even you can do
in porto rico only do us part of the way there to parity and set it this probably thirty one republican going extinct
one of the democratic leaning sticks it in a neutral environment or lose the senate more often than we win it
that's a problem
public policy is going to get older inexorably to the right cycle of just just cycle
two out of every three elections or it's a problem and so
equal representation in the senate as luck
it's written in because student with a special provision that you can't even if we wanted to amend the constitution to make the senate equal we can't do it because we have to have the consent of the states are being deprived of equal or up in addition
non starter like the constitution is like the news on this question and so we'd have to get created about work rounds and i did
there is both like will just go case for britain california an artist and for it
a drew maps and the book that would have created seven states that voted early also don't know states will still have access to the pacific ocean i can all be economically viable and i think there's a case to be people awkward and also
i think that the federalism was entered was designed
to give people access to your up to a government that closer to them
than the national government and particular indicates california which to start a million miles away from d c
oh here it's because there is a lot of restaurant and in california
about state politics lot of remoteness of sacramento
and so again it's a kind of thing where i might actually think this will be a good idea
i've sworn it but it's also it's also artisan marble i think you can't count on all sorts of us me and democrats all the time between ten and fourteen
yeah ten would be to acquire where he mentioned as isn't he do say that in the past if you would proceed the same plan it would not would be almost guarantee the it create a bunch of republican leaning states because there is a lot of california it is extremely conservative you basically the way you draw the lines is that your bases
making states and of like the seven major cities in california in the areas surrounding him and it's sort of you'd have to be very careful about how you draw these lines right i mean like we this require sort of a kind of gerrymandering yeah i mean it is dream and are going over there
again it's larger if you think about the predicament of the planet
determinant of democrats national air are the left and nationally and more broadly i really think of justify to request because again it's not unconstitutional was a procedure in the constitution
states out of existing states
you need an active of state legislature and an act of congress i could also and this there's you're obviously near the consent
sworn it recommends is like jonas over their heads if they don't want to lead a lot of is doris burke
but you also say because if california has this weird quirk with their referendum
system where you know any referendum can be put up for a vote like that would be the sort of the into this is get that on the ballot hey do we want to create seven states of california
they would actually they had the california would have to vote on that but i mean they voted for arnold schwarzenegger governor so if i recall correctly i'd have to look this up after the show but there is an initiative on the ballot bankrolled by an eccentric billionaire split california into three states but it's polling very poorly like four to one against yeah
i like to divide the ideas and look into two camps you know there's like low hanging fruit but i think that be accomplished and month on
and then there's stuff that's like it's like an ideological project have to pursue ever over the course of the number of years southern california it's falls in the second camp look like i obviously doctor gets is can happen and a first year it's more like an open up a conversation
the idea of california in some way shape or form benefit to benefit the to hurt and recorded them but i think just the go next month one california we should not count on a happened
even they didn't have his first term there could be the you know i'm thinking it through there could be an incentive for state legislature legislators to support this thinking oh all of these new federal seats are open now
gov an english and in the california state has suddenly you look in the mirror and you see what you know
gov
sacramento governor of san diego
suddenly you're a presidential contender but as your governor and sort of a state legislator know and you can instead of to have been to run against six other people they could all these senators
so everybody
everybody gets
so yeah even know myself and just start i could see people in the california state government like really really dumb and dumber
the real problem is people in california when i tell them this idea
look like
you're out of your minds
and when you try to tell me what to do it my state like you have the other thing would be like every one of these new states created south california with each have more people in it than almost every other state in america
it made also quite large yeah i know the be huge states now you mention like a possible retaliation should the california plan ever become a reality would be to republicans to do the same and break texas up into a bunch of different states hoping to get the same share of their newly formed senate seats but you say that like that would be a little
bit more of an iffy proposition for republicans would be a little bit more dangerous or or harder to predict for them to guarantee that they would get like a dozen new republican senators him as a couple of
the texas texas is trying to give me the opposite direction
or a success is trending purple
and so breaking up texas really goes the potential of backfire republicans
because of the temple it's sort of demographic changes that underwear and a state of texas i don't think it's a swim stir in the next decade
moving much director and if you wanted a great texas up into pieces you know unless you want to stick like austin san antonio dallas and houston into the same state and had a bunch of bankrupt
you just can't you can't do it without a couple of democratic states and most adorable loans and get a couple of extra republican senators also older and it muscles would be worthless
the state has to do
there's also a really strong sense of identity success
i think this would not that i don't necessarily in california don't mess with texas
okay so the draw boundaries now moving moving on from from this like the next the next pegging in your platform
one that is my i think personal favorite
his court packing good old fashioned car packing adding more justice to the supreme court and creating a whole bunch of new federal judge ships as well
obviously you know i prefer a pelican brief option for the current supreme court but barring that again you mention the constitution does not mention how many judges need to be on the supreme court
f d r try this could you talk a little bit about
his core packing plan how it ended up and how your plan would be different than that
yeah sure i mean first of all i don't want to go we're going to call it and against court appointments
yeah i mean we'll all remember the of the arthur
i was losing administration was losing his work he until the new deal or being struck down by the conservative supreme or
trying finally won reelection and thirty six with his tower already has like that will spend the rest of our i was dreaming about muslims and congress
couldn't get it done and so you know what's what's the secret were
it would it would add a justice to the court or was everybody that was over seventy
time either
six seats sprint or i was six camera somewhere
it was age based you don't get editor you all people were going to justices the record
ultimately is democratic allies in congress bought like we're not going to do this is too disruptive
i think one thing that's been lost a little is that his allies in congress were willing on what when
what it out and fewer than five justices to the court they said no because it would have been it us to destructive but democrats and cars were really were willing to record just not
is exactly
and so here again we had a case where we have a conservative government it
that's completely roads and it's not just the seat it's it's six of the last presidential elections are democrats one october and those election
the for the senate since ninety two democrats won't thirty million more got us us it so it's like the american people have spoken they want democrats studying the federal judiciary and one thing one of the bank republicans for when they when they did the girl and thing
i don't think they really torpedoed any remaining norms or informal expectations about the supreme court should do people speak or nature
and so here's a case where it's like it's it's not it's not unconstitutional to expand the supreme court
democrats get to see if they get to see it's ticket to see it's
you know
he didn't even know we want to which so two four six whatever whatever it means to do to get a liberal majority i'm a supreme court because so many of the other problems with our political system including ocean untraceable classic gets dumped into every state legislative race in this country a are
all springs from were terrible decisions authored by this circuit court like i have not bereaved day and minds i realized what a liberal court majority country has been a death grip of a concert
or since the nineteen seventies like since i was born and so again
something were to do its constitutional it would be perceived as horrible it would be horrible
but i think that the circumstances really justify
it would be hard ball but i think as you play that i mean this current supreme court and you know the decisions that rendering i my opinion is intolerable situation for anyone who has any hope of a better quality of life in this country and they they are fulfilling the goals of
the all memo from going back forty years you basically erase all the new deal erase any any representation for workers to challenge their employers or seek redress of grievances this is just a massive shift in class power and just slipping away like the last thread bear
vestiges social welfare and not only that but like should a democratic congress pass any kind of progressive legislation you can get you can guarantee that robertson course it's and has spent waited their entire life to find a reason to declare something like single payer healthcare unconstitutional yeah absolutely
i mean you've read the constitution and so i mean we're we're one seat on the supreme or away from the new your or terrorist
i'm not convinced that roberts will go along with it
i'm not convinced he wouldn't years but when kennedy or any of the democrats does earth
we're looking at it real
a real judicial last year
because these are people that really like all they care about is the original constitution but actually in an era
oh really
oh but he writes in corporate or in the preservation of white supremacy it
so you know their stuff that we can do about this
in the objection is what about the listener and i'm like no
the escalation already adams your we're living through it
we have a lawless administration them
right now a governing the country
this the store they stole this you in court
so why not returned fire like the idea that we're going to come back
republicans were like oh on so so sorry
so so sorry about everything we've done and years it's delusional you know we have to come in after played herbal though it is you know it is hard to imagine a new democratic president wanting to spend capital on this contentious fight right off the bat instead of thinking okay well just wait for someone to die
the problem is it's a lottery
under this lottery system or people you know people from outside of the president's party
it was appointed by republican will have incredibly strong incentives to hang on and all or don't recognize their their grandchildren and anymore
they won't step aside because those are those are the incentives that the system that we have such you
on as long as possible until you can be replaced by some good hearted and so really what would be waiting for his
yeah or a serious illness and there's no guarantee that will happen i mean clarence thomas doesn't look all due to me but i have no idea you know no not as president trump so
when the
when he died we did some research into antonin scalia and to be honest the fact that he live that long is fucking incredible so again you can't count on any of this stuff and also sorry notorious r g b fans maybe she should have retired when she had a chance
she's know your and that you should accept yeah don't want it to him
and prior to i mean that also just like anybody looks like over sixty so i stepped aside and twenty thirty and while democrats lot of the sun and the democrats should have appointed some sort of like doogie howser known at her legal
eight as old as well
elements
the other thing like the age thing here you mention that there's a sweet spot that you have to aim for between like you know old enough to have experience but not too old to just be like a crypt keeper like do all but also getting rid of lifetime appointments for these judges i do that too
yeah in the book
why not offer them a compromise let's amend the constitution let's get rid of us but once and for all every president would get in there to acquaintances sprint or we could actually spell out advice and consent obligation and so it can spike one nominee they spoke to nominated and like three or whatever like the procedure think about it
but republicans going to say no to the just not going to happen
so community
one hundred percent are just hose
about the horrible where it's not just the supreme court but you can also expand just records the appellate courts you can create new ones
because them done in the past
there is a workload problem
some of those words so and then there's a i than the other day about federal judge appointments at this point in the obama administration vs this point in the trump administration and the trump just been like full steam ahead he has gotten in like three times as many people as obama even tried to and they are all like people who know
ass dogs for find our street magicians you know just like absolute lunatics and monsters getting in these lifetime appointments that are going to shape han this country until i'm dead probably and only i'm not even that
will be an office and so on
nearing retirement
and one of those republicans to last two years they are one of those shirts and they held up
term anyone
so they were hundreds of sentences on earth when going to authors and so you can be able to do you for years what it took obama eight years to do with just a flip partisan control district court after just district court order to to or
it's all perfectly constitutional dependent on on republicans or balls were you have to and six basically and hundred and sixteen
and so again all of that behavior which was really transgress little in terms of the expectations of american politics
they just because you know a further escalation
and then people who worry about than us the next escalation
so we're not going out of democracy it to worry about if we don't do stuff over the next few cycles know well that that is when this incredible to me but the idea of like an get the obama administration again they absolutely should have gotten rid of the filibuster when they had the chance and had some sort of a legislative a legacy to it
even get dismantled by the trump administration but they didn't because it was just all about the the friendship and comedy of the of the senate and just like this idea that like oh one of the rippled okay one of the republicans going to do in retaliation it's like they're already doing it so i don't understand what this this fear is about like oh man you know her
republican party think gets really crazy and out of pocket it's just like it's already there like what what do you where are you afraid of what do you think is going to happen by i don't know
giving it as good as you get and mom's it
around when they were you during the dark were arrested
the beginning of the movie
it keeps you sent a radical islam regarded spoke external was like you're only making it worse
yeah
okay to get any worse
i can imagine things getting much worse than they are right now
you know we have a couple of other communities that when our next two cycles don't you know
that we really are
russia road of what it's like a sure and dumber it it's not real it doesn't have any real content to it it's just it's just you know ruled by the wealthy it work for the wealthy using every procedure else was able to them
yet now
real quickly like the the the last few things that you talk about his first electoral reform and you talk about changing the way changing the winner take all form of elections could you explain that sure yeah so we rent one in thirty five separate elections that also works that those in this country and they're all decided on
when our so you can win those elections were forty percent of
two problems with this one is it leads to leads to to autism was one of your findings the lot of political science
you both agree on is that this system leads to fewer major political parties
sixty percent of americans said that they want a third or or twice when they go to
in our our electoral system really going to get sick and start
one problem
the other problem is that what thousand and twelve democrats one more votes for the house
and yet did not win the house of representatives and people estimated that we need to
the houseboat nationally by what get between seven or eleven points in november to take control and that's because of things like gerrymandering
democrats
republicans in a partner
democrats cluster together and city hustler i don't have a single republican random chicago where you know
no i wouldn't know where to find you know everyone i know it's a leftist but that's a problem for drug district
so there's a reform out there
or spoke recall sarah
instead of having a single member district
you'd have three or five member district
those people will be elected it earned the right choice
so that you know you could vote your heart with your first wrestler vote for the working families green party however and
person doesn't when you're going to notice them redistributed get away
your second choice
it gets your vote
so it would avoid know what's happening in california right now are democrats themselves by running she going to canada it's and the stock to armor insist on this is where this is another case where ranks spreading
oh
it would eliminate your and you couldn't germany in germany now
so german and will be gone like just and songwriter and rotors anymore
it's a former proportional representation on the idea that you know the percentage of a political party guts should in some way shape or form translate roughly and to the percentage of the and that's like my will be going to back to the right now and again
whether we prefer the us not on the constitution
so you could fix it with a simple act of congress lot of the them and then it's gone and the wholesomeness transport and i think americans would really like the system that comes out of the us or five art isn't august
and people would no longer feel like they have to folks were already that doesn't really represent what they believed
i picked another thing that contributes to the decline of the system people are really sucked out of it yeah i think it also contributes to i mean that gets to the the last thing which is about voter suppression but also voter turn out like what you're describing also deeply demoralize his people and from the electoral process
you know there's there's a really inspirational going on and a lot of states right now to restore the rights of exponents you are deprived of the right
sticks to get people automatically registered to vote
to get rid of some of these voter id laws
some people don't realize is that is a clause in the us constitution gives congress the right to do whatever they want to the state procedures for federal elections so all of these things are are something that to be wiped away with a single piece of national legislation
called the modern than exotics
lol voter id laws that are designed to suppress the already
it could create automatic voter registration so that you don't have an out like complex bureaucracy to register to vote we just are registered
create a holiday for federal elections what wouldn't you know a lot of things that would turn out because like ninety million people set up with sixteen presidential election
in a lot of that was because the candidates but a lot of it because there's just there's so many different where is that people are prevented are discouraged from voting and this country and it was one thing we know about those ninety million people that didn't is the
is that are less educated or less well off people will open you know statistically would vote for the left and higher numbers and the road so to me this is just it's like a slam dunk it's another month
you come out with expensive piece of legislation
six has a lot of these problems that you saw activists in virginia
when they were i was like a hundred seventy thousand stones and then magically democrats on projections
so it's another thing and i'm not i cannot believe that this wasn't addressed the last time darker and so unified power and you see it but you know hopefully we'll have another opportunity and i think it's really important
because when turn out goes up you know the origins of the left to go up to think it's pretty simple i mean virginal now we're discussing
some ways to not just
increase turn out for the a left wing population but also to let's be honest suppress the votes of people we would not participate in our democratic process so i always thinking just blaring rap music and all polling places would be a good place to start
a literacy test you are read a monologue from felix and you have to identify all the sound cloud reference any references yes some sort of like a new form of literacy tests at the polls but based only on the type of shit that like felix is really interested in i was thinking voting by snap chat filter just on election day there's like a
there's a snap chat filter like republican or democrat you swipe which one you want they get a lot of young people out there
honestly i don't buy the cost of mad men
yeah kit
something christie it's told i think you should have to vote by a starkey sub tweet voting voting by kissing booth where you are present but a member of your sex so you vote by kissing someone in your vote counts more if you kiss longer and more passionately voting
with
bathroom makes sense
oh virgil you also you also mentioned you only get the franchise achieve a victory ray allen fortnight that's why idea i also think that before you vote you should have to officiate an interracial marriage so yeah they are or you know i also i mean this is my
a radical suggestion here i don't think you should be allowed to vote after out don't know sixty five like as soon as you start collecting so security it's like you should have the best most generous pension provided by the government a top of the line healthcare but you don't get to vote anymore because it's sort of like you're just you're running out the clock now it's not really your can
we're so your opinions or less valid is that people are gonna have to live in it for another forty or fifty years why like jack's idea that everyone in the planet should get to vote for the american president except for america
do i think we've lost that yeah absolutely
it's not too much laugh but like i do you want to get we've we've gone through now the strategies that you lay out for keeping in maintaining power and making it possible to achieve the kind of legislation in society that we'd all like to live in however in reading your book like going through this there's this idea that
the democrats have to take our take back power to do any of this stuff but i'm wondering like in reading this book i felt like it's sort of the obviously the republican party is what we're concerned about because they control government but in terms of actually implementing this strategy
i was struck that it seemed to me that the biggest impediment that is the democratic party itself as it is currently constituted on an institutional level and i'm wondering what your thoughts are about that
i mean i agree and disagree to a certain extent
we've seen a lot of in instruments i'm an early since two thousand and seven
you know that done one hundred percent
two thousand and two
thirteen onwards it's gone
there's some people are still there
you know sort of a policy center at a party has been moved left
and a lot of ways that's that's what a credit due to the to the standard
and i'm starting to it
but i think that there's you know it takes a long time to transform apart from the inside
so a lot of these older folks who are committed to a different way of doing things you to different economic model
who came of age during the clinton era you know they just have to be pushed out of our they are they have to be successful each hours and receptor terrorists and
skinner take time regressive left is not winning every single day they engage in right mouse
but i think that they are really reinvigorate a i've never seen them
and i find that really hurt me so you know i guess i guess what i would say
the democrat like right now the democratic national go russell change in this country it is really aren't on
i think there's some people are going to go
you know seventeen ago
as a lot of people perceive to be and center or when to old institutions and norms
you just don't get it
i think that they don't get what people do it everyday people
this country
what i do think that would be better off under a democratic government and we would add and that
we can simultaneously try to make that happen
hold people accountable wants to get into artist minutes in its day stray too far off the reservation them which aren't them and emirates get much more aggressive about just like republicans have done
you know what i'm thinking about the last relationship organized labor
you know they work on this project and two thousand and eight remember god and so does the kind of you know that's the kind of policies
what the real trick air is maintaining engagement
don't laugh beyond the election itself so when we get know if and when we get into power and when when man we can't just do an article like everything salt because then you're going to see the parents are that democratic i'll just as to slow sort of a snip the money on when and motors like walk towards if if we don't hold him accountable we don't get the right kind of others
it was a long answer that's now i mean when i was preparing for the interview are today
i just came across peace in the the washington post
by jeff stein about what happens to what happened to new jersey democrats when they ran on a millionaire attacks and then got elected and wouldn't you know it they're not so hot on the millionaire attacks anymore so their husbands or tags enough as it is
but like the point you're making the book is that like the republican party really is the body through which this demon known as the conservative movement occupies and the democratic party is really not a political party has such is more of just son of a collection of different interest groups
jockeying for power pudgy so the delineate a little bit more like the actual difference between these two parties and how they operate
i think at least this century
what you've seen as republicans have been transformed into like a european style parliamentary party
that is there an adult
not the rigidly committed to going out about what gender you know to the point where they can't even joe to raise revenue to closing attacks loot or
originally written or spoken crazy going to drown them
and so that's very different
don't it
which is which is i think is a coalition different groups who work together to sleep
who don't always snare sort of policy preferences across the issue is it's you know
teachers' unions and organized labor color
students and young people at an unwieldy cause him to try to get on the same age about always the change
one that's encouraging to me is i think the data is starting to reflect
you know the people in congress and move into the last you know it's there to the left or where they worked years ago
more or less than that works and years ago
because republicans are the their long march where they are older at the farmer
i think a lot of people are skeptical albeit what we've been in this country has been so the democrats to march after the fire rough
but i think that there's a cemetery is not just in terms of artists or or comprised of them
or artist act and and power
they're still too many democrats were going to do so
what they originally him in an office and what oldest reward us bipartisanship and it was like no know going on at all
and in fact it just uses the democratic base and frustrates the democratic
i don't think that that's come out work as strategy and don't want them to go out spite of watches
republicans have not read and on a policy you know but i want them to start acting like a parliamentary block and or same weather oh yeah but in order to could get to that point of moving like if our goal is to move the democratic party to the left and not just annihilated completely as i suspect many of her listeners with dear
hope for you you mention it they it you know not to relive the litigate the sixteen primary is will all be doomed to do until the earth
just fries itself and the oceans boil but hey that's our bread and butter on this show is endlessly related getting the democratic primary in the beginning of the book you outline sort of three broad strategies in this ensure liberal democratic debate about where the party needs to go the first should be the british
anders model of appealing to working class voters with the more left wing populism should have more traditionally democratic socialist message the second is the centrist route which is about peeling off moderate suburban republicans and independents who don't like trump and like sort of bringing them into the folder
persuading them to jump ship and the third would just be like two thousand and sixteen as an outlier just keep doing what worked for obama and o eight and two thousand and twelve and just doubled down on the you know this idea that the demographics and the youth of this country are just inevitably tilted in our favor i'm wondering
as a political scientist
why is number two on this list the strategies even up for debate after thousand and sixteen election
mean in my mind it's not i mean i don't think it does message is having any reason and spoke with the actual democratic worse
just message just largely
mark
although new york
who are terrible rhetoric and and earth
responders or so
also what actual owners more
i don't know how these things
but if out there as a potential strategy
it is sort of embodied an actual electoral strategy is really oh man
super adjust your barracks were going to be able to pick up a lawsuit
i don't think you're actually seeing the when i'm suburban districts
it's not happening
on it
couple of months ago
and we saw no progress when in pretty good republican suburban counties
or districts and
which is evidence
primary voters and not necessarily seeing a strategic choices
an arm
and i don't see anyone in the real like mark and molds
in primaries and then again in order to the general actually i'm going on
is nowhere near that kind of creature is the center and erratic imagine that should be yeah
i mean but there's a lot of a procedural hurdles to clear if you have a more open democratic primary process them in there are still a lot of these procedural hacks that are these locks and dams through super delegates and close primaries and things like that that our hands stringing a more
progressive or left wing democratic party
yeah i mean i don't know what's happening right now it's shocking to earth still superdelegates in the system
i hope that getting rid of them as article compromised
you can we want more people in the process i also picked up we need to talk seriously about getting rid of
which it and this is a way i just like a oil rich misread it's like you get to get rid of superdelegates get to get rid of august and we all agree to have open primaries
i think that that's reasonable compromise because the caucuses as cool as they are
what's cooler than standing in a hazy will see him for ten hours
i said what's cooler than standing in a high school gym for ten hours
and who doesn't have ten hours
so i think the goal should be like let's get and more people involved in the primaries
on the philosophy that the more people are in the primaries
better candidates will get more other watch like the actual our preferences of democratic or so to me anything that gets more people out and armrest and so we should be working ensure but but you're right i we do want to reduce the ability of neat inside the party to direct to direct outcomes
it's the way the politics works for a long time i think it was uncontroversial until recently but i also think it's it's totally out of stuck with voters now expect a local targeted you know you don't want to have a party structure
at all like a party structure that able to disaster and erase era pursuit
i don't get that any brewed remedies democratic voters want
and the party to out as much power
david ferris on the final note of what we all want to need my last question for you
wood burning of one
yeah you here for extra year and here
after out myself as as a as a need support from the cause my asthma
yeah but i had less him off
this you know his overhead
come to jesus moment election
in retrospect you know that
should have just believes the polls
so bernie doing better in the general actually i think there's a real argument in it
voters saw something and
didn't see any other candidates
remember back into sixteen when i walked in the classrooms which are sold it in interrupts
and they all loved bernie sanders
scanners and that it's evidence that he is speaking to people who want to different objects
in a way that hillary clinton didn't
he has a cogent see to go to the ideological lot longer than any other democrats locked
and i think that he would have been much better oil
sort of like galloping corruption what we were seeing and attempt administration so you know there's no way an hour for sure
when they would have a lot of stuff at him
but again i'm i am yeah
i think you were on david ferris the book is it's time to fight dirty available in bookstores now thank you so much for joining us david
here is by
and no a reading from the book of chap by the book i have selected this reading
it is the introduction to chapter kids live in which we outline are the statement on the problem with the american lip so their dive into this this chatter begins with to epic graphs
what did the rules to you that was so offensive to the republican party senator i'll tell you what they did the rules got women the right to vote the bras got african americans the raking over the rules created so security and lifted millions in elderly people out of poverty the rules and it's segregation the past the civil rights act the voting rights act the rules created medicare
liberals past the clean air act and clean water act that conservatives do they oppose every one of those programs everyone so when you try to hurl the word liberal and my feet as if it were something dirty something to run away from something that i should be ashamed of it won't work senator because i will pick up that label and where it
as a badge of honor
those with the words of presidential candidate matt santos as played by jimmy smits on the television program the west wing
followed by the second paragraph
if the rule you followed you do this of what was the rule
anton sugar no country for old men
okay
no our own words
pretty liberal do they not bleed
of course will bleed all over you like a romanov a second cousin
do they not like us prefer things to be good rather than bad in some very general sense yes
and as the first paragraph above lays out do they not have a record of popular legislation to their name
to be sure and boy do they love to bring it up
why then do we live
the essential problem is not that liberals are as bad as conservatives but rather there is a giant sucking void at the core of there being in the place of real beliefs liberals have guilty consciences in the place of politics they have a democratic process to assuage those consciences the process this process
pitts tepid reforms against the deranged and revenge just right wing with no such inclination towards consensus or incrementalism despite its claim to the mantle of american progress the liberal algorithm produces positive social change legislation only when pressured sometimes terrorized by militant and or
popular left wing movements without an organized and popular left liberals and up negotiating themselves into oblivion moving the country inevitably to the right
if you're of the millennial generation and even slightly left of center liberals in the democratic party has been the only game in town as long as you've been alive your parents most likely protesting the war and support of the civil rights movement and have been patting themselves on the back ever since
but the litany of bold progressive legislation liberals always point to is at least thirty years old and it's been eroded by both republican and democratic government since all those great liberal achievements have been systematically dismantled both by the right who made such destruction their mission and democrats and liberals themselves
who believe they have to innovate their ideas and moved to the center to win elections
your parents slightly considered themselves pretty radical and they were your age they were known to enjoy good vibrations solid wages backed by union power a college education that cost a nickel and the ability to go to the doctor without selling their car to pay for it but since those days americans jerk to the right and so liberals had to do the same in
order to win elections and keep the country for moving further right
this is the basic liberal mantra and it's fitting that it takes the form of an excuse it's end result is a political system irrevocably weighted towards the forces of reaction coincidentally by almost every metric you are poor and your life is more precarious than your parents were at a similar age get over it snowflake this book is your purchase
a patient trophy
unfortunately the eternal wimp out shows no signs of slowing down these days there are two kinds of liberals those who vote for democrats because the alternative is worse and those who get teary eyed at the thought of supporting cory booker are some similarly phony slug the latter are just moderate republicans and should be written off completely the former
sir deserve better and probably have some misplaced attachment to the political tradition of standing up to the right wing
these poor souls can be spared the chop or reeducation center with our patented liberal veto treatment but only if they even by the lessons in history laid out in this chapter and inform on their parents to chop oh central committee
that is the introduction to the live chapter in the chapel guide to revolution in stars august twenty first sounds like a book i like to buy
you'd be crazy not to buy this and increasingly all of the information need to buy the book can be found a chapel trap house dot com which has links to booksellers where you can pre order the book well that about does it for this week so virgil it was a it was a pleasure hosting with you without the rest of those riffraff cutting in oh your
your and a gentleman and scholar thank you very much you are a cat and a dog
more of a kappa
so next time by by scientists have yet to discover own room
self consciousness
let alone how the human brain processes two dimensional images in the three dimensional phenomenon known as perception yet somehow reason we declare seeing is believing
your scientific illiteracy makes me shudder
and i wouldn't want your roots
i'm telling anyone the to saw anything last night
and the planet venus
if you do

me i just


so in a later aside side of the news this past week there's a funny story coming out of me annapolis minneapolis earlier this week i don't know if you saw this one that is that that spiderman climbing a building oh no no it's it's raccoon man climbing a building up i remember guys
one it's a bit a little light viral video of
raccoon climbing the u b s building in downtown minneapolis but hey we know it we've got a special guest to talk about this wacky critter it's minnesota native former governor jesse ventura
jesse welcome into the shower
we'll got from i'm on worth it
got out on a your chair
comments and i ordered clear on the fibers
jesse your former governor of the state governor of minnesota so i know you must have seen this raccoon and his ascent to the top of this office building we were all riveted by me tell you
glued to my limits laptop i was in mexico and let me tell ya i saw that little critter and i knew immediately that there was more to the story you call it like new well let me tell you something
there's always a dark side of the lighter side of the new which i saw that and i was you rooted on the fact first off you wish and shape all i i'm on the record saying always the dump
sure he was trying to crawl out of there who could blame your raccoon and shape all you want to get to minneapolis but you can because of the high res sure you're gonna go up chicago look at the facts look at the and look at what he was draw
that little raccoon wish climate up the building he was looking for and church way so what's going on in the building in which the u b yes building is pointing us he knows that he has the attention of none show the public radio you know that immediately he is going to l the top my range of the group state of men his shoulder
following show what does he do he climbed street for the logo
yes and he he wants to go straight to the heart of the banking system what's happening two billion dollars down a black hole
up and you know what the main stream authorities try to distract him and bring him back down and he was confused for a second it was ready the dragon steamboat blinded by blood
stumbling around the rain
that raised as are they should keep going for at rack on it
all right now the beatles' white album it's all their rocky raccoon you started in minnesota you checked into his room there was a good a huge bible
wasn't enough
what what is this record trying to bring attention to what what what what's going on in this building while you know i have a theory i don't believe either day you do use or gods
but i believe that when you human beings fail to do what we should be doing that
nature sims the animals to step up
this sort of an animal spirit imbued in an animal but representing us all in a way the
situation calls for it nature boy real show off the rich ric flair for a common procedure gonna die
guess he had me out
going to see more of these super intelligent raccoons i mean they're suddenly becoming more popular in movies yeah well i wanna know i want to know climate up that far we've got to what we need to do which we need to follow his work and help him and get the resources there were you need to be putting boots on the ground we need to have if i were still governor
or i would have had frog defending every level scaffolding just as a matter of policy every day or the week
and then they would have been there to intercept the raccoon when he chose to go up but i think we've gotta put the resources on the ground and find out if you were scale of that use the guardians of the galaxy raccoon we are groot is there a group grow and off that build it
he has big winner a little what just it's just like you all said you know like the democrats and republicans they're not talking about real issues so there
as for you've got the republic crash
or the demo publications
or sometimes i like to see the republic cracked of date
the i know we were going to turn to sources outside the mainstream media the two parties have failed
the american people they tag in just the ventura
gags out there the raccoon tech ship that sell free to works like i'm a tag team partner of billions of organic creatures album i
i can hear you chortling but i guarantee you somebody who is not george only is any citizen of minnesota there are proud of the light rail that i installed yeah
you can go right to the state fairgrounds on that goddamn light
when i'm sure well i'm surfing and mexico that's one of two things that my by goes to proudly i think of that and i think of a one time i couldn't get out of a camel clutch
jesse i got to say what i was watching the raccoon skill this building
a thought that spring to mind was an issue that i know you've brought light on before
i was thinking maybe this raccoon escape from some sort of government lab where they're making an animal's maybe he's trying to bring to light the issue of mammals and they're going on in these government labs that we don't know that's the first that's obviously square one that's what we're building our theories ah that's the concrete
what we know what we know we're looking for our don't obviously yeah as old as the land of ten thousand lakes
it on the side of the butter bucks it's the land the lakes we've got ireland and most lakes and i have information when i wish governor delivered to me he had manila folder
but the island of dr moreau literally with a leak in minnesota
i experimented with raccoons they were experimenting when i wish governor i tried to get to the bottom of it but i was stopped by the two party system and garrison keeler i just stopped by investigation but i was on it they were they were there were there were experimenting and raccoons
giving them different color greetings
they had peppermint color greco drug and around that is let's straight
all area had lobbied i had two terms i want to put a stop to what i mean i think we need to know more about what's going on at the lake woebegone research facility yeah i'll look or garrison keeler went down but the dark money behind still up
god chap
ask questions
oh the raccoon
you astray
follow the raccoon all the raccoon that is where all the answers lead cow and the raccoon whole hash tag follow the raccoon folk
put it on social media to beat we're going to be devoting three hours to that other



we are path
your shop for this week
i'm just not i this we have licks could be with us he
game for thirteen hours straight last night and slept through his non existent alarm but don't worry you're not fear we are not completely unmanned joining us is libby watson libby was up
i'm really sorry to hear the phoenix suns diet like one of those korean kids strong just scanning jihad illness and greatly he was gaming and the same room with a fan when he went to sleep and that's what happened
be thanks so much for joining us
resident
wants you to talk about this
ballot measure that's going on in d c right now about kept wages are making a uniform
minimum wage for tipped employees
we'll get it added a little bed
it's a interesting local labour issue but before then
just overwhelmingly were thing and like you know what what what what are we gonna talk about on on the weekend show and
like overwhelmingly can he the only news story
really worth addressing from like a broad perspective right now and the news is the you know the reality that the the writers for season two thousand and eighteen of america have decided to you i think push their luck a little bit and go
it's something really outrageous like child concentration camps to get viewers back now that it's become a little boring and i gotta say i'm not liking it yet and i mean it
shot
it was a concentration camp it's pretty pretty lame and i guess like aren't even know where where to begin with this topic but you know we're now living in a country where ice steals children from families trying to cross the us mexican border
friends them from their arms and puts them into privately run concentration camps
i mean how hard you know where to go by i don't know i'll just begin with this account from npr who reading here says kids started appearing at the shelter who didn't know the drill they had just been separated from their parents so they were experiencing an increased amount of trauma trauma said and
davidson who worked for southwest he a nonprofit that operates more than two dozen shelters for migrant children from texas to california davidson quit this week because the shelter where he worked in tucson arizona didn't have the train staffing to handle the influx of a younger more traumatize children he said the breaking point for davidson
came he says when he was asked to tell two siblings ages six and ten that they could hug each other they called me over the radio and they wanted to translate to these kids that the rule of the shelter is that they're not allowed to hug he says
these are kids that had just been separated from their mom basically just huddling and hoping each other in a desperate attempt remain together southwest keys as it has a clear policy that allows touching and hugging in certain circumstances
well never mind while they're yeah they're allowed to hug in certain circumstances
i'm going off that i saw jaw pollack of bright part apparently visited one of these child concentration camps and said that they had a problem for the kids in that they also they were field trips to the zoo so all in all we've been misinformed about what these things are what goes down on them right
seemed a stupid thing about that is joe pollack didn't go to one of the new year's census boys that have been separated from that parents as a result of the new policy he went to an officer
he resettlement
center where unaccompanied child line is have been house since two thousand and fourteen so not so excuse not to say so it's fine but he was visiting a completely different
facility from the ones that everyone else has been visiting another facility they visited this week we saw of one of the reporters who are allowed into one of these again child prisons we saw they had a one of these facilities a giant mural of donald trump behind an american flag with an inspirational quote from the
the deal that read sometimes when you lose the battle you find a way to win the war
and again you know i don't want to belabor this comparison too much you know reports came in their parents were told that their children were being taken to a shower and then hours later realized that they had just been taken away
parallels there are two striking to miss but a quote from the art of the deal that leads you into a child concentration camp really is the are parked might mark vi of our times only even stupider which is the real hallmark of everything
though is the stupidest version of anything you can imagine and the cruelest yeah it's deeply american i would say it's it's definitely a
got that upsurge
separation and reality sense that things in america have i think the only way it could be more american would be if it was sponsored by mcdonalds or something or if it was in an abandoned walmart away a lot of them
i didn't realize
you know you see stuff like this and like i said the accounts of ice agents
do in the old were taking your kids to the shower trick which again i don't like anyone saying that it's inappropriate to compare this to the holocaust is completely for shit it's like it doesn't have to be a death camp for to be a concentration camp the original definition of a concentration camp was a place it was yeah camp in which
ethnic minorities could be segregated from the rest of the population including women and children to make the fighting may male population first using the boer war by the british i mean it's literally by definition these are child concentration camps
and it's just we're dealing with it case of like such obvious staggering evil confronting us evil that is i'm sorry if you're a citizen of this country you are responsible for it's all of our fault with you voted for donald trump or not
our country this is happening within our borders it's happening in plain sight everybody knows or these facilities are everybody knows it's going on there's thousands of kids being held right now
and it's going on like i said on the open and i guess my question is how do we how do we deal with this and i don't mean deal with it like psychologically like how do we how do we stop this because like we just we feel like we're confronted with
both this the staggering evolve what's going on but also this terrible sense that you know
since of paralysis or fatigue that is just like where you throw up your arms and just go oh well that's just twenty eighteen dumpster fire year of the stupidest fucking century ever in human history where we do i completely agree i've been thinking about that a week and a lot of the times with stuff under trump
i my instinct has been worth for example the healthcare bill that almost happened last year and the tax cuts
know i keep thinking i mean democrats to be stronger and stand up and everything because the republican party is pretty much beyond any kind of
influence as a i it's most disgusting elements the reason people always rag on even like us for criticizing democrats too much when republicans are was but it's because you're a republican the just be on the fucking pale this like what can you even say or a republican policy anymore they just they clearly just beyond that
i've been thinking about i mean democrats are being disabled the right things on this and you know some of them are going to the facilities and stuff and all that's great but it just feels so few tile because while can to you there again the republican party is never going to they're not going to whole donald trump all his administration accountable as whole and they want this in a good chunk of them want this
so i don't know how we overcome the machinery of the state let alone public opinion and you know that good and i was thirty percent of americans you will just simple whatever it is that donald trump does it it's really hard to know you think about i mean i wish i had a good answer or i mean i have been seen some
representatives have been going to these facilities and demanding and friends to inspect these facilities who talked to some of these kids but you mention democrats him the right things i mean not all of them are i'm sitting in particular kemal a harris twenty twenty hopeful when on chris hayes is show
and chris hayes and to asked her point blank should ice exist
a government agency that literally didn't exist twenty years ago and come our harris gave a long stem winding qualification about how you know chris i'm a prosecutor and my mom most important thing if people are committing murders and rapes like the to be punished and if theory legal if you he deported so yes i think i should exist but no i don't think that
should be know separating children from their families and it's like you can't get come on
should be the easiest fucking question to ask any democratic hopeful for twenty twenty should ice exists the answer and no easy and eating and then just to be clear that that clear that wasn't from last week it was actually from march that she said oh really
this week
doesn't excuse not it should have been fucking clear years ago let alone in march that we should abolish ice but that was that wasn't this way people will reach sharing everything because it's like yeah you said this two months ago one of three months ago still should have been class so yeah i mean i don't have a lot of a
the twenty twenty field is going to articulate a complete and reason response to this and it is it must be said lake
his extreme and horrendous is what's going on now is
there has been a machine in place to know
torture and exploit and abuse immigrants four years now and it was happening under up on our and it's been happening for years so it needs to be a broader reckoning and just the small matter of child separation absolutely and obama deported more people than like the last few presidents before him
mind but what we're seeing right now is policy put in place that is crafted by into appeal to again like shouldn't be controversial to say this in the slightest
the white supremacist part of our population and government and i'm speaking of course about jeff sessions who absolutely believes this is the right thing to do because he believes america is a white country and in particular also in the trump administration steven miller
there's been several news arms this week about how this whole child separation policy was absent was his brain child from the get go and he's a guy who's been in the background of the trump administration the entire time and it's been very much under the radar and he's the one fucking just absolute reptile who i think is probably
it to this white house and anyone because his name is out of the news and he's getting what he wants and it's just it's just blows my mind like i mean in general i again i think the media has been largely pretty good about treating rest is the extreme disgusting thing that is but just not equipped for this level
you know illegal and open an evil activity like you see their reports is saying you know steve miller saying credit for this and stuff and like in a sensible society that would be that would be that would participate him being sent to the hague you know that would be like okay well we'll send this bitch to jail than there would be
an inquiry that would be an investigation would be some kind of way to say oh it was this guy's idea whoa he's going to present for the rest of his life as know i'm going to happen
he's going to leave the white house and he's going to found some fuckin consulting firm for the most disgusting republican this and make a good salary for the rest of his life and he'll be fine i mean again
gets back to this question of you know what has to be done as someone once said but i mean again we know where these facilities are and it's just like we're seeing like the limits of what normal politics can accomplish our normal politics have accomplished something and it's rending children from the mother their mother's arms and putting them
tent cities in the middle of the desert as a specific policy of torturing their parents and stephen moyer said you know raising the price of trying to live in this country if you were born here yeah
it's just heartbreaking i was at the gym and working out which i do you all the time to his i'm incredibly impressive and i was watching m s n b c and there was a girl
being interviewed because she had been she was there a part of a protest and she had brought letters from like other kids and people in america and stuff and she was just going to read them out loud outside the facility to let the kids now they're not alone and stuff and it's just like when you have other children
if i were the portland thing and it's like when you have other children having to stand up and do you know just like the only thing they can do like that is just the as heartbreaking fucking thing but i think you're right it has to be asked to be direct action like people who got to go there and they got to disrupt it physically hurt to start doing things that are illegal to physical
blocking the entrances and exits yeah letting people leave or go to work you know being arrested themselves again for starters will he get rid of every one of these camps tomorrow if enough people just decided to literally storm them and dismantle them and free the children inside or take them into their own homes and
going underground railroad it's been done before but i think what we would see now is obviously the retaliation from the state would probably be swift and overwhelming and as was the surveillance of anyone involved in you know fuck we saw what happened and jake for hours for just treating them as easy should be killed let alone
actually tried to physically stops of one of them from doing their jobs right of course and we know that border patrol and have no problem
she's shooting at can anyone who tries to help are immigrants at all
that is where the mine has to go if your rational person is to you like irrational means are things that seem like beyond the pale i mean it's happened before in the history of this country and yeah probably should happen again to be on that but at the very least jeff sessions shouldn't be allowed to be able to leave his home without
oh
yelling at you know like the home a bad man episode where have a hard working with saw that should be jeff sessions like the rest of his life i just want to share and then briefly that just came across the wires that i think as a counterpoint to me saying that the media has been generally pretty good on this witches
maloney a trumpet out a statement saying mrs trump hates to see children separated from their families and hope both side of the aisle can achieve can finally come together to achieve successful integration or whole and she believes we need to be a country that follows all laws but also a country that governs with heart and phillip russia who is the whitehouse spirit
she for the washington post said milan a trap seems to break with the trump administration not at all
zero tolerance
fitch no no she doesn't you
and fuse reiterating the whole point of this is too strong arm the democrats passing a comprehensive immigration reform that gives them things like the wall and also limits legal immigration
this whole was all an effort to try to create leverage to pass something that will be brutally restrictive
and do things like glue them legal immigration which which hardliners always insists there isn't a problem no
or and we're worried about illegal immigration
if you obey the law them we have no problem with you but the goal of this this bill the from trying to wring out of the democrats
do by means of this sadistic for didn't claim gooey on display is to limit legal immigration and drastically increase penalties for trying to get this country at all and anyway that is the other thing about you know when the immigration hardliners are like you know
the facebook people facebook america talks about this issue
it's it's all these people whose fucking irish or italian grand parents you know that or they came through this country the railway you know my answer to escape if the came here at a time when they're literally was no immigration laws you like movies will use literally just came up with the said hi
i'm linguine scallops
your name is louis school make your you go
but the other thing is like even he will talk about it now they're like you know don't blame trump don't blame eyes blame these parents for breaking the law and putting their kids and harm breaking
civil offense we're talking about these are misdemeanor laws that are being broken here like if you've ever driven drunk or like dirt dirt and faster than illegal speed limit like you are committing a more serious crime than overseeing a visa or crossing an invisible line without permission but yeah of course some
these people are coming here to seek asylum which is not illegal it's not illegal to come to a country and seek asylum but everyone is being treated as a criminal just crossing the border which is completely insane will also i mean again like if you're talking about people were coming seeking asylum from central american countries like el salvador there are a lot of them are seeking asylum from the
catastrophic gang violence in their countries which is in turn being used as a reason not to let them in the country from m s thirteen or whatever and i'm sorry like reason el salvador is such a violent country is because of this country in the first fucking boys gather is that case recently where the justice department
prosecuted a salvadoran woman
and immigration violation
and they said that because she had been forced to work she had been forced into labour by salvadoran gang she had forgiven material support to use a salvadoran gang and therefore she was ineligible for i
it's just the most fucked up shit pretty cruel sadism just writ large out or out in the open as part of it again a part of a policy that is about hurting people who want to come live in this country because they're not the right color and we don't want them around idea though we just don't have enough space or money in this country to any any more
people in the people who work there should i mean my god anyone who's working for eight team they have essentially disqualify themselves from any any job with more responsibility than a fucking dog walker
they should have federal law enforcement
authorities and the same any kind of immigration mechanism that we have to have because you have to have immigration enforcement in some way or another
she can't involve any one in this organization they would have entirely completely fucking urged
as a fucking compromised them up throwing them in prison yeah i quickly out alex arch here
peace for t y t last week about how ever on correctly were first southwest key is a nonprofit because it is but i think people don't realize how well paid executives i wrote about how that nine ninety s shows it
those executives are making like hundreds of thousands if not millions off this is what those figures from a few years ago but there's no doubt that these people are rich off this absolutely insane disgusting practice and yeah they should be prosecuted to absolutely
easy to fall into the trap and just being like oh you know trump is doing this obviously if hillary clinton was president ice would still exists in these deportations would be continuing a pace probably not with the same level of iron or outrage that we're seeing now however i think to see that is also kind of an hour
for how uniquely awful and evil are trump and the people who surround him really are again to return to a guy like steve miller like that this is something he's been working his basically since he was twelve years old calling into conservative talk radio to complain about how his classmates
wouldn't stand for the fucking flag or had sex without
his permission or something
look when you think about him and the people in the right wing media and
voters themselves i mean again it's racism motivating them but like i don't know what at base do you think he motivates someone like stephen know to get this far in life being so fucking rotten and evil i do not fucking now it
he has been this way since he was a teenager
mckay coffins had the profile of him and he was tweaking the other day that you know that this fits with he like he's basically just a troll and the he enjoys to see like people are liberals for example having
and connections have a child concentration camps but i don't think that can fully explain it like that's a lot of work just to get people riled up you don't know if he's like a sort of fortune lord
views just the troll you would be like hearing people are being like ah ha going to put your kid into a a tenth person who does but he's actually doing the rolling any more
policy
that's reality it's not just like easing people including kids in concentration camps to and lives is nothing i mean it starts that were taught in your own summer it's before the holocaust this
he talks about how you can't really debate them or are you in points because they don't really care about points they don't really care about are you familiar with make sense
get off on your discomfort of anger and like that
can become an all consuming world view
and i mean
what else are you going to do if you're if you're a person likes the with miller this little carbon call from from santa monica who is just filled with nothing but deep empathy for a majority of your fellow citizens
mean why not just basically commit yourself to becoming a comic book villain
hopes of crossing as much grief to the people you don't like as possible but i mean
it's trolling put but like all like a lot of these people who claim to patrols it's driven by genuine racism
kind of gets delighted when people talk or trolling as if it's value neutral as of just be there's there's such a thing of these guys who don't actually believe that you could spend that much time devoted to that kind of goal without having any real investment in what you're saying i think that that's that's sort of a thing people tell themselves
to not acknowledge the reality of so many of the people that they encounter every day on line and in real life and the fact is is that you know you become a troll because you you want to see people you don't like suffer and the people you don't like ten people who don't look like you and he's getting to do that he is getting the best
the both worlds he gets to troll people in maple loops mad and also maintain
wipes majority in america for a few more decades that might otherwise have been the case
yeah i think that's or i think the fact that he enjoys pissing off liberals doesn't change the fact that he is just a fucking white nationalist is what he is and i think again with trump and this is something i've said before but i think we're really seeing is that people with authoritarian personalities need permission from an authoritarian leader to really let this all out
you know and i think what we're seeing is a greater degree people are being less and less shy about just saying the quiet part loud in terms of you know
running for office as republicans on platforms of explicit white nationalism or just not even denying that they are i don't know a neo confederate or a nazi or someone who genuinely believes that white people are superior to other races and should be treated as such and right
as sad that's the direction at the republican party like it's it's only gonna get worse because it's like an entire generation is fucking state and as out there filled you know all the college republicans are just like this awful combo like stephen mailers and charlie kirk's i mean where we are
i mean i saw in another comment purring and yet another comment about sort of like during the obama administration all of the semi ridiculous paranoia about fema camps and things like that
well like now we see that that's just an obvious projection of what vague
they want to do to people who are not them and they assume that because obama is not like them doesn't look like that that's what he's going to do to them so it's just like prisoners dilemma thing of like who staff and fill the fema camps first because they believe is going to happen or should happen
someone has gotten some of the him locked up and it's not going to be them i think for that is a core belief for a lot of a lot of them up at the grassroots but a lot of the have a lot of this is made worse by the fact that the nature of american two party system and norms of journalism is that you have to keep
treating them republican party like a regular party
you have to treat it as the broad expression of a center right is that
right encompasses everyone from eisenhower to donald trump when i'm with a fast lead
very rapidly turning into a a very sort of celebration is racist party
there's no equipment in the american political system or in journalism to handle that there is no way to talk about a party
like that when it is one of the to you know because you have to sort of keep them in your mind
pounds forces between these two broad coalitions instead of instead of one sort of hyper racist
of apocalyptic death cult completely and they're so vulnerable to a soft bigotry have low expectations there is that tweet by a capitol hill reports saying no small thing orion says he is not comfortable with the constitution can i add that is the smallest possible thing
that is a grain of rice i mean is tiny
i mean again i just feel like
discussing this issue are talking about how how evil and bad it is just seems inadequate and i'm almost embarrassed to be doing it because
like i said this is all going on in broad daylight in front of all literally in front of our eyes and talking about it or just saying that this is evil isn't enough
because it's still going on and you know it can outrage you and you can vote against the republican party or the people that are carrying this out but at the same time i mean these camps are still being billed and built in filled with people and ice is still around and like i said it's going to take something more than that and i think it just a matter of
i feel like a hypocrite
because i'm not putting my life and body on the wind stop this either but i think we off to ask ourselves the question is like you know what are you willing to do or what are you willing to give up in your own life to stop this from going on and until until we each individually can answer that for ourselves
it just i don't know it doesn't seem like it just seems like it's going to get worse and we're just going to be left to comment on how dumb and evil an awful everything is yep i agree they're out there are some get organizations
provide legal services emigrants on the border
this one the refugee and emigrants sense
occasion and legal services
that identity last week
and they do you really get so they're out there are things like that us car still elites that are thousands of miles away from the crisis well i mean i think that that's a very good things that everyone can start to do is find the organizations that are providing aid and support to him
grants and their families and are trying to get into these facilities in any way possible
to find organizations that are doing that work and support them at the very least with money
okay moving on to another issue a local issue
in your neck of the woods libby this tuesday
there is a vote in washington d c for something called initiative seventy seven
can you describe for us what this initiative is and sort of some of the lot the sort of intense lobbying battle that has cropped up over what is otherwise this sort of seemingly minor local issue
yes so initiatives seventy seven would eliminate he tipped minimum wage
mostly as in many states tips work is empty see can be paid and low as three dollars and thirty three cents an hour and the difference can be made up in tips
our law is that if
employers have to make up the difference if they don't receive enough tips to get a minimum wage and so they spell would do with our system and
after an eight year phase in periods and by twenty twenty six day would have to pay tipped employees a regular minimum wage which by then will be fifteen dollars an hour
so that's that's the basic structure of it sounds pretty non controversial you would think except there has been a massive lobbying effort by a mostly by the national restaurant association unknown
as the other and and
and they have started a campaign called save our tips
which is they have their frame this very cleverly and very disingenuous way as
taking you know is something that would take away work is tips
which in principle it there's nothing in the initiative that says that people can't take anymore
this post their idea is that people won't tip if they know their servers are making fifteen bucks an hour which will start of the pruitt certainly wouldn't you know yeah i mean i can imagine a lotta fuckin gino wearing decades in dc saying oh excuse me i know that you make fifteen bucks an hour bitch again the tick i can imagine a lot of people here doing that but
i see you know i really don't think that is i i don't know where they're getting that from i don't know what evidence there i mean is obviously a huge cultural norm in america to fucking tipped so and as proponents of the initiative point out there are many other states that have a sort of won fair wage
alaska montana nevada minnesota california oregon and washington all have the system where there's no separate tips minimum wage and as far as i know people people still to it
who states it's still pretty normal to do so a tipping is so ingrained in me when when
visited holland i went to amsterdam
like all the tips are included in the restaurants there and i still couldn't stop myself from tipping because it felt so rude to just leave without leaving it to brown completely i mean when i go to england people again massive chips that they've never experienced menorah their lives because be blood in the u k to like five percent because with mean
fuckers
no via the american thing to do is for these these horror stories about people that will come in particularly in the sunday after church rush and literally like line up like a series of ones on the edge of the table and the begin to subtract each dollar
for every like not coffee refill not smile or if you're waitress or waiter says no problem instead of you're welcome
that's the whole subtracted everything is taken away but this thing about
this weird imbalance between
wage jobs and tipped jobs because people who were for tips as bartenders are waiters do tend to make more money in terms of like the cash they take home and someone who works for just twelve or fifteen dollars an hour at like a box store or another another a retail job however tipping
having that like so much like your entire income depending on tips
open the door to this whole other world of kind of i don't know harassment and just sort of like this idea of your server being a kind of you know
servant for you that you can reward and punish at a whim and no thing i want to mention
brennan pass this law unto us from a dc fan of the show who's involved with this campaign and he says another huge thing about if the initiative would or pass is that it would also put a huge dent into wage theft by restaurant owners which is a huge issue that especially in packs especially people who are buses
there's food runners and bar backs who are overwhelmingly immigrants and people who speak english as a second language so in this like tipping economy because it is cash and like it's easier for employers to essentially steal money from their employees yeah yeah so the the economic policy and
it has a good guide to the initiative seventy seven stuff and they point out that absolutely this which make it so much harder for you know i mean obviously wage stuff goes on in all industries but it it is rampant in the restaurant industry and they say in investigations of over nine thousand restaurants the us
department of labor found that eighty four percent of investigated restaurants were in violation of wage and our laws including nearly twelve hundred violations of the requirements you bring tipped workers wages up to the minimum wage
and it happens all the time this like study after study how
tipped workers are more prone to this to this way staffed and that is something that would be addressed by this issue and yet there were save our tips campaign has just obviously not addressed and anyway
and framed this i actually have odd here that i took from
founding farmers in dc when i say this
weekend and there's obviously no mention of says this measure would eliminate the tip credit system i mean they don't say anything about what that is i mean that sounds great love to get credit doesn't explain what that is
basically like everything else is about killing jobs over time and forcing restaurants to close which is another thing that the data doesn't necessarily back up at all
libby you see this thing where the the anti seventy seven campaigners with the restaurant industry people they did this thing where they created this kind of pop up restaurant
it was intentionally bad and shitty to give diners and experience of like it was called like restaurant twenty twenty and it was to give customers like a taste of what the dining out experience would be like if this measure passes yeah it was super fucking embarrassing
it's just like a very dc thing
and restaurant already exists in dc it's called boss burger on avenue you
do not
bosco has gone by the way it is clearly or pilot that was they really just reopened under a different name to yeah
so they have this twenty twenty six pop up where they raised the prices of the cocktails and like had fewer servers and stuff
but damn crawford his with the e p i pointed out onto it said that the prices the prices that they listed the coattails out we're not even very much above inflation
like why inflation would do to prizes in two thousand twenty six anyway so they're saying that if initiative seventy seven causes that cocktail prices will be one dollar and ten cents or and servers will make fifteen bucks sounds great i mean honestly yeah i would pay a dollar and ten cents more than my shitty cocktail if it meant that work has got a living wage i mean it was
he should have been a cellphone but the media coverage of this has been really really poor service but if the have a minimum wage like the than their american to be desperate enough to complement my big boy blue than when i go and eat when i'm not going to treat me like the special boy that i am going to just treat me like a regular customer and american and
new big boy moroccan to give me the special treats ray where they're now going i'm going to be tell an old ladies that they look like their daughters are any of that
i don't want to live in that world hey a a cop restaurant where cocktails cost fifteen dollars what is this the new york restaurant experience
yeah i don't have met
what i said earlier that i think i'm
when you hear like
a lot of the push back to this idea of servers making the standard minimum wage rather than a tipped one i think a lot of hostility again this comes from that that suburban authoritarian mindset
you really like the are like being a waiter is an easy job so to be able to feed yourself you're really have to impress me i bust my ass sitting in my air conditioned office of my big jet ski dealership six hours a day
and i come in there i want to see you hustling i want to see smiling i want you to ask about my biceps
i want i want to feel like the king of a particular restaurant because i am because i'm buying a twelve dollars salisbury steak of one of the many correct thing is correct opinions are offered by anthony brewer dane was if you are rude or imperious to wait staff or servers ever
you can be written off from humanity immediately yeah now i agree i mean the correct approach is that unless the way to literally sheets on your plate and they have to get the twenty percent tip
that's just like the normal opinion as far as i'm concerned that yeah there's a lot i like suburb and dad's that seem to think that big a waiter is like a cushy job so the vote for this is on tuesday this upcoming tuesday so if you listen to this episode know that there is still time
time if you're in d c to vote for seventy seven and against the the other and array the national restaurant association and vote for you know the the fair treatment of waiters by their employers and also i mean to save our tips campaign is just
so disgusting like even if you you know i think i think it's understandable people to see the messaging about restaurants having to close or whatever and and honestly a lot of people in the service industry have been lied to by that bosses about this and told that their tips are going to go away so you know i've told people here who are like while
you know everyone out you in the service industry is against this and i understand that but the save about sips campaign is just like is run by some of the worst people the guy running it is this guy nathan sprawl who
works at this link and strategy grew they work for the trunk campaign
they also ran a nonprofit that is my this guy is one of my past enemy is because when i was at the sunlight foundation i wrote about this organization called protect america's consumers which was like running fake ads against the c f p b and they were all very
very nice shiny and glitzy and meant to be
moderate looking but it was clearly fucking funded by the payday loan industry or some nefarious group because it was it was completely dark money and this guy was one of the guys running at so defeat the awful bastard nathan sprout on tuesday also all these fucking celebrity for chefs who are fucking fretting about when it's going to do their fucking business
fucking selling fifty dollar vaporized pig decks under
and they're going to fuck it was i i don't i don't think i could afford to pay my staff a living wage hey hello has and s yeah but no more foam issues get that the shit outta here server real meal with this no more appetizers that's just a single date served on a plate with this will of
oil around it as it's not food do some work yeah and also how about some real fucking coffee okay coffee flavored coffee
and lot of smoke in restaurants again hell yeah i smoke everywhere and me shoot up
my version of this is when they bring you bread and olive oil like a call i want to give me
salty but i don't want that grows will taste like your vegetables us like you have many me but version of business sit up with olive oil with a little of that the vinegar the to degrade port in a sometimes you don't even get that sometimes you get a gross glob of oil
best thing i want i want some nice warm butter when not unlike melted butter but you can easily spread on the bread and a half from the fridge yeah and then i want and they don't want like a little a little tiny little ball of lakes and nice like malden sea salt to just sort of sprinkle over the top my bread and butter
this is a real treat bullshit here
and will would also like the the waiter to be very nice to him
birthday
fucking birthday
to close out this week i have a reading series
absolutely touches on a lot of what we talked about in the first part of the show weird you know
what it's like to live like in a country
it's actually evolved and doing things that like you read about and a history book you would ask yourself how the fuck did like the majority of people just acquiesce to this and let it happen without doing anything to stop it
and moreover what is the media is responsibility and any of this or one of their strategies for dealing with it well one of their strategies is again trying to better understand the people who all think that this is really good and that kids should be put in cages and i have a reading series that comes courtesy of
the new york post's selena zito now if you're not familiar with saline as he though she is a just
fucking one of those had fish at the bottom of the ocean that consume the corpses of wales that drift to the bottom she's like one of those except for the the the trump make america great movement
essentially what she does issue she offers her services to the media and in a book she's just published as a kind of white working class whisperer
to where she always finds people in the heartland of america who are you know overlooked by the democratic party or abandoned by them which you know on one level isn't wrong with these the people she finds it always seemed to utter know be actual employees of luck
or republican parties or see exactly the things that a republican pundit would want them to or are fucking bosses aren't aren't actually working class
small business tyrants and
so this is a selena zito writing in the new york post
this is an opinion piece called these harvard kids got a lesson of their life in the heartland
on a blustery afternoon in april i filed into of in one with ten students from harvard we had just spent the last few days and chicken p massachusetts where we had chatted with the police chief in his force the mayor and his staff small business owners waitresses and firemen about the struggles living in small got their struggles living and
small town america
the under grads were buzzing with their impressions so i said who do you think most people use got to know voted for president none of the students had an answer it hadn't come up in their conversations and they didn't know i had privately ask each person who they voted for so i let a minute and pass and told them nearly every one of them voted for trump
students look stoned at first but then or recognition cross their faces okay
that's the beginning year and my first impression here is
what this piece is doing is actually instead of exploding my prejudice stereotype views it's absolutely reinforcing them that harvard university is a cancer on our society and that everyone a ten tens there and works for it is an even bigger rube than these fucking truck voters that they're reaching
out to for the idea that they would allow someone like selena zito to create this propaganda tour and goal some of their more credulous students into it's ending is absurd to the well what it does is it really shows one of the real cultural benefit for the elite
this post two thousand and sixteen election exotic station exotic cessation whatever a fuck it shut up don't tell me how to pronounce i don't know but exam sizing trump supporters and turning them into this other species
you could say it's condescending or whatever
or but what really is it's giving people who basically are too scared and worried and and cut off from people on in other socio economic areas and certainly and other races
immigrants or black community is or crew poverty in america that's too scary that's a that's a bridge too far for for being a adventurous seeker of other experiences but some a guy who like i said owns a boat dealership but voted for trump you get to treat him as much of an exotic
species as as like a tie immigrant or something like that and you get to then have an interaction that you're more comfortable with because the person shares your basic socio political and racial background
but get to feel like you're a fucking margaret mead or something because actually going outside of your bubble of of whiteness and privileges to too scared yeah it's like it's the guy who owns one hundred and fifty thousand our pick up truck but it's a pickup truck and he listens to like top forty country radio that's working class and you get if they mean by that and you get to feel like wow
oh i'm learning something about other people like know you're not these people are just slightly different versions of you just grew up watching different television shows
all part and parcel of this this scolding this kind of hectoring from people who are bog standard conservative republicans who essentially support every one of the policies of donald trump but nonetheless find him personally this is for our
again there is now my cottage industry of these people to come along and tell you the people who are has a fucking conscience and opposes everything that they stand for that actually it's your opposition to the president and his supporters are you're being mean to them is the reason that they vote for him as if there is someone out there who's just voting for pres
an interim because it makes liberals mad that isn't living in a fucking bubble of their own creation yes
is it like carla comes from the fact that champs election just surprised so many people in the media he could never seen it coming and i think they're a little embarrassed about that and i'm not trying to make up for it but every time one of the story is a show that they still don't get how this happened like how trump on it didn't matter how many
these people that you including into yeah right like when you're interviewing the guy with one hundred thousand dollar pick up truck
a pickup truck and you are displaying your complete lack of understanding of the systems of power in america and this stuff works because as i've mentioned before work some liberals because liberals really love believing that they're better or different than the people that a oppose that like oh i would never i would never unfairly judge someone
or because of their politics or i'm open minded enough to reach out and it's like oh you're doing like tom sawyer fence painting trick
politics and what these people are trying to do with the ceiling he does the world are trying to do to these these bright eyed college students is convinced them that
your political opposition to trump is why trump is president and if you don't want to eat president you should meet us halfway and exceptionally accept all of the conservative policies that we would prefer the country be run on earth and if you oppose that just don't say it too loud
or question the motivations of anyone like for instance thinks that children need to be put in jail
so it goes on here and it says we were only a few days into a new course i did i had developed with harvard's institute of politics again harvard's institute of politics if there's anyone who goes to harvard or is part of that program drop out now if like seriously what you're doing is worthless i don't know how you look at yourself in the mirror
they're literally being conned by this absolute frog
it says here it's called the main street project where students are immersed in small town america even though these kids it almost all been raised in the united states or journey sometimes felt like an anthropology course as though they were seen the rest of the country for the first time in that was their opening lesson i had been a national political
journalists for nearly fifteen years
by the way whenever and wherever i travel in this country i abide by a few simple rules no planes no interstates and no hotels and definitely no chain restaurants the reason is simple planes fly over an interstate swiftly pass by what's really happening
drama the area with if i should do
likes she she only travels he said
the original riedel incredible hulk tv shows you just sort of backpacks through the back roads of america helping people she takes the only true the proletarian form of transportation the hot air balloon so she goes interstate swiftly pass by what's really happening in the suburbs towns in excerpts of this nation state let's go
have and all those areas people are watching television
that's all the fastening fucking not missing some sort of magical community is everybody is sitting at home watching television i'm just really hoping on her travels selena zito on the back roads away from the highways and byways of america she will encounter a working class family either the one
from the texas chainsaw massacre or the hills have eyes yeah the sawyer family has a lot to tell you about the industrialization the broken promises to american workers so she says staying in a hotel doesn't give me the same connection i can get staying in a bed and breakfasts were the first person i meet is a small business person who runs the place
and those all the neighborhood secrets the same is true of going to locally owned restaurants versus chains
anything about this is if you wrote this article from the opposite side like as a liberal us that i don't got a chain right oh i don't eat i would never dream of going to the local apple be i need to find the local like farm to table restaurant and stay at a little bed and breakfast or the old woman who wants to talk your ear off about our entire family and
makes you go to bed at nine o'clock every
every like think i'll fucking stuck up that is what she's talking about like this small town american culture is fucking yeah the restaurant and what people in the mall and the fucking highway and that bland mono culture that permeates all over there
that is what is there it's it's only fucking snooty cosmopolitan types who go out seeking authentic experience elsewhere
surely this is good enough for the rest of if you want authentic authentic small experience you have to go to a fucking city to get that i'm sorry yeah no it's goto buffalo wild wings during a game if you want to see the closest thing these places have been to like a community and i do like she says the first but yeah talking to is a small biz
minnesota which once again just shows her actual interest and who she wants to get her pearls of of simple wisdom from which are the fucking mini mussolini's of america's vast middle not the actual workers so she could by the way most fucking fast food chain restaurants are owned by local people for called the fucking franchise so she goes also
you have to spend your time in a community to really report on it parachuting in for a few hours to interview the locals can lead to float evaluations that's exactly what she's doing with this operation mainstream bullshit she's parachuting in these gullible fucking politics students at harvard and giving them a tour of pre selected small business owners
tell them hey i'm not racist i just think all immigrants should be kicked out of the country and donald trump is a great leader because he kept my taxes and regulations which allow for small community to exist in america
he goes when you are short on time your instincts can get blurred and you gravitate towards the shiny objects the oddball people and conditions that make the most noise consider taking a broader focus on the bigger fuller picture those simple rules or what intrigues students at the harvard instance you to politics again any of these
students just baby brains
absolute baby brain if you were intrigued by any of this nonsense
i am god it's obviously like the student the the young person urge to sort of immerse yourself in a foreign land a strange culture that's very condescending and it's a classic cliche of sort of obnoxious clueless but it seems that it's somehow even worse to try to fit go in
like a jerk off fucking observed in america and talked to a bunch of fucking white middle class people and act like you've actually done that that seems somehow even worse than than doing the real you take your semester abroad in fucking france or spain or italy or something don't go to get the worse suburbs of america
to talk to you literally the worst people are nation can produce some sort of an accolade areas act like you're you're doing something brave you're actually doing something incredibly fucking cowardly because you are too afraid to cross and kind of cultural or economic gap bigger than that bigger than
voting preference literally and zip code it is so beautiful and funny to me to imagine like a bunch of harvard students being shipped and to think like the south and tasting sweet tea and day i wasn't earth is this or like asking a guy about his curly fries or whatever like what exactly are you eating here you know what what
you people eat like it's a very funny image am not afraid to say i'm not afraid to judge other cultures sweetie to fucking sweet
it's disgusting
way too much fucking sugar it's ridiculous shit together as have a doctor pepper is way better
so it says days after my speech to i o p directors said the students wanted to learn more from me i told them the best course would be a total immersion in the less populated parts of the country no different from the way i approach my daily job
your your daily griffith on behalf of the koch brothers who ever underwrites this bullshit chris clang a twenty year old sophomore from winchester massachusetts and sam kessler a junior from blue bell pennsylvania led the charge recruiting eighteen other students for the class which began in february because kwang his chair of the harvard union the nation's oldest collegiate
debating society out there goes the debate team kid it's all falling into place and kessler as president of the harvard political review they were both hungry to learn what shapes people's voting habits particularly the two thousand and sixteen election when donald trump beat hillary clinton in an upset almost no one predicted the best way to blow apart a stereotype is the challenge it
along and applied math and economics major told me so before we started traveling we had several workshops to the discuss their ideas about the other america
it's not the other america is the most mainstream part of american is the most ask kissed it's the most largely economically bless the from what she's talking about the people she's talking about are the people who even in areas that are economically
stressed are the ones who have sort of generational and residual well yeah i know they they actually go to a factory in youngstown ohio or the guy says yeah this communities
been hard hit recently but i just feel really proud of the business i oh god
two weeks later in londonderry new hampshire the students visited a gun range it fish and game club and saw something else they didn't expect forty women of all ages shapes and colors pointing pistols at a target
i'm going to guess here in london very new hampshire there wasn't actually a lot of ethnic diversity at the gun ray and you shut everybody from from irish people to french canadians
even a stray crow at susan also and a silver haired and structure and made her way over to the students with the broad smile and swagger for women knowing how to operate a gun she told them is the most empowering thing we can do again who are these fucking college aged students who were surprised to find out that women there are women gun culture in america
two or that like that going to a gun range would seem like who is so exciting and different i mean these are people who are brought up in fucking koreans i mean that they spent their entire life like incubator to go to these fucking ivy league schools though who the hell knows what they actually think about the world around them
oh here it is in may the students found more insights in the moaning valley of ohio where they broke reddit the iconic in the restaurant with joke sees the third member of his family to own the either
because his enthusiasm can students wrapped his he told them how he developed and grew a business in the downtown area him as a third generation good inherited
inside my mom's room which really helped me with no job of taking over for my dad i could have gone anywhere and i did said disease who worked for several teams in the nfl is and equipment manager but in the end i wanted to come home to this he added as he made a three hundred and sixty sweep of his restaurant this is the greatest city in america the people the heart i love my
community are fat check five pants on fire youngstown is not even in the top one hundred greatest cities in america
amid the air of just going on here later they dined at the fame trumbull country club where the robber barons as yes he is fuzzy on where the robber barons of yesteryear once made their deals today a new generation of leaders is helping to the club
it's footing and a post industrial age
we weren't bring back the gilded age that's that's a real of
my great grandpa used a hug peasants from the bag of a horse the students course is coming to an end and while no one got college credit or and degrade thank god they had all past the most important test they had taken a walk down main street and made a lot more friends than judgments they had learned that in order to understand the country's politics you first have to understand its people
that means getting out of your bubble and spending time away from people like you if you don't kong said you lose the ability to spark the evolution needed to bridge this country's divide again this comes back to something that i just fucking it's like a canker sore that just won't go away and i can't stop pressing my tongue against the what we need to do policy
is feeding the other side not bridging a divide with them now the people who support trump and like him need to be defeated politically don't need to be coddled and cater to people who disagree them don't need to be told that you really need to come to them
and agree with them before you can get what you know it's it's the fundamental delusion of sort of the folk understanding of politics that it's the power of coming together that it's about it's about people putting their differences aside because politics is literally differences so you putting them aside is
that's defeating the point of politics the point is to resolve the differences and you resolve the differences when they are attached to economic economic interests
with fucking numbers by overs steam rolling them that that's it
i just think i'm i don't like the idea of kong and others other future political leaders being inculcated with the idea that they need to understand and come together with small business tyrants the up america's rancid said reactionary middle middle class instead of working to defeat them entirely but they don't want to see
create their well the thing is they don't want the freedom they go to fucking harvard holy father
the people who sell the idea that politics is about bridging gaps in resolving conflict they all have an interest in that because they don't want people to look at politics as a conflict of interests because then people will realize that all they're all basically on the same side they all these fucking these lapping spelunker anthropologists
harvard students have essentially very similar
interests as the people who they're exotic we exploring in america smaller towns but i just like this idea that just going to some american suburb is is getting out of the bubble that is the fucking bubble yes like hasn't been here my whole life if i go to londonderry new hampshire i wouldn't feel our
place for even a second because i guess what i'm white and upper middle class i could go anywhere in this fucking country oh
might not feel comfortable or the poor actual poor neighborhoods in american cities that are these people actually would feel uncomfortable exactly and why do that when you can go and listen to some psychopath talk about how he's you know uses a bebe gun to motivate his workforce
in his
prime rib shop
giuseppe and here it says the students even came up with a better name for the main street project they call it hash tag eye opening
lending their eye opening experiences with the acronym for their institute again
an eye opening experience visiting a fucking and breakfast in youngstown ohio oh yeah i remember that politics is shown spice it was hired and the were actually have kids you want to like his fucking practice sessions or whatever so he got to remember that these people are challenged
hutch closes out here in our final week the class attended mass it state stanislaw us a polish notch my masters with that mass math was that it's a polish church in the strip district of downtown pittsburgh before then only two of my students had stepped foot in a catholic church oh my god imagine
stepping foot in a catholic church measured how weird and alien that would if you if you grew up in fucking american in twenty first century america so it goes at the end of may here's something that absolutely definitely happened by the way at the end of mass an older gentleman came up to me and said how nice it was to see young people dressed up and going to church
yeah he's saying that because no one under the age of sixty has a ten catholic church anymore
yeah it is nice for him get to know that the religion is a member of isn't dying in the first world goes when i told him they were students from harvard he beamed i've been reading for years that college kids these days are thin skinned what's that word snowbirds snowflakes anyway that they have no easy nurse with meeting some
one new are trying something different or won't be open to opposing opinions he said he smiles as he gave my kids in approving thumbs up don't you just love it when a stereotype is blown up right in front of you fucking that confirms every stereotype by already have this article did by the way in closing hear this idea that it's college
kids who have a problem with things that are new more things change in india earth are things that are different from what they're used to this is way to impulse in america in general like this rhetorical idea that you can decide what america is and what he has a monopoly and what america is
the same principle that leads people to say this isn't us when isis deporting people or what
obviously the answer is it clearly fucking is that is exactly what we've done hundreds of years
we had impulse especially liberal and centrist say know wants to say like oh this is what america is it's small towns and small business owners people die in a chair it's just like now i mean show and it's also i hope and denny's and a huge economic always way
yeah sorry i always
with chain restaurant chain restaurant and it's also people who don't businesses
people who washed dishes and everything it's a lot of these things so it's just weird rhetorical on her part to define and by picking these examples what america is because there is other people that she fucking talk to i mean it's just gives a shit like who is listening to this post i mean not to be parochial from my own background and biases be you know it's also america all of our again
fucking the cities where most of the people live where most of the funding
people live seriously
so yeah like yeah the new and different experiences are way more likely to find that in a major metropolitan area than in small town america
but again the idea that visiting american suburbs represents some kind of earth shattering
uncomfortable experience for any of these harvard kids is fucking laugh and anyone who gives credence to it is a pigeon waiting to be plucked so yeah for the saline as he knows of the world i'm sure it's going be plenty it's going to be boom times for them as they continue
you to work this act with a great effect on for like you said mostly liberals and centrists who are buying it
his they rob them blind with the other hand so think that just about does it for this week libby thank you so much for

the put pathologist who cares
gosh
okay


over the course of
what she's just a lot of issues
show i think we're already touch on the most important all
respect is going to be show bow respects
about us giving you the listener respect and you giving it to us and returned giving respects getting respect and family easily things that make life important
talk about film shows just how you can become a matter of respect a man of honor to run your own family
cas or the gambino crime family will get control over this park his family you need all five girls that listen to the show
if we are talking about our facility
i think i over the road like the movies we talked about ownership i think maybe the most extraordinary movie now that we've done now
incomparable this isn't this is a movie that like were like his insurance a budget and like casting is like like more professionally done then the room but at the end of the day every bit as baffling and perplexing is that movie despite its extensively professional cass
people production habit is to do that stuff but astounding we are talking about the film gotti the bars
starring john travolta as john guard the capo di tutti copy the boss of all bosses before we do that
some help friends of ours
some friends of ours you know a some friends of ours to talk about this thing called respects
it's micro saying thank you and adam friedland
our time out and showed an arrow now is not response
adam i was showing respect for i know how to cast this is how you treat her out
and take off his hat when he can add and slower
during his pocket had
iris back guys get showers and respect all
favre have a way that movie was the biggest piece
you say that we all saw it on friday and honestly i have more fun in the are watching this movie that almost anything i've seen no one reason or were about it out it was a blast deftly ruin that old man's
they're not we enjoy it there's an old man wearing feelers and black dress socks and shorts and attacked and he got mad at us for laughing to work
we were now
i thought in keeps bay which is like a weird enclave for people from queen's speech held in and out of manhattan
and you know how they say like this was the most dollars per movie theater for award
avatar one hurricanes
i don't know gaddy accomplish that i don't think they got that much money per individual theater
per room per screen
but it's probably the most op ed ever written per theater
because everyone in my theater look like the right hand
letters to the editor yeah everyday to the new york daily news about overhearing rap music in astoria although i haven't got our budget trolls behind a keyboard
who are you going to trust people that saw the movie
that is ultimately weren't convinced me i really think we're going to do an episode on this i just wanted to see a movie on friday and this is what convinced me that this movie will be worth seeing was a publicity campaign
leaned into the universally awful review zero percent on rotten tomatoes the fact that this was uniformly panned general i think you know you like the best serve well he's sort of the hero of the movie in a way it's like they should call the got a gene
as my take
with the publicity campaign for that movie taking aim at the the reviewers of the movie and he's raising is a group who's the best and striking a populace town that's very of the time show her say to attack the fake eggheads and the fake news there are telling you not to see this movie
telling you the public that people with respect that you've got to see the movie in order to get respect i will say i think it worked in the sense that i think everyone who voted for donald trump in new york metropolitan area
probably also pro john gotti yes and so you can get all of them to see this movie
you're in
it's going to be going to love it for years to come i honestly think that this is going to be the rocky horror picture show for guys who are medically prohibited from more home
this was an interesting side note about this movie was directed by kevin connelly of entourage from entourage what you eat from ontario is potentially on ecstasy the entire time he was making the movie
like he was something like this is a movie in which is so single or we incompetent in every aspect of its execute said it becomes art area becomes a kind of genius because it's like
i was worried going to this movie that it would just suck and be boring it would just be bad but no this movie was bad in such a shining shimmering way it it was just specific it's like you watch this movie and it's bad in a way we're all the bad things come together to form this mosaic of an end
tire mindset and culture it's just it's perfectly it's literally an educational experience
you know so brilliant about it is that
it perfectly mimics the way that stupid guy who lies all the time tells you a story
yeah like it's pointed characters are introduced but then we don't know anything about them and they don't do anything and then we reference something that they've done so like every time a character comes up john gotti will go oh who's therefore can jerk off and stacy keach we go
that's joey maples and enjoying people's or flash and texts across the screen and then the guy in naples is targeted is going join me balls my every member of the mafia
he won't see him for twenty minutes and it will show up it will remember that thing he did you know it's like a guide is lying to you but he doesn't even remember what he did or didn't lie to you about
i think interesting that is directed by he from entourage because this movie literally is if any of those shitty movies that a pace escobar many chase to do and entourage and it was actually became a movie new would be this or even more on point if you remember from the first season of the sopranos when the first screen
her son restaurant to get on and it shows a screenshot of the laptop there's just this line of dialogue i must be loyal to my cap oh if that screenplay god made it would be this movie exactly and the also if the real christian remote the on a directed and produced her like this is exactly like the world view of the movie
dialogue of it and the execution is exactly what christopher like if christopher a lotta salty were real person they wanted to make his vision of his own life
what it would be i view this
trash this movie i'm gonna of over trump again
yeah my whole family
oh look let's dive it was surfing the beginning of this film
so we get in there we sit down and i swear to god from the very first scene in this movie i news going to be special imagine if you will lights go down
screen comes up what do you see the beautiful night manhattan skyline new york city at night
cut to the east river it's an elderly gentleman wearing a sort of luxurious winter coat
is leaning over the railing looking out a queens and the night sky
he turns around and is john travolta wearing a ridiculous wig and fake eyebrows who breaks the fourth wall turns to the camera in the audience and says new york to greatest city in the night at that point
adam
now we all stood up and class
i salute point they will like
i mistreating i kneel
you nailed as well
as far flung instantly shot fifty seven
seventy five year old moviegoers ozone park
thirty eight there doesn't matter
black dress socks
they should have played the national anthem
however i complained that they didn't
instead of a national
they're amazing opening and then it just jump straight into the opening credits which is a montage of real news footage of the real john gotti it all these various trials lot of archival fun
it's a man's eyes like are upbeat news reel montage of the real john gotti set to music by the rapper pit bull
like probably the corneas most bullshit always neurology oh sod it was the original song for the film any serious with a leona lewis
i've also from avatar
not only did one of the songs behind
maybe i'm wrong
have to play a snippet of the song
cinnamon toast
yes minister
second fastest man
if not the only all song in the movie know well i swear to god with i like the if he had a bull song in the closing credits to that i must have been if it was a result for the movie and that is even more genius because it's one of the classic movie closing song credit sequence with the song tells you what the movies about so pimples wrapping and he's like losing your it's the
bob there's a code got to live by the cold or will kill you
i think my son around
i fear is excellent
more incredible is there is a non dietetic pit bull saw in the eighties while loyal he's just saying that like they play it over all right oh yeah
like know they're listening to it in the eighties
oh yeah we got some people songs twenty years early
fell off the camera
so we get
that credit sequence and again i think the real john gotti would probably be very insulted have any kind of pit bull music associated with sinatra wise to use hip hop because as we all know the blacks are jealous of us they want
copy our culture
so good to be like a cultural appropriation guy will retaliate
i know those are my favorite games on facebook are the ones where it's like students images like any black person and all who's like not in a gang and and it's like gangsters real gentleman who wore like
el al capone murdered like seventy eight hundred people had syphilis
fish swimming clean
that's a man
the school had sex
the rapper type seven
congrats on
so the movie begins and it's of course the narration stays with it because i hated that you know if there was no narration this movie would literally be just a disjointed collection of things happening there would be even more incomprehensible a goes you either end up dead or in jail me i got both
my father
i love that my that was right after he said new york is the greatest city the road i love about that is like i did both
he's funny and cool and say hey hi died in jail
i'm like al capone is still alive
hello hello
gambino dies of old age peacefully because he wasn't a fucking idiot with god it was like yeah but the life came for him finally age nine
find out who did this
it is cancer prick
that self taught cancer sure
alright i'm sorry as a little just started a new thing of ours is called the chai
i'm a big guy by wearing a shirt for cancer charity five k to buy more shirts and say fuck cancer
so a guy he begins begins when the story of of his rise to power our our john gotti became the bar suppose the boss and this story begins when he was a gambino family associate who was tasked by his superior played by stacy keach everyone is
movies like ninety years
yeah a single like young actor
over the guy by john got a huge probably secretly fifty so is is sort of boss figure played by stacy keach tells him
there there's some crime where someone's kid was kidnapped they paid the ransom they still murdered the kid and you know the mafia is like kidnappings one thing but if you pay and they still kill the kid we're not going to abide by that so be saying i want you to have given this you personally this is a personal matter for the gambino family get me the guy who's always going to prison
so he makes his bones and does it will be my honor
laugh
so he makes his bones
killing someone
either way a botched killing they were trying to grab the guy out of a bar and take them off and kill him some more nice and quiet but instead he fought them and he just panic and pulled a gun and shot him in the bar in front of people in the bar who later identify on yeah so like the big crime that's like is coming out to show to fucking awesome criminally was when the he was he
fucked up and immediately was caught for a while when it's three on one with the squad and you knock somebody you kept the third them because one of your squad seals
what of god he's guys were trapped in the storm before they got a bar
john gotti home
i'm moving on
so yeah that of course he goes to jail for that crime again
and then in one sequence he explains that through bribery he was able to get furloughs for dental work yeah that was any leaves the prison
ghosts the dentist's office changes in the dentist's office because without it
into a cool suit and then he's like i had there's a few loose sense from that that hit idea i needed to clean up and we were all like what what i only forty eight
and then it shows him just walking into a motel room with a woman inside it going to the shower and shooting the guy in the shower six times and then leaving not killing the woman again movie does not even to my single it implies that has really helped
yeah she's good work but maybe i actually think of a fan theory about this that have been arguing with on the gotta a wikipedia
that perhaps he didn't hire her and gotta just heard her having sex and was like oh good what you did good and having sex
congrats on this year
then again i just need to underscore like the overall staggering incompetence of every aspect of the like just pacing rain knows that it relates to the following see it it is a collection of sketchy many times have one line or even half of a sentence and then it immediately
cuts to a completely different thought he had an idea is if it wasn't telling the life of one person it would be so baffling and confusing
it's like you just take any ten minutes to the movie the thing you'll see is like john gotti talking to one of these kids and be like if you want to be a man the first the go to learn is how to be strong and the first are your learn about being strong respect but the first thing you gotta learn about respect is being strong
and then cut to like a bunch of fat old guys in a garage and then they have a tense conversation and shoot like a third fat old guy and the head
cut you some fucking social function to john gotti house where was like whoa whoa now they've got these things push pops decide how much ice cream you want
yeah i miss my grandpa
will cut an entire edited video local news report from the nine hundred and eighty i get really
this report
to explain one of them are one of the awesome crimes he does instead of privatizing a way they just show an entire remote report for a local news station
it's called out forever forever and the guys talking like local witness frank polanski says that he saw as i know information that has any me where meaningful to anyone else delivered by an old guy in the eighty i mean i don't know man
course you get that i mean it is so hard to get a license for a local news report from nineteen eighty five on long island you just gotta use it if you got rolling stone songs
i want to get to that crime
there is again completely obscured by an archival news footage but before we get there i want to go to where one of my favorite scenes early in the movie that where it begins to try to sort of sketched out in case you weren't familiar with the mafia john gotti like exactly who he is in what they do because another staggering thing about this movie is the absolute lack of actual
crimes being committed other than bird brain murders which the perpetrators are immediately sent to jail for like a million life sentence that they only kill bad guys right yeah
so it's like a complete fluff piece on john gotti his life he only kill back eyes he never did crimes he talked about running books in ozone
it was early and the shot of the final arc
you are john gotti was john gotti was italian sons of anarchy that's literally every crime he does immediately and dates thirty five people i can only name like two or three profitable operations they had put the community loves him because once a year he throws a party where
well you want to get some hotdogs mariner on it
some disgusting were chicken when mine by friend in the mafia who looks like james call me for some
but they don't in this when they don't show them doing any profitable crime
if you didn't know the mafia was and you watch this movie you'd think the club for all guys to like yell at each other and sometimes get killed
it's like you would have to think that john gotti made money in the way where it's like you kill somebody respect and
everyone he shoots turns to gold
because they don't show them doing anything to and hijackings did they say explicitly we don't do drugs because that this was the greatest martha their propaganda absolute bullshit
but they don't show if they don't the only they talk about gambling but only this guy saying stop telling people to use my about for use start the guy from using my name when he does gambling so that means we know that guy is if it they don't do grinning crimes argument that scene like this is your first impression of what the mafia that about it shows travolta and
or like some will be ludicrous looking people like doing italian face walk out of one of their social olive oil face that's cool yeah i walk out of out of their one of their social clubs in queens
howard be at one hundred fish club and howard dean jfk hogs like you know points in with his pinky out and it's matt was saying he's like this guy i don't like him he's making book he's using my name on the fucking cut it out and like that's basically the only instance you can have like any crime that's not just associated with directly murdering people who they've felt
disrespect
but this was like a murderous cut want to score but right after right after he mentions the guy making book and another little bit of local flavor there's an old one and pushing a grocery modern home and travolta stops his goons and just goes oh oh hope this lady out and it's like well she's pushing a cart doesn't need help carrying it
that they're helping this old lady and they love the community have you learned the guys but his big meaty hands just on her back and just sort of guy so he doesn't actually perfect
but then in the box that yeah that the box with like severe he walks up to this guy looks in no way athletic
he looks like he wakes up and goes to a dunkin donuts reality in our yeah a guy that like literally just sits there
steals napkins
racket
yeah but kid that guy's a good earner
because
bag of port
dogs though that it
they don't make you pay
yeah anyway so this guy comes up to him and he's like he was a matter of finding a mortuary school and like
had to close the gym
i like the equivalent of like had to close the teen rec center
don't worry i'll work it out your door and no no no mention of boxing gym
always good insight into the people who are pro got slash pro trump because it's like anything bad they do is contained in their own world but also you never followed the question of why they have so much money so it's just like in the badger brains of the people who are like pro guardian sledge pro trump in new york their life
oh yes so this guy he just sat down all day and you to have some fucking spaghetti argument with small piece of shit and kill him and it would
sprout a million dollars or him that a million dollars for non specific community acted like john gotti is what every conservative things about obama he's like a fake he is like a community or
oh yeah i'll up the rec center again
shit we spent our entire community budget this year on a barbecue with one grill
the cool thing about this movie
i've been out of were distracting from the planet let's one and john travolta is one of my favorite actors especially john travolta at this stage because he's so desperate to convince the public that he does not spent his entire life trying to jerk off me
that's he is
oh and you like you will deny it he's like in the church of scientology is kid died under mysterious to assets is but he you know enemy and all character have you seen as a paris with what is it called to paris with love or so i saw it with john travolta away it's one of the only movies where he goes full bald he's been
boxes like know any any one he's a rug yeah
he's a rug
that movies and say to but he he is desperate to give the public that he is not just trying to jack off every single guy that
in in his like in his with her via radio the same rank terra nova told me that travolta is not gay and the thing with a gay rumors that you can't deny it
it's know you have to embrace it yeah i guess it also his realize wife is in the movie to kelly plays a victoria does play his wife is also doing olive oil face and maybe one of one of the like you could do a fucking raz is just of the performances in this movie and they'd all be nominated and then you'd have to pick one and my advice or the
funniest thing to happen in like in the last ten years was when he was at the oscars and he was like on clay loser i don't know what it is and introducing the singer a dinner man now and he said everyone knows i love music
everyone please welcome city and let it go from frozen
he take the name edina menzel and he turned into a doubt
he's like full year later it he's trying to jack off everyone around here
allegedly he's like a member of an alien cold and he just wants the ball with he is danny's coast
we have a real met a thing in like fifty years from now when the guy from the entourage
entourage reboot makes the travolta movie and it's not going to show him doing acting and all he's just famous for no reason and it's like look he stayed in his own community of scientology he got money by jacking off it is just a cool guy
we're talking about what's so funny
to contrast sure this performance as god he with his performance as robert shapiro and american crime story was it oh i thought it was brilliant
oh my god yeah oh funny and on point but what he was so funny as they look identical they're wearing the same don't wake up big bushy eyebrows and italian suits but it is so funny the difference between him playing a character like the with the writers are in on the job shapiro
oh is a laughable figure i and the ones and gotti with a writers obviously are not all know
tell your so called realize that he and bringing in trying to describe the plot this movie is probably falls across because it's impossible there really is no plot things just happen at this weird clip nothing is no one scene is related to a scene that comes prior to it and things happen with with no regard or no effect on the plot later the
only or actual plot elements are exposition scenes were stacy keach just lists fifteen italian guys in a row that you don't know and have no grounds that course i will to do this she going to need tony we are no stevie vesuvius
sancho panza sacco wednesday that's just that is how the plot is a step in it really was no distinction between the periphery characters like it or well there was probably other didn't interval to as god himself there will be two or three other character is that like you could identify as a viewer like as a distant character
one and the stacy keach character everyone other than that just exists in this like weird vague like they all think there's no distinguishing any of them
it's just a bunch of potato keep track so there's that i want to say though
we'll get into each of our favorite scenes in moments in dialogue in the movie but like what early other movie tries to establish is that like you know if when you're in the life and the life really matters in these guys the life is about the code
it's about it's about the code and these like these life and death rules that they follow and that's it makes a man of honor and respect and what keeps their criminal fraternity together
the writers of the movie and filmmakers who we take this shit seriously as the actual movie itself and god is true to life story would be proof positive that no one actually cares about these rules and they break them at will all the time and that was the great thing about sopranos to it's like you see these guys who believe in this stuff their whole life and and they realized
it's like wrong
are aliens basically like they're they're dinosaurs living in the modern world as widespread as was so sopranos
like they did all these little things that indicated you that these guys want like the mellow prisms on this rounds were brilliant because it was like it was a very subtle way of showing that they're completely alien from society
and think there are a lot smarter than actually are but in this movie is john gotti is the coolest fucking guy in every room like when they said it seemed to life and then like order his court fees he's like who lives or it's i could take the thirty dollars
it's like oh this guy's so awesome you have those he has like three or four char moments where it's supposed to be witty and clever and they're all just pig shit stupid and that's the thing about this movie is you think well yeah he probably was not very clever criminals and movies are i was way more clever than real criminals are and that's why this is like the most in its own
a realistic mob movie of all time because it's from the point of view like the actual point of view of people in this mill you as opposed to every other mob movie that is good quote unquote which is why somebody outside of it is critical of it and as like has remove and distance and the judgment other people who would they do not taste the they don't know the and water their there are
and there is makers like this is the thing about these guys they got a coat and i got respect as they take your the community in the family speaking of that correct answer those are literally gibberish that was what is going one of the things that again the the outer boroughs a slash trump supporter if you ask them why they idolize someone like john gotti
all of the things i'll tell you is like hey you know they may do these murders but it's only people who are in the life you know others you know they don't got a cold they don't do maria they don't you violence to people who are just sit civilians or whatever one of the first major plot points in the movie shows are you doing exactly that
again a true thing that happened but one of his kids you say allegedly i don't want to get
what john kerry's kids is allegedly mowed down by a car was just riding his bike
the street and howard beach and some guy hit him with a car kill them
his young son and we know he was later on because again the young son is introduced about a minute before he knows he literally her kidney only the a
even have hair and is
as bad as corny as dick and now he's
murray get over here
many folk and aerobics you almost game quit
that's why he is dead
he goes to the corpse of the kid on the street after getting hit by the car and he he just picks inside of his shorts is a god
you
my boy he didn't even a this item
i don't think he is mind the pupils have to strain
alone case you will think adam is joking that is actually a line
god he got his grief at the death of his child is he didn't even have hair on his
so what is he do to the driver of the scar again wasn't in a life he's abducted and killed but again the movie does not show you this on screen it only refers you to actual news of the event so talk about a whitewash of this guy's like they could have actually dramatize shown the moment of kidnapping and then torturing
some terrified schmuck who was in the wrong place at the wrong time will even with that scene they still kind of glorified it because they were like he didn't even have fix the dent on his car oh yeah
no parking it where you can see is not way to respect the family mostly it's really not even the kill indicate it's respect
like every fucking auto repair shop in the triborough tri state area wasn't owned by someone who knew jack it was it called like did not video al partido pol repair and all like all their buffer pairs were just people who ran people over on purpose
yeah now i didn't like after his kid dies you know he goes to the social club and is it when she's sweaty men out front and i remember saying out loud in the theater respect to a
the whole movie is like it's like italian dragon ball z with assessing respect levels
oh my god
cheaters respect levels are higher than i thought and awesome
it does have the judas airline ha
i'm a nice like a prince and i have a working theory i think kevin connelly got really nervous the night before director this
and then he has he directed all and one like let's be clear and i think he just got some guy from china to do it for him and he just showed him goodfellas one
make a lot more sense if the person that directed this movie did not speak english yes it will to make a lot more
they took like fifteen mob movie scripts and ran through babel fish to in japanese and then put them back in the english yeah and they just assemble them at random the as the first gangster movie ever made by the first build of skynet
it's like they took all the marginal qualities that people like another mob movies like the sort of joke he banter and camaraderie and and goodfellas
the narration and generation
city but none of the thing we're the plot can be followed by anyone at all or you know who any of the characters are
he's fine with were joking around here at time you know but but you guys like have the balls to criticize islam

you know there are a lot of characters are introduced way too late in the koran
i really wish they would have gone into the mafia offering the federal government help after nine
they're appointed how how they were actually good guys i love that one because what was help it's like i saw arab yesterday
what i'm worried because i mean that hearkens back to world war two with the bigger midday to enlist the help of lucky luciano a highly own
the sensible what they said they were doing was there hey we know the mob controls the ports in new york dogs dogs or whatever we're going to make sure that no nazis sneak in and you know we need lucky to do that but really what they were doing was making sure that unions would organize on those same dogs that's true by the unions were started by nazis my name is steve nash
yet national socialists
organized labor organizer death camps
i'm thinking back to the line about it didn't even of hair on his prick i would like if the next scene when they're all gathered officials so club and like everyone's paying their respects and like some guys in the and neighborhood kids come up and like mr gotti who your kid didn't have no hair and is prick like to give you some ah
give a big bag
petition from an old
called tribute awesome

you're getting abuse to mr
here's another amazing amazing thing from this movie
we should be about like i said earlier the movie like that guy over there that's angela ruggiero like the screen will pause to show you enjoy riviera who was a rabbi yeah yeah
like the absurd over use of name and location queues at random moments they'll just be like it will cut to a shot of the plaza hotel will tell you new york city
then it will cut to get it will be like new york city
movie doesn't take place in any location other of in new york city so i don't know why they would keep reminding you only have i guess what a prison yeah yeah but again
that that would be obvious when he's in prison and then back of the city where you know the difference between those two locations edges everything is like copy and paste wikipedia oh here's an all the establishing lines with might as well
is another really funny thing about john gotti to character and like as he's portrayed in the screenplay
one of the things he says repeatedly throughout the movie like when he first sees the same me the ball character he goes i don't like tech i i will trust him he's never been to jail and he says it multiple times the movie i don't trust anyone has never been to prison and he has affirmed when sammy the flip side of the i knew it wouldn't want to go he didn't go to jail but he does cross
sammy the ball he put sammy the ball and the most important
sensitive position he could give it i mean i guess he like me where he makes a prediction an axe otherwise you just can't be wrong except i don't go to i don't go to prison when i call elections and like he hopes he votes wrong yeah you're more of a autonomy patera i think tommy karate somehow banana family yeah you're like a wildcard
yeah that's what people say when they see me game it's like sometimes i die seven times in a row sometimes i just drop twenty bomb
and like okay so this movie does cover a bit of real history and if you didn't know about any of this it would be early incomprehensible but even if you know the slightest it's more incomprehensible because there are these big things that happened like they show the assassination of paul castellano in front of the sparks steakhouse in midtown manhattan which is
a big thing
the moment or god takes over the gambino family the five boroughs
yeah
because back to his mentor explaining to him you know what he needs to take in one of the best lines of dialogue with the movie he goes john i don't gotta tell you but new york your new york new york is all the gambino family that's who we are if you're going to do this you can you support of all five boroughs new york
brooklyn bronx queens staten island
just listing the five brother pauses to give me that are all only before all the were fifty seven boroughs they are born out in queens brooklyn
but cast is in a character in this movie at all know he's barely shows and also when he gets killed you don't feel anything because there's never been even one moment of tension between him ah the only one having that path for a plot was him getting an impressively annoyed with cast llano and and getting the guys together with kill him and they'd never meet they never ever
conversation they never shown any kind of disagreement it's just sort of like that guy is now like go real guy he's now he isn't run not a real gangster i don't i don't trust them
because i feel like chap a trap as is kind of like john gotti and paul castellano his part save american
you hear that positive america we love going to prison
yeah it's like i've seen a bunch of god a need for tv movies because i had a lot of time alone when i was another one of our minds
it add premium cable but in all of them is the same thing words like because it's like a jewish screenwriter who wishes he was in the mob because it would mean you'd have more friends and night romanticize it is like it's the same thing is like the suburban rap fan with the drake is a policy
it's like oh yeah he was a businessman cast are you fucking put you fucking pitch and so it's always sort of sympathetic to god he just blow his brains out i was expecting something like that but it's like it was like what was that one mystery science theater with mitchell yeah where they're like
garza busy brazilian gaza they're just name these two italian guys you never see and they just don't really figured that the plaudits that they are the crucial plot point like a in the arm and a day got a movie there's a scene where the disgusting naked castellano emerges from the pony is fat body jiggle about
i guess the implication viewers a john gotti would never do that he would wear like a victorian baiting costume
he had girl is fat resigned ever way short but with this it's just like look at his house piece of shit thinks he's cool because he has columns on and says well guess what he's going to die
the benefit may
another another great piece of new york city mob lore is vincent the change you can say and his
that's going on
his feigned mental illness to avoid prosecution is walk around in a dirty bath robe
you got it today
just put a career cashed out i mean his bio
i couldn't be the boss he's doing another tweed storm
again something that could have been done in a way that made him a interesting character or adversary nothing there's a few recycled shots of him to in the bathroom overcame showing about the streets and then you get one other seen with him when it's implied that like he blew up the car bomb some guys allegation that didn't get guy
that we saw two seasons of and for ten minutes after that i can't believe they killed frankie air seven characters
britain ranges like frank including john gotti son i thought it was funny because one of the scenes he's wearing a suit so i was just imagining he'd get home from walk around manhattan in pajamas and then he'd change into her valentino's it just hang out in his apartment in a suit
murray talk about the marketing campaign of this movie
oh yeah so the twin it
check out the twitter
page for god no
so the twitter
page
it has embodied this like a mafia like a tough guy italian guys running their twitter page and when they get criticized by like film geek says after be like hey
we just we just put ten times and film critic off
you don't like i'm always angry
there's there's just one critic who very happily so this this movie is the first film has been distributed by movie pass right
the past i have it but it's going to go out of business unless it's
his business idea simultaneously
but so they decided okay we're going to distribute films every we're going to have a second revenue stream that way
as opposed to us just losing money in that by people by paying for i mean i think i sound like fifteen movies
for ten dollars which is less than even one movie arrogant
anyway so everyone who has movie past gotta push notifications like sometime around last week which is as which just said gotti the critics hated the audience is love it like how about you see for yourself right
then if you go on rotten tomatoes which it is currently at zero percent it is like a ninety nine percent audience score and the reason is because there are a ton like thousands of people who saw this movie and then decided they were so passionate about this movie is either
they were going to create a profile on rotten tomatoes and then give it a five star reviews that lead people to believe that okay they're like they are fixing the audience score on rotten tomatoes
and to the extent that i think the incredible came out the same week as it and it got slightly i think it maybe like got billion dollar like a brazilian dollars got only slightly fewer audience scores on rotten tomatoes so basically this whole marketing campaign was that they made a bunch
fake profiles on rotten tomatoes and everyone gave a five star reviews and they marketed in the vein of the whole trump you care trust the media you can trust it's all fake news and that's like sort of the way they've got about it it has been a failure i think they made a million dollars like opening weekend three years
saying there's an italian american troll farm
i don't know
i have become like the eric garlic against italians are on hand our democracy with your greasy hand guys in a bunker on the internet twenty four hours a day drinking straight from provo bottle
well i'll be like this gets into like what is also interesting about this movie as a stand in for the times is that like this is like like the donald trump guess not
every reason to stand in for donald trump of like the way he's portrayed in the like more confusion and degeneracy of the film itself in reddit portrays this obviously evil man is some sort of hero or person where the of admiration or because the only way they can evaluate actions is
a series of like three or four fucking bumper stickers that they've have memorized about like he knows about family and a date to the community the same way they are for trump and it's like he's a businessman or whatever like the hell we have like these very small concepts that that they have applied this movie is for people that have a tattoo on their body that
his family but only talk to their uncle because they think will inherit zippo that they believed to be solid gold
this gets we've mentioned before this movie's over use of stock footage of of real news casts and maybe my favor
testimonials is the real testimonials that are we all local news footage and believe you do this i want everyone to go around this room and name and italian american you respect

oh no
it sounded
have no but this is a real news footage for when god he died in two thousand and two and this is real news footage from howard beach and they're talking to these are real teenagers and people from the neighborhood all lining up to say i don't care what anyone says god he's a good guy
he kept the street safe he had class he's now he's bad criminals nowadays and i actually saw speaking of the twitter campaign i saw someone on twitter reply to the guardian was handle was deplorable mega us a number one say god he was a good guy when he was around queens
clean and safe not like it is now which is ludicrous because the crime rate in queens in the eighties is probably ten thousand scientists higher than it is maybe one of the save the world right now yeah that's insane
so significant i saw another deplorable account wide someone saying if god he was around there more followers than any of these hollywood
up
praise god he would beat ninja on twitch i think they think of him the same way they think of job because the thing is they also they all these guys go and he was a pause it was a great pause he was an objectively shitty criminal he sucked at crime even if your have in an hour to jail or the time and then fuck him did he
even within the code of the mafia by killing his boss he committed a violation of the code but he has a pussy and then almost immediately he goes starts going i mean yeah i took him awhile to convict him but he was basically on trial for like the entire time he was boss and then he went to prison for life a died there is a shitty fuck am i mean i have added an isis
he was on tv how the time it's the same way they think drop is a great businessman even though his entire career is just a bunch of money laundering schemes and and sees he was on tv all the time so of course he was a good businessman speaking to his leadership also like have all the guys in his career turned out to be rats
he has all of them were informed guys like i you know i keep people course like everyone you just you have the door literally lapping open met
like john gotti throughout the movie he makes a bunch of a weird moral points about how it's going to be the government including refusing comfort medication when he died
which is like yeah just imagine a federal prosecutor going like you can take out of event so own
the i mean he actually did get over and ago and because every single person he talked to everybody was wired and can you imagine the asinine bullshit always they probably got some version of he seem to finish the conversations
say you know i think you know that pussy about nineteen thirty five before
look now but it would be and are you on that races will have been way better though because they didn't even have any kind of like attempts by one or two attempts at giving the language any kind of color there were just talking about mob stuff in just these things like you gotta have a sit down with the capital just kind of stuff or saying got me
f u wisdom what does one where stacy keach goes the boss is the post is to pause oh yeah they am right and then they think that's so fucking insightful that later on in the voiceover gallegos you know my my personal use to say the poor says
the in case you didn't catch that absolutely meaningless fucking slogan that that is just literally a pathology
were more time because this is what passes for like wisdom and insight here into this this moving was reality this movie was written on the toilet and frazier
see there's a scene where
gary how the other there's one alpha called fat guy that that age and one beta one in us who by the way i want to point out was played by retailer vince who big hillbilly louisiana and he tries at the beginning to do like a way you don't and
okay but then as soon as the movie whereas on and he has to do scenes where he's yelling he just completely drops it and so is just gone i cannot me and there's no way man
f b i got her what we're talking about oh john they bought arcana carry pages
he because they explain this in the most confusing way possible but he
fox up in some way
because he tries to kill as many yeah and cassock has by who's it fascinating character that we seek to fucking scenes of but they got a wants to kill the beta fat guy and guy like now i'm just put him on a shelf
bob's being in the mob so much lie hard regularly say it was heartbreaking
similar to like it's like old yellow yeah our it's like erin andrews it's
we don't watch her they're like you can't come to our shitty building where we sit down all day anymore
yeah i saw the kill himself like you you can not come to the store that doesn't sell anything
you are fired from mars or easy looks like he looks like all of his children
him because he can't sit on a folding chair and go about the bills
murphy says that like he dies like few months later a cancer the video sharing just said it was cancer but he really tired of appropriate
said however that he literally said air and then the following see it is my fantasy of the movie where it's one line is john travolta looking at his friends tombstone is like a you fucked up sorry about that
okay
yeah if jared like dies in prison trump is going to be emotional day and then he just goes to jared muslim and is like well
who'd have guessed you would be i live by me funny how things work out so true but i think we should sort of circle the drain here circle to the ending and talk about with this movie
because the say half of them of the first half the movie or first three quarters of the movie is about what a cool guy john gotti is the last quarter of it is about how cool his son is and we know that the service was cool because in the movie he's like he's like the hunk from a nineties keen show the hair spiky hair is
low body fat whereas in real life john gotti john gotti idiots on looked like a boombox mario just hideous bowling pin shape man but in this movie he's just like in excellent shape of the way they kept to a guy for a fucking acting ability as a he might have been the worst performing i was given isn't that bad actor was like a nap of i thought there's no
oh this guy's an actor he was so bad
is a contest when he's that's what a fella yeah yeah it's like they'd have scoured him from like the fuck team five friends
he has to porn actor
only would have done a better job absolutely one hundred percent weaker bucks you are to gas pipe for a second oh yeah no yeah then we get our other johnny got his yeah mike because you tell us that away but the real gas pipe and that sixty add brevity interview with him so if i don't think that's awesome
yes might actually was at a gas pipe casa was the underpass of the lucchese family and he was like he tried to kill gary with their palm and then we ever jerry try to kill him but there's an interview on youtube bradley talking a gas pipe and he's asking about these to long island
guys who own like garbage carting business and
the gas pipe killed and he was like these are family men men who are trying to make a living is what do you say to that and get her it's like whoa
i don't know if amazon or not
there's a lot of great moments in an interview
like he made a deal with the government and then the government reneged on it because he was like smuggling cheese jail
they betrayed me and i just think about tories i cry on the but your underscore again this is a guy was dozens of murders or yes on him
murder torture executions
type of sociopath it like for the mob like he was notorious like in their use a terrifying guy and amazing character but again if you only reference and from the movie it's like that sort of like the ratty looking dude who tortured somebody we never see again but once he was pretty cool though it torture and the guy
they can meet with wagner
i mean it's like the guy they got to play him play gas pipe in a movie that was produced by a i for sure
google deep dream
this is this movie was made by the microsoft a i had to be suspended for twitter because it kept post racial dramatically
so you think the movie's ending because the movie has been structured around with these really into a flash backs but the the spine of it are these scenes of of gary when he's with terminal cancer in prison trying to convince his son not to take a plea deal on charges that he had go to trial because you
you know is real footage that nasa is like super interesting because it's guy telling sign like i would never lay down i would never like like putting the life above his own family and as being a complete piece of shit was who he was then they are you arguing in this sounds like cool dead he's like no
good move
and then at the end is i don't he leaves and then they show the kid signing papers and you're like okay i guess he took the deal even though he literally just spent the entire movie be told not to
that's basically it is to best for guys who are too much education and brains could ask you closure but he leaves and then they show him on the gurney and hilarious scene like they're trying to get an eloquent as his and he won't take payments and were like why don't we just put you in a coma
hurts so much and like is rather mower
over in years or fuck you
and then he dies
and you're like okay the movies over and then decides it's going to follow the legal travails of john junior and it's like you like we when he signed a deal i'm assuming that they're now he's out and he's on trial
yeah and then the get sick then he's out again and then he has a scene where he just goes into a garage and yells at some people who you'd have literally no idea who they are and their argument is in cop cheaper it just like he goes in areas like i mean here is my dad told me to be here and they're like yeah well who saying that i'm saying
okay where i guess you make the rules yeah i also make the respect okay
he goes back a trial and want dialogue tree do i tend to get all it is is is the movies to explicitly saying that this kid this poor guy is being railroaded by the feds that they're harassing him and that they won't let him go
the real real she says that says that you're the real gangsters
and then it closes on a fucking
title card that says you know john gotti jr was charged over fifty times with crimes even though it was repeatedly acquitted the government made deals with bad guys little more on the street in exchange for testimony he just wants to be left alone
we originally comes an explicit play to for the government to leave him alone or get off work at a pardon from trap which might happen honestly
what the fuck happened where this movie come from and it's like you're trying to tell me that this is an unjust prosecution but one of the scenes in this film
his of john junior swearing and to become a maid member of the game been what i am left which is never hey
never showed are expressed until his lawyer is making his final play which is like come on lot of golf
the jury's yeah
i like the government like they were in that garage that and we got you did one day of the mafia
her hair prosecute that but yeah
it's like
john gotti later in the movie he's in this sprawling mic mansion like idiotic state and it's serious kids now he's married to the girl that he met the discuss beautiful judiciary of or neglect or impossible
searches huge house and it's implied that it's like unfair that the cops arresting him but it's like okay how did he get that house
he like passes series seven yeah theater yeah it just never explain like our wire when he left the mafia just like or what i am i waited as of the start of this trial let him go it's like it's everywhere you could quit because it's just people who having brunch it's just that planned
that is the point is like the coolest part sopranos is a like do all these crimes and they're like a protection rackets and murderers and like all these things but essentially like what they do it to support is not like having big houses are like fancy cars they do it so they can hang out in a boys club like in a club house with their fellows
they do so they could be in a friend but left for their entire life and that that that is like there's a kind of like they think that they like you know where spit on when they came over and ellis island they had to work and they always talk about how hard they work but essentially they really just hang out with other men
that was like the most clever thing this brand it was what a fucking great clever show but like when tony always bitches about hard he works and it's like the previous seem awfully him eating like him
i could go for another launch this is about you're right that this movie is it shows you what the lure of the mafia is hanging out with the bodies but the problem is the real downfall even among downfall is that it doesn't even look like any fun
like nobody says anything funny they don't do anything they won't even my drink or play cards mostly we don't even see john you is why i never had
nods there is no cigarettes in the whole they don't go to the copa yeah like there's one scene where they'll just like joy leslie sitting in a disco and that's they weren't john he went to the club with meet with neil so he could point out people he didn't like statement later higher at random
i can i get these holes out of the way i want to point out these guys are gonna like oh look another disgusting guy that are going to trust her son
hand on her sight
i love it uses gas his trial that it's also to astra go in the oval office with like don began in is like lose fat guy and like that's literally your secretary treasurer i don't like him i don't trust
i several following
it just doesn't look like fun zero here's a thought though has the power and membership of the mob gone down because of aggressive federal prosecution or because of the availability of gaming and pod casting and the accessibility of male friendships later in life that's true sacrifice
i want to know what i would do i might have to join the mafia
yeah i think about
you guys i think about the other the other fair park as a family in brooklyn
i guess the family come
growing and leisure yeah and comfortable the law
i'm sort of fucking stupid but i'm very confident when i say
i don't really work that are but i'm always complaining at that is through this movies for more than anybody more than any general subset of italians or or trump voters or anything it's a very specific group of young men like kyle smith who liked the idea of the mafia because it's where they could be with her friends all the time
as the people who are like that and that's why there's no crime
that's why there's no actual mob stuff because of what they actually care about they care about being in a room with you from being in a pig dimly poorly lit room by the way because they literally on where we are right now i like yes but as somebody who's watching a movie i would appreciate even lighting keys so that you can see people's faith
says in the middle of the friend every interior seen in this movie has a big black spot in the middle where all the peoples features or clothing become totally indistinct because they just didn't like the space it's negative space i think it's actually has no i to have it currently is a family for america even odds are no
it's amazing he had to post this movie
accidentally doesn't know much to michael mann and robert altman there's a scene where there's a bar fight that has the overlap indistinct dialogue and jittery camera
the movie but obviously totally accidentally and then there's another scene where john engineer walking down a flight of spiral stairs and the camera instead of like following them down with their faces forward while they're talking like is behind their back and following them from behind and you to see the back of their head and it's like a tracking
batman movie once again totally accidental it's amazing it really is like you gave a fucking monkey a goddamn i really think that china
that's a horrible thing to say that an irish director
oh can i tell you it harder irish i'm so entourage gossip yes i saw the any from entourage a coffee shop i my old apartment and he asked them to turn the music
back
hello
on what music playing that's utter respect or lack of respect page three shit right there to see that there is a tweet reason and they went viral it was like a group of white man is called the pod cast and everyone was like yeah but if we didn't have those park is would be shooting each other
i would be exactly like meyer lansky and would be bugsy siegel of course go
your car
oh i not even think about that
always replies you with on twitter when you're just trying to have a good post i don't know your talk
the bug
i think i aspire short legs even figure
and irish bootlegging that shorts yeah i'll be him loud excitable killed in the bathroom most likely that's where i will like we die
actually i will like die in a bathroom
but aren't we would be the worst mob i mean what crime
will could even think what hustles could we possibly put together to me all right
you want barack as it's free
i hope
a forget about the money that is rat terriers how you make it illegal you slander somebody every episode i ass
you know it and age aging a poet nice bike as you pay you pay us for the privilege of putting it out every time someone is polite to us like subscribes to address from their park has worked as respect her just being polite because they made us once i got i think if we did try to become an actual mob mob
crude trying trying to earn like i'm honestly think it would be things like lying to grab her to get the free like or the or the refund
for so
do you think about you take the expensive food out of the boom
yeah august costs to of living
example of a tell you
just got to get a mother only go yeah yeah i'd never showed up at are you talking about i never got it you know this remind me of the episodes prayers were there are hanging out i think it's when a poly gets out from gets out of jail and they're having a party and they're making sylvia silvio to please do it to do it and it's like sylvia just in his normal voice he does it change
boys they're all he goes just when i thought i was out they pulled me back it was like that sounds exactly like godfather oh my god
there are freaking that's like that scene for an hour and forty five minutes is this move yes i beg your absolutely every it's just people doing impressions of other mob movie just like a hundred italian men doing deniro scours yeah and it's just like but it's
with anything like like what is good without any these i mean i guess just like information gaudy is now the movie for everyone who used to look up to deniro because it good for us reason reason the trial allianz disowned him a long time
he had some preferences
sad to have been by the church
he's doing is that italians are england didn't like they were like in the modern context the first to be like you know that
get rid of white people
so i would you say in summation
with god he was actually one of the most extraordinary movies i've ever imagine i would say run don't walk to see gotti you're gonna love it
and if you see a critic
do not hesitate to do the most profitable mob activity like killing them winning witness
they don't worry you get to go to the death it's just as if you want you know sit in a dimly lit room with other badly dressed man arguing over what food to eat incessantly do a movie quotes back and forth to one another and generally being a drain on society you can either join the mafia or starter pack
i also want to say that as someone who is like a fan of the show
like i did come from that kind of like italian fashion upbringing in can't this respect people but one thing i respect about you guys is your lack of respect and how you're not afraid to like go after people you know i don't i'm afraid to do that stuff i will thank you for disrespect respecting are different
i thank you for that unless of course literally any member of the gambino crime
really find this episode listens to it i retroactively take the and route only thing i said work i just a little more than argue about cold cuts adams addresses
when he told us to do this we're scared of them i just say publicly that one person that i had this respect
is mr dodd jessica up
and i think that we straight a little bit from politics on this august
it's important that we remember that we have to disrespect him by calling him orange in being rude to him and cheese diddley dude lead
like a sort of ned flanders kind of insult surges just keep resisting
you know the maybe the guardian people fucked up by making this the trump movie maybe it was like resistance will be gaudy doing a deal with tromp and god it's like whoa i'm bad but can you imagine if this guy was president
i thought i was a group that's a good
make the resistance mafia cut she i have a million billion dollar
yeah just last word for me i give this film ten other thing gobble ghouls
eleven and a half per shoots golf
my file or of you honestly like lars von der of those other stupid europeans made a move it is confusing people would say it's genius so give it ten
so yeah again in closing i would like to thank our true friends are few friends of ours from the adam friedland you are you fucking come town baby might racine of the sit down a great park as you want to learn more about crimes and the people who do them felix you are just a guess that you actually talks
about john got the entire got a episode is very good i think you should do it because we didn't die there's much in the actual life of guardian this but with you on that but everyone check out the yeah i want to sit down and dive more into the history of a crime in this country and elsewhere check out the sit down with mike receive
because
wow

said
sentiment
the mob thought it made nothing
the case
the

she
chapel this week said to report
sick and she was don't fret you still got a full house that's ringers that we're bringing in to replace starting with t our friend a rookie roles host of champagne sharks t v what's going on
everybody doing
full name now is preferable you it's all good
trevor dogs to you heard of docks
joining in joining now on a sweltering day in brooklyn one hundred degrees that new york city so we're feeling is here to stay but also
for into the show catherine krieger
nothing
again catherine krieger of splinter in an active blatant cronyism on my heart so guys it's been a week now since the local elections
since the special enough the special elections is the democratic primary we talked about on our last show alexandria kazuo cortez and her stunning upset victory and at the end of our most recent show i said
you are going to see in the coming days and weeks a reaction to the casio cortez his victory that is going to try to get you to doubt yourself or to believe that it's not important and more importantly than anything to try to get you to believe that the democratic party should absolutely not
even for a second think that this could work or that there's a future in it
so i'd like to go through now a week's worth of takes and analyze them with my co host and our guest hosts let's begin with
in yellow green home in business insider headline democrats need to choose are they the party of alexandria of casio cortez or the party of michael bloomberg don't make me choose it's a tough choice
sophie's choice yeah democratic are in a way out
compromise can't we have universal health care and band soda
the two choices
not a democrat and someone who is about universal healthcare but the stop and frisk every patient
many common
daniela greenbaum by the way i looked into her she is basically like the off brand barry ways but she went to that are ram she went to barnard and political and went to the wall street journal and was also had of barnard's like young college scientists the organization that's not even like a go back to a transformers that's like come
some like thai thing called transforming machine
so
daniel our rights
the republican party had a big tent
then in two thousand and sixteen it's fringe elements elected donald trump leaving moderates and politically home were weird how talented election the fringe somehow one that's kind of odd that would seem like by definition the fringe would be the minority fringe elements of the republican weird who again
an overwhelmingly voted for now approve of the donald trump is doing as president elected president leaving moderates politically homeless and democrats
and democrats both politically and emotionally disturbed there's too much going on their weights of the republican party was the party of the fringe and the moderates and the democrats with the party of the fringe doesn't say it's just says that they're in disarray but it just says just
the can party had a big tent right about an ad
the moderates all ten of them who know who i'm voting for hillary clinton yeah who are now what holding us hostage
til the democrats get serious about deficit reduction there are you going to they're going to write out there their support yeah they're going to write in george h o you push your colon power whatever stupid thing old people do they had a big tent but then unfortunately the ted became small and they just wonder presidential election related yeah ok
like the center been got pulled out and it fell on everyone and they were all around the classic circus yeah
so she says here
the news this week highway two very different kind of democrats earlier in the week kinda familiar rumors and rumblings that former new york city mayor michael bloomberg amateur know them
former new york city mayor michael bloomberg was an independent his entire republican yeah yeah yeah well he was literally never gonna grant is planning to run for president in two thousand and twenty the he be calm a democrat at some point she says your bloomberg is a political independent at the moment but reports have suggested he would run this time as it ever economic so
he's what do you guys what do we gotta do to get the job with the race speak at the dance
gonna be all smoke and loved it was a primetime speaker for hillary yeah
we've heard because he smelled up on a on a snack or phone
with women men who are not going out to never for new york city mayor now
always ran as an independent and a republican or a couple of young was just wasn't holding them a burning that being a real democrat
no doubt that that's totally unrelated well now michael bloomberg is now a democrat by like the transit of properties of a theoretical future state in which he might run as a democrat yeah i'm bloomberg is also about a or a bunch of money into the mid term's right if you see those your court republicans like peter king of
every cycle early on there some story about some rich asshole who is going to spend a billion dollars on one party or the other parents go hundred and one ever check the receipts on i i i'm going to spend five billion dollars to elect a libertarian those iron in your first virgil spending five billion dollars the hope
the natural law party is coming back the koch brothers do legitimately de lay down huge amounts of money and sheldon adelson to they actually do spend a ton of money on the problem to me as if you do have the receipts there's no cause a different problem isn't why i just one person or to brooklyn people donating billions and once the quid pro quo
now they just they love america they want to see well here's the thing i think what happens is they start off really early on and say we're going to spend all this money but then it comes with the and strings attached and then when a candidate gets dominate that their likes to donald trump they say oh not we're not spending that money and more well he didn't need any money though matter self made neither with michael bloomberg
the beloved had tea and yellow rights we've heard this before but the question of whether the seventy six year old will actually run this time around is far less important than the question of what democrats would do if he or someone like him does the answer to that question of course is that there are there is no the democrats right now there is the parties left for
orange and then it's more centrist counterpart on tuesday twenty eight year old alexandria a casio cortez dethroned representative joseph crowley a power powerful democrat who had been a ten term incumbent across sea of cortez self describes as a democratic socialists and espouses many views that differentiate her from other members of the democratic party
some of those differing views are plainly contrary to those traditionally held by democrats others are simply more extreme fringe variations on the usual themes
she advocates for gun control in criminal justice reform but she's also called for medicare for all at a federal jobs guarantee without advocating a concrete way of paying extreme measure and and where it her to pay for its her solutions and only source of axes check this out she goes with out a concrete way of paying for these
three managers her next sentence her solution to these sorts of issues tax wall street
that would seem to be answering the question and outside that anything concrete about how to pay for any such a stance on a black harry potter
important democratic
that's closer to where you stand on the once her plant tax the rich and than ten minutes of sputtering
there's no concrete that kind of rich oppressor vs poor oppressed framework might work on your on more exciting congressional district yes but it is sure to fail on a national level in states like south carolina alabama arkansas georgia tennessee state region
louisiana and mississippi where hillary clinton significantly outperform bernie sanders in the primaries a more centrist approach like that of bloomberg would still garner much more support i'm not a and kidding me oh problem bravo had to where is the goal to win primaries and lose those states my story
it seems to be that democrats in the south voted for hillary because she was more centrist than bernie and i honestly don't think that there's any evidence there's no leverage for that those electorates are usually ideologically further to the left that i would think bt and
primary voters yeah but they just they tend to like reflect sort of local leadership price rhinos people are were long time connected to the clintons i mean what she's really suggesting is michael bloomberg stop and frisk bear would sweep
the southern democratic primaries that are like eighty ninety percent african american voters yeah
sure there isn't as daniel says there's an added benefit to support a candidacy like bloomberg there would be cross i'll support a national candidate who runs on the same platform on which cause your marquez in new york gubernatorial candidate cynthia nixon are running will not garner meaningful republican support even in the age of trouble but a bloomberg
i could attract all those republicans a former republicans who as a result of trumps ascension have found themselves politically home
i voted for hillary or going to pick up all of though not all of good
for for hillary hillary clinton
then voted for hillary none of them
why would they fought for michael fucking blow up or it's worth noting that michael bloomberg ran three races for bear and in only one of them did he win by more than three four percent he doesn't really have to all his that his hit the last time he ran for mayor he almost law yes you are bill time said as i think it was very very close much else
that got it okay i wanted to us all the democrats can do is run candidates that are further and further right in hopes of as democrats and in the hopes of getting knows orphaned republic getting those honestly and twelve
yeah let's most amazing the the news they can learn from decades ago but you can even learn from just last year they know that the speech that who did this whole segment of a dedicated to this mythical west wing republican like this and republican who was just go crazy when
be reminded about how we care about this country above everything and it's good republicans in the regards to drop whatever they were doing what you be heard the speech and splitting donald trump's phase and be like mr trump this is not the american i grew up knowing that didn't work on his face and it was any two thousand and sixteen
yeah this genuine psychosis i do want to go back to one point though
i remember the last year jackson mississippi elected lumber a our revolution working families brigade ran promising to make jackson the most radical city on the planet
bloomberg country right there were bluebirds going to do stop for a second hug he's not a fine
it's going to win over all the good news similar tammy duckworth senator tammy duckworth cents a day again sort of just being like now let's not get carried away saying of a casio cortez you know that her message can win in the bronx a can't win in the mid nothing can yeah has they just fucking lost the midwest
yeah you might as well say one of the midwest nothing in women in the midwest we should burn it to the ground and just frolic in the ashes are just forfeited to republicans for a generation which isn't a paid i want to have its kind of gas learning because they use lost their know we didn't
i've got nothing on
the one you got your candidate you got your message you got your chance to triangle eight a month yeah he'll off every moderate republican soccer mom
and world war two dad young evangelical you got every you got your perfect chance to do a phone off with racist ties who's just destroys every concept of what statesmen the supposed to be worse is incredibly competent incredibly moderate
candidate and none of them fucking voted for at all that the test has been done that
data is in no
sorry this isn't a thing this is scott like a difference of opinion this is literally a thing happening and millions of people deciding it didn't fucking happen
it is a group psychosis have ever encountered those people and still see them online where they see you talking about somebody calls your quarters of someone else
oh friends were this you don't like winning elections you just lost like say
he talking about that they're like talk to me when you win an election you get your ass non stop everywhere
i guess you know like when a lexus she just wanted an election
she just one she beat a guy who's been there for nineteen years he was one of the biggest guys the democratic party
she just wax him by double digits oh but how that one that said there was because of hillary you see that one that was a really good year she was the message from that one was hillary open the door and now we're seeing candidates like cycle casio cortez walk through a sometimes i thought a lot
honestly i have a lot of the wrong
she loosened the lid on the pickle jar
or our abilities of the bronx here's another good one version i you saw this one today
news max tv host he's a former n y p d officer from the from queens who retired to florida and is also a rebel tv host drink in that bio for just like going to return a wing conservative media
he was going off of a daily mail hit on no casio cortez which basically amounted to
she claims to be socialist but grew up in our house
they found the photo of the how she grew up in in westchester county which is not the bronx it's only the county literally next door to the bronx it was a very small house in westchester which is not monolithic rich obvious yeah not a guardian
large minority population there are very large or population there and it was this very small how's it look like a servants quarter and the men occurs
a
gotcha
ouch of right there and the her school run is it and if she were to prestigious brown university i went to boston university
factor because the you have a very basic a veil
and thought that been brown university even though it's never referred to by that ever like the idea is like she claims to be from the bronx but actually spent part of her childhood in neighboring westchester county right i gotta i gotta done i here's a good one
this is the next piece by lloyd green opinion contributor to the hill who know the hills always gets one
ron anyone void green used to be opposition research council so the george h w british campaign and nineteen eighty eight and later served in the department of justice
okay so this guy begins with by saying he was let us be clear that oh sea cortez is an unvarnished leftist think of jeremy corbin and bernie sanders just younger and and grizzled wasn't varnish this
that's a good cricket
who's have varnished leftist yeah
been the fuck off i'm not amish not socialism is her badge of honor when she claims that hamas is simply a palestinian analog to the ferguson protests take her conviction is a given you can also place a good bet that come two thousand and twenty kazuo cortez will be the keynote speaker the democratic national convention would you think about that
last one do you think that's a safe bet
it all now
if they were smart it will be but i mean over we're going in this episode but again this is another example of how someone who is ostensibly on the right actually does it better job of describing cause your cortez his politics then for instance nancy pelosi or tammy duckworth like sean hannity graphics tear yeah excuse me this is not
someone on the right this is this was a respectable conservative from george h w bush was an honorable man i love his socks
so he goes the pupil is about to become the teacher and that she'd been sort of the pupil is if that's become that's not sure
that should come as no surprise well democratic leadership in congress is predominantly old and white their core voters or anything but in two thousand and sixteen minorities made up nearly forty five percent of the votes for hillary clinton
yet the democrats was slow to react to this reality now they have little choice as they stand on the brink of becoming a majority minority party redistributed policies and identity politics room is fast approaching storm clouds on a nearby horizon clinton tony a neo liberalism of the triangulation just got pelted with a left hook to the jaw and the parties to bars are looking
dazed and confused
yes lot of rain down and then friedman level of mixed metaphors
that's crowd democratic party failed to reckon with minorities
built to reckon with the fact that they're about to become a majority minority party and most of their support or nearly half of it comes from minority voters i think he's just saying that the leadership is disconnected from reality together is not me the lie is actually a better me of the better the better analyzed
article than the previous ones yet every because greenbaum is obviously offer any under this enormous delusion that there's some huge swath i mean this guy's article says democrats can kiss swing voters could buy i think swing voters is like a bogeyman term at this point
i don't think it really exists
whoever you want it to be in any given argument by he needs white voters
voters who won't vote for a party that is dominated by non whites yeah exactly so white racists borders the unicorn that he's saying that yeah pretty much i want to jump to the end here he says you're wealthy swing voters will not by kazuo cortez selling wealthy democratic moms and scars
generally roll their eyes is cynthia nixon if the polls are be to be believed nixon trails andrew cuomo by more than thirty points in new york and the primaries less than three months away yes some saw their younger selves and miranda hobbes then they grew up going back in time it was fun to be hip watch your folks hate on richard nixon hang out at the saloon on broadway
are all the bars to the bar at the saloon
or with it
spit into the platoon allowed clanging noise but turned into a bar fight will someone starts a player piano a giant tumble broadway but to burn wall street down to the ground is a whole other story who does not secretly wants to be related to a hedge fund god or apartment
this is where this is what this article gets really interesting because up until then he was i think giving a like an okay a pretty honest assessment of like what that guy's view of politics was like looking at someone like cortez but now like like when he's projecting all this other stuff on like who he thinks his audiences is very strange telling out absolve yeah
who yeah who does not secretly want to be related to a hedge fund
on but parties and say yeah my brother works and wall street
yeah i want to go to the hamptons get red eyed poisoning
idiot cousin and after he brings in a bunch of like oysters the oldest the follow up is even better he says let us face it the big short was mesmerizing i think he missed the point of that movie
the point of the big show it was not that like these guys around the world big short is how cool yeah it's all is mesmerizing and who wouldn't have wanted me married or were only two girls walking around in secret of using the big short with the wolf of wall street because i would make sense with wolf of wall street the big sure
short all of the nerd
yeah like i wouldn't want to be like christian bale just bang and hunt around and sell for
money but even both for wants
i think the lesson was ostensibly that look at him as the euro know
as an hour
disagree
i want to be like termites drugs are cool as period is going like all the scorsese movies
during you into this incredibly flashy and dollars in existence and slowly teasing out a morally bankrupt it is but the whole point like you don't get to be a fucking guy who does open for george w bush and right for the hill and have an intact conscience so you're not going to get the twinge that a regular person gets watching them maybe that's not right
just like cool cool cool lambeau cool cocaine cool because another that registers as anything weird he finishes by saying trump is working hard to trash the first amendment shred the rule of law and gut reproductive freedoms but when the smoke clears kazuo cortez maxine waters and democratic progressives
may well leave greater and more lasting cultural and economic resentments
so the theme of these first two beginning that daniella and now with lloyd at the hill is the idea that the democrats are really playing with fire when they are advancing an agenda that really appeals to the people who vote for them when they should be advancing an agenda of the people who watch the big short and was like
well i wish i was related to steve corral that last paragraph is incredibly important because he says explicitly he says trump is doing all this awful stuff and swings suburban voters are horrified by it but if you suggest that anyone's going to come for their fucking money they're going to not give a shit about first amendment or
or child prisons or but getting rid of row
choices all that stuff or you raise their taxes you do any kind of redistribution they're going to fucking switch and the thing is he's probably right about that because but that and that really would doom any kind of movement lot too early in this country because the people who vote generally are a collection of relatives
well off middle and upper class people and they have economic interests that align with that and left a left wing democratic party is going to alienate them and the only argument against that is that maybe just maybe people who aren't middle and upper class aren't comfortable in this fucking me
pressure hello world we're living in might be attracted to that and think for the first time in a while it might be worth it to vote for the spurs why here's the other thing we live in a two party system and necessarily until our
means of electing a legislature were to change radically it's always gonna be a two party system and right now some sixty percent of the country is irrespective of their class interest alienated by donald trump an alien by the republican party because they can see how batch insane these people are so they have
no choice except to stay home
i think you can in this moment and just in this moment
use these resentments against the trump administration to augment this kind of hypothetical oh cause your court has coalition
and i think that would be a workable majority but only in the short term i think you're right that ultimately any kind of like actual redistribute of policies would you know shuffle the dac again and question is there any proof
nose or any proof for research that shows people actually vote this way as and i live in this part of the country but a thousand miles away
they
this person one this is going to change how i'm gonna treat my home election based on what's happening in the europe because really proved to be partially think this way because i mean just always been the french candidates
not a green that fringe but just to accept a hypothesis at the putting forth is always been my candidates were electing different states have different series
oh that's kind of a weird but the go by your business when started to vote in your
local election i wonder if people really think this way it's probably just go to reinforce your original perception of the parties and not change that much i mean you saw the insane tea party candidates two thousand and ten
he did not do that much of a disservice to the republican party overall i think what matters it is i think this basic conception of this moderate voter that's out there that is disgusted by donald trump but is afraid of anything to left wing is probably accurate but i think it shows that any election strategy we live
hang on these people is absolute was no because because those people were either cultural democrats like they lived in one party democrat states like massachusetts or california where if you are in any way kind of conservative you would still probably run on the democratic ballot line and there
not going to go with the republican party those states aren't going to realign not rapidly anyway so for the time being they don't have a home and if you want to talk about the these these suppose a moderate republicans as bad or it out there they're not voting for the democrats anyway they didn't do it we did that test they didn't vote they wrote in john k sick
or they voted for gary johnson and that's it but i mean i think i think this underscores the point of why some y o casio cortez one is because she went after people who are normal democratic voters who probably never voted before or have stopped vote i don't honestly people say that she says that i'm
not sure if the evidence backs iraq because there wasn't like wasn't a big boost in turn right if you comparing apples apples other competitive races in new york
it's a similar amount of votes so i mean i think she just had a message that resonated with those people who turned out and i think that's a strong take away her as great i think people kind of and the rest me how i know a lot of people were talking about her as people who are normally politically engaged or sharing them on youtube
people think differently now a youtube is such a big deal
i smoke it whereby a type of things that get tons of views in hits on on youtube and i think that really helped you get a good narrative
yeah she wasn't inspiring age was running against a rotten out of touch incumbent and i think that goes to show how strong messaging and strong campaigning and having very talented hardworking leaders candidates volunteers can
when primaries over with a far left platform a competitor who views as she is way more prisons and those errands and way more empathy building in those as and any hillary at the spring years in the air for different things and she just never for
fraction of their reliability starting it's tough to compare our who doesn't certain states are certain areas compared to the two different people you know i mean in the home stretch that election two thousand and sixteen the horizon feature her ads feature donald trump yeah she then one add the long one where it was just that slow close up of her face the closer
and i was just her talking about her her resume she was qualified ah she was the most care the most qualified candidate of all time
the he also seems to be arguing that
weapon rising economic present is a bad and the other side has had no problem weapon isaiah racial animus for natural selection but for decades well yeah but that's that's fine with him it's not going to hurt him
officials and but it might end up hurting his pocket and try to get a job whipping up call an economic growth
and truck with more willing to talk labored and hillary sadly enough like in those debates i mean you to have any good solutions for him but he was willing to admit something was broken whereas hillary would just like it's really out there was really pathetic because a lot of those flipped well so obama to trump flip phones can often be described explain just by the fact that he was ill
really the only candidate saying the word jobs
only one the rest she didn't talk about jobs at all
resume and she talked about how vulgar and massage and racist donald trump is which should true of course and peppers
and debate that wasn't enough
i mean here's the real think it's something that i've argued for a long time now the democratic party absolutely does not and should not be does not need to be an absolutely should not be a big ten part and whatever anyone says like oh we got we need have a big tent you being too much of a purist about this i mean you should
when their face because the wrong they don't know what they're talking about a big ten party with no means it has no ideological moorings means it cannot lead it cannot legislate it means it's going to be inertial and it's just going to rot and lead time and time again to any movement no matter how repugnant
it's a movement such as i don't own fascism
that does have some kind of potency that's not as innovative as a big ten party that's just oh hey come on and you can just park your ass here
just hang out with righteous the party of principle where the party opposed to on accountable while the people get to feel warm and fuzzy about forging temporary alliances with moderate republicans who will stab them in the back the first second but we're not even talking about forging alliances because when you talk about a big ten party you're not you're not you're not saying we're going to do
national politics you are saying we need to water down any our platform our speech anything we believe in order to accrue these you know free radical voters and we saw and twenty six seen it can't happen it's not the case these modern republican
they believe repugnant things they could never ever and thousand years build a and elect really popular movement of their own so they have to kind of like like
bacteria
float around looking for a host where they can spread their shitty fucking ideas
there was a tweet you put up i think perfectly
describe as there's no you're right i use of alice mouse and
usually read it out
who's kevin feeling i don't know who he is you put up a tweet he some oh i see our allies some guy and live with an archer and or archer avatar which is all you fucking years are you need to know walk off like this kind of shows that for a lot of these people what you describe is a feature and that a bug that this idea that there is no logical morning
in matches there but it's a typo
the almost like been put upon for a noble
this is the price we pay for being noble were kind of bad luck but we have our principles and i think the impotence is actually a feature not a bug but you put of this tree and is said in liberals ideal world they still do they still don't win and this guy's treat is something i was kicking around last night
what about a perpetually balance court something like ten justices five live five con
so what every major decision deadlocks every time yes he's a spot or even his wildest dreams
this nation is to just be imprudent you to that
as lame i blame the introduction of the world cup and soccer culture in america for that wretched kind of thinking wear ties or and isn't even occurred
the rest of it says his vision as replacements coming from party regardless of who is in the white house so basically whoever you need to bounce in the matter who's in the white house you get for to be like it would be like the lebanese constitution where the president has to be sunni and the prime minister
necessarily the president is maronite and like the speaker of parliament is a she is of money point that's what it would be somebody and fighters five spots for the dams five for that and one of the five dams dies in a hang gliding accident or something they are replaced by the dams and somebody pointed out that this was the plot
have a west wing episode yeah yeah yeah
yeah two spots the phil and he could have gotten to mediocre liberals or he could have gotten one brilliant liberal legal mind if he put up there with equally brilliant one of those babies about build the perfect boyfriend
got two dollars
but the thing is that guess what it does it matter if they're fucking moron it doesn't matter if they need a helper monkey is to feed them if they vote the right way and and vote for the left position on an issue it literally doesn't matter if the writing their a concurrent with crayons there
brilliance means nothing that's the fetish that they have is who but they're so smart who gives a fuck how fucking smart they are what matters is how they're going to vote and i remember there were a lot of people when the gore such thing was happening with course it's got nominated i saw a couple of people insisting you can't go you can't drive a snap go
message you should take or such because he's so good scholar he's a good judge my god
you might not agree with him but he's smart think of who truck
from could pick if you don't pick him he could pick someone qualified as a matter of gonna take up hitler
attach it to a fucking car battery if you put them on the supreme court it's still just one vote it's still just the fight for what were the other all that matters is how they're going about doing reddit be imprinted with good optics then be like a powerful winning but in civil i think it's because they have no skin the game
they actually don't really care that revealing they have no skin in the game
academic and yeah spectator sport it matter who loses particular court case because either way we're taking care of it i think centuries and is more be old you've been left vs right with these people and to a agree they have more aligned with the centuries of the suppose it opposite
with her because even someone as articles there are more cool with a so called centuries person the other party in the fringe on both yes because they meant they want their vested in the fucking economic status quo and all of those with the democrats you have the process fetish that were talking about and the you
the fetish for swing voters and those basically just act as covers for the real truth which is that it is a party controlled and directed and structured around the interests of wealth and that is a reality that would make a lot of the actual voters sort of uncomfortable or unhappy because
lot of base democrat voters are actually you know in some way maybe maybe not well articulated it in some way hostile to capitalism as it exists now in america and if you if you like sorry but if when nancy pelosi since we're capitalists and that's just the way things are she's really telling you what all of this is hi my all the stuff up
perish the a process other stuff but sick worrying about swing voters in peoria it's all a cover for the fact that they don't want to change the status quo and the best oriented and they would be a pyre hundred and they just want to hold onto the ball for a fourth quarter like they don't really want to pass it don't want to do anything with just let the clock run out
because the winning winning in the capital given the right thing to have other down by twenty five but it doesn't matter it's even they're still in power regardless there in power positions of power to influence regardless of whether their party is in power and in many ways it's better to be out of power as if you're in party in power your base might expect you to do something and they has to be fun
emphasize the democratic party is presently exist is structurally and in the personnel at its top invested in not doing any of the things that people at the base the people who have been alienated since the wall street crisis and by trump and other people have been steadily getting radicalize people who are deeply alienated from an accurate
order that does not work for the vast majority of americans they do not want to change anything about it period in a sense they can't they wouldn't be a party if they did because they wouldn't get the money that keeps the lights on they wouldn't keep that remember a class of consultants and scumbags who circulate in and out of government law
lobbyists that is the actual architecture of the party and all this stuff is just window dressing for that and
that's why it's going to be interesting to see to what degree you can actually force them to change and i'm kind of frankly skeptical that you will because you have to create alternative structures that kim
they can can that can compete with these monolithic well here's what you need to troll of the ballot access and money with the things that make politics possible they have a stranglehold well i mean i think campaigns like alexandria cause your court as as show us
show us a blueprint for starting this long process and you're describing but you're absolutely correct things what needs to happen really somebody needs to come in and check out the money lenders yeah and that i mean that goes back to what i'm saying about a big temporary he's whenever anyone talk show big be temporary you should know like one you don't know what you're talking about you don't know how elections
the blocks punched in politics and to it means that you are afraid of alienating any one it means you don't have any actual political enemies it means you want those wall street guys you want the rich hedge fund guys you want these these super i wanted and is doing exactly what is
suburban shit had republicans you even your even really thinking are all these people are thinking deep down inside you know this twenty five percent of the country that's baying for children to be locked in cages and would or would absolutely without question support worse things happening to those people we need to get them back on
our side to their ultimate fantasy is a one hundred percent part
that's what that logic leads you to what really needs to happen is the democratic party has to become smaller it has to excise like a malignant tumors many sectors of the party starting with the entire wall street donor base of the party and campaigns like alexandria cause cortez
and bernie sanders show you that you don't need that money to run a populist party were one to will merge okay
next media reaction this is a good one
this is by headline from cnn democrats are in danger of going too far left for thousand and eighteen this is by joe cunningham editor's note show cunningham as an editor at the conservative news and opinion say red state
in a contributor to the hey ride dot com
tomorrow's as advise on a this is a red state account which is genuinely concerned that the democrats if they go too far left will lose from the early twentieth and just pointing out that up and they're just giving you some friendly advice sometimes you can take advice on how you
should run your campaign and organize your beliefs if that advice is given to you by your literal mortal and and we know that always acting in bad faith should hear about that's the thing because they're impartial they're the best person math i want to read the way the fuck outta here i think the fuck an asshole trying to act like they're fuckin hillbillies
sons of the soil come on to the hey ride and here's fifteen articles the wrong made by some fucking i want a plague industries drag and we need a bag hey ride party that's what we
first of all catherine can you describe what you're cutting him looks like he's the round this boy i've ever seen
i think he was a guy and game rooms
honestly i our
yeah that was a suspect
i'd like to have this is the barber he was founded the world
he's a big round boy with a big old beard wow
like this this is his read of our recent politics he was just sitting around the who and then lays on country wisdom down for you city slicker president barack he says president barack obama lead the party and left for direction
further further than his modern democratic predecessors in the white house which is kind of true but then he says worn guy more in terms of rhetoric on issues such as immigration in l g p th rates than in terms of policy while i mean that is what matters here so in rhetorically he moved the party slightly to the left in terms of immigration and l g b t
earth are the most important thing however his health care overhaul alone invigorated the right wing and by the end of obama has tenure we saw hollowing out of democratic officeholders across the board obama never embraced socialism but pushing the country as far left is he did invited backlash once if the democrats go further left into
eighteen and twenty twenty the push back is going to be even worse skits some money so this guy's been a writer for wow and somebody look up the shit he was writing about about their in your palm and minutes i was just thinking that i know this mother fucker called them a socialist on multiple occasions there is no fucking way that red state dot com about call obama fucking so they were not making those disk
stations you know if they were probably right a messiah sides of the shall i
ape or neoliberal relatively new centrist horse shit you're lying sack of dough
so yeah this is joe cunningham says here
there is evidence that the democratic leadership is trying to keep the party from deviating too far but it seems they might be losing the fight democratic leaders including fear stroke critic adam schiff have urged other democrats not to push for impeaching the president pelosi wants to keep control of the caucus and has signalled she will fight off any of our challenges from her left which includes
refusing to support sanders plan for universal healthcare and raising taxes but many in their party base apparently believe that they didn't go leftward enough in two thousand and sixteen and the groundswell support for sanders insidious this hillary clinton was an awful candidate who survived the primary process with help from the parties establishment and debbie wasserman schultz in particular and her lack of appeal to the
in public was just as much to blame for trumps victory as anything accurate and throw with aren't she didn't go in any direction and that was the issue
yeah she didn't have policies here's remakes she had them on the website though
so much of the democrats base wants to move further left and nominate about socialist to take on the far right conservatives they view is the enemy add to that rhetoric like we heard from maxine waters who effectively called for protesters to target trump administration officials and you have a recipe for more extremism and ultimately voter alienation
it's a dangerous over correction and it's not strategically smart you know you know it's always alexandria and maxine waters and i just wonder what those two people have in common
say something i can't put my finger on it but all of these reactionary white writers are warning us against these two women in particular
also and
similar social you coming from liberals centers because they're always online talking about trust
you know trust non white women of color trust all this stuff but their magical yeah did the magical exercising
the hell out of year silly names didn't need the hell out of except when they don't fit the centrist mine and it's like trust black woman
one or listen to women but no know her
and on paper
all the talking about this intersection now the the
a press advantage you have
you know it increases your like or how much you deserve to have the you know what i mean
yeah you're putting your tweets about intersection now the end is nigh into sectional website for white women in the black woman now that i've seen this fund raising and showing that and that means anything to them
this is a lot of intersection or opportunity she's not rich
unless you listen to that article she's porter rigging she's a woman a paper will be great
we want michael bloomberg
joke and him finishing out here he says it's a dangerous over correction and it's not strategically smart again
just the love the idea that the democratic party should be taking strategic advice from an editor red state dot com and that's the kind of shit they wouldn't do that yeah
you he wants what's best for you
the body's been there before
political stakeholder the american public's response to obama and to trump has been for someone to swing things back the other way they weren't moderating voices and government it's looking more like they're going to get the opposite however and they aren't going to react the way some democrats think they will like it or not the american public as a whole is going to want more
civility from their politics not less what does that actually that why they don't like did donald trump because they want to moderate and the white house i don't what does that actually mean people want a moderate government by then
we want a neutral government doesn't make snow that's the thing is that and that's the that's the third of the floating signify and all of these articles that mark moderation is never explained moderation is never to be ah while it's about norms up all day
the government doesn't want to learn and know and a president who will uphold and respect and every one of every political stripe unless you're a catatonic you know unless you are
unless you're the mother in psycho wants a government with a mandate a platform some general
actually does something but also the schools belt to not learning anything we just test this theory with the most moderating non believer in free to finn everybody liked her exactly like it wasn't that long coat is so we're just split up these premises
not only that the landlords but i think this guy say what i want is actually moderate and what he wants and if he if he wrote it down was sincere about it would be totally abhorrence yeah to and fifty sixty percent of the here here's here's like the the disconnect in this comes from more than both the media essentially believes he conservator
movements own self conception and the way they've sold themselves is that you know this is david brooks line that being a conservative is about you know what what's tried and true yeah
or new experiments are different things and spent and i mean and liking you know things that are okay
possible utopia and that they they wanted this about preserving the status quo
that party exists in america and it's the democratic party
the democratic party is a centre right party that is mostly conservative and it's outlook
essentially yes would they like the world to be more humane and our country to be better in certain ways sure but basically they want to keep things yeah and even handed the keel and not do anything too fast or too soon
the party is a full on revenge just reactionary party
you said if you went down the line and their what they actually want from government it's to turn the clock back one hundred you that includes every single one of the never trump site every every single one of them yeah so if you you should be forced to talk well we want moderation i want you to fucking you have to do like a p style requests should require you
to have to define it what is moderation and you're like well it's a five trillion dollar defense budget and both wars forever largest incarcerated population in the world that lead reading of standard of living for everybody who doesn't own a boat i mean that's and that would be it and then people would know you're talking about instead of just being flow
signify that just means basically just means a reasonable person because that's the thing americans pride themselves or not they don't want to think of themselves as giving away their reason to some ideology we think that's bad we think of that basically as as for loss of self
you are a person to the degree that you maintain an independent judgment above ideology and that idea so powerful that you can package anything in that garb and people will be like yes even if it is objectively insane reactionary gibberish that will lead to the death of everyone on the earth they couldn't be any its pace
typically like fucking death cult shit but because it's it's it's draped in the mantle of moderation and because there's no one there's no real political differences between the parties to sharpen those distinctions and make people have to find their terms it just gets put under and this is shackled
what you were saying about democratic party shouldn't be a big tent party and like right now the democratic party is sort of at war with itself because its leadership and what and largely that people like it's most committed voters are largely conservative and their out but not conservative in the sense that they hate gay people or like want to turn back the clock on social progress but they want to keep things basic
where they are now even though the other for the other people who have nowhere else to go but the democratic party it's not fucking working for them and that's why they doing this when no one was really excited but hillary clinton other than that are hard group of powerful well off people whether you're willing to challenge in trench capital and
the most recent incarnation democratic party is categorically unwilling to do that i've heard glimmers are seeing glimmers of we might go after the drug companies we might go after the oil companies may be very lightly a soft touch i mean you look at the day which was obviously policy in
ending to help people intending to increase coverage
what it was not a challenge to the health insurance company
medical companies what does this will accommodate cunningham were saying about obama move the country the left by rhetorically and that's the thing is that they can only talk about like yes obama doesn't want people to go bankrupt from there
it doesn't want health insurance to bankrupt people or for people to not seek medical care for lack of insurance right but he can only talk about the solutions to these problems euphemistically because he can't go on
you can leave the a market based expansion modest expansion of health insurance
availability in the country is a radical left proposal you're a baby you're a dumb baby i don't care what you believe i don't need your vote i don't want to talk to you if i wanted to impress you are court you i will tangled my keys in front of you
hey here's another fuck off
rookie i want one more before i get the final one in terms of a group of people who i think we need to court about libertarians with zero
magazine all of from former shadow guest robbie suave
he says
that's cool idea democratic socialists who think you're having a moment it's me a libertarian who's been through this
you will libertarians of this country have never had a moment anything close service
yeah she wrote me yeah it's me
as a robbery
very worried about
he writes your democratic socialists and the ideology which cause ya cortez identifies appears to be having a political moment to which i say as a libertarian who has been through the whole an idea whose time has finally come
luck with that camera and wrong the signs are easy to miss read hadn't happened yet
talking about ron paul yeah yeah but isn't libertarian now they been a crack head anytime after nineteen ninety
doesn't
use a cracker to does a time
that has gotten so much bad press how who doesn't mean a crack an
libertarians how are you a tried and true two thousand and eighteen libertarians
the answer is they've all moved on to the harder shit like great and yeah yeah
nazis and a few of them i will give credit a few of because the libertarian as i'm basically it failed alienated from the status quo so it's harder for them they just become regular conservatives or whatever they end up most of them become nazis and i will give credit to the few who are true they take the principle of freedom of the idea and they take oh i mean to be social
and some of them to do that and i give those people credit for most of them are just becoming nazis the ones that are left are in it for the fucking paycheck like robbie slavic rest of them are the ones getting paid by the koch brothers getting paid by all these fucking stitched up think tanks and and fake fucking periodicals that no one on earth pies and that's the big difference and that's what's was on
they released as well
when he writes in the period of time between two thousand and nine in two thousand and fifteen a group of republicans it appears like they wanted to shrink government stole some power from the old guard time magazine senator rand paul the most interesting man in national politics and libertarian as it was finally enjoying it's political moment even the new york times thoughts
also okay wow you so you got the biggest fucking slack jawed rooms and politics to be slightly impressed by your fake fucking branding exercise congratulations oh yeah but i mean the point is a it delivered for the people that funded oh yes oh yes well here's the thing they did they did win because the what libertarian leads to wins
you elected while in two thousand and ten just justin a marsh and rand paul you also like to dozens of freedom cock his site comics and they are at work in this raiding are fucking welfare state and just because they recognize correctly that
all of this
on a great artists principle non aggression just because they've left that shit by the wayside and if abandon any you know half hearted bromides about you know oh
we you believe in multiculturalism and she like that
does it mean they're not fundamentally libertarian listen to this listen to the smug asshole he says while it's true that more and more people desire cultural freedom specifically the kind of customers asian choice and control over their own lives
a libertarian world view providing
political libertarian isn't had much less support than it seemed voters didn't send the see party to washington constrained government and they ended up carrying far less about crony capitalism that may not a it
about illegal immigration that's capitalism father has or what does not political libertarian i'm going even saying well here's the thing like they met it pointed this out to me and like the libertarian like again the twelve people that robbie suave any editors at reason represent their vision of libertarian is it is only attractive if they sell it by agreeing with things that liberal
and left already wanted anything like that was the ron paul revolution was a punch a dip shit college kids a little i or and legal weed excited about that because he was the only candidate and either party saying talking if that was of the only thing the thing is there's nothing libertarian necessarily about either of those positions as positions are at very watch at home on the left and
that's the thing about this that makes it so funny is that this guy is so up his own ass
fucking georgetown happy hours of the others put polling fucking qaeda operatives that they don't realize that libertarian is it is entirely a paper tiger
funded by wealthy people who give it the illusion of popular support whereas socialism if it is properly understood it becomes something that can like actually reach out and be be persuasively appealing to people literally is the aspirations of the entire working class
that is slightly more fertile at toro ground than twelve point dexter's in dc who literally all of whom went to fucking george mason and are getting getting paychecks to believe this shit to create this fantasy that there is some cosmopolitan libertarian isn't that doesn't revolve into straight nazis them as soon as
since pressure is applied to robbie says a casio cortez doesn't appear crazy she's an eloquent if naive and and specific defender of far left ideas he's not as naive as me the guy who literally things that the point of capitalism is to give me multiple places where i can get video game
oh and he also said that are harder after the yeah he said that a paragraph above he he says
sees chris hayes to his credit was mildly incredulous about the future congresswoman's agnostic definition of the term and he's like he's he's talking about how cortez when she's asked what does it mean to be a socialist says things like to me it's about the dignity of all people to have health care education and a job etc not being like workers control the means of production
when robbie was on our show i specifically asked him about the actual libertarian beliefs of murray rock art and hans hermann harper which he disavowed explicitly said that's not the kind of libertarian i am to me libertarian islam is about as he said the getting the widest array of video game reviews from a different
i'm sorry i thought i'm not that i want to you by idiot and every moron who gave us them
because the free to post all day about their fucking video game preferences she goes i be like the idea that his ideas in a socialist government you get you get one video
from from like the cutoff who central committee
every game gets one review
you get mad you you just were chopper years euro to commence chris person with the only one allowed to do video game reviews you know ideally they would be no
he says there's no doubt social as the schism
there's no doubt socialism as defined in incredibly loose terms as a vast social welfare system is gaining popularity among democrats but libertarians have learned the hard way that it's all too easy to draw unwarranted conclusions and misdiagnosed the moment especially when the new york times phones over you think people actually like
obviously very used to the feeling of being convinced young and naive or moment that you were very popular only to find out later the horse meat hook reality of you actually have no for and he said everyone hates here and no one wants to play video games of you know no one will join your plan nobody is fucking struggling as a young
person to make this world is going to think you know the solution to this is the regulation that's going to take care of it
and they know that and that's why this idea that there was any any comparison between these two movements is absurd because libertarian ism mostly got relevant for a minute there with a combination of dark money and literal trickery just putting like the couple of good you know you got like a bunch of rotten fucking vegetables and you've got to the
that's what they did rudely who lead know the around or is bad
and that's the entire and it was never anything because it's just not a thing that's going to it has no and the way that people who has no and the people who fund it like the coax and the mercer is etc
p p peterson's or whatever the people who arranged the reason magazine cruise or whatever
these people are explicit about not wanting are caring about puritanical libertarian is they want the government to be shrunk just enough to like for them to hoard even more creases like well have to go to the moment they don't really have to give a shit if like it's been the polish the d m v or whatever
and those few good fruit that they have like you don't need to be a libertarian to have legally you know you can have legal weed with a bunch of government regulation california it's just it and it's like the least the very conservative era support legal weed and as far as i know there's nothing that talk about that's appealing
only get through libertarian isn't stuff you get just a terrorism is just a nightmare realm of pure social darwinism where people are fucking been picked up in the street giant fucking what sort of link or yeah like selling can bulldozers right but really the thing is i i really do maintain his they got
what they sensibly wanted from donald trump living up guy okay they got the time that are reading it
deregulation they get the eviscerate and it's also so many social safety net right they got this fucking right wing supreme court justice who is go to keep making decisions like that and they got something
a little bit of their opposition to the iraq war no more big land wars just these techno wars were
these video game board where we're not going to die they're going to die so you don't have to worry about it you could read your fucking video game reviews something else they they didn't literally get the wall and lot of loading but they go with the wall represents which is terrorizing immigrants yeah so so make people talk about oh i see these liberals laugh
oh the trump where's the wall and the people who that was red meat for them i yanked near to purchase these kids in cages
finally i didn't have a war but we have a chain link fence that's all the won't we need as long as the wall separating immigrants from us we don't care if it's a chain link fence
in a cage or of it's an actual literal wall i want to see through it
between libertarian rage at trump right now is the rage of taliban holding up the mirror and seeing his own reflection and that our professor
i mean we're we're over and he gets our last meeting series that is of course still have the theme of a day l se but one of rod dryers readers
dip into the roger air mail bag and play the twilight zone music one of his readers is from new york's eighteenth district
how how insane well someone asked me how many times they called the cops a week as a really must be why
because a reader of this blog rights as a decades long kevin james
mr king of queens
a reader of this blog rights as a decade long resident of new york's congressional district just one effectively by alexandria sea of cortez and a stunning primary upset of the democratic incumbent though i've eliminated some biographical information at his request i can tell you from his past comments on the site that the reader is not
a christian okay
as a reader and again
always preface you have to take this with a large grain of salt
rod i'm almost positive is reading these letters to himself
i think of run there are there are some interesting tells him around trail mailbag i think of the film split if anyone with with james mcavoy m night shadowlands some was being kept in the basement what just he's he's there's five hundred versions of him and they are right like automatically write letters to the other than he wakes up and oh
older they all these letters to the editor the need to put them on my website okay so this is reader who again rather would like to stress is not a christian
joe crowley was the congressman of my district and i was rooting for him to win more so because he recently stood up against a protected bike lane proposal and to corridors and a community the department of transportation a bunch of crazy far left progressive activists and the mayor were trying to force these bike lanes down arthur
road despite a huge outcry and we push back enough where joe crowley said no and our local councilman and it or not supporting the project now with crowley gone the snowflakes who demanded these bike lanes might become involved in again
i saw this slice electorate share his bike legs
this is so this is just like that
politics
it's the same mean even if it isn't him it's functionally the same person as they crank who wrote about the thing when britannica we're going to get these of say people like the at the sight of a bicyclist these are the people and they exist it's hard to imagine them
see someone on a bicycle and they get mad i don't know how you get to that point but there are people like that moral that continues that being said i'm not surprised that cause your court has won her campaign posters were everywhere and i mean everywhere every single grocery store or store front in my neighborhood had her post sir
even my local grocery store had her poster up and when i went to the owner who is a good friend and asked him if her followers asked him permission to put it up he said yeah they told me to put a poster on my window and i said yes when i told him about her politics and that she was for bike lanes and all the progress of craziness he immediately rift it up and
that that is absurd
it's like bikes the people ride bikes it's radical let it isn't the on the minority is basically a giant avatar for people and pie
it's like a fuckin rube goldberg murder machine for people on bicycles the idea of just putting like some space for them not to get squad yeah i gotta i gotta say i think believing that the most important issue in politics is going to mobilize the most people his bike lanes
is a lot more same to me then what all of the centrists and liberals talking about alexandria cause your cortez is when believe this does affect people's daily lives people feel it
and it just goes on you're going to find out the bike lanes is definitely not a not all
so he goes in the funny thing is the poster was upon his window along with an ad for joke crowley just by walking around the neighborhood i saw how bland crowley's campaign posters were there were few and far between and number and i had a sense that the last three months that he was woefully unprepared for the tidal wave that was going to hit him many of the store owner
super of cortez is posters had no idea who she was or what she stood for her election in large part was successful due to a very well designed pr effort and propaganda came of the activists who work for a little door to door putting up these ads and all they had to do was ask permission from the business owners if that wasn't enough people were actively stopping
austrians on the street and campaigning for her why my local park every home
i think the biggest trickery
she'd never hit her positions political stop at first
because i don't know this is really good i don't know where her funding came from but big money was definitely back her up from the t shirts to a bicycle from the t shirts to the well designed posters to the glossy campaign cards something was definitely work here is if there weren't a million articles about how she
if she had an accord children no longer need to be ah dick round but i'm not that it is no other option but big a million people with twenty dollars in a park
they couldn't possibly be actually of actual ground swell of popular support it's gotta be money is what this is also like real like old person boomer mindset is that they see something that's like pleasantly graphically design their like that money was behind that i don't mean to areas
awesome to was her race or background is it probably thought okay it's probably on the black and spanish people in all the poor people voting for her how did the out of that first of all are they even allowed to vote why did my dogs are french as the mets why aren't the all phones that's that's another
look into so how did they get the money to give her cc he senses that there's something off with these well designed posters and he goes as anyone who thinks that the racial component was not at play here is fooling ourselves her campaign poster look like an ad for a political candidate in a latin american country
what the fuck is he talking she has them
it persists
excellent
that's what i say about like he was wearing this hat with all as fruit on
an epilogue like a huge
covered in battles see as her add looked like a poster for a political candidate in a latin american country and i guess it worked a marvelous affect the large hispanic population in this area okay guys
this letter was hinting at the crazy but now are really going to dive into it however what was really bizarre for me was the fact that the overwhelming majority of activists who are campaigning for her like a bunch of fanatics were whites in all capital
when i see stuff like was i can't help but think that whites especially white liberals have some sort of in built suicide complex where they want to give away their own country to non white new here we get some absolutely mind boggling sorry
oh yeah
it's absolutely mind boggling to me and it's going to be hilarious watching these weights eventually be pushed out of the democratic party for the record this guy lives in a commercial district that's eighty five percent non white he just loves being pissed he goes they're going to be pushed out of the democratic party and straight into the hands of the all right
you're describing what happened to you
oh cause your curtis is far left politics of the future the democrats and if they want to get their way america will be well on the way to becoming a third world banana republic make no mistake this country is in big trouble there is a lot more i can say about why i've come to these conclusions but in the last three read my manifesto
i've seen enough to believe that some sort of civil war in america is inevitable race or yep and then he says first it'll happen along political lines then it will morph into conflict along racial ethnic lines i expect that will see classes between right wing left wing groups in the streets there will be very reminiscent of the bloody left rate battles that to find turkey in the late seventies and early eighties
he's out of this chaos will see the military step in and establish martial law and that will be the end of the united states falling apart like the tower of babel before it i know what this guy talking about because there's this guy who would always come in with a big boom box and play rap music really loud in his pizza place
this verse the first indication that things are going down hill said they really really realized about
conservatives would have parents that your to is i used to only the fringe really believes in camp of saints or what's the what's the other one to turn it down
but leave in different differing degrees one group things it's going to happen tomorrow but these guys think it's only one election away or yeah like you know this one bad choice of america and then all the masses the more them come from the abyss him just drag you know
they're absolutely convinced that's the catalyst to make it for fascism it's just that death drive of the eventually just all going to sign off on the idea that america is doomed basically needs to die in some bloody racial regular ah you think the new french reign of terror is going to happen at any given second this is so crazy to me is that a casino court
as one a nice of something of election but this guy's literally like race war is going to happen because of it
so her and her platform wasn't that radically
so a rod says i've been an update there's like ten updates on this post he goes i've reconsidered whether or not to take this comment down because some of you say it's racist when roger dryers readers are calling something
he goes i'm going to leave it because i think the readers observations are debatable not correct but debatable the fear of voters like him have the power of identity politics are realistic as much as the fear of left wing voters have from right wing a lot is she did not run here for a but that's thing that's thing for these people those things are racially coding and read to trouble
lucian is racial yeah taking money from me who's going to get it them that's how they think of it it's one hundred percent the way they think of it and anybody who's white and has any kind of social standing racial biases the concept of redistribution
and then these these white people that he so horrified or i bet a lot of them are ones who really don't have anything and think that they might actually benefit from redistribution he writes at the end here but there's no escaping the fact that through a lot of people who look like the joe crowley's of the world the ambiguity of that statement it's time for one of us will be interpreted as other rising those who do not have the same
identity is the candidate
cause cortez is one of us well who is them in this case it's a guy who's been in congress for twenty fucking years and takes fucking donations from literally every you all than the i swore have her the and then a finishes with another letter the ever readable met in virginia rights i am thirty five a readable in letter fucking written in his own
semen and i am thirty five years old and for what it's worth i honestly feel like there is only one category of people my age or younger and it ain't a majority who believe any more in i have a dream that my four little children will one day be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their and that's what if someone asked them if within those second speech
don't have add a vague else to say also by the way i guess what if you guys who were if you guys really want everyone to judge you are the kind of a character you're fucked because her truly awful your bad or the scumbag nazi pieces of shit and lucky we of people are fucking rise up and put you in camps
you are talk about fucking continent you cut your characters dogs
by the letter every fucking letter from to rob trader seems like it was written on toilet paper and center hannibal lecter
next time i'm going to send you something where i just want to bring in one really quick
the thing about it all day the funny thing about this is that millennial socialists are an anti materialistic are anti bourgeois they think socialism is their path to materialism and a while lifestyle avocado toast in brooklyn loss for all and all i could think is every man a king how hypocritical
i didn't get a chance to talk about it but i hope i don't recapitulate what you said on our fiscal how to ensure will but i was at alexandria his victory party and on the way over you know and the conversations i had with a lot of people involved and that the been unnecessarily her campaign was that we think she went
marvelous campaign she got the word out it's a victory in that regard but you know hey if she gets thirty percent of the vote that would be a huge victory for us
and i when we got there i spoke to ryan grim of the intercept who told me he was walking around the neighborhood and he talked to ten people and every ten voters and every single one of them was voting for alexandria so when those results came in it was a shock by i mean it seems like it would have been a shock to anyone on the
around and throughout out that night i kept hearing from people people would come up to us was a you know they'd heard the show and said you know i just just recently or few months ago a year ago got politically active and i'd been canvassing knocking on doors for alexandria or four months
now hours every day and it was the competence of her campaign in this one of these volunteers that put her over the top and i hope this wasn't off the record but i spoke with someone close to her campaign who said that long before she was getting all this mean
the attention before she was his breakout star and later last couple weeks of the primary that the place where they got a great deal of attention online was the chapel sub reddit which is a very politically active
left sub reddit and i was also i also learned recently that one of one of the modern was banned for posting the ice list
to which i say some propose so if you were elated as i was sure you were by alexandria his victory and you
this event kind of crystallize to you how important electoral victories can be not just as a way to legislate but as a way to build a movement to get the message out there because as we've seen the with her on all these tv networks evangelize
for socialism
thousands of people have joined the essay just based on not alone and are ready to get to work if you can appreciate the value of that then i think you should be interested in a friend of mine her name is julie salazar she's running for the new york state senate in brooklyn she in the
get out the vote period of alexandria his campaign
she gave her staff her people to alexandria to knocked down doors for her she went out and she knocked on doors for alexandria and she's locked in a tight race of her own and i think she is someone who deserves to be paid back for that investment she is a leader she's a unique
and member she has been a community organizer for justice in brooklyn against police brutality against war for several years now and she has a platform that is just between you will be a fraction as radical as the person that i know and her victory would be yet another mess

i'm gonna kick things off right away this week and were now
making a second appearance on the show
someone who i regard as the greatest humanitarian of our times a humble genius a dreamer and a beacon of hope for all of humanity
you on musk how are you doing good thank you it's so great to be on the show again to share my vision with you guys it's great to be with the chapel clan on
you know you're coming off an amazing week
captured the world's imagination and rescued all those children trapped in a cave in thailand because you to all a little bit about the it's a fantastic weekend you know it's a building on a lot of other fantastic greeks i haven't had a bad week since nineteen ninety and the political events that happened in that year
but you know
you know you go to forgive me because i'm i'm here we are on the ground and two kids and we're still working on the operation what we did together
with the royal government to thailand you no kidding the twelve soccer boys added a tunnel just really the kind of inspiration did i need for my space force and i was very inspired by the work of not only the young boys but also of the government to tell him we did it together we did it together in space x
and the long must could not have done what we did without some of the assistance of those people so i have to be generous in that sense
probably the most crucial elements of this rescue was the introduction of your personal child size submarines can you can you speak a little bit about the development of this been working on it we've been working on a few years different program to spacex one of a projects because it takes so long to get to mars we will working on deep
i pods so that we would be able to have children go between earth and mars if they have divorced parents you know like on an airline
and they'll be able to travel on their own you see and so we were working on that and we thought hey this is a perfect opportunity to reconfigure an existing projects and try to get some headlines and that's what we did and it was really fantastic the perfect child sized pods they work whether the biological organism is alive and nods and they just
perfect pre made for resulting their way through an underground tunnel or whether it's and get or whether it's in an undisclosed location where you will see me surface again so you on how do you respond to criticism i mean i mean it's shocking to me that i want to cut you off their it if i might will the way i respond to criticism is by being online all day
long arguing with people on twitter because let me say something i you know a socialist socialist that i'm also a socialist you know i'm a socialist who happens to believe in the power of the markets and extra political power for billionaires some people have said that your this rescue that you did of these children and again they wouldn't have
and rescued without your help
was just simply a publicity stunt to gain get some cheap eat for you in your company publicity stunt that sounds like that
sounds like something that warren buffett in his little troll boys would have put out the publicity stunt is when you have a very doughboy on tv getting poked in you go by pillsbury dough
he done his electrifying and elephant to prove that kind of electricity is not the right kind of electricity which by the way we're going to go on a tour of the united states and canada in the next couple of years and we are going to be electrifying some elephants just to prove actually that
this oldest city vision and tesla battery greed is perfectly operational so it's going to be a positive exercise in electrifying elephants know what we were doing is was saving children with saving children and we went down there
specifically asked by the king of thailand he said he learned i have no plan i don't know what to do and i was communicating with them every day we one face time
and they said you know you going to do this and i'm going to get on the ship this so we have we had we have a little submarines we also have bringing over
boring boring company large drill
in the good news is the boys are out and the thai government has been kind enough to give us the site
of the caves and we're going to use it as a proving ground for tesla for spacex for the company while going to put some more boys down there were unsure what i mean that's obviously down the line but she got engineered first and make sure it's safe and not safe so you know what to allow for
they're all going to be real boys but not before we put in a little boring company time we're going to widen it's just a little bit so you can just comfortably move tube have one child at a time through the tunnel and it's going to be perfectly horrifying attraction people are so impressed with this rescue there are reaching out to you
use your genius and your intellect to solve some of our societies other probably as a on it i see check
i've been seeing a lot of people ask you know on what can you do with your magnificent technology to make the people flint michigan have clean drinking water what do you planning for that so we're talking about the flint michigan and yes sure no problem i can get you drinking water what do you know what do you want do you wanted to be hard water do you want to be with you
want to drink it it's no problem at all the solution is gonna be done with nano computers a whistle we're working on that we're working on that we're working on biologically changing the people of michigan so they don't need the same amount of water
i'm working on installing solar panels in people's stem cells so that they can draw energy from the sun instead of from a hydrogen and oxygen molecules you know this is the stuff of
what were inspired by the work of isaac asimov were inspired by the work of robert heinlein you know were inspired by similar great political think as a south african a lot of other places and we were going to make humanity
lean they're not going to need as much stuff you understand how wow is all i have to say that i'm also working on a deodorant
be a deodorant called the fragrances called deal on musk it's going to go into your armpits and it's going to just buy a logically change your pheromones so the you smell like someone who belongs on more epic sir epic last question
i saw a story in the news today that you are one of the top donors to the republican congressional caucuses reelection funds yes sure is that the problem i'm socialism is socialist who believes in
the revolution of the proletariat through donations to the republicans
i'm playing a game of the holographic chest that you can't wrap your mind around i can wrap my mind around it but like i would expect a lot of a lot of painters on line will be upset by this are saying that it's some sort of hypocrisy on your part but i don't think they understand that you're giving them money
so that when the time comes for them to do right by you and the people of america you can threaten to withhold that money i care about is how they're going to treat the future of humanity and by that i mean how they're going to treat my companies that i'm hoping to make billions of dollars off of look i don't need to all sides i don't know republican i'm nonpartisan
and i donate to all sides i do yes we're working with the republican caucus to get them to support some very important libertarian issues
also donating to receive it
editor want to make sure that turkey
just a cleans out any political elements that get in the way of a massive spacex campus
we we don't have to all sides i'm working with the dutch royal family were working with the saudi royal family obviously we have connections now in thailand we're going to have a massive tunnel underneath bank that may drop it into the mantle of the earth but what will be replaced with will be magnificent
see the vision
but add to ask out sanguine in
the stars through glad
sometimes the route june with the stars
the quickest route causes a straight line between two points sometimes that line points directly through the center of our earth that is why do you must drill our way to the stars mr musk thank you so much cheaper your time
on behalf of those boys rescue from the cave i know they haven't done this to you personally yet so i will do it on their behalf thank you mr musk for saving or were monitoring with them with monitoring like the we we like what they did and so we're going to monitor them in probably kidnap them into an x men program some
time in the next ten years once they've a fully completed as adolescence
and yeah we're gonna we're gonna see if they can survive and those tunnels were going to shoot a minute test look at mars and see if they can survive that what a beautiful vision of the future mr musk thank you so much thank you hold on let me i gotta get into some my engineering right here if you don't mind pull his body out online

you know what that's one hundred percent accurate that's also i'm going to drown myself a toilet so
yeah so again thanks against you unmask for colon and and once again thank you for rescuing all those children they would have died without you
real quick
things started with a a story three
quickly one that's very much and are will house i know our fans love it so much when you talk about fast food franchises and defend the various perfectly disgraced spokespeople for said franchise and i can hear the squealing of the hug from here
papa john of papa john's pizza unfortunately has had to step down as head of the company and head pitchmen for his pizza franchise because apparently only conference call with shareholders they he no he said the bad at the n word the noise
smith in the house hopper that's our word so just just before we get into this week's show i would just like you're trying to have a good time some noise has
the difference between pizza guys
oh yeah i just want to make a pitch at the very beginning of the show for listeners of the show to buy papa john's pizza and then recorded videos of you throwing it in the trash setting it on fire shooting at like skied yeah yeah throwing it on the roof like breaking bad or just like
stock up on like a million of those little the garlic the word all into one big jug and then film yourself just pouring it into the gutter thing is you protest the this shit us he wants the hours to say it that's what he said
so that he was pressured
sometimes i feel that pressure
every day you guys are like know just that you're going to be the one who changes
if everything is that he said it because they were talking about bad pr related to the faces of different franchises and he was talking about and i think he probably is so mad that he had to get promoted for saying oh we're losing pizza share because of the mailing black eyes and he goes well you know
colonel sanders said the n word
that is a real person now
yeah i was always an amazing here it's not just norm macdonald
colonel sanders a fascinating figure he he killed a man
i got a few will he shattered
he killed one day he shot a guy in a in a dispute over over regular restaurants yes he had he had he had a roadside restaurant
and there was a guy who had one like down the road and they were headed whether this this is like the forties or something and he was messing with a sign and colonel sanders came out blue
i don't believe any of the final terms of north yorkshire the forties were also if you're like a like i have killed somebody
chicken shop and you could of
all right we're giving you the toughest sentence we give a white business owner and nineteen forty eight you hit a rock with a hammer for exactly have to wear this straight be out in like an asshole
he stand with a adorable kernels energy does to our money i'd what he was given away and actual military rank in kentucky does that
kentucky kernels is sort of learned that they give yeah it gave hundred s thompson one of it
johnny depp is a real
he isn't from kentucky is from indiana
and he eventually sold the his name and the franchise to what became yum brands but they kept them all as as like a guy who would do they would pay him to come and do little presentations at different like opening became so he has a real colonel sanders and he's wearing the white suit
he's waving and everybody but as he got older and kind of losing his marbles he would go in because they are so when he shot somebody right well though that was just business
he would just wander into kentucky fried chicken restaurants that he didn't own anymore and go in the back and just start by quality and control things like sticking his hand and i mean idea
i hear it hurts them and apparently the corporate world was just if he comes to your store and starts banging around the base in the kitchen just let them
do it and then when he leaves you can clean that's what america is great again when you get abused by elders there isn't an elder abuse
it's the saw i was how many people had their childhoods marred by go into a cave see interests in the senile
potato okay
just fill the colonel fans
dropping shows
you're you're at your table with your family and you got your pocket and sides or whenever he just comes viable exist
sit in the us whistles it around was he was the frank alley and oh kenny rogers
that's what it will sasso oh jerry lewis was burning this movie called the not which is just like one of the higher concept jerry lewis wizards leg or are the guy was kooky
also i said it was easy to be white and kill somebody back then it was so easy to make a movie back then because every movie cost twelve thousand dollars to make it he just had to go into whatever producer did the most way eludes that a be like what if a guy was sort of jewish but in a wacky way and i was jerry lewis his career but he was promoting
there was like a tie and it was when the first high promotions like a k of c and the not promotion
and there's his fame
infamous poster jerry lewis and the colonel jerry lewis was like whoa that not all this chaos say and colonel sanders looks like he wants to take out of fucking fleet lock apollo has such a
it's one of my favorite like how fucking pissed off kernels and really curious
oh my
well before we get you far again too fast food franchises and their disgrace to pitch and
let's let's start to show and will be introduced our guess for this week sitting in his actually feinberg
actually now if you fall ashley and social media and of course you do i wouldn't you
know that you are one of the you eat when it comes to documenting the social media
of the trunk family i think you are one of our finest reporters in that regard and i want to begin by talking about this photo of the trunk family that i saw this week and i literally can't stop thinking about we're going to make it up with the episode art so you'll know you'll know what i'm sorry there's actually two pictures of trunk that i can't stop thinking about this week but this first one i ah
honestly think belongs in like the museum of modern art or something
not museum
as i was going to show to you know i'm sure you sure you saw at the sweeper
yeah that's nice one
different ways the city this where i've had for
have
eric champs senior and junior all
pushing their bras like i mean the thing that's a sign is
think any of them men and tram actually have a man boobs felt like this stand it looks like they're exact as of as a dodger has an hourglass he's a very bluntly figures as to air it actually is that is that dungeon your pre across with the new there's a new picture on his his chest testing is deaf my purse cross
he doesn't know how to handle like new york yeah he was him when he was when you watch him work out he's working out like he's trying to injure himself on purpose so we can assume crossover that is what money
it's just injuring yourself
i was actually talking to someone who went to his cross which him and apparently he brings like his like twenty children with them like half the time and they just run rampant around the cross a gym like for some people take photos of them and like no one really says
like scared because there's a serious serious everywhere but it is a nightmare it's a safe place to place where they barely train people are properly lifting and dropping hundreds of he has
can i get home
that's what you know what i find so uncanny about that photo is that all for them
our standing in ways that are different have each have an individual standing technique there is just so uncanny and inhuman at the same like their arms or out in a weird it reminds me of like in hanna barbera cartoons when people in character would run but they will have their arms perfectly straight down there
looks like he like up player like a young age and like and covered super quickly but it's still like is like totally confident and like balance while
eric's normally better that photo is an anomaly for that yet
dawn senior which lake i always wondered about that if he knew he would be referred to as on senior name he he's he say they want and eight
one of the worst deals
he always stands like he always stands lake he has like this this for area but for thinking he's a minute or
that's actually a very easily just saudis
do you think you can get your mom is
no one has lose again
okay the next one
again just very sorry i can't stop thinking about this ever since i saw this is a form of it kinda sweet from trumps now sort of disastrous trip to the u k which i want to talk about that
i wouldn't have gone but this is a photo of trump sitting in winston churchill's chair and here as i was going to show that you again could you describe it
trump is doing a very classic winston churchill pose yes he has kept his pant legs which i've never seen and i've thought about that a lot of of the past few days at who who did he asked to do that because you can't and down that fire and how long did they cuffed how funny would be if he sees the new tuner someone i mean we asked as i see major yeah so
he is reclining in this old leather chair and he's sitting that way very far back and has his legs crossed and sort of a provocative pose and he has his hand
perched atop his knee and the kind of like the know sex touched
i said when needed his ex
as he's casting casting couch in himself
republicans are going to me to himself or sympathy and i think it's so important he said
i think someone gave him a book or a seminar on all the ways that you can sit or stand when you're fat in a way that doesn't make you appear fat and i think that's what he's doing here he's like a very very high crime
to cover his his girth sitting down the leg is there to your the they suppose english slimming
he didn't have such a stupid brain where he's like the suit is the symbol of business
one all the time he would just be a cafe and guy he would be like homer
yogurt judicial this is terrible but i was singing for the steely dan i was wondering like is is he ever like when he's playing golf is the only time he's not in a suit me like my brain was like what does he dressed like when he's just around the house and then i started thinking like oh yes the shower and then i started thinking about him making about that
yeah we finish our i just imagine him like get it going into the shower closing the door and they coming out in a suit that tries off and then just puts on a suit and
america pair stopping it and it's got to be at least like touches on i think of other constantly yeah i think about this hyper and here i think about the sidebar and hair just lying
he's awful like neon orange pay us
i don't think it i don't think it like it's like low than comes up i think i think it's like his hair is like suicide doors
like the strands there like come in from the
back is squarely bald yeah that's got to spell it all up
he was so cool he is the u k trip like james bond i know who should play
the entire time he was like the newton who like all he will humiliate himself just to protect like bonds in like monetary options and shit and here don't talk about breaks don't know dude he's got it and then the second he gets over there is like drizzle may honestly looks terrible
he wants to put our own and a burger yeah she should be wearing but anyway she is screwing up this deal and jimmy saville would be a wonderful
through the drugs it predicts it is pregnant folks okay that's all there is to it
as big inside when asked them about my favor was his meeting the queen and i gotta say last the cow act rabbit and for china's a gun i genuinely angry and disgusted the queen of england must be to be new york
good so bad
the fucking remembers unfortunate finally die never gonna die it must have been really weird for the queen to meet like stupid spoiled rich influence jeffrey epstein point
like a totally new experience for her
the queen of england is probably never met someone still races his meant more show most and chris hands
no that was incredible to see them walking together it was great but now
obviously like trumps social media presence is well known but i want to talk to you about done juniors was talking about here is sort of like when your favorite character
i have he is like the extent to which all of them are like complete idiots like astounding and to be with without question the dumbest one of of them is like an is is incredible i don't even like who are you done or than eric
or evocative august i think if well yeah august it but like eric looks like a late habsburg prince he's got the job he's got like they have a huge bland someone had face the constant sort of like like he's trying to think of a math problem area just looks like a dollar and yet somehow john jr is dumber than here because he doesn't have not like station
yeah yeah eric leg i mean eric's mouth
seventies desserts words like put chick lit sort a thing of jello
but yeah it just he fooled everyone just looking the absolute dominance but you know don he probably has purchased kevin rudolf singles on
his mom and dad both unfortunately doing like a shithead drugs and i had another the lines but like i'm sure they were more as with first one dungeon it has every to kevin trudeau mega memory book that's libraries and every one of those on is the kind of rich and the kind of dumb guy who thinks he's a smile
guy oh yeah he thinks he's a sly business magnate like his father because it means pinch up here and he also emulates his father and his only real desire that's express constantly is for his father's a faction which makes it so funny that he's the one singled out as one his father who ate
it's the models his mother was if ivana
she's my daughter she's my sister is where i may i may regret eel folks reduced or don't in my family
i make my daughter one of one of the mothers my children another deal of one
the story i think was an avant his memoir about how she tried to like use done junior area
custody chip and yeah i'm going all in to be like i want one hundred percent full custody a done junior and trump was like okay
she was like i don't want to throttle than yeah not
all i love
that's your take someone to take custody of a junior have a child had junior and that after a few hours ago now fuck this scenario was like i'm finally going out of and i am willing to send him back in atlanta downey jr is interesting because in some respects he is superman on krypton which is to say he's his dorm his dad
but his dad has a superpower is the most amazing the most amazing personality type on earth which is that it's like nearly impossible for him to feel embarrassed like he's he looks like shit all the time he's wearing like these his pants local zoo members are so big on him to hide is weird by and for like to feel like you're like yeah
eight the longest zipper in history every day there's like a news report that's like all of this guy's closest friends say he is the dumbest peace initiative alive and as it's made up
is just like everyone sees him look like shit all the time act like a fucking he's like and so good at this a ruse jealous of the and his son like can only feel shame in his son got all the shame of us through his dungeon and believes his dad when he is says everyone loves them any his bro
and like he has no reason to question that didn't have the capacity to understand other childlike yeah well he hated his father for a while according to his classmates at the university of pennsylvania where he was nicknamed diaper don because you piss himself after he got drunk all the time he would find him literally path in the bushes in front of the dorms is that he hated his dad and
college which i mean what really hate this just monster as a twenty story were like his dad as i've taken some baseball game and yeah i can do is draw graham an engineer like not all like stoke like renting and like a yankees uniform and according to like hundred years of college for and he said that tramp
punched him in the face whole new like put a suit on and i is going to go in the car and i will be less of they like saw this i'd even explains a lot i put i mean that's what it's like trump the story daniels like it's like i believe he's like
morally would do that but it's like i can't picture down from having sex i can't picture in my pond and slapping his left leg i get very weak
ever thrown a punch
i i love that story though because it just there's so much going on like the punch takes like mute everything else in the background but it's like this brands re watch it relies new things like you have to wear a suit to the baseball
like that type of the tongue and i donald trump is the first rule of respect his style
pages
has to you if you're going out wear a tuxedo don't care where it is it's like the tragedy of dungeon is that he hated his from all accounts and hated is that for good reason in college and he probably had some fantasy that he was going to be able to break away from his control and become his own man enough to deal with them and then he realized that some point oh no i am
fuck moron i can only exist is a remorse fish suckling off of this corrupt empire and he had the stuff all of that resentment down and just just become his name but i hate pinstripes it's yeah it's like that a brutal well he actually some you catalog a lot of very depressing dungeon
graham yeah want to talk about other guy and
i think it's interesting he always uses the cried laughing about you you fucking loves that mit but it's a tell
with such a good
ours
that's why i'm crying it's brutal it's fucking brutal he everything he probably that thing where it's like you in the stories like he wore a yankees jersey but done junior probably were like a full yankees unified socks up to his knees playing an asshole
how does all full kit lanka because of like some genetic disease he probably got knocked out in one blow by his dad's
and select the most formative moment of his life and it just cried laughing the most you ever since yeah well speaking of cried laughing one are my favorite three lines in the done junior instagram saga is ongoing divorce and relationship with kimberly got cow foil of guilt
while the fox news gavin newsom ex wife what the fuck bizarre
gather going back to our last last week's theme of the show the disgusting incestuous their eyes wide shut like relationship between every rich person they'll do some his pipe assholes

in your coverage of engineers instagram is the sort of like divorce guy motifs that he keeps coming up with the divorce guy bracelet like i remember you should he had he had a zippo lighter with a little insist on the now
got her into school possession of one hundred percent of freaking awesome
what are your what are your some or some other your favorite like dun dun junior divorced guy material and then the thing that baffles me most about him and his yeah he has not followed any like instagram point of cancer and models like he only follows like like giant school rings like and lighters
like my i remember he was like look at me like making a fire and like you like clearly a like for someone to like film him for at least five minutes like building this fire but if you look at the back you can see that there's like two other guys around and i didn't like composed like fire pit and he's like feeling have some like learn how to camp training thing
it's so depressing
he's got train for he's got a train for of being outdoors because he's got to get out all of that aggression against his father on endangered species of
feel anything as my parents are imagining that when he blows elephants brains out it's dancing and that elephant lake
big pussy is the season two it's like that elephant like turns to him
has done seniors facial composure almost and it's like
i came up with the idea for roller rinks on and on credit
actually were you the one who broke the story of you found darn juniors accounts on hunting message board that was so funny to me because even on these message boards people are like your fucking stupid
you may want were his comments are hunting message for there
like a boring like hunting shit and him asking to buy everyone's guys but also

i i never been more happy in my life until other age we did was a better before
okay so moving onto an actual news story from this week
i guess the thing that the picking us troops supreme court pick brett cavanaugh i want to talk a little bit about this guy doesn't not have reject i don't care about him personally and like honestly every time there's a supreme court nomination it's like my least favorite style of news cycle because it's just also wrote knowing
the same thing happens and like mainly what i hate about it
is that we all have to play like everyone in the media and the democrats and republicans all play this game of make believe were like a vacancy they all pretend that they're considering the nominee and that they always talk about whoever it is as this sort of like they're intellectually voracious and just over everything they just love the law
all they love the law more than a table of debating the law writing about the law and it's this like whole kabuki theater where we have to pretend that we don't know exactly especially if it's like a right wing guy from the federalist society like per capita we all have to pretend we don't know exactly why he's being nominated exactly
if you on the supreme court
you know i will keep an open mind i will respect precedent
and you'll see what he says will will know the answers my question
and committed here and i just like it really doesn't matter i hate it so much and i'll tell you exactly why does doesn't matter
it's like a little bit about this is a piece that was in the daily beast this week it was very good piece by jay michaelson about this guy named leonard leo who is like the
kappa oh of supreme court appointments for the right he's this federalist society june
i want to talk a little about the sky in light of the cavanaugh nomination reading from this piece jade michaelson rates here
at the center of the network is leonard leo of the federalist society the association of legal professionals that has been the pipeline for nearly all trumps judicial nominees leo is on leave from the federalist society to personally assists trump and picking a replacement for justice anthony kennedy is formal title as executive vice president but that role belies leo's influence
directly or through surrogates use place dozens of life tenure judges on a federal bench effectively controls the judicial crisis network which led the opposition to president obama has nominee judge merrick garland heavily influenced the beckett fund law firm that represented hobby lobby and it's successful challenge of contraception and now supervises admit
guns and hires at the george mason law school newly relieved in memory of justice antonin scalia leonard leo was a visionary this is it really important leonard leo is a visionary said tone carter who served on leo's media relations director when he was chairman of the us commission on international religious freedom in an exclusive
you he says he figured out twenty years ago that the concert conservatives had lost the culture war abortion gay rights contraception conservatives didn't have a chance of public opinion prevailed so they needed to stack the courts and that's exactly what he's been doing with great success it goes on to talk about
he's be was responsible for the picks of a lido gossage and now cabinet and roberts to and they all share with him a arch catholic fundamentalism this guy's a member of the knights of malta hoo boy and his it says here leonard's faith is paramount to him carter said when he traveled staff members had to
find a church near wherever he was staying three kids attend mass every day
again this is why it doesn't matter this is why everything you read about brett cavanaugh does it matter this is the only thing that should be discussed in this context in that using other right wing religious fundamentalists who is being put on the court to roll back the last fifty or sixty if not one hundred years
frank haven't wanted the massive a know this was but brick oven are going about to find out is also bruises
and a carpool we're going to get there but i'm sick like
the real the context with which this nomination or any nomination by republican president should be viewed as part of a highly organized and disciplined and ruthless in a way almost admirable if it weren't so evil
attempts to stack the courses people who are reliable ideologues who will vote to overturn roe v wade the overturn the right to privacy which underdogs the right to abortion and contraception
return every labour law and basically as i described it earlier this week if you have a right that you think is foundational to your dignity and existence as a human being get ready to have a given to either a private corporation or religious authority because it's not going to be yours anymore it's going to be theirs
that being said everything i read other than this this week about cavanaugh was about what a great guy he is yeah guys are going up on is a good dude
anyone who's asshole kid got a clerk ship from him says he's wonderful yeah everyone at the raytheon acres bridge game league they do the bridge tournament
aids that's not good enough for three hundred four hundred however many people live in this country to figure it out
that's not good enough for them
we just not have reports i will you want yeah really do not want nine fossilized psychopaths determining whether you live or die is at the world you won't recognize the yankees an
we can get him to start doing crossover
i mean i have
that his his ideas but he is the supreme court justice
most look like steve little from is bound to happen
i'm not gonna go and for
also it's interesting the new york times had a piece liberal case for cavanaugh and that shit a two minutes after the exact all means that everyone on that short list they had a fuck yeah
written this guy is actually great article by some liberal who is somehow incestuous related to them either they're fucking three year long at all
tottenham at school or their stupid kid is the clerk some way connected to them where that person being on the supreme court raises their status that's what that's why they think these guys are great that's because him being on the supreme court reflects well on them or their family here
here's a perfect example of that are in the wall street journal cavanaugh is a mentor to women this is by amy child the the tiger
yeah tiger mom for those you don't remember it's a book about being a furry parent
no nope
a series of identical articles and i'm gonna share a couple of them all sketched out this idea that where they basically say i don't know how he's going to ruin the court nor do i care you know way he's a wonderful man and he's like a role model for young women again like and this is all very calculated because the really the main issue with this is that they're finally going to have a major
already to overturn roe v wade which i fully expect them to do so they want and you want you to talk about anything other than that and the way they're going to do it is by appealing to the bra sensibilities about what a good guy is you know how he believes that like you know what women in the workplace or whatever as want to read here from from amy
he writes judge bread cavanaugh jurisprudence will appropriately be discussed in the months ahead i'd like to speak to a less well known side of the supreme court nominee his role as a mentor for young lawyers particularly women the qualities he exhibits with his clerks may provide important evidence about the kind of justice he would be i've gotten to know this side of judge cavanaugh lost
irving on yale law schools court ships committee for the most of the past ten years it also affects me personally last year my daughter accepted an appellate clerk ship from judge cavanaugh which is set to begin next month while in addition know there's no man that has been as good a mentor to young woman since charles manson
know on one hand like the fate of hundreds of millions of women and reproductive rights on the other hand someone is going to enable your daughter to become is repulsive the human being is you like really wins here i think it's interesting that it is the tiger mom this she she's this like she she became fame
because she wrote a book about how to like psychopathic the abuse your children so that they can play the violin real good but her most recent book is about her tribalism is tearing america apart and i think it's interesting here that she's just like bread cavanaugh what do i know about him i don't know he gave my daughter a job
this big a puff piece on him and the wall street or all that those tell you what they mean what she and other people mean by tribalism as people having any kind of ideological commitments because it's just the world is a big country club it's a big it's a big network of of glad handing and mutual back patting back scratching and anybody who
who wants to disrupt that is being tribal i mean to hurt her big endorsement of cavanaugh is that she wasn't worried that he was fucking had daughter which is like yeah
this is the end it says these days the press for stories about powerful man exploiting are abusing female employees that makes it even more striking here judge cavanaugh as female clerk speak of his decency and his role as a fierce champion of their careers
judges confirmed my daughter will probably be looking for a different clerk ship but for my own daughter there is no judge i would trust more than brett cavanaugh to be in one form or clerks words a teacher advocate and friend it's good that tiger on here
is very concerned about powerful men exploiting are abusing their employees which break haven't i will make officially legally
has no right to redress against sexual harassment in the workplace but yeah i know of course he's not gonna fucking
do sexual harassment and anybody it's hard to do that when you wrap your dick and horse haired fucking apart
liar liar because you're an arch catholic psychopathic sure the fuckin albino monk from the da vinci code
so i i
financial statements on facebook
someone posted something some us in this to me
the name but i'm post on facebook that anyone who went to georgetown law school in two thousand and ten would have been very surprised to learn you married
and i mean like i can mean one million different days but like a
maybe it means
played with his friends real late at night it's like all but don't you can hear you
again i mean i just go back to that line about the leonard leo guy and this like incredibly well funded by dark money right wing groups that it is just like plotting to they understand that they are immoral minority that wishes to exercise a veto power over everyone else in this country they know they can't win politically
so they love the supreme court because it's a lifetime tenure with which they can you know like they're all like hold over law and authority in this country
see why the supreme court should be abolished but just keep that in mind these people understand there are moral minority but they have no problem loading on democratic power over the rest of the country
next article this is this is the worst one this isn't the washington post and it's almost identical to the one that appeared in the wall street journal
i don't know cavanaugh the judge but cavanaugh the car pool then why great guy
yeah that's him
so sick of hearing about these people fucking liar know it's important because it's part of the job of the most because you know they say that the most junior supreme court justice yes the close the door
has and then get coffee and pick up everyone one of america's kids so i need to know how he is a carpool that this is by julie o'brien in the washington post and the article begins and a little like just lets you know julio private lives in chevy chase if you don't a chevy chase maryland is from one of the most evil
zip codes of this country it's literally all of the new york on iraq war architects live on like the same block and it's also where chevy chase
there is there
if like i had pick any place in america that as a yellow king ceremony
a chevy chase there's just such a dark energy go there yeah everybody everybody lives there
and they're fuckin clause that they've got an unexplained black robe
well cavanaugh will it will have an explanation of her hands
okay so that are a room to work again and how embarrassing
okay so this began julio brian dawkins here much has been written about brett cavanaugh us presidents stroke nominee for the supreme court
that fact same fucking lead why do you why do you even know who they do it i know horses
i'm always it for soccer now i don't think it's a stretch to think that like these people are just giving like forms your idea is weird leonard leo satirize like the in today's society
certified that has i don't even think it's that i just don't think these people like try that hard i think it's like for them it's ridiculous to think that anyone would not like the guy from their car poor who gave their friend a job
well you know there are many judges in america i mean all they needed like a public endorsement of this feature supreme court justice to have his air like when you become justice so she writes
much has been written about but the discussion is focused on his record is a federal judge and his in his legal career i wonder why i'd like to talk about him as coach k like the one it also university this coach k is also a mentor to student athletes who love basket and isn't repellent shit in scumbag
coach k but his players are sixth grade girls
ret breaths older daughter in mine have been classmates at blessed sacrament school a small catholic school in the district for the past seven years on evenings and weekends your link that you're likely to find bread
at low at a local gym or athletic field encouraging his players or watching games with his daughters are friends he coaches not one but two girls basketball team hopes and because his positive another wedding
i was erected
his positive attitude and calm demeanor make the game fun and allow each player to shine the results have been good this season he led the blessed sacrament school sixth grade girls team to an undefeated season and a citywide championship in the local catholic youth league to the parents of players on the squad it's no surprise that the team photograph
with the trophy is displayed prominently in his chambers right next to a photo of him shaking hands and grinning with pinochet
a father
opus day founder who had like six kids that he us
i am just i gotta say it's not read your main this article or care of on himself like in the catholics and calm down with what they named their schools
fuck in school this is bloody now is that ackerman
to get ulcers and
metal marianne rules i think they need to cool it
you are you prefer
a protestant names and are like friendly hands
also no one noticed a lot of positive attitude
heavenly gate l l c
corporate religious like yeah of course your kids are going to grow to be like ambitious judicial freaks like a colonel bloody destiny lower school like the man
brits contribution to our schools community extends beyond the sidelines he and his wife actually support their two daughters and other national in
i should disclose that
support their children are countless school and church functions throughout the year
they don't could count them in the summer bread is the car pool dad often shuttling students to and from practices games that activity made how many had to either in there during the summer
well as this guy find a job i didn't realize it
get back to work on his father
show for a really good competitive stations of the cross
lift
it's also like i like oh this is like a reason why would be good judges like he helps
his daughters be can do whatever you can only knows how to drive get it he said
kids can get a little spicy here i think all the stuff about that he's he coaches to sixth grade girls basketball teams i think this is all coded message this is all like code to the people who are like in the sec they're like what they're saying his folks he's really dedicated to disciplining and policing the bodies and too
i'm sorry what i'm going to say either i don't think if you're an adult man you should be coaching sixth grade girls teams yeah we have like catholics can't coach basketball teams anyway because they can't tell the girls drawn suicide
brett is a steady presence at his daughters events even if it means racing across town just to catch the last fifteen minutes of a game or lime the team isn't enough
that is not count and mark for bread
yeah fest
it goes breaths friendship and mentorship have touched my family and and especially personal way a few years ago my husband died what are the most difficult aspects of
however many
one of the many difficult aspects of that loss was that my daughter had no one to accompany to accompany her to the schools and your father daughter dance that first year in every year since my husband's passing brett his step forward to take my daughter to the dance alongside his own so he's seeking to daughter
someone else his daughter to the fathered rather bread gave my daughter her first chance to my my dad died and i gonna say that the last thing i would ever want is for literally anyone else to take me on one of those direct dancers and i would feel wage and going to have to say now is this seems like cruel thing to do anything i mean my dad was twenty one and bread cavanaugh it's
i have kind of weird i like i'm not even a girl
there's no doubt that is also
i admit it was heartwarming when you see them in a step out on a desk for that first time for that special dance to the song from eyes wide shut
not the athletes chanting during sex ritual that's only a daring if he goes to the dance wearing his judicial robes holding a gavel and he says things like motion for upon
oh
another say there are filed father died dance is every area
what age thirty
get married sad effect until you get married
catholics have to relocate i'm now becoming a zionist work i was against them at the start of the segment but now i realize have been infected by protestantism oh through ah doesn't junk know it's trying to get out of an absolutely this doesn't happen in the vatican because they don't acknowledge their daughter don't clip that i'm just giving you
it's not offensive
this t pain song overwrought
oh man so yeah i was delightful virgil
it just finished up here i'll leave it to others to gauge judge cavanaugh his qualifications but in writing this yeah
all he did for others the judge actual qualifications
but he says but as someone who would bring his work the traits of personal kindness leadership and willingness to help when called on him he would receive a unanimous verdict in his favor
i like oh shit like literally doesn't matter if he's a good guy or all that's important is how you will yeah
as part of the supreme court which we know that guy who put them on the court is a member of the knights of
all of this is coated it's for gullible liberals who do read the wall street journal up ads
and to tell them look there's no way he's going to overturn roe v wade the coaches and girls' basketball team
now that i mean that is all of these are are geared towards professional and you're right it is obviously coordinated they're there to soften opposition among liberals among people who already have soft enough heads to begin with and way to soften them a little more because there's nothing more than than through imagine their their leaders as
regular people and evaluate them as suction and just think of not think of them in terms of these replaceable cog in a political machine that is determined by the interests of the parties but as free individuals who who who rule and vote based on their inner character
find the find the vine that and you'll know how they're going to rule and how they're going have now we're going we know how they're going to vote as we know how pissed a feels about roman sexual and religious minority the twentieth century vatican two labour control
era cycles and as not overturn roe v wade have fun out of girls to coach
one of those memes that's like a basketball player
not turning point
third of the league
placid virgin summer day care
i mean again
oh we say it all the time
but this is why i'm such a good president
he there literally no stories of him being noticed his kids
only one and he just one on his own merits of will try to write a story like this about donald ulcers and being super nice to have aga
he's the man i had a really bad one
donald trump is that you're dedicated father he started a home school wrestling with a bunker
i did on
damn don't clip
they always have a way to trick you
like you were talking about these
the federal societies yeah conservative legal group and how profoundly successful the yeah getting their nominees through to you know rather different republican presidents are just the sheer amount of power dedication they have within that are it's not just the supreme court it's like every other
and like the federal society we exist like basically just groom the next generation of black eyed psychopaths to like you know eviscerate that is probably the greatest power within the republican coalition right now
obviously there are liberal legal groups of society's by the obviously can exert that level of devotion or influence in the democratic party because of a could they would have never gotten alina kagan on the supreme korea sort of my or yeah sure but here's the other thing like a day i get our act was admired despite how he
it is the fact that they're not afraid it all of the fact that like i said that there are moral minority that wishes to use power to exact their vision of the conflict their vision or the world on everyone else i gotta say that's kind of the point of
level so you kind of have to admire them if they were also evil and should be not having having a zillion dollars to do it really how in the daily beast article it does it by the end of it it's a very good article i recommend you read the whole thing but it a talk about how it's very hard to say who funds all this but we know for sure that the koch brothers in the mercer yeah speaking of packs of like
the fact that like just suspiciously all these articles are ready to go like literally the mini cavanaugh his name was announced
here's what i was wondering number one
if when obama got kagan and sort of my or
do you remember reading in any venue the conservative case for my
no i just the she was a dumb bitch that's yeah yeah she's a dumb what he's doing identity
grills or yeah i know there was a further away and there was a zillion up and about her completely and dying comment about being a wise latina like augur like the doom of american culture and yeah
i am for him
pat buchanan was on tv and his face was just bright red and steam machine out of his ears and he was firing two pistols at his feet and hovering above the ground he was so pissed about the wise latina thing i remember that and get it's because she's the best just regard and yeah she is wrong
any better than kagan and i'm sorry and urge
yeah
dude i don't know man
yeah i hear what if there's like a nine hundred year old jewish woman
get this she's similar to black rapper
what about why our you
you take her initial okay
got it you know it's our be are luigi are be okay how does that sound like
ziegler
i was going to say chief justice keith
gee that's a rose most you display
gotta be emulated fucking chief justice gives quote
quote weeding washington post malone
i got so many of us on anybody
then here's another example of a reason you didn't read any of those articles that were like i've been in the federalist society my home address
dedicated my life literally to are turning back all social progress made over the last hundred years but here's why sort of my are such a good person yeah at least be considered you read those articles because those people are fucking stupid yeah they're very successful at getting what they why unlike their their opponents and garland was not
donated use of milk toes beige ass fucking room temperature milk ass motherfucker center right mother fucker
white dude but he nominated him because i thought well they want to check him and they'll give him the same sort of benefit of the doubt that these people do both have another way like while america island is he's on the same circuit as cavanaugh he's been there are no longer and they would think like oh no the conservative case for given
garland because you know he talked about with the idea was amazing fucking softball coach and i know like the idea was with with garland it was like we're going to get nominated guy so moderate that they'll really look foolish if they tried zappa like they'll although the cradle not real bad
extremely didn't win an election like two years before by being like we're going to turn want
lake that everyone know they were not benefit of gerrymandering this dark money network you can't like if they had been explicitly running on since two thousand and ten were absolutely out of our minds i mean them that over the one thing that would have been a good move
much as hunter ever got here was that they nominated trumps sister because she didn't like she's actually a liberal judge like they they like said no to that because his trump off well that would have pissed off
that's true
what a very much because you know they had a very game plan and they were very well funded and they had of cards and denying garland the seat there was nothing anyone could really do about it once they decided that they were going to ignore those norms and then the really nothing to be done i mean really the criticism of obama and those guys is really just that they
nominated garland in the first place someone who know and on earth could get excited for and then just kind of didn't pointed out because they assumed they were going to win
they didn't think it was going to matter that like well
in and then she'll show know garland up again
yeah yeah i remember a few months even after the nomination where it was clear that grassley mcconnell would refuse to hold hearings at the demand wasn't a points approve girl of his records the man was just hold the hearing and garlic would go around capitol hill and like they will moto op's with democratic senators
and just just you know you know the smiling grinning their legs crossed talking to each other and thinking when this kills on the front page of the washington post mcardle will look so bad
people have made this mitch mcconnell there's no real like democratic equivalent to mitch mcconnell of his entire thing is like yeah i hate me fucking want good
my voters and going to vote me out
it was a little i read as a client
but just from like it there was someone who said it i didn't you at tangiers
you are not to get you know my guess
happens every time in canada at the tangiers hotel did you not promised me that i was never your guest you will never my gosh i can't you i don't coffee at least two or three times a month at the tangiers i'd like to answer though this time
i was present at that dinner fuck harry reid to his credit that character is unfair because read actually punched to guy on f b i surveillance you're trying to bribe and unlike his counterpart
harry reid was a little bit like someone who
had better politics and the read i'm not saying like i expect like you know someone to come out there and be like mitch mcconnell but for like socialize in trance i mean like every little am but like just someone who from like just doing the stuff the democrats even say in their website even that sub standard stuff if they were just would go that far
it could yeah it could be it
will never be chuck schumer ever it will never be any hoyer it will never be any mother would you rather than your other problems that the whole like most of the are gonna caucus is totally rotten and the republicans march in lockstep become only has to deal with what maybe to hold outs one because he's right you insane and the other because she was prime
hurried and is still bitter of audio visual
like it's very very unlikely maybe it's very unlikely that the democrats even if they were entirely unified could start a bernie sanders with the majority leader how much legislation do you think he can pass out of that said it even if he does all the procedural trace source to get to fifty one exactly and like look the best i mean the best we can hope for from these
they provide a united front and loudly and angry
have some fucking firing knew about be clear and honest so the american people about what this actually means no governor has got to three democrat votes how easy life hands and mansion have already said it so yeah
all boring anything truly incredible in his basement think that the baseball yeah there's some weird shit going on in their ass of thank you for reminding me about that the baseball ticket thing is so funny he
the headline where it was like cavanaugh when thousands of dollars in debt buying baseball two hundred thousand
it was two hundred thousand dollars that he spent on nationals this all baseball's you take to take unspecified people because you baseball games and current unspecified number of time yet which i gotta say like imagine the fucking goals that he was born there
look like as exists
they did they had no proof like the only thing he wasn't even i
home and forth
yeah early in the russian personnel records that are you don't have to provide proof that this is actually what the money was for he didn't have to name who they are like i can't imagine why the white house would come out and downstairs like and unless it was like seem like they're being super transparent about something that's actually like him looking like buying hobo kill or something i don't know
he went to these games
druids of games or he just bought the tickets for he bought my ticket apparently like it's like ticket packages like you can only in and fourteen it off a real fast he took he took the whole basketball team
well nationals games and you beard costs of based on it
one thousand i mean if a quarter million dollars i seriously
no it isn't just my fucking nefarious thing were easily it's like some complicated byzantine scheme more like the seals merc pays him for like a ruling words okay for puppy should kill the firstborn your kid is the bible time yeah exactly but that was the one story if he just was
going into debt because you love going to be
those those that would be okay about in the car bullshit like that's cool
i got out would be like from wisconsin the nobody knows only way
yeah i mean just so he's probably gonna be on the supreme court
the baseball think it would be a good example of how a company in opposition party could potentially make a big deal out of like imagine if sotomayor or a million dollars and weird thing is he's probably going to be on the supreme court as i've outlined i think i think we know how he's going to roy and if it's you know women's rights civil rights of labor
aids environmental protection of any kind right probably won't be even a single square miles of land in this country that will be opened up to like the oil and natural gas realigning industries
if your job poisons you knowingly you'll probably not have any legal remit to sue the minimum wage minimum wage or probably out on
death penalty for striking know yeah i mean labor laws are ready got fucked by this court but it's going to get we were so i want to want to close out by saying like we know where this is going we know
going to happen i think it's intolerable i think the democrats should absolutely start laying the groundwork now to as we've talked about packing the court abolishing it out right i mean that's the dream but that has a yeah yeah i mean however that
phantom just the pragmatic position at this point is packed the core problem
words put it in a ideal position abolish for fucking court and said by the way i guess i know a lot of a lot of people go in like oh you want to pack the court will next other republicans going to they'll just patently that anyway
just keep going back and forth like that itchy and scratchy very affluent bigger and look amazing
anyway
it all started for like an ox we're going to have the right thing and i go fuck just keep doing that until every american is a member of the supreme court
now at our our people are still playing they gotta have the fuck supreme court cases determined in like yankee stadium
not not not don't the point is contrary like i mean in the baseball tickets thing as a good example of this as well as the deep deep dark money that funds all of this this idea that the supreme court justices live in this like magisterial castle of the law untainted by political roads yeah is an absolute fantasy these guys are political actors and operative
and that is why they are being given this authorities that they can act of political guy has earned enough in a fucking cave his whole life and he's being called to service he was in the fucking bush white house yeah that was the other funny thing is when he worked for ken starr he definitely thought a president could be impeached and then lo and behold he discovered as soon as you started working for a republican white house
you doesn't work so hard that's what he said he said they work so hard and it's so hard to work for the white house that i just don't think it's constitutional to ever prosecutor yeah he's added crimes i if people have credit him with growth and willing to admit he was wrong
because when there was a democratic president he was trying to get have been paged he thought that that was the presidents were liable to courts and then you know what it's just such it's such a complicated job you can't be distracted but that kind of stuff wow he had he had a real come he had a real growth moment there instead of just it's all being absolute opportunistic horse shit with
no fucking underpinnings of any kind of meaningful
principal for me in closing like we know where this is going like this
his ass holes are going to be with us the next forty fifty sixty years deciding what rights we can and can't
if that's the case forget the democrats what they should or shouldn't do with back and record for everyone else
you need to start preparing yourself now to break the law and create be sort of networks of support and solidarity to continue or whether it's abortion or unions are striking
if you build build now the social and political networks to carry on as if this didn't matter because because i'm sorry living under these people is intolerable no person should have to submit it wouldn't be a civil enjoy it
you should now and the only way to live as a human being with dignity and as a citizen of this country is to start is going to be breaking the law
providing of providing abortion services in the states that are going to make it legal that's a first step but there's many many other things
for example they are going to require individual citizens many of us to consciously break the law
well i think labour for example with they're trying to go back to the explicitly trying to repeal the entire new deal that's the whole concept and how did the new deal get put their in the first place because of massive illegal action by by by unions by by militancy by sit down strikes with were not legal by violating judicial restraining orders and
things like that and wildcats and things just general
outlaw unionism and then then it was and then the new deal existed and it kind of
co opted the labor movement into the framework of the wagner at and of the labor relations board and it's well if you're going to get rid of that then you're gonna have to bring back the same kind of disregard for legal niceties that prevailed before those mechanisms came into play and if you are one of the supposedly good billionaires who are
the broad don't like this
start creating the same kind of networks now not just for the courts but start donating your money to have a huge pool of resources available to provide legal counsel and bail and protection for peace for people who do break the law
well we're not going to see that because most of them this is going to be good and they're going to be happy for it anyway
my closing thoughts on cavern on the supreme court
yeah now
for the definite immediate future democrats are still going to think this is a sparring match and that they can only hit as hard as they want to be head while they repeatedly get knocked out by seventy three year old man with wimp bone
they were his own sorry
but for everyone else
those aren't rules
so in conclusion recognize that land of many con
on one hand will make this country of ours was on the other hand he helped like thirty girls all named mackenzie
bloody down managed to eternal life know they're not donkey
probably makes them all like dress up like larry bird
the fundamental drill valley
has passed
that who are your favorite basketball players larry bird on stockton
kevin mchale bob cousy tony to oh he's like i don't want any dribbling on the masses just passes bounce passes only yeah brick oven like his of like all the other coaches or do lake doing like says
hi i'm roots and he's just having them like throw medicine balls that each other
like this is a good old fashioned work up for their ruined the game
protestants
you know as well when you're talking about abortion rights and roe v wade it's really fundamentally a class issue because some face like brad cavanaugh if he happened to live in a post rose state that had or band abortion on demand
and his basketball player mckenzie daughter got knocked up he could always pay for a plane ticket to new york or where abortion is legal republicans have always always always always all caregivers in every nation it's going and obviously in a post roll country it will be harder for people have less
means to do that is well it's harder for them to get abortions today so you don't really have to wait to finance support organizations that pay for abortions that do abortions
lock them out look them up we've mentioned if few on the show in the past go and and the post the receipts whatever you encounter someone like deplorable derby your big fat piece of shit out of magazines
he did you don't need it in there are donating their name and then tell them to buy the book by there are there are
there are parts of texas
was not an abortion provider within six hundred miles which makes it essentially de facto illegal for anybody he doesn't have the money to be able to travel yards or so
yeah that about sums it up for this way ashley feinberg thank you so much for joining yeah
as a blast a please keep us posted on the antics of a truck family the hosts were created an atheist
next i can't wait till they all spend the night of the busier
the holocaust museum














good
can you hear that silence sounds as the as romantic or and virgil texas who are moving in together because they're married gotcha you hear about
we have today me feel to be roman christmas and hi i am barely first yep
so where permutation it's we've never done this permutation and i think it happened yeah i was prepared for this permutation was
point use with andrew because they didn't get a single when i say up you are a win and you know they say sometimes it's not your night
the new year
i've got a new white rap stars after careless in the mindset where he goes very yeah this is how white backpack rap or to rap about you corporate fortnight
grogan got like it's fortnight my plate it's a law called a pork knife
swimming with called my black swan of
yeah i'm pumped out now
works it works ready for this fucking pod cast him and berg that's about to explode all over ear drums because we have no idea how this is going to work
hi everybody
fuck
another thought said always harder time than that
chocolate smeared children
he had his or her father who keeps us
by being disciplined and reading us to help her and scary that away
it's utterly sex is to say that i ever keep anyone in line
now you're just another one of the grubby urchins running around go after all it's not urgent there is like wills or stern younger father and we have a bavarian arms were naturally like little chocolate
enter dad's in the franco prussian war
words words pop or more sweet
he's like i can't wait to send you to artillery school
ers but also with like weird bad habits like pie remaining and
yeah a world where like ralph whigham and odor will fuse together the frontal fly machine the duality of crowds
heroes it is episode man it's like talking to me it's not even just fucking amazing we have a good show he says well it's amazing that like you know i haven't burned down the building i live in yet another like mine and on that started with hundreds of to death
by putting gonna cigarette
i really am i will go out i don't like some dead now i honestly honestly i'm shocked that he lived for a year and that rockabilly building without doing a crispin one everyone else
well they didn't have a fitness plan for me though the song canadian just dragging them down the elevator the didn't work in that building to the
like you i can you imagine is i mean it's not surprising given up giving up some one of my favorite
do you like massacre started never completed
well giving up his saintly underrated i love having have a rule stare a lot of things that
you get even less than halfway through and like this is it bad idea and yet
that kind of american mindset is like now you will get the white whale take i'm steven any out though to that you should quit certain well i've actually have literally done this or quit something so earlier quitting quitting and i see the test through
just miss time i quit as whatever the metal gear stream like the audio didn't work and i like i was like immediately outdoors like thought this would never going to fucking do this
fucking work but i quit so early that i was like for quitting
see this through and were he would have been more work to slow them down and him exactly exactly
so that's like to any athletes at remembered coach showered friday night lights will lisa he said
every man will have a fight over fight that he loses what's important is that he doesn't lose himself so want to lose this episode but we're not going to lose ourselves now we're gonna go down guns blazing absolutely
noble that a martyr stuff yeah i remember be like slim pickens on the back of the now carriers okay so we because wilson out here we have very well prepared we didn't really think about this at all workers have planner so we just show up
we do have a few subjects to talk about this week
before before we put this out here and and hope that the show still goes afterwards
and today we wanted to wish a few people congratulations i think that maybe the theme for this week's show is just graduated a few her favorite people and institutions in this country for the great job doing three in mind the first being tim cook an apple which this week became the first company in
history to have a market valuation of one trillion dollars i it's it's difficult to overstate how much money that is it's like when you go to see the grand canyon except it's instead of being overwhelmed by by the scope and iberia it's just it's just a giant pile of evil
it's really difficult to fathom one trillion dollars yeah it's like one of those ancient the cigarettes made of human corpses
it's astounding it's two thousand times one billion
that's a little math
that is that shirt way to have another no do that's true how any advanced math that's not but yeah
it's an insane amount of money and amber as you pointed out a hide it all ireland well also who's the company started by the company started by someone who tried to stop the rapidly dividing cells in his body from suicide bombing his life by do shit with
capri sun it's it's completely it's completely baffling that people are constantly talking about how stupid this man it's sort of noble because steve jobs like you imagine that like he was at bohemian grove and they were like we have like seven infant spines we can give you yeah he's
i'll put a cucumber is over my eyes i am i'm yeah that we are always talking about how stupid insane incredibly rich so called visionaries on his i mean i think it's kind of a reflection of our simpler and piety in some ways it's i think it's sort of a throwback i think it's very few
i mean who's the chinese emperor who thought if he took small doses of mercury everyday would make him more and that was something machiavelli
course hero he wrote the book art war
outdoor
now size own ago as i am at this last night with angela and she's like yeah i pay like point zero zero two percent of attacks and ireland because they hide it all and like shell companies in ireland ireland like it skipped industrialization it went from a sheep and bob to silicon v
got nothing in the middle there are no factory and like of their liberal class loves it too they like were modern as they're getting just fucking fucked by attack and the stack and were like a real european country now it's like you fucking loser skill that kill them and take their money and like the last financial crisis just poking holes them
oh yeah only only they turned it into their only big industry like as a tax shelter and like secondary great financial city outside of london and after that they're like well this can literally never happen again yeah just as reliant on and even more they have one of those tax policies that usually only like formally
colonized caribbean island nations with like thirty people on them halfway they out to has ports where they sell passports to like pick up artist said that they can hide their bank accounts i mean i know you know there are easy to make fun of an all white and such but they are colonial they work early oppressed by
they're basically the same as those caribbean nations they were taken over by the british and got it and destroyed and now they're just trying to rob a few bucks together using the financial sectors are kindling it's so it is fascinating it is legitimately fascinating how much liberals are vulnerable to insecure
he's like obviously there's that there's a lot of
you know backlash against like tech and exploitation among among the irish who are actually have i think that our class politics generally and americans but they're liberals are just so obsessed with like being a modern country they've completely internalize i guess what the english lot of them was just like a bunch of like bog people that were like civilized
slightly by the catholic church i blame angela's ashes because if anyone remembers a book it was prepared no one remembers that everyone present but i would hope so it was a huge huge hit while we're not on longer watches like you and and it was not in that particular book in america for a while and it was just about these suits smeared orphans
in limerick
go or whatever and it was i think a lot of the irish people are like now and what had happened we're going to turn this place in tech made a haven
i'm not going to be laughing at us when we all have like
ltd screens in our tank pubs
but now they're find out they have the tax shelters and i also have a red heart real estate market and as we all know that is a ticket to non stop and ever expanding well nothing the fire economy just get any kind of for action whatsoever
obliterate like any kind of protection you might have for your ever expanding service sector it's just all fire economy just real estate you can i mean they're rank crisis is as bad as ours now financial care and you pay that much to live in toppling it's basically a farm financials cannibalism source in
rented global real estate bubble somehow like that's the most amazing shit over and this is fucking incredible they can keep our eyes that he will know i commute from madrid to dublin or something like for a long long time it was absolutely unimpeachable receive was that there was no such thing as even within one can
a single housing market early regional markets and there was you couldn't have an entire country have a bubble or whatever and they're like fuck that will see that and create an entire world
real estate market never done before you think about it so irish to wake up late sleep through industrialization common job financial of the hyper financial as age what i was here
whoa i caught him but i understand that they'll come out a lot of them
right next to and have a very deep complicated relationship and inferiority complex and resentment of of the u k
the center of european finance capital right there in london they got that big pickle you know the big green pickles
the pickle wreck building
when you call yeah
and they look like folk i one one of them what to one of them and totaling i get the stuffy and left me that big spike in the middle which is nice because you can never get lost in the thirty square speed of dublin with that thing random and on we are actually do loved up on literally is literally a city full of the best people at the bar
you walk around it and the you honestly get the impression that all the buildings are made of gingerbread oh it's adorable like you could just start nibbling on them and and legs deeply yeah it's or and we make fun of them for everything but a lovely people
shockingly attractive i mean a h poorly it's like a go to bed silly and murphy and wake up like steve pan and
but very cute very charming always very like it is weird as a new yorker to go to dublin and be like how people just like talk to you with a bar here yeah that's true that was where there was a weird experience say they just genuinely benevolent and friendly and then
it reaches a certain hour of the night they start shoving each other it's a great time and they've been nice enough to help create this unprecedented tech behemoth
there was created as we said by the juice the juice man steve jobs
and i think that the question of how we have to think it's the same thing reason people insist the dunk trump is a good businessman
the juice man had to have been a genius because otherwise
this whole thing is just a push button
exploitation apparatus that any of if they're in the right type time and place can take advantage of someone saying what if we made it smuggler yeah i don't want over there is no buttons on it
well the night he is nice but the real the real whole place where the margins come in is creating the suicide met slave army to build the shit that's where you actually make the money not deciding shouldn't have a fucking partner
but those things have to be the product of like a will have to it is it's futile and it's even deeper than that it's like is like
the original nose
civilizations were with the god emperor were you know no one who had a building that big and and we could command armies and large could be just a mere regular asshole again we don't feel you know admiration for these people we feel like piety for
absolutely and of course of and mosque thing is though is the mayor possible true of that this guy who not only is a genius but according to a lot of his friends literally save civilization they have put all of their hopes for the survival of this species on the pickle rick billionaire like the reddit the
edit mean guy the epic bacon billionaire is in their minds the only thing standing between us and annihilation
i mean how do you even get out of the bed in the morning if you actually thought that you think wow those climate change looks pretty scary
might be a problem and then you look at and musk
treating you know fucking links to big bang theory episodes and he really likes and you know we'll be ok folks were going to do it was the health thing that the deeper we go the more we become a feudal society and this is just this is perfect it's it's perfect
we can actually name anything that you on most kids ever done
though we think is impressive because you actually look ok he made electric car but costs four hundred and eighty nine thousand dollars
constantly recalled and socks up all the time he blew work with smother asshole to like come up with a credit card processing system online basically and then everything else purely theoretical but because he is to be anointed sign epic science guy he's going to sex it same with steve jobs steve jobs is like
he didn't invent watershed you invented the dumbest shit in the world which is being attacked executive who takes lsd it is like
oh my god i saw garden he taught me how to increase efficiency
but he mostly just benefit of the creations of other people and and was like i invented this same thing about this now
like whenever on the geopolitical finance like landscape or whatever is the eel you know that that great
you know advocate is of workers the european union actually intervened and told ireland now you have to make them pay taxes to you and ireland was like no
don't you address that he really loves me it didn't come yeah yeah just a battered wife your country and and i mean there is some popular like opposition to this obviously among the irish but they're not in play and this at all it's just it's just an argument between
the e u and like irish liberal capitalists while everyone else hopes that the lake more sustainable form of capitalism ways or
it's the perfect vehicle for neo feudalism because what has less accountability to any popular well than just completely made up money what can you do began to share it doesn't really matter how many irish people it yeah bitches what are you going to do we move the decimal point along we decided that this does more
pointers and born here we entered a few things on the spreadsheet now you have four trillion dollars park here that is sort of liquid but also sort of totally made up you can borrow against to make these buildings look like they're a background in halo two that are just going to crumble urge
filled with empty units
in an oil had their you can't do anything about it there's no a people's advocated nice there's no institution
now they have the irish working class that has literally any any say in this whatsoever well i mean that's that's all of us i mean we we does not have countervailing institutions
go run and buck wild yeah but it's sad when it happens to us because they're nicer than us
they won't be know yeah
any americans and fifteen yeah i mean
yo thing about it is and the liberals by the way the irish liberal cavernous what here then be like yeah we're going to be and fifteen you enjoy it's going to be great for you earn a little thing called the golden corral yeah look forward to you know no longer having sex or drinking at all and just you know applying highlight are all night
and taking instagram photographs of yourself i will say though that
it will be nice to be able to go there and be able to get free refills on sarah
genuine american innovation that i do appreciate whenever i not have access to the sequel to is usually only thing you're anti nanny say about what now i just i'm not
just you go to a foreign country and us for a soda and they give you like a shot glass with no ice and acosta four euros or whatever and you don't get another on this is just give me give me the big public glass filled with coke and give me another one them
maybe one more when they become american angela's ashes becomes angel cell phones and it is a tale of a bunch of like she'd adolescence be more useful my headphones to you're so fucking day it's still nine hundred thousand pages
up a secondary economy just space and girls doing their eyebrows on youtube do people in the british isles law they oh my god that's because my fallback well yeah
the next financial crisis going to be you to being eyebrow tutorials they have some fucking sheath door
you fucking boomerang what are they doing it's a mate like yeah
it's it's like a racing stripe i don't know what happened in the british i don't know if it's like a ghost of colonialism or something but i have no idea it's
it is fascinating to like walk into like a london pub and see a bunch of girls like just completely joan crawford it out
while drinking like watery warm longer just
it's fucking boomerang is above arrivals i don't know and then just they still didn't fake tan they're like it's two thousand and three it's very weird
europe's always a little behind but they're not fully behind though always pick like a couple things we used to have and then go for ages of gone with
just thinking how weird it would be if you're someone in dublin grow up your born in say like before is or first is this the new fake money world economy is great because it makes the economy just a mystical thing that you cannot fathom or understand just more there has been advantage
get a staff that is amazing force that you don't understand that's i mean that is why so many people are drunk because if the guy just goes up there is like the economy jobs well
this system is so mercurial in fucking weird and you are applying box you are all your life is getting better even though it may tangible ways it is worse than it has been in your lifetime there are enough like outside bullshit indicators maybe a new glasses your abomination going up maybe tag
you are making more money even if you don't pay attention to see
the economy so intangible to you now that if you're resentments align the right way or you're if you're irish your ambitions your lobo ambitions your inferiority complex work the right way this mystical beast has enough benchmarks don't actually mean anything that you can stand by it well that
explains then why the ireland took to finance capitalism so well because what is the traditional irish get rich quick stream it is you follow rainbow and a drunk man
choke him until he gives you a magical pot of gold and and that is the best is steve jobs as it's the best analogy to sort of yeah the mystical nature of modern finance capitalism it is like getting a leprechaun and he just snaps his fingers of the know what we should be highrises now this is amazing
oh that's what she get for creating a nation whatever cut this arena yeah
one hundred nation you're on the ad or
okay so congrats first and foremost through the good folks of ireland who helped the good folks of apple yeah become the world's
most monstrous financial enjoy the new hair world is coming but another don't worry will last forever
another guy that we want to say shower to his big ball or palma before
it was everyone knew and he was originally charged with of his shenanigans and tax avoidance the he was rang and i believe that was in a deposition yeah
a fan of basically laundering money through buying absurd items and just kind of like parking the money there but what we found out this week and his trial is that the ring thing he really loved to buy was ball or as suits he bought over over a million dollars one point three million dollars
i'm custom suits between two thousand and ten and two thousand and fourteen
i mean i just try to imagine what not since isn't injure has there been someone who has figured out how to blow money on clothing aware that was for me specifically this is very hard because i honestly don't think that i have spent more than maybe five hundred dollars on clothing and my entire life so
the app
like find your pants in a garbage can
kroger is going to find clothing paul matter for his pomona for and but just this this is a general type of rich guy though there is very like almost tragic to me i think the guy he just looks like any middle aged guy you've ever seen but he's says he's incredibly vain but knows he can't change
these two old he can't change like is shape or how they'll never see a cool guy what i mean those are now the mark house and buys these insane say i mean you can buy your way or so much you can buy your way out of pretty much every inconvenience you can buy aware of consequences you can buy your way out of almost any feeling but you know if you're
one of these guys really can't buy your way of your own skin but god you they try the buyer way out of your own stupid skin and into a fifteen thousand dollar astrid skin
fifteen thousand dollar asterisk and jacket i mean i don't know how you wear that honestly you when you black career at suit
it's leather no it's just a jacket fifteen thousand of our jacket
i honestly don't know how you dress like that
i mean he's just an impulse buy he probably wore it to like outing
no way or the suits you were to leg work or like an event it's like oh mobutu sese seko kid is being research sized
and even where the jacket like a cool of that era astrid shack it i'm going to say hey we found church church power to check non stuff the palm and forty eight it's like we clone the last row and we're gonna kill it and he would wear to mean by church i mean like whatever you know she
faraway place they all these children right the catholic church
he were to commit ping pong but the other thing that people say about this is that while this is basically a money laundering operation
because he had all of his money and foreign accounts i don't think they understand that laundering is not laundry and
but i mean those it different the fact is that he had all this money and foreign accounts and the thing about their money is you can't use it for most purchases or you can't pay your mortgage you can pay creditors or anything you can only the only thing you can do is find somebody who will take direct wire transfers and luxury goods and so the theory there is literally had too much money
like too much money to even stands right here he had money couldn't spend because it was it was hidden from the united states government
he didn't declare
but it was of the country so he couldn't access it because that is a weird isn't it
but tantalizing money than all of this money but you can only spend it on damn share well that's weird it's like
it's like a curse it's like some sort of sequel the producers millions is like you have all this cash but you can't do anything that anybody else does with money you have to buy weird exotic items
just have them in your house and just like well you know it's a fifteen thousand are jacket but like i guess i could put it on ebay or something i didn't craig's list ad and get somebody smart he will do what all redneck stale which is fine he objects that are high value but appreciate the lease which are guns and guitars
that allow myself at the same amount of money would be cool if he did that but apparently it was all clothing
and like
emerson island with ronnie mine and he's losing money on that you know he's handling the real analysis is the depreciation is high i rather than very sad
nobody else on earth biases shit
while i mean we know it wasn't very good at his job because got own as soon as anyone who looked at him for more than a minute which is really the thing to me the one actual meaningful take away from the entire russia whole shit is just how comically horrific three corrupt everyone involved in washington dc polish
access to the degree that if any of them gets the slightest scrutiny from from an investigative body five million crimes are immediately reveal look at all the people including democrats who are now caught in the backlash of just the man afford investigation like fucking the protesters and own former white house counsel for obama
craig craig craig
first thing manner for it's going to get him for his birth certificate fraud sorry to the site your name was no one's name known as a literary critic but i yeah i feel like now at the point in the
in the more investigation where it's already from casino religious bitching and he had zero three
it is reveals every crime
when ever did
manna for implicates everyone who's ever talk to every lot like i mean i would say that like someone like lanny davis is probably like smarter than manner for to the extent that he hides it a little bit better like manner our dog's name that's true that's true
man of easy as smart as a golden retriever manner for it's money laundering is just like comically incompetent
like i thought to be fair i thought a lot of the suit buying was money laundering but it's like know bitch was
it's the other money laundering is like he would wander through like a rug restore able to payment like legal business
god do know it's ever going to look into those
nonetheless rugs you gotta figure that man afford is more the mean than the external absolutely and and it just shows a businessman and this of course makes you think even more about the obama administration argument about why they couldn't prosecute anybody involved in the mortgage collapse because you know hey
great if we could have found evidence but there just wasn't there wasn't a strong enough case
i'm sorry any of these guys gets one agent spending an absolute denying it not only at all even for a second yeah like the criminality is out the open continues because it is not considered criminality it's not considered it a priority it's considered the lubricant for the how the system works so it will never be any
and if you want to talk about like stopping russian nefarious foreign intervention in politics i don't have this fucking class of absolute drifters that close to the levers of power and the first place
maybe at the very least investigate these kinds of crimes that have have a government like a prioritizing and also of course best of all not having people with this much criminal amount of money in the first place to splash all over the political system
that's the actual fucking like agenda item that we launching the cold war america doesn't want seal
ever be told to get a own house in order and a never well and that's kind of a yeah we rule we always will rule if anything goes wrong it's because someone else and it has nothing to do with their own shortcomings i mean like you realize when you pay too much attention to the democratic party is a laugh
it is you become like a boot straps personal responsibility as you like you fucked this up this is your fault take some responsibility and they never will oh yeah after after two years following this fucking nightmare i just feel like a boomer now if you feeling about it
are all the time yeah
rooney is a problem but me a while now america i mean america is just a reality show contestant
didn't come here to make friends and a sick of everybody else has drama that's that's american general
okay so there's one more guy we want to say congratulations to the and i think this is i think our favorite of the three we've talked about and a guy who we all miss great deal and think
have a tremendous amount of respect for that his former president barack obama who turned the magical number of fifty seven years old and states
today another obama gaffe like you'd think you just skip this year
people with yeah
i'm fifty eight let's not talk about fifty seven
every a can handle his birthday
yeah he's going to have the pie or he's going to have a cake with with fifty seven states on it
a own half and count how many seats
oh i'm in be cooler than we were my birthday suit
older so in honor of barack obama supporters of the president the president who basically didn't exist at this point
the disappearing president i think the least consequential two term president ever maybe when any my in the simpsons yes i'm trying to think of a two term president who had less of a lasting impact on american politics and barack obama easy benjamin franklin
because because he like none of his his accomplishments have stood the test of time his attempt to heal the divide in america's local
dialogue is attempt to rise above partisanship
none of it had none of it has left a mark on any of the political institutions or the political discourse it's it's like he'd never existed
it's it's breathtaking railway
no one is mad at him now i mean i but i mean again we are i any no one is mad at him like they just like are we this year well yeah because all politics is just sort of like mysticism now and the reason you'd miss obama is you miss the feeling
failing of not having to worry which i understand i did feel better than oh my god i'm unquestionably the culture was better i didn't have to respect seth meyers
i didn't have to see fucking five billion asshole from the f b i oh god every day and resubmit like it was better it felt better most of the things that suck or the same but it was you know better but you know the people who were throwing their bodies on the pyre obama come back
avant comeback they just want to feel him back
and obama he can't really showed them i i saw
i thought with the adoration of which i've seen many times where it's like when both you obama please help us it's like he was literally president
what do you think he was doing this
how he thought he was helping yeah
it's a you know what is he going to say what can he say without realizing he's about as i'm an idiot what easier are realizing that he completely failed yeah so he's got to spend the rest of his life
no cloning jellyfish with richard branson
you know just water skiing with naked models on his back but that's true because his the
the crux of his conception of politics that of his role in politics was as the guy who would give a speech i mean there really is true and that is why the right wing was so crazy mask i have a or thing because they thought that well if you can take his rhetorical ability and and reduce it to reading off of a script
when you have reduced him as a figure because everyone understood him as this rhetorical figure he had those like his career was propelled at every point by an amazing speech and a moment the first one of course was the two thousand and four the keynote and then after reverend wright thing remember there was forever right thing during the two thousand and eight campaign and everyone freaked out and oh my god
had this is this white racist was this guy he's crazy by at nationals what are we going to do and he like went into seclusion right and he and he sat in his study and he spent the night writing by hand speech about race the he delivered in philadelphia that he was so west wing
the most west wing thing in recent american political history because we're oh my god he was a liberal poster yeah studies like you know up we're going to fight this year by what post he posted and the thing is it worth i mean you there are you wouldn't matter anyway but in terms of the way if you will remember that campaign he gave that
about race and everyone stopped and thought wow whole lot of merit and they forgave him forever right and he went on to win
like that's how he thinks of it because and
he were to come out and try to do a speech again
like like a third act kind of thing like roy hobbes in the natural it would instead he knows and is however i think because how could he not down from france president that it would not be the movie ending of the natural that everybody remembers where he hits the home run that smashes the light read it will be there being in the book
where worry fucking strikes out and then dies because he would give the speech nothing will happen and then the entire premise of his political career would it would just crumble in front of it yeah it's it's not just the speech thing i think people did like the speeches and eight and feel guide or whatever
any was he was a pretty good orator but you have to realize the standard the power had been set so low you sell and that going to help him in the long run because look at where he is like will at the same with everything has many a comparatively look at the salem witch of presidents that obama is going to be between yeah the murder cowboy
and then trump by how how is he not going to look good and elevated and presidential compared to that right
because yeah i require holy reactive yeah you know it's all just a matter of like this is so much less embarrassing than the previous president but i do like that in his retirement he realizes it's sort of impotence i give him credit for that because for most of his presidency he was he seemed to be genuinely delusional and if you look at
the the memoirs of a lot of people there's there's a new book up by one of his
one of his assistants the talks about how during the showdown for the government for the debt ceiling showdown after that the tea party election in two thousand and ten
they sat out the republicans this is a thing that ended up with all the awful shit like sequestration and all that
talks about how there's this is after the tea party elections after mcconnell said we wanted and i'm a third term after the the two thousand and ten midterms lead up was just a bunch of ring cycle paths with tea bags hanging from their fucking ear lobes holding brown purse markets and pointing them a congressmen who are trying to give them
obama care
they sat down and the as we are going in and negotiations
believing the the best intentions of her her part of our other number like that's what they were saying in two thousand and fucking eleven there are saying we we gotta assume that these guys are operating in good faith so his entire presidency was based on delusion but i think the thing for most like it did for a lot of us kind of woke him up because he has decided
just to spend the rest of his life just easing into global point one percent debauchery
just like go fuck it likes the first thing he did was he went pear sailing with richard branson now he's got a fucking net flicks deal to do a bunch of movies we can hang out in hollywood
she signed to phase
yeah
you're a bitch
spawn campers are you didn't build up i'll give him playing with the epoxy america has just reading them for soccer
i it
john build god dammit
i'm never gonna want to score game with you
just be throwing like glasses on the floor and taking off their clothes and rolling in it
hedge or can was to ham on getting by scott free he got away with it he is now he's doing what do you always want to do it was a to the global we should our is unquestionably the hang out with with the global monsters and and go to davos time he wants to
and hangar now even with the hollywood guys he started puberty broken so congratulations to him on his power he never stopped raining
respect him for that
had grind for this view but the plead the sad bereft liberals who left in his wake and have to have to live not in the global money
clough the heaters but in america governed by donald trump psychotic republican there are a little more upset or a lot more sad a wistful and i wish the trump that obama woods back and they're are expressing that as a lot of weird ways the funniest one in my opinion is a new book
karen up amazon charts
called hope never dies and obama pipe mystery the first of what is promising to be an obama by mystery series i wanted it it's seizure and adventure would have been cool and i would have or coloring book is written by andrew schafer and the description is as such
vice president joe biden and president barack obama team up in as high stakes thriller the combines a mystery worthy of watson and homes with a laugh about romantic chemistry of lethal weapons murder and rigs way this is slash frank basically us with with with you i think you have to pay extra for the sex scenes
vice president joe biden is fresh out of the obama white house and feeling adrift with his favorite railroad conductor dies in a suspicious accident leaving behind a railing wife and a trail of clues to unravel to unravel the mystery amtrak show teams with the only man he's ever fully trusted the forty fourth president of the united states
amtrak jones and the chase for me too
together they will plummet darkest corners of delaware traveling from cheap hotels the poker powers and beyond as they uncover the sinister forces advancing americans epidemic
you oh you mean they're like own party's donors
yeah presumably and all the superdelegates yeah presumably and it pulled the mask off of the monsters face and it's a or something
thriller and part romance second time they mentioned the prominent so yeah they're pushing the slash for i love the word romance it just another word for male male friendship for people who have never experienced that everything has to a special award
the opportunity to i never saw mill ship except for the movie will serve okay
oh
did you will boast or was a poor people do everything as ever que
yeah i have had children now has to be premier one hundred rating like the hardy boys versions of politics yeah the as now we are our children our our interactions and all of our dynamics have to be branded in a specific ways that we can talk from parliament a shorthand that maybe have a t shirt or something or certainly ashtray
partners for and part romance hope never dies it's essentially the first published work of a palmer infection and they are now why first and a canary
i'm a cathartic read for anyone distressed by the current state of affairs all my guy they adjusted admitting they're just like eat the loudest is great yeah yeah here's a pacifier for you you stupid fucking baby
so there is also as others make ever years there is an inner well there are reviews won't talk about but first there's an interview with the author enter schafer and they ask him where the idea for hope never dies come from the first time i saw joe biden in his ray ban aviators i thought that guy's an action hero
the eighty year old man he said as haven't played average finish area is only have like a brain hemorrhage is the sunglasses the suit the dead serious stare you think you'll have a chance
seen anyone wear sunglasses before our fucking dumb people are old person wear sunglasses because they have cataracts because the sun will kill them
like fucking jesus
the top bush should games born to oh my father this is entirely against like the kind of onion manifesting now that's applied see the sky this why this guy is really weird on manifestation there is like a sleazy sex group really
now i mean i'm eighty here that biden is actually like the perfect example of the sort of person who you would like to be your next door neighbor but you don't want in charge of anything ever not even like a block clean up can now he's not he's not like he's not like your wag year anyways of fucking complete scumbag is totally behind
old into delaware
ireland is flat plane of nothing is that is a tax haven for fucking everything
cynical people every fucking architect of the drug war he's a pc shares actually that biden crime dollars yeah unsuitable for i mean a huge amount of incarceration of the best thing that ever happened to him and he's like a ruined crazy uncle notches
chris dodd know but that's have english language
is that that uncle is that guy but it's just like he's nice to you give you twenty bucks
yeah forget it
well
you're saying oh it goes against the onion thing but now he's he's taking a reconsideration it's a synthesis the sunglasses the suit the dead serious or you think you're looking at james bond then he opens his mouth and sticks his foot in it and you realize he's closer to leslie nielsen i toyed with the idea of a solo joe biden novel for years but it never went anywhere for years can you a
with a gargoyle toiling in your like your garrett he's sitting in the dark in front of an old tiny typewriter it's just a pile of cigarette butts his hands are ripping his hair out why wont work it's there but i can't make you work it's just so freaking
epic what what should surely quote should equal whoop there it is or who at the dogs out i can't pick know that that's the thing everyone fucking makes made for mitt romney for the dogs out it's like yeah that's not really different from anything joe biden our government on it as ryan is that all time when the obeid here comes when the obama biden romance
memes began circulating on the internet or in there for a final months on an office
robots i passed it off the idea i have soul i dusted off the idea of doing a job i signed up and tweaked it mainly by add president obama as the sherlock to chose watson
was have a chance that someone who's read this book one hundred percent awesome was a challenge to right action scenes for a protagonist who is seventy five years old
surprisingly not joe biden is in fantastic shape i had the hobble and with a bum knee just the right things competitive between him and the bad guys do you have a particular favorite biden isn't that you wrote pile mode hold the pie
so that's the that's the book
you know nine gag kind of wonder culture or i inherently angrily
everything supposed really walk in progressive and sofa for me yet radical now but it just feels like everything it's just week epic yeah all the time
joe one hundred percent epic when you see about the ways your supposedly the walkways you supposedly allowed to insult people like you realize that like a definitely dominated that scares oh my god yeah just the only non able is rated saw someone like you fucking kidding here awful yeah laos and you know some people have
austin he ranks felix
yeah and there's one of you i wanted to read about this
a verified purchaser i was torn between four and five stars because honestly this isn't the best book ever written or even in my top one hundred as far as the detective
that guy bragging
as far as a technical skills a really serious
but the plot is mine and by the numbers however this may be the best book ever narrated by a fictional joe biden so there's that also given the times we live in i really needed to read this book about to totally decent humans who have each other and our brave and true and get things done
got so much can look as president of a deal
what all of those like british soldiers did after they were all fucked up from world war one and go to asia and get an opium had it you know they can maybe just if you're going to drop out drop out and they dropped out but they never left
still around yeah because now there's the new there's the twenty first century option of dropping out is just going online
just just being extremely online you don't need to go to shanghai and find an opium den you can just log on and never log off know it up
i feel like nothing's ever going to get better and all you individually
seeing really pursue the habit of getting his video games
you ever felt that way and parishes and universal
i've heard that but not video game specifically between he may be so mad mad more traditional games is like i'm going to compete and detector
it's a soft game you can you can get good at will be funny to be like the ninja
jacksonville that jack
hi that requires coordination know we don't know many of the aggressive you can hurt yourself yeah being the top ranked ball player in the world
isn't that just like the tallest person playing admirable yeah you would take a bit
monkey both
so and i wanted to read a little bit for the beginning of the hope never dies and obama by mystery
one the night this all started i was in a black irish mood
that's okay
we have sad is even half is offensive to the irish that line so if you're gonna get mad at us irish listeners fine andrew schafer instead of black irish why
i don't even know what that would immediately peers as you mean it's they in the n word
it means he's thinking about all the times his ancestors were slave
and that was before i learned my friend was dead
i was sitting at my computer and i'd stumbled across one of those so called popper oxy videos yeah this is like while working for crush outskirts crush and outskirts
it opened with a wide shot of cape town fabled table mountain the camera panned down to the white kept waves of the harbor an impossibly wrong speed and or the frame cutting through the surf like a buttered bullet a pair of sailor trailed behind the boat high the sky tethered to the stern by thin rope the camera zoomed in on a daredevils space and i saw that my old friend morocco
obama was having the time of his life my own funny is the first line of dialogue hello barack obama former president i'm your friend joe biden former vice president i will say i will say that the one thing that this book gets right that isn't delusional i think an accurate
insight into the character of the care of pipe is that he might be a lizard puppet of military industrial complex and and of credit card companies but he genuinely his whole life clearly wanted to have a cool black friend and getting to be friends with obama clearly is
like the highlight of you watch lethal weapon movies every night now he wanted he always wanted to go black eye to be friends with them like that's that's the one thing that actually seems genuine about him and the one of the ways you can know that for sure is that obama was the guy you sat him down in two thousand and sixteen when he saw hillary limping through the primaries and thought and
not for me that i could get in here and actually when obama guy who sat him down and said don't rangel and it worked
because he clearly has that puppy dog admiration for obama
so kudos to pay for forgetting justice
eric supplicant part of vitamins relationship of better because he could have one he would have won my absolutely was much as i don't like him he would have one and he would have won because he wouldn't have made all the fucking bone headed too clever by half mistakes now of course you around or american idol nice races guy in delaware
you would have run a boiled meat and potatoes irish campaign good old fashioned award healers go and march walking around on the pox and he would have won it wouldn't it would have been easy
and he i mean i don't know if he could have beat hillary and the primary but
it's possible definitely more likable and hillary million times and obama i mean we want to talk about his his manifest incompetence is crimes like
and we've said this before but clearing the fucking tak for hillary in two thousand and sixteen
the greatest acts of political malpractice in history no one bothers the people that hate in like barack obama is jesus christ
you anything for the people who liked
okay and all that she turned on the other cheek and the back of atlanta yeah over all the all the things they are people did
no a huge it's like now only she can be said
fuck in a may and and actually
yeah that make refer to him reflects well on it means that he yeah he's he's above pettiness and he's a good person everyone you are super racist to me well no hard feelings river or you had a picture of me wearing a turban and the hammer pants and put that out into the press it's okay just it's amazing it's amazing how little memory
yeah we have like hillary did run like pretty much like a boring strasser is take it
i'll show it as as we said she ran the actual search should have just been like
oh yeah she would like go to some steel mill be like i'm not gonna let them make any more rap
just like a ladder is are taking away our jaya eight years later clear the deck like everyone's races but
dude i'm always and the guy ah cleared the deck for her that was the guy ritchie her people race agitated
rules are rules no one's ever get to talk about it no one mentions it it just forty and also it's also you a laugh thing and yeah and of course like the shops
people who think that they have inside inside inside inside will argue with that say no he didn't do it because he's smog and because he wanted to feel like he was you know
he was big harder to wherever he did it because it needed to keep the clintons on his side he didn't want them outside
also the white house like sewing descent and it's like one that didn't even work she was fucking leaking the whole time she was secretary of state and her people were bitching about in the entire time and also how do you not recognise after she loses that gimme race that she's a spent force in american politics and not some here to worry about it's like
oh it's not nearly as bad as in the bankers
we could be done with the clintons forever oh god now
i'm giving you i'm incidentally redoing the series yeah you have to watch the show forever he tried one of those fuck he tried one of peter tools plug boys and in the room and squeezed are full of teenage poor to keep pumping just long enough to eat shit for fucking donald trump
so this is he's he's looking at this paparazzi video his buddy having the family's life unencumbered by the dead weight loser vice president
forty four was on a vacation to end our vacations wind surfing on richard branson is private island kayaking with justin trudeau base jumping in hong kong with bradley cooper brock wasn't simply tempting the fates he was staring them and why not if he could survive a long years is the first black us president he can survive anything not that i was worried about him i was getting all worked
top of barack obama is this book written for readers who don't know who obama is kiss every every every line is like being that he was the forty fifth president of united states
as a former senator from illinois
i forced myself to walk away from the computer i turned to face with our poured on the back all of our office there was an all christmas gift from my daughter i'd kept it in storage for many years but now i finally have some free time on my hands maybe too much free time one call i said to my faithful companion champ that much to ask
yeah
dog the dog glanced up with indifference he'd heard it all before just one phone call i said in a snap of the rest i sent the dirt sailing across the room it here
mark right between bradley cooper's piercing blue eyes
a years
it's from the shredded magazine cover taped to the board and that even a gosh darn postcard prague even have the gall to tell people magazine that we still were golfing to around it and first about biden would not say gosh darn he would say the word also obama would have eaten champ i know
handle to save face i repeated the why the truth was there hadn't been any golf outings no late night texting not even a friendly poke on facebook
i watch the skies for smoke signals i read the new york times dissecting headlines looking for clues he might have left me nothing sometimes late at night after chose to sleep i scroll through the old text messages brock and i had exchanged a lifetime ago it was an exercise in futility if i kept looking at the wound it was never going to heal
in the darkness outside my office window at once the tiny flickering light i turned off
taylor swift so i can't really make any i'm already has clearly like going through something is he's right
he said a real break up and the only way he could process it is by turning it into a tale of
of scorn between former president vice president i turned off my lamp my desk lamp to get a better work and there it was again a pinprick of orange light like a firefighter a cigarette prowler maybe only one way to find out let's go champ the dog's ears perked up i the on the smoke was safe there are two things inside my medal of free
adam and my sig sauer pistol who i slipped the pistol into the waist band at the smoke by back then my polo shirt over it i called out my wife and wearing champ out she didn't answer back i can hear the tv playing in our bedroom law and order i should have been watching with her instead i open the back door
as soon as i did champ race across the lawn and tore off into the woods the motion like over the porch should kick on to propose burnt out all bob's romantic burn out
the one says that mean foreshadowing
a character joe biden will one day die of old age i think he's saying that these conveying the job i was filled with the sense that he he's is past his usefulness is sort of just waiting to die but i feel very shortly meaning will come back and it was like the moon was far enough to wire up the backyard or seven thousand square foot lake house
the four acres of property is as old bragging about his real estate during his own internal monologue
the problem is it only got up and over the every year over the past five late at night it was possible to imagine you were all alone in the world
however i wasn't alone ahead in the woods was this pinprick of white and now i smelled of a tobacco a familiar brand marlboro reds
your hopes up i told myself hope is just a four letter word across the yard walking to the spot where champ it disappeared into the trees at the edge of the clearing i spite of vertically challenged manner dark grey suit matching tie he had short spiky hair like it recently been discharged from the marines it was letting it grow out an earpiece disappeared into his collar secret service
my heart was beating faster than a dog licking a ish
my own security
last year
he had been my own security to help and dismissed earlier seven were weak dismissed several weeks earlier buy presents for granted six months of protection falling their time in office now day more or less they were extenuating circumstances nice night for a walk i said secret service natalie was showing me the way i tucked under a low hanging branch and kept walking but heavy for
overhead the fuse the moonlight i had a tread carefully to avoid the underbrush the smell of burning tobacco grew stronger i called the champ
in response i heard flint striking steal a lighter close by i sold around there to my left by the big oak ten paces away a man crush low scratching champ behind the ears german shepherd still talk to strangers
man was no stranger he rose to his feet a slim figure in his black hand tailored suit is white dress shirt unbuttoned that the mac he took a long drag off a cigarette i exhaled smoke with leisure barack obama was never guess is fifty shades for people who retain like house
the saddest tracking of thing i can really make fun of age ages like managed you hate it
sorry you just have to see it's a god damn shame what happened to this porn am would have to everybody that there's there's seriously huge demand for this book or tons of people
this book is going to sell more than our book like you know that oh yeah for her to have no question yeah but to see it you hate to see it but nobody has any other ideas all they can think others as bringing i'll piano

michael scott should be and then all the all the southern all the southern conservatives other sons were all murdered dogs for some reason put them all in there who kills rom thurman to the fifth now let's dig up the really weird kennedy's the ones that they don't want you to see that live in basements the grey gardens canada i went and around thank you
gotta figure they're at least like seven kennedy's who are white people with dread locks right oh totally their my masters in a habit but rosemary kennedy and there show raise the i q of letter
okay so i mean i read yesterday
in his will he requested that both barack obama and george w bush speak at his funeral at the national you draw they're going to play the paul walker was khalifa saw definitely but now i mean i mean weekend these the takes right themselves like we can i can see what's coming as clear as
my hand in front of my eyes
barack obama and george w bush are going to speak it mccain funeral and everybody is going to say you know just for a brief moment america was united again and they spoke to our better angels and they raised our nation but also and most importantly sort of slyly and implicitly condemned
donald trump
kind of kind of was a great friend to the cause of the global celtic like alan thrall a george w bush is a big background player
here's what you wish evolution was cooler to john mccain the donald trump ever wood's oh yeah all donald trump like donald trump's biggest sins against mccain was being like use a bad pilot which leg it was mccain was finding it it's funnier if mccain was like a cooler person yeah i kind of soft
it's like music video games like to believe i'm very good but after around like i'm not so good you became could do that was being a pilot but he can't do much of an asshole meanwhile george w bush did robo calls and the two thousand and republican primaries his campaign saying that mccain adopted daughter was an illegitimate black child conceived in vietnam and mccain was
forgive you cares
cooler than anything to trump couldn't get it together to do a robo call or anything the advice the thing is that george debbie is like in his prime was really kind of focused frank point bully and also a obama and bush those the guys who owned him those are the guys who were stood between him and his
lifelong ambition of being president getting to initiate global nuclear war and they're just going to stand there and be like are vanquished oh we respect him i mean trump just said some hilarious insults about them he never he didn't actually stop him from being president the ultimate cut move trump also like
he was so nice to he wanted to make out with john mccain so much that he passed and signed a tax bill mandating it's from know mccain shitty kids would ever have to work like he knew that they were as dumb as their dad usually here you go and became was still not big enough of the man to make up with them
talk about toronto because one of my favorite things happening right now is always the people how dare you sir that that trump is not have the official white house flag at half mast for trunk and i have literally seen i've seen people being like this will not stand if you have a flag fly at half mast everyone
faggot
oh my god
oh my god they're going to be liberals arrested for civil disobedience but it's like putting the obese flag and half now
climbing the flag all now
yeah i mean are we also know that the the white house com shop like sarah how be sanders had apparently according to news sources a pre packaged be written statement ready to go for john mccain about what a hero and an honorable man he was that trump personally spiked can put out a twitter state
you saying thoughts and prayers hanging out with king prayers how you run and how you do that shit you know though that like sarah how could huckabee state sanders for all of her bullshit is like a real like student council president kind of breeze or yeah like she definitely like she she birds that have been into would in a pirate
she's a real pick slick
a third thing about the trump thing is he put in instagram could dance john mccain over a picture of himself
that's a lead to such a powerful brain it's like he does even he looks so bad in every picture but particularly bad in this picture and he's like oh damn looks like you lost again by the way here's my disgusting part it
oh he's sober he legitimately things he looks good in aperture like it just such a thought you as a continuous thing where i feel like the kind of lives or gas lighting like every time i read anything where they're like look what he's doing he's sending secret messages it's like
so see i'll he is he is so simple a dick or something like it's just so obvious and this is why i think we need multi generational households because you should be able to see with a brain dying
this is all agree it's watching the trails of has of bird
i believe is probably my favorite thing i saw today just score for coming years and robbers in some unrelated meeting with
state or something
prime minister of niger ask him why he gets to use our
the white house press corps had to be assured of the room
because they were yelling at trial and asking any comments on john mccain what do you think that john mccain when he the majority in your terms of his seat are aspiring the screening there like an eighty and everyone is just in high dudgeon about this including for israel john walsh shoes blurb can be found on the front overbooked know i mean this is the overall thing like the next week or so like as you list
into the show you were going to be hit with just a tsunami of the most sanctimonious bullshit imaginable from the political press because john mccain really was the avatar of everything they believe it and i want to go into why in that like he was someone who got infinite mileage out of occasionally going against his part
and putting country firsts but again only doing that like he would make statements against his party but it would almost always end up signing onto the bad thing as well but the thing is like in the washington media you only get press for doing good thing if you spent your entire career doing bad things like the fact that john mccain came out against torture during the iraq war
one was like a huge standing over that that he broke with dick cheney and george w bush but like whereas if you'd spent your entire career in politics like a dentist's fuselage or mike ravel figure just generally being opposed to pointless violence and dehumanization and slaughter of any kind you would get no credit for that whatsoever what they like is a massive war
hark that nonetheless has lines yeah and here's the thing what you're seeing right now
you seem like hey remain are like all these people just saying that like the nation is in mourning right now and i just want to be like what you mean we white man
like everyone is more no fucking and most importantly shitty mean old man know most importantly here she's not morning john mccain not us the shitty dirt bag leftists all of the republican base every single trumps supporter is pissing on his grave right now if you look in the comments section of any fuck
the news story or any right wing forum or any major right wing media figure everyone is talking about what a traitor he is he's in hell right now
trump has ninety again
ninety percent approval rating from his base so who are all these people talking about what a hero what a great figure john mccain is it's journalists and it's liberals my cue the queue theory
is that he killed himself because he was about to be arrested for doing pizza good yeah i know he did it was a military tribunal you're going to be put before by a military tribunal for doing military pedophilia with the worst kind
eight years old hot they put them before the star chamber and they gave him the option of the roman
a suicide where you inject yourself with brain cancer
so yet all of all all of the republicans all the conservative movement none of the people who really subscribed to this or believe in it like john mccain or think he's a hero it's only liberals and the political press the political press i understand but for everyone else who is like going you know party over country right now now is
the time
talk even bring up even any mild criticism of his actual political impact on this country my question is why why why why
why why are you doing this
while i think some of it is that he was having all these death bad regrets but they were no way a concession of his own moral failings like he would be like while the iraq war was a mistake he means it was a strategic mistake yeah he doesn't mean that it was like murderous and completely unnecessary he means like well that didn't work
out well for us yeah which he was doing like as soon as bush's popular resorted to take a little bit he's like
running this thing that we absolutely need to do one hundred percent had little better like that was that was the republican like fuck in chicago's same way that was the move if you were like one of the last of the dying breed the republican moderates in two thousand and six and two thousand and seven was to admit that the iraq war was going
which was he doesn't won one hundred percent still thinks we should have gone there yet but i mean and
so i would have accepted like a true like deathbed confession like i would have been like fuck you old man but at least you did something good on the way out but he wasn't like there was no clear weighing on his conscience he's like it was a mistake he never used words like atrocity or anything
i will go ahead and selleck he stopped after the iraq were promoting every fucking military adventure crimes hands on he was he was he wrote about up until his death he was annoyed that we didn't go into syria was knowing that we didn't send more arms and soldiers to the ukraine he was basically piss that he missed world war three and getting a little bit
the man's life
there were obvious reasons why the press like mccain so much he was nice to them like he would business
parties for them like his street art barbecues he would talk to them you would give them quotes he knew how to play these people because to be a journalist in america you have to be for the most part the majority of national level journalists and local reporters but the majority of national ones you have to be just a fucking cretin who believes cretin nice things
and we'll just the moment
huge fucking roll over on your belly yes suppose both move but mccain mccain was also a bit of a hero to them because mccain was somebody who unlike you know his successors that he sort of brushed up against and republican and democratic party he was someone who it seemed like he had gone through some struggle now if you
look at it mccain was he the trend in his life was he experienced maybe point all one percent of the punishment he deserved like he flies or vietnam just dropping death and chemicals and what he gets the same prison sentence you get for unarmed burglary oh his his shoulder doesn't work
no talk to the people that he just flew over after by the way he can't the plane respond to keep getting in and
okay so he gets that he gets that and he gets out and it's like oh my god what a hero what a hero this guy who how many bodies to be have the monument app on how many fucking bodies to this fucking wide faced cretin have at this point then he you know after savings and loan for everything he looks a little contrite he's a little sad and that's enough
that's enough for journalists in the early nineties then after just years of larceny after years of abusing his power getting and made band in america all the shit know what he got banned in america because it's fucking wife who he left his other wife when she was on her fucking sick bed area in a line that learned a lot
like sarah palin yep mary cindy mccain this air to this anheuser busch distributor who bird woman you burn woman hearn calista gingrich actually hurt no one talks about this
their family
deep deep in business with boxing somehow gets the up and coming competitor band
just savings and all this evil shit he's done forever then it's two thousand and oh look who's throwing me barbecues oh whoops oh george w bush is mean to him than his punishment for the rest of the time is that he has to hug george w bush smile at this man he hates and he stands up to him two or three times and that that's enough
want to go through the mccain legacy before i do
tuition as the press love them because he's nice
i would dispute even that they all love him but if you read all these like touching remembrances about how cool and fun he was they all have a weird quality it doesn't really seem like he's being nice to them it seems like he's being a massive asshole which i can only conclude that every other senator is either the most blank person zero personality imaginable or like a
albert fish level like that
international because these journalists are hispanic their yes their shame pigs they love being neg and again to extend it also the other
little nerd lives and they they want to daddy to damn them yeah they want to get basra and by a father figure like the one they never had or whatever
why jim webb you've got any coverage at all
there was like
he needs in ancient memory now but there were like mark halperin
and who's the other fucking guy john hammond yeah john allen the profile exhaust their profiles of jim webb and what a maverick he was and it's like what do you think like jim webb said to these fucking around fleshy journalism oldest what do you think this man who brags about killing people and talks about reverse racism on a national
these guys why we want to be all around by a military daddy and let's not forget the purely kind of economic motivation they have for is that he moved to a lot of ink people loved reading about quote mccain and which to garber he was always my god he would show up to any for him
bullshit event or or show oh yeah you talk to anybody give drop a cold for anything and that's huge a media creature of i knew he knew how to play the game to like you remember when he was drawing out the boat like his last great he he says right before he finally goes against the
seventy literal seventeen percent of the time you vote against his agenda he goes you want to see i'm going to do stay tuned it was all showed him it was all showed him it was pro wrestling but these people ages
they bought the face oh i got i just figured it out
trump is reality t v mccain was prestige v
oh okay so i want to go through like the mccain legacy right now where it goes through some of the greatest hits of his career which were going to hear you know like i said prepare yourself for the week to come beginning with the centerpiece of his you know his courage and
everyone loves about in the most his service in vietnam in particular his time is appear to be you and the thing that everyone references is that he had a chance to be released early but he chose to stay and made sure that all the officers who are in prison there were released in the order if they got their right which
like in that context yeah that's an honorable thing to do in that situation to let someone else had been there longer go first however the entire political press and everyone he's referencing this is completely unable to reckon with why he was there in the first place now
he got fucking kidnapped by the he liberation army and i am in shanghai and sent to fuck in hanoi
he was the son of an admiral who volunteered to be you know
a navy pilot
you drop bombs on vietnam in from nineteen sixty eight on by the way i think trumps coke or someone else pointed this out most of his imprisonment in vietnam took place after nixon had purposely prolong the war another four and a half years so thank him for his stay there as well
but again like he was the bad guy in that war know
pilot is especially vile class in my view it's a george w bush she was a navy pilot in world war two and he was and over when the war started and here and elvis in all of his say no no we need you to stay at your fancy perhaps or and already yale and
you need to graduate and become the leaders and let let the let the draft or it out what the chaff unified but bush was excited make a name for himself and he was just excited to be a night of the sky
what they viewed being a pilot as and became to safely resume builder to it's like the equivalent of doing like teach for america for legs that are going to go on to become corporate lawyers entering
in another feudal society and saudi arabia the only prestige the military just sort of a jerk off professional other except for being a pilot he says the cavalry the twentieth and twenty first century and for mccain that's where was he was that was the aristocratic military position i assume their ground truth was just like a fleet of lamborghini
something here
man i think you said on a recent show like vietnam didn't happen
it's only like movies and like yeah i'm your man from movies and tv show that as american heroism and suffering
that's all that it was there was a pageant of american trauma and mccain is just an example of that yeah and he offered and recently suffered so greatly during the vietnam war but again he was part of a war machine that drop more bombs on southeast asia then the united states it on germany and japan during all of world war two i think just
during operation rolling thunder the hatch meted out and told civilian casualties
one hundred were talking about millions of people that were killed by the united states military during vietnam again another completely unjustified war of a crushing also again
it's not just that people were killed the environmental devastation of that war left congenital like violence on their children that were produced by the people who survived without what people in laos and cambodia to this day are still killed by unexplored unexploded us munitions drunk on their country
birth defects and shenyang my agent orange yeah i mean the list goes on and on of high clean war or anything like that this was like physically really so horrify again like the inability of the political presser anyone who references is like i said in that context honorable decision to stay longer than he you know passing up the
opportunity to leave i'm sorry they're completely unable to categorize like you can of the vietnam war as an atrocity which is what it was yeah and so this will probably go under that was johnson's and westmoreland campaign i'm north vietnam
with no real military purposes is just to inflict hair and force to the bargaining table in advance of the election and afterwards mccain said that i will this one of his biographer autobiographies that
the problem was we weren't bombing
useful military installations generals and know what they are doing we should have pumped more stuff
we had that's the that's the refrain of that was sort of a very popular there was sort of and underpinning to the reagan revolution that conservatism the people who mccain kind of the rock someone didn't let us win the aim is line from rambo too so don't say that you know john mccain was just a cog in this warmer
and he was wondering this there's just no he wanted more you want me to do more than when he came home he was a propaganda
he was a propaganda tool for for the war effort know you praised exit
i mean by the way it's not as if the entirety of like us servicemen and women at that point were totally brainwashed to i think the degree they kind of are now it's much more homogenous opinion that whenever we're doing and acts foreign country is going there is an incredibly vibrant like gee i anti war movement
at the time like you saw visibly a time of soldiers who were like defecting and going to jail for refusing to serve so it's not like it's not like
you could be attributed completely to group think there was there were dissenting servicemen and women that refused i mean so would you will about john kerry release he comes back and says oh yeah that's bad we're just doing war crimes over john kerry john kerry sees that john kerry goes in front of the goes
i would like to america statement like he can do that john mccain gant yeah
ernest just heard over talk about mccain and rational
prefer
yeah i know what
in the pro bowl on the vietnam talk imagine when people are talking about john mccain just replace take all the fucking breathless bullshit all the other hand wringing all the fake tears
everyone replace
still he still can still vomit and replace john mccain his name in any obituary any breathless article any smarmy to replace his name with crispin want
actually i mean john mccain significantly more people than men was absolutely and while i was by the end of his life not really responsible for his actions as brain and slurry by city i don't even like wrestling with been walk contributed way more to humanity and john mccain actually at least he made those in
people was wrestling somebody gave their lives better commission make one of those browser plug ins or just changes the name of john mccain a crisp and why
what started now you're going i would like a room to start believing this isn't true but i want you start believing it a big mccain is secretly kurtzman was nothing
i'm twenty two is john mccain zil gym it's on i don't care of it is dark and start believing it i need you to help me ruin his man's legacy
here's my thought on the vietnam pegged his legacy i've read today that the current the vietnamese colonel who is in charge of the hanoi hilton is his jailer and tormentor issued a statement today that said was very very heartfelt condolences to the mccain family and so the he pretty much admired john mccain particularly
for his efforts later in life to normalize relations between united states in vietnam to which are it's a good for that guy you can always feel sympathy for your enemies when you defeat them just all that we i mean i don't like sportsmen i would honestly like i would have kind words for john mccain as well if we have defeated him in this country meanwhile his way
words for that guy were a little difference
yeah if we were to believe him he hated that ma'am and everyone like him right up until the moment
a poor sports i mean to be honest like the torture of any p o w is wrong and not to be celebrated however
those american officers were treated for better than americans treated any vietnamese burst and absolute during the one hundred percent i mean they could have just been killed
just kill them all anxious that like torture
fuck out of people in vietnam yeah ok so just as ever
like loan at coney island yes okay so when you get to the very top of the first strap this is the oldest functioning rollercoaster in the world you see an american flag an italian flag and a p o w m i a flag and you're like god i've made a mistake
when carry came back to the of monks those has not been torturing charles is
so okay moving on to another another big peg in the the career of john mccain this was when he was already a senator a well established
the keating five savings and loan scandal he was one of the keating five for those you don't remember that you basically helped swindle the life savings from thousands of americans one of the top political scandals in american history basically the link in savings and loan collapse ended up costing the taxpayers in america
three point four billion dollars for his role in this he received only a reprimand citing his poor judgment and the senate ethics committee what the thing is that's why you became is to dim campaign finally had a while he was the name ever talked about that but he started running for in two thousand he was mr to them
campaign finance reform and just the fact that he had decided you know what now that i got caught just blatantly taking money from the book and crook i've decided that you know the thing that i did lately is wrong
because i got caught doing it
it was never frame that way they never work it was a fucking pr washing move and it worked and then the mother runner he gets one piece of legislation passed mccain feingold which is immediately fucking overturned by citizens united ruling that was vindicated that are there was decided by judges that he had all voted for because his use of i think it's zero
but of and it was just the whole political fucking the first of all campaign finance is while those classic said loop things like when we can fix this that we can we can slap some paint we can throw some bombing on this thing will get it across the finish line if we just get money out of there but beyond that it was just a goddamn pr move to be cut to become associated with
the thing that was one of his big ethical lapses so gradually fucking nations for basically once again just rolling the press i feel so bad for people who are like really into campaign finance reform
that's just like one level above being like oh man what if we played the song imagine for donald trump
just like when just a slight level above that thinking that would work moving on the receipt vote against recognizing martin luther king day is a national holiday
he's probably talking about that with aretha franklin right now
read were referencing possibly the worst we'd ever made possibly the worst and
where she was like it makes me smile think
john mccain and aretha franklin are hanging out there which is like like like neither of those people are happy to see in one
very differently
friend was feelings i was thinking about you when i was reading all these tweets about like heaven is like the best concert ever in your there and you got front row seats and princes serenading john mccain with i would die for you
talk about protestant mindset that is just like pure the the idea
your conception of heaven is just like a really good even cooler version of earth with all your friends and cool people whatever was having a big party and they love their loving it
it's a church like bake sale and narrow lemon squares in everyone's just milling about quietly but there's still a hierarchy so all the fame and you to hang out together
vip roped off section of heaven yeah yeah yeah we're game as sir anthony and
but yeah i know i mean like think about that though i mean like if that is your actual conception of how you're going to spend eternity is that it's just like earth but like you have like a slightly better a hotel room and there are famous people around you get to hang out with for eternity that's been with having your soul be with god feels like that
that is why we literally pray for death
whom i understand islamic like suicide bombers i understand the depth drive there were like we're going to get to see
an access
hear them talking about while i get i get you know go to heaven and i'm like oh yeah we have that to the boomers are so fucking awesome that they like they think there is in everlasting omniscient omnipresent being who just is you can't conceive of his my and power and knowledge and law
love and he is infinite and he is everything and also you go to his house he has it equals cancer
lucky you i gonna say respect to judaism respect to the jews for not believing in any of that harsher yeah it's a huge of and is like
you can come here if you want we really don't have one
yeah you might see god on and such small portions
mormon have it is a mormon have oh that's that
related at all not outlast to christianity at this point because they solve the problem of it's forever you realize because you can talk all they had it's basically like it's like a hawaiian vacation right but you know it for ever means right there's no way any of that like okay yeah have talking all my favorite celebs and then you know five billion years later you talking
jesse camp from him
you like this fucking sucks ass whereas the mormons and like you get to pee god which seems like that be more fun
green goddess the only way the return of these anywhere anyway interesting mormon heaven is like the game no man's sky
my that forever it's assets that algorithm the creation of new worlds i know now i think it's like gore with milk instead of beer ground
mormons
for the marvel universe the mormons in america
universe is the best one there they iraq
back from our religious digression your some highlights
this is a throwback how the forced removal of navajo from their ancestral lands to open it up for coal mining interests he did that he sold the with er rada who are already rough that call he brought back clean coal has had a while gave away the water rights that were negotiated for again by it
americans in in arizona he sold them out
okay let's get to this one the iraq war
that was good i mean he boost that real fucking hard
a member of the surge that was she didn't want it works he is so happy with spending nicer
that surge work you a member and human lindsey graham went to that market in baghdad and they had like helmets and kevlar vests on in like ten apache helicopters circling over know like this is great i'm buying a rog it safe
as an industrial be open in the next six months i'm just kill in baghdad now john mccain was like the john mccain and thomas friedman were like the king of like the next six months are crucial for the iraq war yeah and we're still that the six months never ending not store fucking ongoing and his problem of course if it on it was well surge was good put a fitted better doubles
search if it had been a mega quintuple surge them there would be a dave and busters on every corner and better
six votes against apartheid sanctions the bill written by ron dellums which he managed to get as have veto override run those who died a few weeks ago and strangely did not get so yeah we're not become the great american statesmen according to these fucking idiots will i get this goes back to where
i said earlier because if you're someone who has been on the right side of virtually every issue in then you die the political press doesn't like that because they know it all that this asshole
making us feel bad or whatever where is john mccain who continually saws from like you know atrocity to mild moment of conscience they relate to that that's like a human quality to them about the moment of conscious is is is what i'm saying that a scout his his his conscience isn't a conscience it's it's just he's antagonistic yeah
he was as that life because at that point he hated bush because bullshit own him in the two thousand and election ages bitter yeah and he was just a bit or piss then he's like fuck you bush and so he will vote against tech stuff like that just too fucking pissed them off and he voted against the obama care because it didn't like revolted against obama can european because it didn't like trump and it was amazing a was about
there he became much more down the line on out and
raised by yeah exactly this is pure spite and also of course his own perception of himself as this thing that he got the media to believe you why the way him being opposed to obama era penal total bullshit that they did multiple votes on multiple times are appealing a skinny repeal for appeal and all of a repeal and he voted for some of them he just gets credit for not voting for the last you pick the spot
there were all their to lap it up like a little pissed hogs that they are heights area
i'm rereading the exact quote when and cindy mccain said you're getting a little thin up there and he said me say don't plaster on the make up like a trial up you can't like he decided trial it was too soft he had to double down in front of reporters this
oh at all yeah he said you're from reporters because he said clinton like the british way it was a term of endearment or so
he's a role and as a proper legit all the
to be playing
okay here's the next one on my on my list of mccain achievements the bom bom bom bom bomb iran iraq wasn't enough for him he was also completely gung ho for iran and for everyone who is like everyone is going to listen to this show or is or saw our tweets during the past day who are so
so disgusted that we make a joke about someone dying
bom bom bom bom bom or and hey that was a joke to what's your problem he was joking about starting another fucking war that would kill another few hundred thousand it's just jokes he was just joking around he's just joke that's why we fired him from the park here
just joking these are just jokes were talking about right now which is sad that way with such he was so good at writhing that that's really just jokes and in that spirit i have i have a joke as well he may not be a peter jackson splatter film but he is brain dead
so he advocated for the around war that you sadly didn't get before he died
although i'm sure you know it's going to be called operation rolling mccain
but libya down for it
siri intervention good start with why not more could we have some armed moderate rebels and and maybe a us intervention their ukraine yes more war please please give it to be his whole thing was everywhere and at all times maximal conflict ratchet everything up to the point of violence
loved it
he will hear it satisfied some honestly deep and horrifying bloodless that was very helpfully in coincidence with the imperatives of the military state
that's why any income me into this guy any one of these fucking sweets or or articles about how he's an embodiment of american decency you're basically saying that a lifetime spreading bloody imperial may him from southeast asia the middle east means nothing that the lives of those millions of people that
he helped and mean nothing
if he can be a paragon of decency he was exceptionally militaristic yeah
a standard just like conservative capitalists we're not necessarily as enthusiastic as he was because they like what will this do for business hey you guys over this one were all georgians now
calm down
not a final
oh my god i am i going to sit in a field is just fire off nine millimeter rounds into the sky for an hour and a half thank you know thank you
pretty awesome
the actual allies best origin
george yeah we are all georgians now yeah that was another theaters again i'd say their word
we are all georgians me after a deal
soundtrack is my okay is my last item on john mccain is greatest hits and it's one of the best sarah palin
for everyone who is again all the liberals and all the journalists were talking about how he represented some some last sense of decency and honor in american politics everything that these people hate and fear now que and on pizza gave birth resumes just the general mainstreaming of just absolute ignorant yahoo conservatism sarah
alan open the door for all of that he chose her is the right
running mate and yeah way to go buddy
circus yeah he brought the circus to sound you remember that one rally where he's like users dying up there like all the crowds of more runs we're just waiting for like trump and cute around fucking eight years later he's just like and another thing ass who is sick of it
just fucking die and then our he's like he knows he knows he's dying because it's just a lifelong media and crowd operator he's like while about sale or pay my ass and i have on her up there
hearing more and just start cheering is the most iconic moment of the mccain campaign as besides the spending his campaign to fix wall street
yeah that was good
again
you know for for everyone who is just like what happens like a decent republicans where where is this last you know these great statesmen of your
trump and all of his mega people sarah palin that was ten years exactly ten years before all of this she use the mother of two years key open that fucking door and as amazingly inept successful purse and like she really was the preemptive trump where she just kind of like trip
silver own deck into success and even when by then she got kind of showed that she that
but by failing to win the office
showed that she did not have what it took to like keep going because now she is genuinely hawking like tummy t on instagram like she's just the instagram thought now because she just too lazy and stupid to keep a grip going with the most reputable people on earth and yet my old ask him be one heart but one heartbeat
between her and the nuclear but she man is a a aggression but i appreciate herpes yeah to figure the other crazy like michele bachmann and all those people that are like they are they still do live this like upper class lifestyle their kids will go to prep schools all the shit but not the pilots the parents are just always like the dad and son are always
getting into fist fight over some snowmobile lane
yeah keeps your heart out bastard kids one afternoon a mansion white trash it's all i do the i am here for it like that his reputation for a year for a messy that they have been there i wish they got imagine if they were vice president ever is just like someone who is on the vice president official twitter account
you know some people say they'll be there for you but the never forgotten or thought fuck this shit listening to avenged sevenfold right
really good hard would get a hold of sarah would get all that leave remember levi jobs and
oh my i brought him at gunpoint they are and are now is so
without of and then as soon as it was already was fucking our respect of the parents who are really being those pieces of shit those kids are never going to said well for
can you imagine them at yale you like they can't hold they're never going to work at goldman sachs now
there could have said they're going to sell our these they're going on
only some going to try to put track pale and in the skull and bones initiation ceremony and he's going to be like and scrambled up your whole or can't believe this shit this is all said they won't reject all that kind of gay though
i thought current law
my amazing night hides they will become the number one like journalist of politics in the country you get he would finally people like you decode their way yeah you would be the he would replace mark halperin which is what you again most importantly sarah palin spell children unlike you know john mccain or bill clinton
will will be safe from whatever depredations and one out on the us state we are not safe from chelsea clinton and meghan mccain now they're coming for yeah they're coming for all i mean i have to say meghan mccain i chelsea clinton is just she's just a dummy that's a she just a dummy and it's like her main functions easy writing books
chills and doesn't seem to have a lot of ambition know she has been doing a better and she just wants to write books called like the kids guide to resisting and like you know she'll get insulted by like mega pete nine hundred and fifty three he was like i'm going to kill you
stupid bitch and she does is very student government and where she caught with them goes actually a bitch and a female dog and most working dogs are very smart and be more like that was classy chelsea yeah and i mean she has been called ugly since she was a child by a major media figures i think she's like i'm pretty calm
well at the fact that she's kind of kind of try to stand ever had that doesn't mean that the democratic party isn't going try and to address try to drag but she's like more of a sympathetic character he didn't meghan mccain who is just like she was when she was born she called the manager of the doctor that
she is just oh my god what a fucking tiring you can tell you can fucking though the way she built she basically wrong or hands around her dad spongy tumor for about six fucking months and just wrong all this him to be out of us demanding people apologize for being mean to her dad fuck you
you i am just so what a fucking entire why he days
he's kind of like a divine character from a job
she's dummy thick and just
i i'm still thinking about that
people keep posting this is a power car about mccain and you write about her book is that rally were
is swine woman comes up and as i heard obama is an hour is bad and he he's he's he's ever
yeah yeah yeah she like what what about that clip is that that woman like she felt because she was our cameras had a making fun of a she knew she knew like what she was saying wasn't right so she kind of like mumble that she should have stopped yourself a little bit then it just sort of like stopped and pause and started again it has not been there he's an error
spit it out real quick and then he's like no no he's he's he's decent person and doctor does seem to lead the and
have eaten it seems i've have camped out in the fan
the stadium tick area
cbs receipt of happy
absolutely
see some people defending mccain there and say i was there are the campaigners the rally is like the real deal also became was acutely familiar a campaign knew that
their supporters believe that barack obama was a scary muslim so they had they knew they had to have it off in the past and
media types of these liberals the centrist whenever i see them bring their hands and wonder what happened to the republican party ninety percent approval rating for trouble
the assumption there is that donald trump castle spell over over what was fundamentally a decent chunk of the populace and that's never been the case in two thousand a mccain over the summer and seven rather over the summer mccain campaign imploded really didn't look like he was going to get the nomination and the two things are really hamstrung and more one his opposition
torture where he was getting booed are on at debates for that and to was because he signed on for amnesty he signed on for the aborted immigration reform in two thousand and six i rammed with the she amnesty to have do and six which really really riled up
the only way that he could inject any kind of passion into his campaign any kind of enthusiasm was by one appointing sarah palin and to ivy
winking at what is fundamentally a and has always been a white nationalists pace of the republican party and two years after that when he was being challenge in a primary airy and he was really fighting for his life they're against some disgraced former congressmen who was doing
infomercial hey we're worth the i with that as that big boy or many here a big ass him in haiti
i'm like get a drunk weatherman pain had to the base himself by playing to the jaw pio pace and the arizona republican party and he was going on t v and saying why i think we need to build the damn fence
the damn fence that was in his campaign at so you get to pick one here one he's he's actually a decent man who's just pandering and lying to
his stake holders who are bigots or two he really believes that he was not of avatar for fucking a way of doing politics that honorable now there's there's no degree it either way now and that's what i mean what i say the problem isn't the problem is it has always been the republican party when was the last
time the republican party where they get guys the civil war price of yeah
oh my friend you know maria
after a good compromise
okay
every seven
oh wait actually teddy teddy epic bacon roosevelt
roosevelt is like he was the first mccain does he oh yeah irritating imperialists blowhard
i'll tell what he was epic they were also half on
he would write these really self and he had like an email period because that was one like that ran a rare sight man of letters did at the time like a fashion themselves in a sense of these like pretty sure norwegian explorers so you do a lot of correspondence and he was just such a whiny bitch
he would just right right these like long self indulgent just like bad let like if you you've read it before because we live in new york and there is a guy who you know who wrote a novel about a white rapper you're familiar with the cadence of it i totally recommend reading a read
belts correspondence he's a complete whiny bitch
if i said on the show before governor great lot about teddy roosevelt
i'm going to say it again give a sissy a gun and kill everything and so
the thinking about it they were kind of less racist they were kind of less actively beholden to the kkk the nineteen twenties so maybe you can make the case nineteen twenties maybe i would like to transition to so of my favorite media reactions to john mccain is passing
no the shit out of me and i'm going to begin with olivia nozzle who had a great three the other day where she basically said hey it's not cool or edgy to like you know talk bad about john mccain you're not christopher hitchens you're just an asshole met as you rightly pointed out the categories asshole and chris
hitchens not exactly mutually exclusive yeah but i mean if anyone's edge year cool is olivia knows he wrote
this woman who was born warning to be on the new york times editorial masthead who fucking will just do perform any transaction or relationship with anybody for any about
as apparently will be his friends with meghan mccain so obviously if your friends with yeah
if you're obviously friendships often do you take precedence over your abstract political principles i don't really think that's a bad thing here's the thing olivia maybe someone who has not been so well established as being quite also chummy with milo you annapolis and ann coulter
should maybe pipe down a little bit about other people being mean to others publicly and here's the other thing what i say fuck john mccain i'm up being a being edgy i'm not trying to be i'm being one hundred percent sincere yes
absolutely
i think he was a bad person who had of poisonous effect on the world we live in this cause untold suffering of countless others as we've related before
again this is sincerity and i'm sorry i'm not going to put up with this phony national bath those and morning i'm not going to take partner office terrible man who made the were world a worse place by far and pointing it out has it's not just getting likes it or tweets it's not just being edge year or you doing like helen
hello jokes in high school or something what you're doing is you're pointing out this is if this is the model of the american politician according to mainstream political discourse the mainstream media mainstream
members of both parties and he's this much of a rancid piece of shit then that tells you what their ideas of what the fuck and politics are actually me all the it's just it's the way this is the american media the language falls apart from them falls apart
the edge
edgy thing to do is to talk about the implication of this career criminals foreign policy choices and domestic policy that edgy that's opie and anthony did any of you guys are browse sorry for the biggest fucking nerves of that
pros everything everything is a bully to me this is just these are just like transaction or warms move like wanted to be inside on the inside of a social circle forever and older resentments just sort of fucking shoe guy doing no fat cutting himself shaving and just come with eight
time that a anytime that like they have any disagreements only any interaction with someone who isn't like them so and who hasn't wanted this is there were fuck and twelve
it just comes out it comes out their lack of socialization they're they're complete alienation from the normal world that everything i don't like is it's a bro it's edgy it's it's shock jock curry every it's just completely alien to anyone else these people are fucking freaks she
brought up she went to christopher hitchens you know who shit on a lot of dead people he was quite good at that pat robertson among the best that or follow those orwell he had a great media hit for he was rude and means a lot of people who died but then again it was also funny as hell and christopher hitchens died i'm sorry every one of these when every
variations would be fine with people laughing and it's yeah here's the thing i'm sorry every one of these racks of war supporters when they nothing kill them but i'm saying when an eighty plus year old man dies of cancer that sort of like that's just nature take its course christopher hitchens was a drunk who smoke ten packs of cigarettes a day and and die
lying is not so huge fucking tragedy when every single one of these iraq war supporters these fucking ghouls dies for whatever reason it's funny and good and the world there's a better place
next ross doubt that ross doubt it had a really funny was the boss
he was going on and he said he says here
i also can't condemn the case along thread with is he showing his thoughts on mccain he goes i also can't condemn mccain choice of pale and in two thousand and eight because i sort of to upon him at the time though she was
also shows i'm not sure how he owns he goes
actually i don't say like processor grow meat always one of these be i think it's a little bit more honest than most of the media
england's was i'm also enjoying the later orson welles style
a lot of applause it leads like a character he at least has their like he has a personality like i pretty much know around author going to have on this list just they just all their personalities
he had an hour principalities she's just a chin their personality is just being like oh it's wednesday and i've had three beers fake news like just so depressing
cause i wrote this entire book where he's a curse gyro cursed damien child and he goes to jail and freaks out when
oh no don't they know how you know they were the road trip or harvard what he's at harvard in mikey doesn't have to put on a condom
it gets molested by william buckley like
it's like a moving sideways and so magical
but the rest of the people on this list there is just the lowest their lower like chivers of personality than any of these lotteries ranking any of barclays come
i'm getting my ass fingered on that's just great
i'm not
i can't condemn the teachers you feel and because i sort of urgent and upon him at the time she was chosen to be something other than what she turned out to be on the basis of a record that implied strength she turned out the lack she was the governor of like a state that's just fucking an oil pipeline and just the world's largest t g i fridays you're get a fuck it
two years and you're like yeah she's going to do it
of alaska has like a naturally occurring
ventures flat brimmed hat on tackled at the best thing to be said about mccain is record is that he took being a senator seriously
i appreciate the powers of his office
why is that me again i don't know i sat behind his desk
choo choo choo
what does it will like what were their like the early ninety others just fuck off senators who were just like ah damn i forgot to go to war
sure add round shows up in board shorts
going down the halls of the senate and a board had added cool aw dude i've actually going to the agriculture building for seven years for come up for reelection i forgot
because he appreciated the powers of his office and try to exploit them to the hilt for his conception the common good not something you can save some many of his colleagues and he goes it goes on to go i cannot find the link but ramesh a route wrote a piece back in two thousand and seventy thousand and eight about mccain the politics of honor
but i don't think it was one of those measures of the man he was most roman legislator for good
piece of yeah man on the same mark foley was their most i think his record shows became probably would have loved to own slaves if they've given the option as well
agent napoleon pointed this out actually calling of our most roman senator is actually very pathetic of him
son of a big military man who you know
took that position seriously if you also engage in imperial warfare slaughtering entire populations of people who are resisting are giant imperial death and suffering cafe under our he didn't do a very good job of even doing that if we're going to be there is so
he suggested that
and then went into a career in politics where he talked endlessly about honor and service basically only was motivated by self aggrandizement you know that sounds pretty pretty pretty romantic also you got that amp are effectively as neck model
that's rushed out that my last of my favorite mccain death reactions is certainly cut the opposite way these you guys see ben garrison and cartoon
i didn't say okay
you're in for a treat show her than will describe to the audience you have to just really weird that this is anywhere other than deviant i like it's strange to me what become successful and this kind and obviously weird sexual fantasies the whole world is kind of big deviant art at this point no now deviant
has bled into the real world and the process where does this the process of the deviant art application of the entire world
would you describe this cartoon
oh okay
so he's in a plane
that is he going into a grave
his
said here songbird mccain what as well as is how it is it engraved
he is
had is exploding
i don't know if they met that to be a little rough a literal reference didn't like his cause of death or why i like what does see what is he saying though he saying go to hell
off two days may angry a he's shyness sort of portray him as as you know like a slim pickens steam coming out of your it's a giant head that is exploding and on fire in a jet plane flying into an open grave
so i could draw i wish it like that's awesome it's so weird
both and things cancer looks like when you open someone out there is like goya to me
is so weird how political movement that is able to fucking identify its own enemies of appropriately hate them as more successful than one that seems to not even know what i mean oh my god you know what it only recent pew will surprise there
the new york times like
art spiegelman i'm in the new york times in the atlantic get they want to actually represent their voices just give half the appeared space to ben garrison cartoon
give him a job because no one in america believes with brad stevens believes rain these people ben garrison represents millions of people now there's a third of the country that is completely on board with ben garrison so a queue and on white again loving this is what real conservatives think about john mccain this is how they regard yes if they have no respect for him
there's no reason for you to either were better than them sir ember i just thought you said it's like art spiegel then i'm now imagining ben garrison mouse but all the mice just have you written on them
and the cats have not german

i mean you guys only other favorite mini reactions to john mccain we are i'd rather than and navarro on that one was taught not to edinburgh has to be one of the worst posters of all time just it's like i also she's an auto or because you just always comes up with me my friend spent a lot of
time like trying to make each other vomit basically with like fake post and stuff were internist earnest
or body but an unabridged always she of the one where she like took her twenty three and me was like
point four percent african and choose like i knew i was a sister
because i hate drop at it was like oh my god
like foot and i'll just delete is this just wipe out the server and of ora ora i may not be a classic eighty side scrolling actually an arcade game but i spent a lot of time playing contra
it's i mean i'm not gonna lie it was bomber seeing bernie sanders and they'll see do the people yeah but the thing is people say you gotta say something hit you get shit post a few months
but like you don't have to go that far you have to call you a paragon of human decency you really fucking don't know one in your district is going to punish you for saying that anymore not saying anything at all about as funny
sandler
sometimes you just have to say there you know your thoughts and prayers whatever they are suffering
to all the time now gets away with a truck had had a less discussed here the the least nauseating political tweet about this asshole just like thoughts and prayers with the family all you got it and then added a picture of his own hot body
for and i don't know you guys live era my favorite reactions and a generic one it's it's all the liberals who posted about oh what a hero he was and of these honorable the man was and then the next day after this horrible shooting happened in jacksonville just supposing you know hash tag thought the array we're going we're going to do with this time going to get rid of the guns
you know just what a day hence there were praising the center who took the most from the and are a part of twelve million dollars
you guys
oh
has a lot of john mccain tweets he loved and like a lot of this when his gear cindy mccain a grief stricken nation thanks you and your family for sacrificing your own time for him and sharing john mccain with the rest of us she said
is the third is the polish
it's a to have twenty good person paul
oh i'm going to get ahead
the city became loved it every time that asshole off the fucking house he's on a regular this is being a fucking cruel to her
oh my god you think anyone who's ever wiped off as much flops what actually probably got the botox and
yeah but
cindy mccain after john died jesus christ dude
she's going to eat pray love her way around the world and good luck sister health on what the family what does family that we're stuck with them forever oh yeah i hope you guys like him soon to troop mccain like his his son that like volunteered for iraq and somehow didn't like crashes bradley fighting vehicle into a bottomless pit
he's going to come
yeah measured in bend oregon had some cursed egg
who are using dna wizardry and create some immortal monster that in the senate for the return of when they're going to create the ultimate wedding graduates they're going to create this child who was born like dabbing for the deficit
didn't have the worst should have to come out with a shiny
now i need a nominee megan filler dad see that's going to rule when she votes for some build a convert the poor into slavery and he gets mad or and she says like my dad died and my god tells me that i'm doing the right thing here you can criticize me and all the fucking soccer is like joe walsh we're going to sign on to it
version you talking about all the suckers are going to wrap it up i want to return to where we began which is my question is why are all these liberals so torn up about this why are they having this perform it is being of you know he was a good man even if i didn't agree with him politically and i just my race for them is
certainly didn't like or respect you
there's not a single person in the conservative media who would extend you or any of your favor the same level of decency if obama drop dead tomorrow there's not a single person in the right wing press or politics who would wait even a second prefer they started gloating or critiquing his legacy at the very i'll just go back to the robots for ted kennedy
yeah obese for ted kennedy or yeah if if bernie sanders died tomorrow and all these same people all the centrists all the right wing people will take a big shit all over him and you know what i will be the last person to say how dare you or don't do that or that's not fair
i would i would expect nothing less than are we fucking disappointed if they started talking about what a good and decent person he was no exact
say you really are exactly so if i see you respecting very sanders every i'm going to be right there first reply on to your tweed going the a chief
yikes for me
bam so i guess my advice for them or advice or just my message to them at the end of the show is free yourself from this high school play pageantry of politics as martin said many times before we live in the age of horace know everything is permitted nothing is forbid it absolutely
they kill you and they would never send you the same courtesy and this idea that with three other eighty and what they're going for with this is they don't really like john mccain they don't really like this person if they ever met him i'm sure they would be be rude to them they be terrified of him what they're doing is they want this they think they're they're going to cash out
if they just do enough performance of dignity and virtue that like that
the other side will finally respect them this is no they won't yeah this is lisa and
those fucking tokens
at the game and then you go you get a big stuffed animal kolb comedy but as you say like the takings you collect the tickets you use the tokens to play the game and then you get it you get a big stuffed animal at the end of the river
he assures you that you know what we're better than them know you're not you're not better than them you are weaker than them
because you have no power if you did you wouldn't be bleeding on about how unfair it is to be mean to him or what a good man he was if you had power like they do you would say and do what you want and you would make sure that the historical record reflected what you actually believed you wouldn't be don't really believe in any this
you're just doing like i said a school play of what you think a smart political person should do well and they think that sunday if they simply long enough they will be rewarded yeah they think the eventually they'll like the the mass of people will see the one side being so awful and so
oh so partisan and so small minded and see the other side being always so reasonable and always will
hey handling and not inside the public enemies it will someday respect them rolling over in showing that bally's
reposted
the liberal fantasy the liberal crucible fantasy of the last seventy years is fuck and twelve angry men it's henry fonda twelve angry men being the one voice of reason and logic
and compassion and a room full of people riven by prejudice and small mindedness and greed who over just by being decent by by being decent over and over again eventually turns them all to your side and never literally once perfect your everyone yeah you'll never grovel your way and
being respected get off your knees like i said you'll feel better it's much for the grey just set your friend out your free but another one where you just sort of divide the people the people take this should seriously it's like yes they have this fantasy
comedy in their head and this delusion that they can use they can politeness their way into power and respect but also a base a lot of them they don't have a problem with the john mccain view of the world they don't have no problem with the harvard of governance they just wanted to have a a sheen of compassion over it a sheen of bipartisan cool
operation
this meant the fantasy that these are people in operating out of a good intentions for the betterment of all instead of just this endlessly humiliating and dehumanizing capitalist process of stripping everything of all dignity and meaning and we're just fucking slurry right and
that that thing for them mccain often voted for trumps agenda and he was pretty much every logically in line with him that just doesn't process for a lot of them because it's like mccain and trump are the two polar opposites for them because is how politics feels to them with it feels worse with mccain at least it feels
they can live the rest their lives when really they lives are totally unaffected they could just read the news less if they want to feel less bad even though i in name alcohol in a in one of these are people that like beat off to the western front christmas cease fire
that style is an his success that's what success it i mean the out of your enemies i mean the christmas truce would have been cool if when their office or showed up and said get back in the trenches they fucking shot them
well let's leave it there for this week one little postscript no matter who it is cindy a job io kelly ward
because john mccain didn't have the foresight to resign and seat one his brain was pretty much more at that point
an unelected republic in will be sitting in that seat two twenty twenty mobile for all of drums agenda we wave congratulations again last last thoughts pairs up for a real one plus a stable us extra prayers for other people out there hating one last thing and may still going strong john mccain or in the fucking ground if i don't
final the one last virtuous thing we have to do on the show an honor of john mccain just reminder we are going on tour

but they taste good they don't look like they would i couldn't handle looking in know little faces of the crabs we were eating in baltimore i was fine with the crabs i didn't like any other organs yeah there are the parts that are we didn't mean they're monsters are like looking at them i just i feel superior to them
they're just insects to the white sox the alien alien creatures i think that's the way to do it is just just revel in how
zito more fuck they are how of like everything you recognizes like a creature would be you're eating some geiger ask monster
came out of a meteor i mean i signed with an alien earth by crushing you're with us hammer yeah i enjoyed that the whole hand or action all the hair out ride
crabs that felt very atavistic and primitive borderline sexual you know i just realized what makes crowds one of the best foods and especially the blue crabs post of the bodies is that they game of fi dinner
yeah has when you are going through a carcass of one of those crowds of you find another little bugger of meat like you pull leg off and there's a little hidden bit of meat
that's exciting it's like you won the lottery that's okay our when i get are running a lot higher he went lungs or whatever it's like i level down although yeah that's when i was so i see it but that's why when a it makes me it's like hot what score by giving about this particular crab carcass that lady you know what am i going to leave behind versus what are we going to get the right one that lady who
had to teach us how to eat crabs because we're being crowded it should have we should have asked her to sit around the table and score are crab yeah assumption so we are really crab done were thrown out like half the crash and nefarious then we went through the bucket of half eaten crabs and eight the second hand
if you go out to eat demand that your server score you do
that's the law
whatever a passive my plate at the end i'm like can you just give me a little report on other if they say no if they refuse to san at your table and monitor your consumption and watch your coins arbitrarily are asked to see the manager yes in demand to see the man to man that third demoted and when the manager comes say sir i demand points

going to show want to show off parable
we are going to do more tours
keep your knickers on everywhere the end we wanna do a year to her oh yes
delicious vanity mostly english speaking at anyway
what of holy shit i had back fast for the first through at that party what is that okay so apparently it's brood by monks it's for loco brood by oh yes amateur talk
got a little crazy why how well yeah it's it's fight use yes how was that i tasted like cough syrup hell yeah oh yeah
that i only had a bit but i was extremely excitable and then we were in my a bunch of girls were in my crawl space a lot of them were from philadelphia
and they were all giving their
philadelphia catholic school who is in trouble right now stories and i'm pretty sure we may a pregnancy pact is a really from liquor it's a really fun is is crazy up with your kid like syrup service grows like you and then you're an adult and you're just like drinking bottle after a bottle of it every single day
well you know we have to go to scotland just to like load up on buck fast yeah
get get the i want to try do i need book fan slighted know i knew that i needed just caffeine and booze it's just a apparently the bottles i like the number one assault weapon in scotland until though it was going to put robots that my call
it's fine
little book fast only outlaws or
so we did we were in dc for two days and then that baltimore for two and i don't remember anything about the vault we their indoors it was nine hundred degrees
we both buckle down what we saw a walk by i remember that we saw a walk walk walk about everyone in the y se yeah we saw so long he was doing the virgin walk he was he was the food waters are literally should be sure if have taken a picture and from the angle or a vehicle we would have backed onto the virgin from the mean exactly
it's the most virgin town in the world
it's the it's the opposite of the district of chance
is absurd and know but we had fun we will be played it like a legendary apparently punk the nine thirty club was plenty of great bands of play bulbs eggs at which point
the sky no one that remember know shuffle bare naked nose
we presumably probably
or later
so so the show great we had fun with folks that are sold out
but yeah though we had more fun day
baltimore to address those after the show us where we are all the crab
absorb all those precious heavy metals your body required
and then went to the aquarium but now my god and the bottom otherwise known as a fish jail the baltimore clarion already soldiers and marines like they understand them because they sell wine at the baltimore where and yes
and we are asking because there's beer in the cafeteria and like can we walk around with a beer and she's like no open containers and it's like what about wine and she said
no open containers so far and is terrible little bottle of wine and what's jellyfish on edibles and it was just really the most pleasant thing so either way i think that
in parts of it huge it's like standing over a tank that's right there and you could just touch it
and i've had some and i mean that's probably why you can bring an open container because people are just one for me you getting getting the sharks drowned yeah which obviously wanted to do yes in addition to a touching tank they should ever drinking during
boeing that to pay a jellyfish and patch or escapes in the rays and that was nice
as pointed out the jellyfish were sending all the kids at the aquarium into a very bad trip now i think it's one of those things where you take a kid that's like too young to see the wall just lake
yeah yeah they were very steadman ask kind of creatures and kids were not prepared for them
they were screaming they were literally screaming to charity and they were franklin harsh in my body gathered
jellyfish don't move in a way that seems natural if your your yeah well and i gotta say the people who organized this exhibit when they weren't trying to guilt us about fucking climate change of guy i now assume that creatures you
they understood that you needed to play like prague rock over the jellyfish and that was being piped in while we were very high and slightly drunk and watching the jellyfish it was the perfect jellyfish watching conditions in even outside the aquarium just what the general harbor zone as you approached you realize that they were kind of piping in
like ambient new new age music yeah what kind of wales sounds as grace eyes or it was great with a natural light on people were there i want to the gift shop to buy a large whale and they
intro to sell me a tote bag which you know i'm obviously a poser all posts the tote bags so i know where all those have a regular plastic bag and she says this is a conservatory
out a report africa toto
you when i'm not going to carry around a way that sir you got own i got owned wow that's a that as a big star us out of guilt that keeps the dolphins and thanked the size of my apartment did it has yet
the fact that they're trying to build a new line of dolphins the thaw is a moral question
elephants
ever really be happy in every way of kept her biggest let down by far dolphins dolphin show we see our dog shit so is also tour as a woman there who just telling us dolphin facts that are not interesting some of the evidence or bad other dolphins yeah this woman has this piece of less little trick fish why
it's like a rubber band or on a string of this united gauge your like you do with your cat to get a bad at all you who are a guy just sat there were too high to actually hear how depressing and actually was so they're trying to teach them to be able to survive in the wild but because they've lived in a tank their whole life they're not used to burn
it's so they would be it dolphins are supposed to look for birds because that's where they're supposed to find food and she says we're trying to get them used to birds because if we sent them out into the wild right now they would just be terrified of birds being overhead so we're trying to you with this fake bird acclimate them for a life in the wild because they've seen nothing but this dank
and their little lot of this bird on a string just smacking it up against the side of the tai shan dolphin looks on inside like could not be was interested in us yeah so there's like a whole group of dolphins in a small table part of dolphins oh poly part of the
though they're not do any tricks for us the woman says that there's you didn't do tricks but also they should at least have a bigger clinton should do tricks for me
the woman says that
these dolphins were born in this tag this is all the know which had my line means they don't know you know that you don't know how good the ocean is because ah yes
basically growing up in a skinner box office although how great is you go outside at oh yeah well being of the ocean until you hit one of the patches that's just dead
or you run into the pacific garbage patch get caught
to tibet
where you just swallow five hundred pounds of garbage so would you go back if you if you saw the daylight if you saw the ocean your other chance would you be horrified by it or is like when old people try to like go back to jail after being released
the outside world
sad perhaps very educational golf but jellyfish very proud don't feel bad about then they don't have brain and do not have brains perhaps is the most another call that we don't allow dolphins we've released into the wild to make the choice to come back yeah there should be just like an open door back to the tail like the tunnel or something and if they come back in order
as always been curious how many would go back and i'll leave i think most would come back but somebody leave
that's just a testament to how awful we made their natural habitat so how will we should give them a dolphin rum spring
feed them lots of myth my favorite animals and turtle
google turtles great turtle didn't get to interact with her has his own agenda
your favorite animal
havana well i don't know if i could says whatever their because i've seen of a bunch of other places it's called the look down i always felt the pipeline fish
looks like so to to poke played smash them together and put crudely eyes on either side
turn it into a fish it has this metallic reflective chanel it's like a child made it and uncanny it looks like it's made a battle and i love the looked out it's called the looked out fisheries it's it's making a circle with its hand
this
elway
pull there was a slot their everyone saw the slop i didn't see it we did see a thought
i know that i set out to slash because there's one near the exit that moved over right after you guys left they were doing the aquarium was doing kind of a rain forest crossover which you know it doesn't sound canonical but i think it was just like to fish from the rain forest or whatever but i think we're just an excuse to get a flop and was actually extremely don't by time we got up to the to the ring
for starters on the very top of the aquarium and by time we got up there was basically night and it was like a lightning storm outside oh yeah his grace rainforest bio dome on the top of a building inside a glass dome with a lightning storm going on outside link enter the rain but we're not getting rained on like being in a rain forest with a wet and looking straight up at a slav hanging from
the ceiling very dope a body a that there's a lot and the best view in the city so lifelike turtle i think represents our show pretty well absolutely and effort it than okay cool very slow animals get that we have the next day
we went to like the plays response to get in the parking lot of a strip club
excellent excellent ten percent
yes it's like if you never heard of baltimore specials
kind of like barbecue but really what it is imagine the army's roast beef sandwich i am a man go on a platonic ideal of how that will be the best possible world and that's what it is it's even harder
beef but it's all tender and succulent and the real horseradish and everything on to sauces
so baltimore was a blast with diet find john waters
try that hard to be fair you did try to read
somebody that's about it i get find him what to oppose grave a total of the socket where we drove past that anyway
oh out a year ago so they really terrifying custom ohio it's very metal holocaust
is it is grim i saw when i was baltimore years ago as one another
why is there a giant burning ball of human corpses that's what the statue is it's again they weren't really a literal with holocaust very literal like what they want looked about consumed with fire i'll just do that
metal as we said at the show you've made us wonder like what did fault and loyalty or are you got a guilty conscience
what you do during world war two specifically
what's also like as we were driving back we went past like dover delaware advertise like the turnoff for the dover nine eleven memorial
why why here i get i to say i everywhere what's that
now i was going to say was near where flight ninety three crash
hathaway now now just everyone wants a piece yeah i he wants a piece of that sweet sweet
what did you do delaware
where for
delaware got the got a phone call
nine eleven and saying old girl aware of has died that day oh my god wow are learning a lot to the real learning about the holocaust baltimore
the state of delaware
while the baltimore was what was that i honestly forgot what we did in dc or we at the numbers bundle
creating all bungled there are meal
via people leaning over one quarter and a second
fucking depression
i guess we interacted with walks and that's about it
some sidewalks heads the laughs it's good were much looking forward to reading to come so we were disappointed
extraordinarily disappointing because we were in dc there was supposed to be a rick and morty things pop up on a bad actually genuinely annoyed with this i was looking for we are ready to go probably both nights
the description us on a great the bartenders are world supposed to be dressed like mr me seeks yes it was called the wobble love a pub excellent excellent just tedious you know they've got a pickle back rick to carry off course they probably got one of those drinks were they used the dry ice to make it
smoke like the ocean oh they're different colors serve some mixed drinks in an urban meyer our flat had sadly oh gosh he would rule but these fucking jerks a turner broadcasting these asshole these corporate bitches these corporate whores who run the rick and morty thing network adults will benefits
say no you have to pay us more than you can afford to to have this episode that you have a shutdown that's ridiculous ridiculous i mean that's all i mean i will say that these people deserve to be ruthlessly punished for being so stupid they didn't think this would happen
but at the same time or it very much of the mac greening school of copyright oil i mean it's it's better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission but that's what happened they tried it out first the torpedo these were the same people who did the game of thousands yes pop up which was apparently just called game of throne
and this dog shit
that even sir i think that these are you better as they went on because the game of throne as we looked it up because we were really fascinated by the idea when someone told us about this
i guess that's another thing that happened and the drink names are not puns it was just like you here's a drink called the mother of dragons cool yeah my lands was stealing us that apparently people used to dress up and get in line because that is what is cool and dc to go to go to the game of throne is
astra mean go to the fuck in medieval times now you get a real show their you to court or jam in with your hands toast blooming all at the heupel i though you're not around your fellow wonks offer awful now does go to any renaissance fair now
i draw the line to drawing the line i'm excited to dress up and reprise by adventure from last year the up say renaissance fair at the end of this month
it's kind of the speed to maybe you're going to get kicked of a renaissance fair
a thought and i like the most white trash headlines that we're both going to have and i think matt christmas kicked out of renaissance fairs going to be yours and mine is going to and mayan fortunate death at like a water park or something
the thing is matt
the reason you would get kicked out of the renaissance fairs not for being like just to generally disorderly would be like yelling at things that were anna karenina stick i would be chill i don't care you guys want to mix up the genre of the arrows that's fine i don't know i think he would actually be fine with that and he would go the other way and become the antagonists and show up in a
well in and a track suit and what he's wearing now
go but you have to dress up as a star trek guy and a bad year long have you have traveled through time travel to a primitive planet or something
that's very economical for star trek there are a lot of minutes
i felt fun
anyway so i want to do a pop up bar yes i think is i think it's easy oh yeah we just like find a bar that sucks and you just say hey your burst terrible the he goes here let us do with thing for like a few weeks
exactly yeah we throw in some props get some good some themed cocktails yes
did you just like a chocolate bar take over for yeah yeah yes someone let us do that if only there was another local part casting bar shut out to washington
hinterlands maybe whole at a ticket
we would have yeah we have the pond drinks it would be about our interests and drinks at the it would be absolutely horrible no one would agree on a theme by i would be really fun and they'd make a lot of money for that week it be a weird pass each end of the parts would all i don't know they were like baseball crank heads yes
they want work best cricket
speaking the voice of the yes they bust will have drinks like the a hot couch tardy ago
oh
what's another game or fuel game or a few old her home game where we only know that's a that's a seven think it's not too extreme cold fuck you need what does that mean
birdbrain i am put put said mean
fuck you mean it means when when someone says something stupid or that angers a fucking mean was birdbrain or yeah i mean i think that you send selling
i think they just like the silly sound of it
i don't know what to do rage comic theme during that are struggling mean theme drinks from thousand eight hundred years ago give me to do penis please
yes
has been going to go on are trying to think of another of losing it
jumping of like a whole list of of chap references somewhere but i don't want to see what i have a whole list of visual brainstorm was just all the things i could take your job way more seriously than we take our jobs yeah well somebody asked you if you've been to argue maintaining our
thirdly each you have a keen eye and i have never posted to the wiki or the tv two trips but can you post we have a youtube channel right
just making sure he didn't make can you post that video i took of man who watching yeah he's my eighty cedric i take a lot of it

stormy oh we did all the ones in a in a book really is a big reality let's just let's just do that they will go to let's make get the resistance the bar oh yes because we add add ons would actually be so we do an ironic resistance the barn door so right we joined the senate

hot meal or
gym membership or robert mueller are they doing like billboards with a hammer and sickle and twelve
yes yes yes yes know they're all over the place now
g o p but the o is the soviets star gotta have read there's probably been you know i'm just thinking of these like viral resistance people and the various things they've raised money for it's it's heavily in the millions for just cockamamie ski oh god yeah absolute gibberish the total economy of
the hash tag resistance probably won't remember what made you kicked in half a billion dollars for michael codes the feds fun oh just gave lanny davis half a billion dollars that's where nothing too awfully i rather think back because that was going to tell the truth or something i get it would they give money to like the or something i mean that's also
stupid but it's like okay you like the guy you gave half a million the michael cohen like the imagination that there's like a one of those paper thermostats in an office somewhere for a fundraiser and if you just get it filled up all the way with red marker the dropped just resign is truth he just boop those folks they hit the top of the thermostat okay i have to
decide what they do oh yeah they they a bunch of money to protest in front of the white house yes oh my god pachinko machine
another six figure sub just that people standing in front of the white house with christmas lights wasn't the idea what that when that if you couldn't be there in person you could give him money yes exactly
you'd like by a virtual spot at the rally i love the idea of getting into the age of virtual protests were it's just like in some virtual space there is like a place where avatars like sims or mingling in front of some place and you can just buy assumed mit mingled there and then your protest oh okay speaking you agree
chefs have you heard of this app i can't remember the name of it but the gist is you can pay celebrities to yeah personal i read an article about that that is fucking grew yes okay this
celebrities like very hard that he lists
and then it's cool yes yeah fair deal as an ongoing
i feel like a member of the vander pump rules to say hamper your great in a little bit that's amazing yeah well i know we're very good for secret say you're getting that here
yeah it's called cameo cameo right right right and who's on cameo
there's over fourteen hundred athletes musicians social media influence and there aren't that many more i know i'm going to log on to the lottery

our around here
so yeah vicki polanski nicky bars in gary busey is arraignment
clear that he's on here
how much hercules that he was the had quiz daddy
how much is it cause
that's what's so amazing put it on on a price tag on your worth is a celebrity because it's all the they named their own prices so for example mischa barton seventy five dollars for a video that feels low all if a were oh it's three hundred and fifty lance bass one hundred twenty five those juicy manicure
maples barlow people who who are the real housewives nikki plan ski perez hilton yeah we are not see prices on your did a low hand classic the prices god it oh the guy from john and eight plus eight or china kate plus eight john yeah
america black from the friday like
thirty bucks thirty bucks
to get a video for the rebecca black all got let's do it right now yeah can we get her to say rebecca black's say your was in a trap ask it by the end of this recording yeah yeah put it in by one police what rebecca black
i don't we make them see demeaning things now
what those explicit i mean to be fair promoting i shall is probably did mean that's what i know
i listen to chapel trap house all the time it's what i get my information it's where i get my news in hot takes on culture and out okay i get will buy the rebecca black they but here's my idea we should all go on it should all made a cameo luck out and sell ourselves
people would definitely buy buy shit for the and i'm curious with the top earner would be like
i think it's feel sadly he's got them his followers yeah oh well he would be the camp boy supreme court because he posts a lot of videos to yeah though they love the wrist straps throat parallel wouldn't say unparalleled
he has a lot of action for those terrorists dogs
what do we set our own prices i'm going to set mine for one thousand you can have the guy the real life that wolf of wall street guy toward bell for he does it for a thousand nobody has paid we now now i'm working yeah he's basically just way because it doesn't cost them anything not to do it so he's just waiting for the day would
one rich asshole as a joke decides to do it that it's been worth the whole time i thought it was marketed as and economies that the more into manual are the more in or they set their oil prices on that sucks
are you are you're like that so no signs of numerical value two year olds of fame now i'll also mine for for fifty thousand and just rely on ads are trying to buy one
that's it and i leave i made by a vague for the
if like those
it's like the casinos
those higher boutiques the or something
there's like there's three people standing there there's no whatever their but if one person goes and buys one handbag they've made their bob
yeah but i feel like now and there's just no way that it would end wow like if i did it even if i said it it fifty thousand there would be a bunch of down fans that would pull their money to get me to say the anyway
you wouldn't say the n word for fifty thousand
i i would feel i don't like i don't like the idea of that kind of direct service economy it's someone can make do you think it adds a little to me the email it it's immoral to say no because you could to give that fifty thousand dollars or the chart yeah would you would i will do i keep saying what i would say yes have ended and
jewel as an architect has a story and i do want to point out that basically the very first roof of the very first episode of the show is what if superman had to save cd and at the save he

usually this we watched a few million usually at this hour christened up man is asleep on the couch storing loudly he's how out amber is gonna bad and felix's in the other room playing fortnight and screaming at it so every lie for by on our is punctuated with him yelling at i presume that an eight year old yes
yeah
no lag in this fucking house i hope we have fucking better ping in the next one
needs to get over the lag issue
either
all ages now over no lag he needs the lag as an excuse for losing
that's what i'm saying
get over it just accept losing as part of life but my favorite part of the grand jury and was the a dent in the next day when we were in one of our various discussions about how the world of spiral spiraling into chaos and i think matt brought up that you might consider branding is a gun guy virgil you're like oh yeah i think i might do that too and everyone's like what the gun would you ever yeah immediately
hi tech nine yeah like the heroes at gran torino ones who who killed that awful raises committing a crime
around the neighborhood
got pretty that please
i just think i think you with a tech nine is a very funny image to me so all like this will be comes at a certain point where one he can't see the n word in it so we just uses a weird or racial slurs time a menagerie of yeah they really avoided the beach obvious have a source ground into the oh
only possible slurs for asian people that you can put into the movie and a lot of his hand waving a gun at minorities are pointing the finger at them and threatening them and i just kept thinking this movie comes out came out it was like two thousand and two dozen yeah yeah
did that movie today he would just be straight murdering them over and over again and the audience would would it would be primed to think oh he was justified each style yeah it's a dumb away from be know
mazda death wish now but i don't think so biggest thing about how poorly death wish holds up and saw death wish oh you showed it's insane in the same got deal yeah so like it's it's not the m
i mean for greens jury now it's been a while but i remember the moral kind of being minorities and are dangerous but some of them are women and some and some of them will help you
woke some ammo help you fix your roof and games as well as some of them will help you spite your children yes that you hate for no reason
some of them will prove the pussy priests in your district wrong yeah i did like the producers is totally useless priest who was an asshole
gran torino yeah it's so strange
oh yeah
here's your was a or when he takes the cake around
to meet other white other racist white people and they're just calling each other racial slurs all the time
like being reminded me of that white like me s and l skip where where eddie murphy's us old white people give each other things you do that just oh white people are just racist when they're with other white people and and you see him
like an irish guy says are you do and dumb domestic
it's fine you drunk bullock and it's and message is clear that no no racial slurs and find is because there was once for white people to it's a very big fan i brought this up in the car of the movie i always turn to is too long for thanks thinks everything julie new modern which is an amazing movie which could never be made to
day and it's just about three drag queens
who may or may not fall under the rubric of trans gender by today's standards but they are recognizes drag queens with the movies just being racists to each other and they're super friends forever it's an amazing you like
more or pet names
yeah i just think that there's a way to be affectionate and mean to someone and in fact i don't really know of any other way to be affectionate semblance so i'm sickened by well i mean that's our short work so you were when we talk about donald trump or hillary clinton were being affectionate but mean for friend sarah guys and we support and love
the mean we are the more affection
say about gran torino it's amazing that clint eastwood previous movies two years earlier where the flags of our fathers and letters from iwo jima which were praised oscar worthy and for like humanizing this conflict in world war two is ground zero of american resort resentment for for the japanese
praise for humanizing both sides and seeing how war changes and affects people and cleese would walks away from that use like yes now i've got my blank check to do my asian racism movie we need to convince clint eastwood to make another grant arena to return to redo gran torino and i just to see what his vision is now a younger
oh yes as i swear to god it's going to be walter a waltz stand in just murdering athletes who neil for the flag just fifteen minutes of that i think that's definitely the trajectory were what i really want to see and report back on the jennifer garner move me where she fights and s team
as a vigilante because they killed her family peppermint yeah what the most bullshit
so basically she's one of those angel families the trouble talks about who asked people to to illegally
yes yeah they called the age let the money they're trying to invent a new thing for gold star
other thing for illegal killed your
it's fucked up it's crazy propaganda yeah i no and like incredibly annoying and there is i think we should say if one of those a little mothers decided to get even yeah take the or he's going to grow out her mom just going to work couch can do pull ups yeah it's going to be like terminator two which she's immature
the insane asylum do pull ups on the she will get yes she apparently like lives in the streets and they're like like she's she's supposed to be batman basically and they're like why do you think there's no crime in this terrible neighborhood full of you know and it's because she
rome's the streets or whatever it has the local shortened name other put down her
although as a local shirt name of it
picked up in a are there or whether we are this we have this revelation to watch granted gran torino that one of the pre figure asians have drop was thousand and twelve are and see where charlton heston are natural
fuck
were actual has had died right then or something right
yeah he was as soon as he as beautiful as come see us he hit glorious would want answers were busy
talk to an empty chair that was supposed to have obama in it and he just sort of lauer said painful at school why a screwed up so bad why are we still in afghanistan
turk the audience's hoot and holler and all the people of the media including myself
but they oughta be the math it added they said this is a big disaster for the american political discourse know i mean it is embarrassing because where his grandchildren to be like you know he's a little confused right now
yeah know it was brutally awful that they did the other thing is is that we all thought it was embarrassing
it didn't help i assure you know it's something that her he lost but it didn't help either the do anything but we all thought it was just as a barrister anomaly and now our politics have been totally absorbed into oh yeah yeah know if you've done that for years on it
just clinics who would just run for president and yeah go to every event with an empty chair as you this part of the news cycle when it happened now no one would notice oh cardboard would notice now we're all here in the chair
you don't like a cheesy thing like that when when pat buchanan was running for president he would
he would dress up like america's daddy were like a sweater and there's a are seeing a press conference he did where there's like a set of of a small american a home like a like a dining room with doilies and tea cups and crap like that and you just sitting there avuncular and that was i don't know i guess that's for already one who senile
oil and thinks oh he's going to bring back that that nice room we were all in and the johns john birch mr were basically yes yeah that's exactly it
which is i want to do it on time
word fifty

was fortnight
i want to yesterday it was pretty cool
hermes how much peripherals matter because i was on my desktop murdered so many children now is definitely playing adults definitely do they had some point going to get old
yeah everything does everything in your life gets old after a long time or twenty four months and then it loses its sense of novelty and the you spend too much time with yourself and then you you find the next thing in your life is just your like spiderman you're going for building the building but you're going from thing to thing looking for a nuisance and novelty and you do that
you know by my math about thirty more time for a guy and then that's your life and it's okay
he needed to get away from yourself you will gladly escaped yourself the whole time where i'd ever caught up with yeah right
you could stay in one thing and keep convincing yourself that it's good it's the other way to live your life and you only have to do one of those really to do that for like sixty years but if you're good at that one too
there are two ways to play life there's my way and the other way or you can become religious but i haven't really figured out the math for that one i play donor county the other days for order and made that labour little some fucking

being very complementary about it may appear to me and many americans believe fixed the us election which wide donald trump became president for anyone to think lead
new food to had
anything to do with fixing the elections or even that the russians have that kind of knowledge is stupid




priests news softball fat cows and grief
the new routine
best leaders in the world
according to the trend for the show
repeat
steven seagal
i didn't see it
in the previous with these coming out against the kneeling protests in the nfl and
he he knows the months ago he is claim to have been a operative for like three decades now so easily as someone who is the top of the sniper program in the past assassin this insults me now and he said he actually said
risk my life countless times for that bag
insane that he just nobody challenges him i mean if you really care about about the flag people stealing valerie in disrespectful let's talk about this
fucking potato with the goatee lying about being anomaly
he he sacrificed his twin brothers life in a perfect weapon for that that his his his website claims that he is the only civilian ever dismantle an atomic bomb
all is so
if you're going to have a story about
kneeling is breaking the flag stealing valor and steven seagal you know we're going to lead with steven seagal never sit or neil when you should stand one thing i've learned from his movies yeah he definitely has always stand it
no my ah guy very agile very mobile he definitely would be able to get on one knee and then get back up again
that's the real and imagined the clicking here
like a washing machine it sounds like this
others me it sounds like getting a laundry bag full chick lit caught in a door
trying to send it over and over again
i like that he switched countries because he's like oh you can sometimes be prosecuted for sex crimes in america
but that is the that is that if anything about steven seagal putting these pampered athletes and their place for disrespecting america which i'm all for i don't i don't want
yeah like to be all right to disrespect the flag and our troops but food
i just i don't think steven seagal like i said someone who literally has renounced his us citizenship so you can do more sex runs in russia
is really you really know about that atomic bomb that he this man right and he wants to be respected for that for all and on any he he was
he was a blue life for a while yet that sharon not on there was a blue life and he mattered he would yeah already mattered more than a else he had an orange life he had already colony sit like cop or something that he hadn't caught on television and he's like i can send certain things and he thinks he has some sort of premonition of cry
and it's just racial profiling i it
it's guy over here looks suspicious just a black sense
graphic the moldovan woman within one hundred euro
through echo location yeah totally i should have no idea for the show gets too far gone i should say we're going to be speaking to ten thousand and a little bit and also welcome amber back to the show and that and the packing the jolly old u k we had a chance to go you'll be writing about that and we'll we'll talk about that and a future episode for sure

matt was aware of this but this was from when as ago had to end his ill fated a nice series law man because of allegations of sexual harassment and sex trafficking
this came out in open you don't do those unless you've been elected chair on the reading from the the news account here it says the lawsuit says the lawsuit says when told seagal that she had to leave to me with family members who would be suspicious if she didn't show up nonetheless he told her not to leave the house and followed her with a gun equipped with
the flashlight i mean he's an operator if you're god flashlight you need a gun to go with it
lost loved guns and flashlights the zodiac killer also trail would also splinter cell so she says he says
followed her with a gonna cope with a flashlight as she went out to a waiting cab which bit away as she jumped in the front seat wins lawsuit said she could identify quote a unique physiological reaction that seagal had sexual arousal which could be corroborated by the other attendance
it's not a boehner the suit did not specify what that reaction sometimes while begin real randy my boat spins for mama mama fucking tongue rules out months and that was back in like a motherfucker when she thing is when you study in the east you know be run in a normal person your legs
personal finance they reasonable wheels on a car but it takes about three seconds for them to move in on the ground that little thing called duchy through fog and operators when they get they get they blurred up there hot jumps out of their chest in the perfect shape

i've been a regular done with my friends normal more time i listened to a liberal pod cast the other day the humorous we were just saw here about that
ask you about that
are you sick data on going without it's funny as hell i have it
i mean i i only wish to name them because i don't want to just be beating up someone us is horrible plaid as that isn't that high
maybe one of the worst things i've ever seen
the mail host the milk a host who spoke only when spoken to
spent about forty seconds trying to get the word clip out of his mouth he was like and the burning brothers were harassing her and they said they were thinking with they're gonna want to say it
and the host was like whoa whoa whoa whoa where they say i don't know what it is ass which i thought was that was again a good know she didn't get what he was going to say next to you
well begins with the c just it's the it
little pleasure but
split that could add to your mouth
i mean that i understand not wanting to say like the slur i understand and records
isn't the slightly yeah you know that it i don't a gash share anything i some really that that was the best part he was he was too timid to say quit and i thought oh man he doesn't like he was to say the same idiots way the ticket if he was going to be like a good ally you shouldn't be intimidated by any part of female anatomy as well as you use
the corrects you know government always a steven seagal and be praising that we're not want
milan argue with the team found it
bumble cloud hyde amendment doesn't matter
steven seagal new song where he's for improving medic obama care of the bipartisan solutions so market solutions i want to get to where i can recall what will get some boy and the hyde amendment and the most humorless broadcast in history in a second i think first
you guys want to talk about being on the call yesterday introduce that you do want to introduce it
okay you can
talk about it
right so tim and amber
you guys were just a call a secret call yeah i was so secret one hundred people on how many it was broad
and recorded and publicly available yeah i'm really good op's there is five hundred people and one phone call yeah well they said it at aware
some kind of software where you can have like a million observers wow chatter
yeah yeah we used chatter that's like
al qaeda conference call shadow of a lie
excellent scoop actually recorded exile it
but seriously though
like i say like strategy color what planning session about health care right right
it is about medicare for all campaign it's you know in in the early stages but it's moving along really quickly
dino stella set it up and i've been working with add detail and mullahs and ash shack on sort of creating a campaign in a box
and spearheaded by can sing campaign so i've been reaching out to bernie and corbin canvassers who are often times the same people corbin actually brought in a lot of burning canvassers to work on the campaign and we've been sort of
trying to develop
or at least you know fit the canvassing model that they've used to a more campaign
healthcare campaign rather than canada campaign based canvassing model and were also sort of we want to include events it as well which would be essential for people living in rural areas where canvassing may not be as you know as viable but said that you could reach out and
to the national and they could hook you up with a speaker and you know you can set up an event for the community and like a church or whatever new sludge or whatever and they can send someone from maybe physicians for national healthcare labour campaign for single pair and right now we're sort of in beta testing for the canvassing model and philly any spare
trying out different wraps and seeing what works in the actual wraps like when you knock on some was dog
chair sanity and i'll share and then we flip the chair
and then you sit in at the wrong way little know you're serious you know i had around to flip the had around and no kids you know really whip screwed
the idea is that
you know when we get this data back and see what works will have like official the a campaign materials so that any chapter you can call in and say hey i want to canvas and we can send you someone probably from initially the the bernie or and or the club and campaign to train room the people i had a knock on doors
can send you all the official materials
and you know we could just hit the ground running and i will talk about this later when i ran our part on this but i just got back from u k again and honestly like you forget that they're living under a right wing government right now
because they're so on the move and they're so ready and they could be a right wing government for quite some time and it's shitty and their attacks on there in a chair send education and it's a it's a terrible austerity government but they're so optimistic and they're so just working on these projects and i think
and the clients that are really well last week it's not just enough to fight trump we have to actually be working on projects trump is not going to be president forever when she said that i'm sure that our show first not at the waiver can't
yeah he's got the gig of headlining labour conference after they saw that you did our sure yeah
had someone is also on call and yeah and it went really well people were really excited and people are really excited to canvas and stuff and actually find them in can but if you want to one you need to canvass if you know what a kansas or don't want you just know it's farm you know but i prefer to berlin up
by the way i prefer mew slim just the just a little bit though for going to be like training people had a knock on doors you know a little too for all the cameras result there has also my do
oh and you're golden report a ball or move was going to take about two weeks of my men occur intensive knocking on doors
comp canvassing conference strategy session four hundred dollars a day right to a woman monitor care of words on productions are new p o box
i'll be teaching as a nonprofit now we have a new non profit when i you know her personally but i'll be teaching people how to knock on doors like i said to week course four hundred dollars a session
attendance is required if you know you're a member of if you want to keep such drove into the show the disappeared episode or three episode rule and you gotta get a bleep out will you just heard glue years giving away of like that was of
i owe you one hundred correct started with
research going off what you said you just came back from the u k they are still under an austerity government but you're seeing an incredible amount of enthusiasm and optimism about the people who are fighting back i mean they're working so i mean how can we bring that to this cunt
tree
did you find the same level of excitement around this issue of medicare for all i mean there is now the thing is you just literally have to give people something to do will get him there yeah yeah and and people as soon as they hung up all the comments they did a survey after the call and then again we want a canvas so awfully that should be wrong
pretty soon i mean the fight for universal healthcare contains within an all the other parole fights of the big thing that we know was bad that it's fucking everything over but it's hard to maim right like a big structures of things that focus over here is a tangible way to organize your neighborhood and and fight back and not just fight back and the point of resistance but push forward like new
klein said to create something better create something bigger instituting like i am absolutely convinced that american help like america has all the ingredients to have like to be best healthcare program in the entire world full stop
oh and i think refusing to i think calling for anything shorter than that is is is on an ambitious
i'm excited by it so what i'll be doing this i'm going around i'm doing and twenty five talks in the next two months hoo boy
trying to get folks one like talk about what a single pair what is a single payer health care model what does that universal healthcare why do we need these things what do they mean like whoa what are all the concepts kind of bottled than the idea of health justice and and to how do we why should we how do we together
achieve it and i think the canvas model that we talked about medea say call is absolutely the way to cut that because the reason people are like people are often afraid to knock on doors which is wrong like the reason you're afraid to knock on doors is because you are told to be afraid of your neighbor and we have all these artificial divide between austin the people that live literally been next to us most affected
by the same things were affected by yeah i have not been killed by my neighbors once right so why should i feel i've got one hundred percent zero killed rock or yeah total my case
and she got women i'm normal make come in and tell you about healthcare
i'm only canvassing women
because they are most affected by lack of health care and by not knowing that i'm normal
i feel really good about it right
ember talked a lot about what you're seeing the u k which made me really really happy i saw a piece couple days ago in some kinzer our front of the show i think i'd wilkinson posted a piece that she saw about some super right wing rag in the u k all with them while yeah as just as glad man
lad land and wasn't lab that lad
it was rude and no actually you guys are both her it was actually a council fan is
the ruddy gentle but
it was about how jazz is going to be and does
towards it just letting them because they're scared even mother in power they think they're on their heels
and that was pretty cool reading if i ever read up has like that in the u s
that will be a reason to fuck and have a beer
well be really exciting but the i think that worked like there's a lot of divisions that have been working on this for decades and their work is really important and i think we're building off of that in a way that's really energizing and really compelling
yeah we've had represented his
from labour and from the physicians like we really do have a really solid grounding in the people that have already been working on this for a long time all they need is the canvassing army right
we're building a broad coalition armed with both popular support and a moral imperative how know how how tide is this canvassing effort to the bill that is currently being proposed by bernie sanders is it
the template that you guys are going off of when you knock on doors actually we thought about this pretty heavily because we do like the bernie though especially after some pressure from the physicians he expanded and included
a few notes about coverage for all residents but the truth than the matter is and i don't want to suck on the air the room
but that bill might fail
like any number of bills might fail and so we need to have a campaign that is actually based on principles rather than a single bell especially right now under donald trump
so we had like a five point principal base campaign that could be plugged done to any bill as it goes first one was as single program not a patchwork second when it's comprehensive coverage impatient outpatient dental reproductive you know everything
free at the point of service fees no co pays nothing for universal coverage that means like non citizens means residents to and five jobs replacement program for the transition
but anyone knew one of the health insurance who loses their job you're going to retrain you know
while the ceo of a while be on dragged to the theater
it's a relatively small number of people rightly brooding put together his estimate of how do people are actually affected by if insurance companies disappeared tomorrow what what does an industry look like because often go
opponents of a single payer there was an article that was written the other week that was like proponents of single payer healthcare might be interested to learn that the healthcare industry employs a lot of low income women yeah think pisses me off so fucking he will on their shitty terribly the thing pisses me off so fucking much because the implication
one is the insurance industry is just given them jobs because they're black
and it's like they're going to automate those jobs as soon as they can you are pc shit
i'm leading to fuck you over yeah yeah and anyone who likes studies any kind of feminist economics knows that expanding the public sector is the best feminists jobs program there is and that is what this will have to do you realize that the pig or tunes employee the lowest of the irish
i heard one that adds redundant
got booted posits that there's a couple hundred thousand people tops that are affected by by this change over and so there's two things one the american economy terms like churns about a million people per month people that are either laid off or quit their job or retire so like both of those parameters and to bernie is bill
i think it is very strongly allocates up to one percent of the transition period the budget into building programs to retrain people take care of them is called fares called just transition it's good like obviously we're all workers watch watch watch it but his back but it's not like the and white it's not like this always secretly we gotcha here's the achilles heel of the program
come on what i read the thing with does concern me though is bernie his proposal that would require federal mandate for all three these smile
yeah i mean like i'm very pro the sort of expansion of of reproductive health but i'm anti having to show the feeding
amber so embers point about like we bought a push not for individual bill but for a broader movement is spot on this is this is not a one year canvas is not for a single canada had the same time like this bill i think is pretty good one of the things i'm doing when i worked talking a local organizations are like everybody should organize
on this like principles based framework talk to somebody ask him what's the deal with your health care people love to talk about how they're being fucked over by their insurer by the hospital by their employer you can talk to people and like you can build community with people around you
once you have my board for like here's this vision of this thing that they want like the actual ask itself
can change based on where you are one of the things that the new york city chapter dia say socialists feminist working together was the idea of and rolling folks in the at the door on medicaid if they're eligible there's millions of folks that are eligible but not and world and medicaid like there's like medicaid isn't the answer but like in rolling your neighbor who is eligible for medicaid is
great way to like help somebody out if you're in a state where you've got one senator that endorsed bernie's bill or one rep that endorsed connors bill but others haven't you can lobby them to endorse the movement or sound like a norquist like pledge saying they will back a a federal single pair you can tailor the individual ask based upon your context i'm actually a really really want to learn
oh what those contacts are across the us because the situation is fighting for health care in kansas city and iowa city and minneapolis and western connecticut are all very very very different moments or that looks like a building the community and building a relationship and building that unilateral demand for universal single payer healthcare is what will get
us through the next six years i were going to talk about it a little bit with the
chip
expiring but it's kind of interesting i mean amber brought up how in the u k like they're and are brutally austere in terrible right wing government but there's all this energy and there have been sustained a on the n h s from both parties there for meant for many years
but it is kind of interesting how they're able to rally defense for a program that is universal is directly visible in their lives compared to you know how ridiculous is that we have chip this thing that millions of kids health insurance is probably save tons of lives but it has an expiration date
that we have the solutions that are sort of sticking their fingers and the dams a market that can never work because the problem is is the market that have all these timetables that have all these expiration dates that are international yeah heads might stop getting sick that's true that's true we have said the problems are going to stop
i'm becca ready for that will know you're right like one of the so what is chip and what would you like it's going to be it's going to buy their don't allow it to expire first of all but could you explain what it is right so chip as a supplementary health insurance program for low income kids low income kids means under two hundred percent of the federal federal poverty level not seen a lot of winners there
this video is on or not
i think it should be allowed low low energy good yeah
it covers right now i think nine million kids back in nineteen ninety seven two thousand and three percent of low income kids were without health insurance entirely and one really pernicious then i actually have peace coming out and jack been i think tomorrow that i mention this on is that like america as a specific perversity a specific disease where we can inflate the idea of insurance and the idea of healthcare
we kind of use those things unilaterally because in america your access to getting help is dependent upon your ability to pay and so like
there's like a chip provides health insurance for kids but she also provides a lot of models for prenatal care it as a strong start program
where women that are are people that are pregnant that are marginalized and like are in trouble can go to weigh it offers like a social work model of prenatal care will just super fucking good like there's one of the biggest successes i think of of of chip is this prenatal care model there just there was a myth for a law
long time the idea of the crack baby
that poor woman worst most of woman of color were smoking crack and therefore their kids were being born with deformities were born being born early wrong like smoking crack is probably not great for a fetus but it's less bad as buying cigarettes the problem was lead paint the walls people are being people are like being pregnant and people are being born in substandard housing and that
with bad nutrition and that's fucking them up right away said there are still tons of apartments in new york full of lead paint i'm pretty sure i live in one of them added
what don't get pregnant trying my best
we will give us idea and america have like finding separating the where the from unworthy pour the idea that somewhere out there someone's getting a free ride and because this person might exist and if they do i don't give a shit fuck it but because this person might exist we need to like build this super complicated patrick of programs which creates gap through which people like pork
fall through chip was created to try to like it was like staple a canvas over our
one of those gaps one of the while one of those biggest gaps
it is a discretionary fund bill which means it's it's funding as up is up for debate every couple of years it was reauthorize in two thousand nine two thousand and thirteen two thousand and fifteen what does not like up the funding it for like a long term plan it's been it's been a little up a little volleyball and the most recent reconciliation period ended without a chippy author
relations so under the current funding proposal funding will run out
by the end of the year and because this has a program that said it split a block grant oh it's a different kind of block grant might a gram cassidy shit this is a block grant that the feds have often put more money into when that was running a deficit is because taking care of people that are poor people that are sick isn't profitable
because it has a block grant states are on the hook for that part for a large part of the funding and because of that a lot of states are now i utah was the first one out at the gates are now filing to scale back there are moments create more in positions for receiving care or ultimately withdraw entirely from the program and truly fucked up and i was born i was talking to my partner this morning
felt like was a problem of of malevolent or a problem of incompetence and fundamentally i think the answer is it doesn't matter
it's to like to sew naked lady value the lives of nine million kids made fun of this is an act of class war and an act of race war right this is explicitly hurting poor kids and mostly poor kids of color poor families of color
this is explicitly an act of of of
a race and class war and so whether it latest couldn't get it in in time because they were too busy jerking off but cassidy gram or
they actively plan that to do this although orrin hatch who wrote the bill with ted kennedy
and some assistance
hillary clinton
renovation part of the show hillary clinton
my mother
or and hatch so ago there's that there's a deal coming through they're going to pass it can be a five year extension or whatever but like i don't fucking care where as well
now like it's enough to like it reminds me of the and like dhaka rollback right now you got a bunch of kids they're like living in fear of being deported having their families harmed and i've got a bunch of kids loving and fear of like not be able to get health care and people pay for healthcare you've got parents that are fuckin be afraid for their kids' lives you even have kids do get insurance with the which is one of the proposals to
solid an interim they're going to get higher risk of of preventable disease lower standard of living and there are still vulnerable to a publisher that happens around them all these social determinants that that that make health worse and are pregnant woman parents are you pregnant people are gonna fuckin suffer worst of all it's it's abominable and
i i i don't know why it didn't pass this is a fucking this is a gimme everyone looks good when you pass chip is passed without us in support of retirements come up so i don't know why this happened
in a year of naked betrayals of government responsibility to people this is another one of them i don't know if it's the most naked because a lot of well out a badge it's happen in puerto rico's happening at the same time
but there is no there is no mitigation of this if they pass another bill tomorrow to fund it with the fact that it took that long as still an abomination
i'm pretty mad she said
that they're all part of the same thing this is the field testing the new model whereby they're rolling back the number of people who are going to count as full citizens
who are owed anything because they see something coming on the horizon in terms of
catastrophic climate change and
lack of resources and they know it's going to get to be lifeboat time and they want to be they want to keep that boat as small as possible
my center from my former state my home state of wisconsin around johnson was speaking to a group of students amazing
the idea for that yeah
has shortened brutal
oh okay
there's primordial watch
do you consider food or right
consider calling i consider shelter right
what we have his rage
life liberty and shoot happiness
hash that point we have the right to freedom
half said point everything else is is a limited resource
we have to use our opportunity given to us when we can for those things look health care housing food these are not rights and privileges and they're there they are scarce resources and they go to the people who deserve them
that is basically taught a logically defined as the people who can already afford them brad johnson inherited a fucking used car dealership if i recall correctly right now now now he married into a rich family for all and even in college and got money to start construction business from his in laws anton sugar voice
later earlier the in the family joke
okay so that that's the healthcare update health scare update for this week but up for move onto our reading series to out the show tim
plug a way yes we are first off
bernice bill is a thing that exists wars auto discussion of a piece coming out and jakob and tomorrow or go through it thoroughly also have a new pod cast that me and my partner collegial put together she's a healthcare lawyer and she's much all the smart things that i say it is things that she texts week before as a them we've a pod cast called have a medical where we go through a white pay
paper on health care policy a current issue health care policy and the metal album that we both like and so off in the past week we went through futile protection laws which are extremely heinous there are ways to for example if if it turns doctors and the cops they will they might drug test a woman if she
apartment person if they show signs of having a drug and system that person then goes to jail and shackled what they give birth
for attempted genocide
you have cases of of of people trying to kill them
china get an abortion not being able to get one than being indicted for tempted photos side trying to kill themselves being locked up forced to give birth and then dying after all the individual problems of patriarchal capitalism misogyny racism trans phobia and basically when you don't have a robust health care est be carswell state fills the gaps those all live with
philip protection laws kid he has written a lot of research on with that we talk about that and we go through our bernie's bill really really a thoroughly both the good parts the parts of need improvement and then really what comes next so it's called having met a call that was the metal album the metal album us because of older locks not suffered which is a we have no nazis know rapists policy which is surprisingly difficult
for metal music
but this will others weeks as collateral ox not suffered which is a norwegian kind of grungy our garage metal band i think a fucking it kicks ass the very friendly and let us use him an album facebook before that it was sacrilege which is like a female fronted slayer from the eighties
same time as a slayer i think a lot better before that was a serious on goal which is extreme nurtured music about wizards and fire and bullshit and it was good to sell also i've got that it's good
recently beat out politicos nerd pardon pod pod cast of the fuck it's called and their guest most and the higher dealer pod cast for kingdoms number ninety eight mother fuckers compared to the one or two so where their bosses now
and my only goal is to grind them into dust
and can snort lines of their broken bodies so i've got that going on and then also i'm hitting the road as said before if you live anywhere between new york city lexington kentucky minneapolis or boston kind of in that promise i might be in your city in the next three months so come talked about half the with it it'll be fun
just tell if you're looking for music done by you know
the black metal done by like a good good regular guy there was this guy leg of org versions
check
you criteria yeah in a normal guy good good habits
all right
tim will you sit around for this week's reading seriously my honor and pleasure it is a duty and honor fantastic this week's meeting series i'm doing all of it because it really requires all of it it's not just going to be selections from i'm point to now torture all of you
matt taken out of and right now
because i think it is yes oh dear god by torturing my cobra losing your
torturing all my co host yet again because we're returning to miss megan mcardle i knew would be heard
logging new guys the last time we talked to a man chooses lifeguards last thing she was on the show we did a reading series from i think it was definitely her most evil column today are your number that is the one in which he said use the grinned fell tower fire incident to say basically
you can never blame landlords or lax regulations for it easily preventable disaster like this because if things were different the people might have died another way
that's not an exaggeration know is he's not even that building fires because they might kill baby hitler that is the article that nearly got be taste by campus
that the libertarian butterfly and maybe i don't know like this one for some reason for this
get mad because it's that evil it's just so with all the last owners are most evil column she's ever in this one is the most pointless column ever written
not just her not the most pointless shing she's over written it may be the most pointless thing ever written by a name is being to write this we need the clear blue third a medium post this is the facebook wall thing she got right this let's let's dive into this now because this column is extraordinary this is an opinion section
bloomberg view again
the the title of the article by megan mcardle is why is italian food so
oh yeah
know allies
a crush it on
well as the cod
we talked a while to have a little girl
a burning to death is is a necessity for a free society and also let's talk nash
the sub head here is new yorkers know the rest of the us deserves a taste of what the italian diaspora brings with it by megan mcardle and before i even begin you know
i'm from new york the shows based out of brooklyn there's a lot of good italian food here listeners of the show elsewhere in the country
is there anywhere broadly speaking in america that italian food has penetrated it now
italian food size making it
every everywhere has like fine italian cuisine you get your dominoes you going to papa john's old guard
i commas live as alina really a tiny little town and the town outside of the had a small italian restaurant and been like their yeah that was an indiana video to
a smattering of people are just like if you're listening to this now as a listener you're not in new york or you're from another place in america that's maybe doesn't have as many italians historically just think to yourself like is there an italian restaurant near me is there an italian food
okay
already has one of the five basic kinds of foods that and sandwiches
let let's dive and i'm going to read the whole thing because i i don't want anything to you go to waste here
okay
meghan begins a down new york city my birthplace seventeen somebody said
new york city my birthplace is ring to by italian neighborhoods go to staten island to the bronx to long island or to new jersey it doesn't matter where you go as long as it's within fifty miles of the empire state building with that within that fortunate circle you will find that you are always reasonably close to
a neighborhood or at least the street from a little stores and restaurants of unprepared posing appearance and fantastic cohen achievement tragically such neighborhoods are a blessing of erratic and patently unfair geographic distribution so she's she sighed you about stalin style population transfers of a town
that you'll get over that
what news
do tell them more rob
those you keep them in all black
a chef
spicy meatball you you can build the boots and go in and help you
the first thing we can sort of were kind of see what's coming if you're familiar with mcardle but the one sentence i want to highlight and the first paragraph that she says it doesn't matter where you go as long as you within a fifty miles the empire state building
i don't know there's just something about that phrase or i can't quite describe her raiding it's so weird what does she and i mean that's not even true
we called the pizza but i think was it extends way up farther and farther north of used to see i were i'm i'm putting myself in the mcardle mindset and i think when she wrote that said and she was imagining what are those cold war era diagrams of what would happen if a hydrogen bomb exploded over manhattan and she was like toyota the chef and
pizza box
anger is radiating at it it immediately style guess what do you get the central new jersey and again
there's no time to spare we have to do this whole thing in the rest of the country the quality of the presumed seems to be directly proportional to the number of hand crafted keep display cases and also to the elevation of your heart way when you view the price posted inside those case what sense of what's censored
what that's right in writing
writing style but his so she's saying that the pursuit oh is proportionally to as good as nervous as you give because it
it's expensive odessa in italian neighborhoods by contrast he older and more scuffed linoleum the bearer that badly plaster walls the more tattered the appearance of the single nineteen fifty six mass card taped into the cash register by way of decoration the more likely you are to discover the single best piece of shark eatery you have ever
you know what that was one sentence that was one she likes to talk about metrics
appears as of i don't think that that is an empirical club know making the things you one again adopting the mcardle mine said she was thinking of one one establishment in her head that she goes to she just whatever double fish cheap person
it's like every time she presses her space key like a little bit of ether blue
oh eyes
you know why period but he go
unlike some enclaves that develop good restaurants in markets as they gentrified italians do not need to seek outbid food as a way of expressing with they have arrived financially and socially italians are already there
not socially
being a cheerful and kind people are willing to it
i
going again she's thinking of the pizza
the had finally be guy
well it started about a good officer bed of its that's already caves that your guys were going to be some very very broadly sketched ethnic stereotypes coming up an eye and check it out
i wish we had ever on
bizarre that is and you can be we with e g you done one seed with the police are scum
consider your score
the
you see how you scum i appreciated this a new well on vacation
having spent years in a food desert in washington dc that's fucking and true and
i had boss burger
that said she got this world view is by going to dc were like everyone just mumbles and you never get where you ordered and people as confusing questions like do you want brown sugar on your burger
will make you a libertarian
she goes i was practically weeping over the ease with which one could secure a decent pizza
am not the only americans who have noticed that everything tastes really and know that's not just because you're on vacation and surrounded by charming ancient buildings you may notice the few accounts of vacations in reykjavik or dublin begin with the food was amazing quality of produce in italy is in fact much better because italians the man
better and haven't gotten their hands on better ingredients they prepare them with the care of their treasure were reserve so you're saying better better
you say that she's getting paid thousands of dollars to the right one hundreds of words the boiled out better ingredients to say papa johns i have to say i don't ever will be accused of defending d c but there is good food and dc it is like ethiopian or yemeni yeah they have good ethiopian food pretty well
also didn't have that when megan was growing up
bush's from new york
like any accepted this why people
she went this is just a noxious kid who came back from a study abroad and they'll only like it
they are just then
can i can i do and i always got later with a huge dad zach well as he continues it's not clear why italians have such an amazing array of exquisite regional dishes nora why they have held out so fanatically against the bland defying forces of modern commercial food processing week which i support wholeheartedly there's a libertarian we can guess that the room
an empire probably had something to do with the empires facilitate trade in exotic food stuffs enrich imperial barons absolutely chefs who dedicate considerable ingenuity to finding the best possible
he should have been there are they didn't have tomatoes or past
fucking talking about everyone want to go in empire drink like fucking a wine and barry and not slurry for every meal and as abraham thing as of grain best condom it was fermented fish guts and they fucking they had the duluth or wine with water up they were savages
the end of an empire encourages culinary genius yeah that's why we have the famous english cuisine
classics such as you know sunday boil
eat swan the only the queen was allowed to eat swan and now it's legal and like the races thing they say it's all the polls and irish travellers are sneaking in eating the swamp
that's so far but i looked up like oh what a swan actually taste like and like by all accounts just absolutely because it tasted like ship
most consistent description i found was fishy money delicious that sounds so good i had beatles someone want a highway
get they didn't get the defining things i wanted to highlight the highlights anymore they didn't get the defining elements of italian cuisine tomatoes or pastor to hundreds of years after the roman empire fell and again he is such a just a also read the jack of in peace
for commentary modernism everything we invented delicious like eighty years ago that they know everything before that he knows nothing of this is what's funny about the first half of this paragraph for she says like we can guess that the roman empire late know you can
she's she's guessing at this but like there hasn't been like a probably thousand book sorry and know like the history of italian food she shows arguably the oldest cookbook in the world dates to the roman empire and it is reasonable to suppose that after the empire collapsed it's canary influence lingered around the citizenry and here are literally mesopotamia cocoa
note on the i remembered fish guts that as the roman empire point and mcardle she says in parentheses at the end of this paragraph though it's worth noting that italian cuisine as we know it today evolve with the arrival of new world foods
what why make a paragraph before that and if you get a critically did not destroy your diaphragm it's moving along with next next next that is going to shit his pants it alone
yeah i was said
they said about italian food but her her just fender a idiocy is so if a guy's a child has wandered into demands enclosure
run a dependent
just again
like every paragraph it just which is gear another thought goes into your head she's like you know it's reasonable for me to write this is sort of what she said she's an mean so she goes along growing season also homes without vegetables are abundant herbs there are only so many possible variations on hunk of me piece of fish
egg or things you can make for milk again this is another parent that a gold she goes it's not an accident that the northern reaches of europe are little fame for coronary excellent assessment
interesting and appealing local specialties tend to be either cheeses or some kind of alcohol those things are gay
she's booth rule yeah cheeseburgers and brad are fantastic i was like fuck fucking watch and any more dana any were once in awhile go to like denmark and like this is the best and current never had the colonel kind of digests ideas
it's jack in the box or just in and they come out sort of fully formed but unlike a soupy shit that fills your toilet and leaves a permanent stain and it's like she starts up by going well you know we can guess that julius caesar was known to eat spaghetti and meatballs
throw a pizza pie in the air because empire is implicitly good and then supported the iraq war
it
actually that he didn't have those but you get my point
to what i it's already get a little forget that ten minutes bruges leave the stain or brown ring around in my mind forever
fresh again your brain toilet flushing again the brains are moving onto the next paragraph again ironically the tenacity and abundance of italian food culture may also be a trip in an the tenacity
you've got to failed to succeed
the as and all the haters all these haters try to put keep italian food down it may also be attributable in part to the intense reasonable strafe that followed the roman empire and the poverty of italy's long decline of reddit go away
period of money and the opposite of that's okay good
as my colleague as my hobby tyler
cowan
that was another a complete know nothing shithead as my colleague tyler cowen at the george mason school for orphans study
and experimentation in studies as noted in his a marvelous book an economist gets lunch
readings next up on our readings
economists a very thought of reading that book
i'd rather have it every day off the
the i'm clicking through the hyper link to the books paid
kill myself if you do a leading your car
kill myself
to tourniquet this fucking living room with the been why i was told by that and black
no getting away with this
tyler cowen notices that in places that industrialized early mask commercial canning and television proceeded to technological and logistical innovations that made it easy for us to get decent produce your in those places hungry and relatively poor people developed a taste or at least tolerance for bland process food made power
well by lashings of sugar and fat then came television which favorite meals that can be eaten one handed in front of a screen that's her that's why she thinks food became this you summarize with him
he sit on the that's when she thinks food got bad so if your culture
a pre exit preexisting pretty existed and came before television and mess agriculture you still have good food was and if you had it afterwards then you're just used to shit and it was watching tv and either way why did one hand for to watch him to you because you're jerking off and the price is right
she also says and women moving into the workforce which favorite anything that can he can quickly
thanks to its relative poverty italy came to these things late and at a time when global food supply chains are improving so italians held onto a food culture the price care and taste over efficiency and ability to withstand a hardship and process all these things are probably part of the explanation but they cannot be all of it because why
almost a century after the great wave of italian immigration ended or italian american still noticeably better fed than say they're irish american parents are
i'm already fat boy ah fuck it made jokes about leg irish food but that's just because we don't like the people if you go there and they have great brad they're fantastic lamb i mean they have like five meals but like a good five hate the man british talking about watch these on
the all these are the most on the provable assertions and the history of the problem is her ray science is inaccurate right that's right it's not like now like us accuracy
on the ground or is as the anthropologist are fond of telling us culture is a mystery is now an anthropologist
opposite of
just tell us i quit
just like megan did two things wall just mainline can mean and writing this article she watched the godfather so she sees the same were clemens is like a fork in pussy
look over to the meat sauce your fucking ivy league pussy and then was like oh italians have a great food culture and then she watch the third indiana jones movie and music while he was an archaeologist all that
anthropologists same thing just didn't know there was a holy grail
you through those two ideas work together
and here's a call and get paid three hundred and fifty thousand to who knows of the votes going on in the world and the pelicans be evans
anthropologists tell us that culture is the emergence of millions of individual decisions so we cannot replicate italian food culture we can only try to figure out how to lead as many people as possible free ride on their cultural labour
here's here's how it gets really at this is where this is where she begins also think
it at home and the other thing is that she's complaining italian american immigrants with italians the throws a whole thing off and destroys their entire yeah okay new york yeah she like eating like squinting a fuckin pasta and she is literally paulie walnuts when he goes the naval as i can i get them
because new york has more than his fair share of italian cuisine
perhaps some denizens of a town or neighborhood of a certify of the italian american character will take pity on more bearing holiday or he climbs again mcardle grew up in new york
little italy is now two blocks down and you know what i'm sorry i i like the chinese food is just chinatown i don't like their i mean are there real like an alien never really not really an airline
i will take you to a pork store that i but they're not a crowd gardens and someplace and yeah right
the best fucking an italian place in new york and martin and his is in i guess it's and clinton hill like things matter
there's a ton of like actual of l a n shit like upstate to
in may and and
boston which has east them
in rhode island which is like night and lap
a great italian restaurant on the pacific garbage barge
continuing but has there been a fantastic
today it's a restaurant operating out of chris christie's neck for
oh my god the bread
wow while you just said
i mean his folds created natural use it
of course he continues of course without a critical mass the food culture will dissipate into a sea of oreo o's and taker taught rules so we need it
we fight we need at least a few thousand i don't like either
least a few thousand to move en masse this is where it gets really interesting which reminds me if only we could spread french cuisine the same way but since america has pitifully few recent french immigrants this may require some sort of special visa program
towns
just okay
get a rest is these the last three graphs their short but this is rick it's truly special because megan is proposing in her mind a solution don't think i have a be to which have made a problem of the not being enough italian
these us three hair grabs i just want to say if you're easily offended or shark don't look at what i'm about to do myself
excuse me
here we go towns could even entice italian food related businesses
tax abatements and special grants enabling to relocate their linoleum their mass cars and their battered still display cases it's a new homes of in the great american food desert no know you put it a cube of hair gel and a wife beater underneath a box with a stick on ace way to they were
wander in and then he said surroundings and the world
dying of opiate
going to fucking catastrophic climate change in misery and people are killing themselves the time it just all these small towns like indiana jones the rose bowl a larger gonna be like is so we're going three billion dollars into debt to get some pursued
here we we began the episode talking about the terrible problem of health care and like the lack of health care in this in this country and megan i'm sure she's written about health care before about how that's not actually a problem she's written dozens of color columns about how why like it's the lack of everyone can just go to emergency room
in her mind it's a lack of italian deli in the great american food desert there's a problem that the government through tax abatements what's she what's stalin did to the nation of chechnya
the war two she wants to do with italian neighborhoods in the east coast and just put them on fucking cattle cars out to the great american food desert as she describes it in bed but no she wants to lure the greed has to learn them with tax abatements because she's a libertarian keep includes by saying this may seem a little extreme to you must thousands of our fellow
citizens of earth themselves simply to improve the food culture elsewhere to even ask such a question demonstrates how dire the problem is if you cared about food properly which is to say as much as italians you already be recruited in and around new york but it just her whole part before that was the political culture is
this yes syria not be able a million things and how what
there are the result of like when you're a mass culture interacts with like agricultural innovations and canning and television i think you're on charitably reading her interpretation of culture i think she's saying it's it's that when the moon it's your on
that's where you have to start if you want to start to study or spread but it's like does it doesn't the government already have a program where they relocate strong very close to culinary really gifted italian families to the midwest under new name
i guess it doesn't work me
okay so that's meghan ricardo literally the most pointless thing ever and i'm going to kill you
in say however however i was there is like a nugget of something interesting their the first layer is that this is what people like megan mcardle think are actual problems in america
like i said we began this by introducing wish she doesn't think is a problem is like a few hundred people dying in a deregulated fire trap or let's say that millions of people don't have health care can't afford it that's not a problem to her and what is the fact that not enough people get excellent shark eatery in places with cracked linoleum and mass cards on all
tiny registered that's just fetish just fetish icing i want a place that she however what's also interesting we've talked before about how conservatives had this idea about like unemployment and shit and problems is economically depressed areas in america is that people should just move but they also like blacks on constantly about the important
like community and like being rooted in the ice and how important that is so i mean like i've been the last one who's to say what you should do displacement is good for poor people down yeah so again megan just sort of like was like boy i like italian food
write a column on it
again it's just like the grinding pain reality of her prose and the just sheer idiocy of her thought process us really i think makes or one of a kind and
every show now will just be reading or all the miners should learn to throw pizza
to be then because i'm going to fucking die
i will die if you're doing this sort of food
felix is oh he's hung himself
oh well
if you'd like to apply to be our replacement coast for felix to peel box for twenty sixty nine
penn station care of our sons productions aussie ten thousand thanks for joining us thank you

we'd somebody recently was on twitter and airline they de m me and they're like
brian i'm listening to your all your back catalogue and i'm listen into a show where you can't stop talking shit about how c b d is fake
sell it
well i've got at a change of our since the head of the first time you try to you walked into a smoke shop on campus in had some like gum or something and you were like the guys it is now i can't get high i can't get high for the rest of the
that's i was mad about that yeah i know that people have gotten mad about meters by and you know with medical marijuana retail marijuana available now people are afraid of course of kids using it so i've begun dosing water
school districts with c b date
they can legally take that legal marijuana but they won't get high i just one thing to me no more heavy medication rather just be chill i just went to my daughter's middle school my daughter is in seventh grade and i went to our school first to drop something off earlier today and i walked by and as like this is so ohio they have a narco
can kid in front of the store and i kept ever these kids do an airway
not shit
it's ohio yeah i guess it is well those cops have done that thing now we're like if a cop gets like food poisoning or something like i think somebody sent me with a little bit of fat know it it
yeah well i love i love and cops are like that's like the tier above abortion survivor
cycling like i was in the same room as know it's like you know it's not like you don't just instantly die if you touch it know we had a police force here that claimed they were is flyers put on their cars and they had been dipped in fact nelson when the cops touched than they would over know
then they put pepsi and our car knowing that there was aborted fetus parts in there and they give us apples with razor blades
thing as wild i just we have a new one of the ballot measures in in ohio this time as issue one in its treatment for drug offenses no jail no jail time for drug offenses and there was a dark money pack now that's putting out these memes that say if issue one passes a person that's walking around with enough now to kill ten
she would not go to jail
you get that number
i love that i love like ten thousand people or four hundred elephants
the packers probably funded by private prison
pretty sure that's disgusting i know i know i saw its the police still yeah at all
yeah ohio's cop i'm in columbus is cops are like now becoming the one that people say when they say there's corruption and it's like they just arrested they are they arrested stormy daniels yeah
yeah
now the vice squad so they arrested stormy daniels in about a month later
the cop shot a woman who was like a sex worker that was insane or he was fucking show at a store it was second even charged or what but now the vice squad is as they say the vice squad is our whole it was it right
it was it out of uniform cop with your shovel been trying to push her into a car yes yeah basically try the kidnappers he had her in a car and and apparently he parked next to the wall of a building so if she tried to open the door she wasn't going to get out a car so she get him and then he shot her like eight times or something
maybe going to fucking charging and though there are now i'm always he got oh my god
yeah he got off to said that they actually said she stabbed him and that's why he got off
well they don't bust and nobody gets in trouble here at the guy that just shot to me or rights and cleveland got a new focus got in a rural place like just they they don't get busted i mean they don't get busted anywhere though it's not like new york in l a or any other places like have done and as my only fuckin convicted van dyke that was like holy shit
i can actually have i couldn't believe that because in chicago we had like a special operations division in cebu
and it was basically just a shield can initiate like they were just fucking extort drug dealers and rob them of their backs and then sell them we didn't and it's like no one really went to jail vicious like our i we won't or we won't have the shield union any more you happy
you're not going to get these gripping dramas
so slightly not as serious brian
your cousin got a little with lot recently yeah you should a murder bryan on twitter you got to find this thing and the street fight obesity serious page but he posted something about a state rap who was an enormous piece of shit the state rap is a guy who say so a couple weeks ago
a little eleven year old girl was at kroger and she got a taste for shoplifting and the creepy as thing the cop with and see honey i don't want to do this you made me take you but anyway
an adult man rising and eleven year old girl yeah shoplifting fifty eight hours worth of stuff
and creating with a taser and and apologized say honey i'm doing this for your better yeah i mean i can't imagine if you're a cop like this get said so much on every pod casts that on every on twitter all day but like if a cop can't deal with an eleven year old girl the paper
just don't need to be but so this state rap in some backwards ass county in ohio
said well maybe she deserved it
if a kid gets if my kid got shot i would look in inward and see like what how i failed as a parent maybe these people should see maybe these parents should see how they failed when their kids get shot
taste or shot maybe they were just acting like a punk
my cousin posted something that was roughly like i wish someone would kill this guy how am i supposed to believe and the government and then he got arrested the guy bragging on his facebook page about getting him arrested and and hr have felony free speech is very important to the republic it's very important or relevant
air of are really ask him what they're using his facebook pages sort they say things about left his stuff on his face we get talking about it and but like he has stuff on it's like leftist like imagery on his facebook page and of course is he works for us so i think he had some street fight stuff on his page and area
using that to say he's like a radical leftists generous yeah he's black
black girl a family block but the good thing about our job is when i contacted a lawyer i talked to a person it's a lawyer was like you know shit breton i shut up about this and he has like you should check with their lawyer but the first thing i said what i told him what happened and the first thing he said was he got arrested and i was like he's like isn't that good
for your brain
i suppose i guess though but i think what do we had to go to jail
i mean like if we're going to make the thing and lake it's a death threat to say i would like it if someone like fuck like
then you just wipe alex three quarters of the good things online that's all i do is a hobby someone dies all day
saying i'm not saying i'm going to good or pace i'm saying like i would enjoy that happened yeah
and it's a guy with like maybe one hundred friends on facebook it's like he's not some influential guy that's like out there say like let me get my minions
said it was just there was one of those type
i feel like it was just the dude saw that thing and he felt so hopeless and then that's what came out in the thing about is that jake does work with those kids jake worth that risk and homeless youth
it came from like a very passionate place and was obviously a tear flight
neither but he's not he's not facing a felony any more they not have is a misdemeanor territory don't take our lead know which just really lucky and you like the regular guy who has to pay for a glint in premiums who you know it's a fucking rough world out there and you know just you know say to the next year
mom screaming and screaming on the x box message the person who killed you in cod
org and hit a heavy bag get one of those pudgy bags as a clown that you put water in the bottom comes back up and pretend that's all your enemies don't you know don't take a risk by been epic and i want our job
i want to do the new george carlin thing on your show roque were killed death shoot stack and seven
they were i have been stabbed the best burger
what it's all about another a religious miscarriage of justice is early going on
as a running columbus as a new york story
i was reminded every game today this is from new york would just call days ago
headline
transit obsessed queens man will not be released back into community
sorry says here ever since he was a teenager in queens areas column has been in trouble with the law always for stealing subway trains and buses
and the story goes on and it is basically about this guy who i regard to be something of a folk hero in new york's it absolutely i haven't heard about this guy before there and it's what it sounds like he's a guy who is this entire life has been deeply obsessed with trains
he was stabbed as a kid by a classmate have received by trees is part of his recovery and ever since he was about like a teenager he has been basically coverage during and
driving an actual trade like a c train at fifteen not hired by the it was covering for an employee you want to spend time with his offered that's cold
yeah this is perfect for of this is this is anarchic as bright as well
talk about ourselves fucking love it
when arrested for more than thirty times for for taking them on joy ride subways and buses
we were writing is sort a joy you can join my route
he will he picks up on these places he does the actual
i haven't being paid
it is now fifty three years old he was in brooklyn supreme court on friday hoping to judge if measure freedom freedom let him live in a supervised grupo instead he was committed to a secure adult psychiatric center
like a woman style horror show for sure
a man offered to drive the clay
was a job and supreme court justice roof shilling for who would not agree to be seen on camera sided with prosecutors who argue that mcallen is dangerously mentally ill when you know why this is why you can ever vote for prosecutor for any political office the as like this is a wonderful all
whimsical man who is actually helping the community and has this amazing interest in this thing the city and state led fold total disrepair and this for this fucking law school
this joyous fucking hawes is like knowledge is put him in a cage for however much time it's like you know
just this wonderful whimsical guy are sociopaths prosecutors are fucking to break that habit
this is the first incident said in nineteen eighty at the age of fifteen various was arrested when he drove and in the service he trade he was covering the employee shift so he could visit his girlfriend a passenger concerned when she saw a young the area sitting alone and the operators give the train was stopped and various was arrested
the news of the young subway banned it was sensational their throw through all of it
revealed to the authorities he was working for the game
oh really
banned it how is he he's like a bandit is wally
a guy sees a python on the window sill and find is a quicker way to cool it he yeah it is days link tell the aid in town that was fucking cool
as a comrade
what they called on i just all this thing
so he returned to school but then he was labeled a true it is feel you should reform resulted in this confinement in a mental hospital it was there that he was given heavy doses of anti psychotic medication and he was diagnosed with depression psychosis over within days of his release from the hospital areas return to the subways and t friends were so pleased that he had
not reveal their complicit activity that they walk with him back into the fall
transit world was a violation of his probation and he was sent to kill know so ninety nine of course he was diagnosed with asper syndrome but he has like by all accounts a savant like understanding of the new york city transit system both buses and subways yes it's a type of do that
you feel like see i know our job doesn't exist in nineteen eighty nine hundred and eighty a guy could just get in a tourney
dr people the people that work for the train or like it's pretty whimsical it's with this guy's doing and i i i wish we could pull that off because that guy should just be a character in his part of new york
give him a job at the yeah
they destroy i mean this sounds like a great position
taking somebody's and instead of utilizing their magnificent skill you're putting them in a cage people people hate any type of greatness
hey haider eyes of true greatness for the past forty years
in jail for charges involving transportation is never get arrested for crimes of violence he has never injured anyone is banned from a rail yards bus depot other official offices what if his many efforts to find employment areas volunteered at the new york city transit museum a job you love but he was fired when his boss ultimately realized is that
oh shit
oh this guy who laid
the more than i ever could
that's off the fucking tragic
as a part of this following nine eleven various volunteer at his knowledge and skill to make the new york city subway system safe
various lead a team of federal agents york city intelligence the factors in new york the police to the subways subway system identifying locations where intruders were able to enter without being detected
various was actually incarcerated run
take it in shackles from is growing as eyelid by theme of federal agents to tour the subway system assist in law enforcement with their efforts or his contributions the earliest receive no benefit instead the department of was notified the various was easily been any
terrorists could gain valuable knowledge as a result he was placed in solitary confinement
he'll imagine the fucking fat guido minutes like i care to katie that someone could use points brain to initiating islamic style
yeah i probably am online what if osama bin laden gain access to professor x's cerebral
the way it was easy though it was like so easy after nine eleven to just be like i bet i think this guy's talk and osama bin laden
no maria so finally i be the last summer he was arrested was in two thousand and fifteen where he drove a greyhound bus around new york city and
he was ultimately arrested at gunpoint by five new york city police academies
this thought all the size of you know where he's going to go he's just follow and around but
prosecutors have argued that he is a dangerous criminals to be put away for the rest of his life and some horrific of mental institution wear were of thinking here there is a go for me going on right now he's currently incarcerated were putting it up yeah but there is a go for me for his legal defense i mean i think this is
going to be appealed hopefully but i mean i remember learning about the story a long time ago and just thinking what a folk hero this guy how the guy who just you know rides in works the trades
this
i've said this before but if the emperor north more now the first time he tried to stroll into a nice fancy restaurant downtown san francisco you would have been strangled to death by some mech fucking cop psycho yeah one week they would not have fucking plaques of them all over the sun not just the fucking cobb psycho but like your the prosecutor
how do you do that you go into the court you like i want to throw in this wonderful man who's never heard any age ages helped has never once committed an act of violence or even put anyone's life in danger through his action then what do you do you go to a ball pan
okay live the rest of your empty cosmopolitan existence you a look in the mirror and wonder what the fuck you're doing with your life to fight they are you wanted to do when you let a law school you know that can creep they'll think er sant water sit in law and order of fighting the good fight we actually just like last week there was a story in ohio about a
a woman network a giant eagle the deli counter giant eagle and she would eat like four to five pieces a ham or salami every single day that she worked there she worked there for eight years and the loss prevention people at fuck in at giant eagle fired or and impressed fallon
he charges and said she eight nine thousand eight hundred dollars worth i am in the times
oh now see were in charge with grant that for hang out if the were just like smuggle the peace
if the great escape just smuggling lunch meat out of the place in her stomach every single day
she was just she probably cut to images was like one fattening and five
picky people there oh that's too thick oh that's too thin those are all separate
that's what law that patient moving the ham from the rocket was stored or stomach is individual taking of tiny land that would he leave like a class z felony and misdemeanor just as so they don't they don't add up now
no an obscene it like like the loss prevention guy is a deck obviously and he's the type of do that
loss prevention guys like the yellow punishment law a guy
no but then there's like that with to with the cops and then it went to a prosecutor and now they're in court and this is still going on this person's been charged with felony for the just say like penises
our society
yeah it's so gross you live in or if you make under like eighty thousand dollars a year you live in an authoritarian says i am saddened say you are
her radical boot if you make under that amount of money wasn't if walking country you're so you're so underrepresented in any kind of government like democratic structure that you're effectively disenfranchised even if you do oh yeah and it's you have no ability to change this at all though and they and they use and the only way you see
the state is is this is awful croak coercive to boot and of course no one really love them and up becoming like
for wars conspiracy guys because that makes sense and like the state is a concept is just the that fucks with them like i remember that that bundy ranch guy who killed those cops in las vegas i don't have anybody remembers him and his girlfriend who dressed up like the joker harley quinn en las vegas strip they shot too
yeah they shot two cops at a pizza dropped and gadsden flag on the bodies and then ran into a walmart whereby the way they killed a good guy with a gun
to who is there and he was a concealed carry he saw the guy and he thought oh at computer engage and he didn't know that the girl was there with him and sheep little boy okay and then they ended up dying in a shootout with the cops these this guy by his life story i think he's from a higher is in the midwest
shitty schools and then his only in a counter with the government was that he kept getting arrested for pot yeah all the time and it fucked his life up and totally like robbed him of his ability to really do anything besides just sort of scrape by and even when he started getting better at that something else will happen and he get not the square one
that that's the state of course it's like a drop by reptile rothschilds or whatever the fuck while nothing like that thing about it is that like that's why it makes me crazy when nice like rich liberal type people go on twitter and talk about like these poor people vote voting for donald trump and stuff and yeah they don't vote because who would who
i vote for like if if i don't know if you make twenty five thousand dollars a year you don't you don't care who's the president
unless years
shit this president we've you make twenty grand a year
they're trying to leave the house without getting older assets seized fucking cage for a decade a salary
if over drop and it's like you want to know why they did because ever since you got the nomination till now the establishment attempt to undermine trump is the emphasize the he's not one of ours yeah he's not part of the establishment and so it's like yeah you mean like an asshole who make my life shit
contribute everything that makes it hard for me to live you saying he is the opposite of you guys the he's the total antithesis of everything you are saying i might have to give this guy a look
you mean they're by hand for fifty cents a pound she's carving it up and selling it for six dollars a pound and doesn't have enough money to eat a fuck and ham sandwich on her break and borrows a few slices that are going to go in the trash anyway with a ways to have the food yeah the food all its up with the got the of garbage dumpsters are unlocked last don't
efficient distribution of resources that's what you get this happened this is such a thought
oh my god yeah
it has that i do is that ohio's struggling keep have recently we've had order episode verge of were just talking and without us knowing it were just like slowly walking into an abyss yeah yeah
our whole thing now is that we got to college where people say know my boss is ripping me off in fucking me over and it's like oh let's make this fucking
looks have a laugh at i funny
my idea late for our columbus episode sons' lives show was like let's watch a movie and make for today
you was just that we just talk about anything at all that happens and yeah i'm really on all the human condition is just pure authoritarian misery
you give anyone powered all that he lives in the middle october so little they also like the weird thing is is like you can spend all my village you're going to spend probably three days year and you're barely going to see things about the police were like the thing that shocked me the most about getting the new york is when you're
about fifteen miles out in new jersey there's like flags for the police department there's police graffiti all over the play at least have at least the police are upfront there you know because i suck at think but this neighborhood as a development
they built this in the sixties it was originally blue collar neighborhood know it's a blue lives neighborhood
i would love to be like the market go pro police graffiti that will be good
i want to be the bank c of of verbal i want to be the guy that came up with every time a cop gets shot that sells the stickers and says the name of the city and and strong after it didn't
hurt my favorite thing about the blue eyes better movement
yeah because there's an official who lives matter fucking twitter account i don't know how they got their check mark
not fish they're not like an organ or anything it's just where the guys the most january out with the ideology
we actually had a round robin tournament and of course they posted every time a good shot like look at this but then they also posts every kind of kept dies in the line of duty which means like yeah he was in a donut shop and if i could choke to death on a corona they have like all these cards like accidentally discharged you know up and then sometimes like i think it may be an algorithm because they just post a like six
getting arrest but there was one they posted it was like all got arrested for rescuing animals during wildfire
what are you saying we're keeping like a little thick were sick
we're keeping the people say or how good our idea was a blue lives magic yes the route com for cop s
i mean that that blue lives matter stuff is so big like everywhere we traveled and like the one thing that we notice when we were on tour through the midwest was that you never see a blue lives matter flag or anything on a shitty car it's always
thousand dollars ruggedly
that's the classic felix tweet from during the black lives matter protests when he says i don't understand why they have to riots says man well cops put his groceries and as porch
every guy with a new s u v or something is like he's like all you do is show cops you respect them and they respect you
it's wonderful they're my best friend
it's like yeah you're like a rich guy who rich white guy he smiled at them
wait i don't know why they do their job they talk about college were attacking you specifically they talk about cops the way people like give advice to people like hiking about bears
always you just don't show any fear yeah
are really comfortable around their personal armed guards
these guys but my favorite my favorite my favorite death are
bless her account will report the cop tragically died
in pursuit of a suspect on foot
he'd been in effect
you just blew a fucking a order well as to run for half a block or like every plane on know everybody like the resisting charges such bullshit because like everybody's afraid of the police now because everybody except for like three hundred pound white guys like work at the local mill that doesn't exist anymore
i don't like you know like an engineer isn't afraid of but everybody else if the cop starts talking to you go into panic mode immediately i actually when we were touring in virginia we got pulled over and i thought panic has he been in the car vapor being out of packs which really fucking smell
in the car and i was and ass down a hill and i got to eighty seventy nine miles an hour
and it was seventy have gone back then i don't i do that and i wish i had this guy pulls me over but i pull over on the wrong side of the road to the battle his i pull over and he pulled me over but he looked at me and he was like this guy's like just a scare dad has never been pulled over before and i was just sit in a car like
i sure wish i hadn't done that and eleven
i can let us
yeah man fucking blue lives mother funny man you just have to act scared of them that's how you deal with the police now yeah when they up you and that's a huge they want they want to see you submit to them
they want to be god forbid they want you to show the belly
there's all those there was a kid
this been a few years ago to totally forgotten his kid in miami
i believe got like grabbed by the screw off by a cop and planted on the pavement arrested and roughed up because he gave him a quote hateful look yeah that was the cops test about a guy look at him wrong we had a guy here that said the guy was talking shit to him and he was on the ground handcuffs so the
the cop stomped on the back of his ad and it was our camera people that video circulated in that guys back on duty
a neighbor and he also had shot another guy he pulled up they do this summer policing program here where plainclothes police drive around an unmarked cars and try to bust drug back those law and they jumped out of the car and this fucking guy took off running because he was like these two guys are chasing me with fucking guns and they shot him and back and the same
op also cake the guy and back to the head he's been a problem zach rosen people know his name in town and he still works
like he has been in trouble yet and it's fucking either one of my favorite new york style pizza place
because they were raising money for that
i had a picture of him sitting on a horse with a black girl standing next to the horse like a little kid and i was like what the fuck
love
i love all the like every time like a cop just like and loads of fucking bazooka into a child on a tricycle there's just like a totally organic story words like a cop played a pick up basketball with china know look at this cop doing the huge dance
drop where did we have a columnist polio cop now that's a dancing cop and he goes to all the rap concerts and dance and
we only got one of our boys and blues your know he comes down does the dog in
mock did you have you seen the video the f b i agent at the bar like he's like doing that he's back flip his gun and also
she gets this poor woman
more recently than me
f b i agent if you guys seen the it's beyond
a video of the horde cop yeah a cop in uniform at a club just like taken his phone out like just get good
of just it has
this guy inflated of i'm just doing her ass is like a foot in front of put photo but it's like that such a weird thing to do yeah like even hours i've already guy were already geiger the urge to be a public like i gotta get this yeah
just annuity and
it's like this fucking cop sees the he's like
pretty great but i'm knocking i know i'm not going to be able to remember it
that are being able to remember things like last year and oh no amount of money i blurry video the it fucking back if that cop gets in trouble though and they show the video that someone else recorded as in recording so was asked at the club i guarantee you his defense will be the same as the event guy who just got
found guilty of killing mcdonald
his defense said yes we all saw the video of you just like this goes could be walking away or just like in no way lunging towards you from ten yards away with a three inch knife you shot him like i don't know how many sixty six
first of all day testified that he was shooting at the knife and you should really out of his hand like a cat
that is like it even follow mill or something
train you to speak to your manager the i actually have slow motion ability
i am able to go on the bullet time i call it a cop mode
i was doing i was curving the it as in the showed in the film wanted
he's such a shithead that he found a way to be convicted as economy my
cook county jury your fucking idiot the the only way they haven't is because there was video of and even that is not a guarantee that oh not out yet
as a reporter and of activist in chicago got together to leak it get it out there it was going to be fucking buried forever and we know for a fact around them manual kept it hidden for a year so that it wouldn't come up before his real change and as that's probably i think why he's not thinking another term because he knows that that's still a time bomb
if there's like a smoking gun proof that he held that back is going to blow up all over again and it's just going to destroy his career so it's trying to go out on top so yeah we saw that video right and it's arguable what happens on it yeah
however in addition to him testifying that i was trying to shoot at the knife
his his his defense said uri like yeah you saw the video but we are arguing that the video is is irrelevant
to the matter at hand because the video doesn't show what he saw from his perspective
cop will just be like yeah that video of me that will have to work in
see when i have seen from my respect
ah cuellar ass
those assets
filled with explosives i i was i when i was looking for any identifying tattoos i can afford it to the isaiah eyes
horny thing that has been make me laugh lately is that right after that stormy daniels thing it came out that the columbus police department had been doing all long term undercover staying on all the strip clubs and
it was going to israel
pay high quality of our oil will pay hundreds of dollars for fuckin l o a lap
fuck fucking taxpayer funded stripped the strip club at the end of which they get to arrest every yeah yeah that's disgusting watch commander i have tactically asked her cane did not think several the dancers actually like me as a person
i got a shot at
she's you comment get on house where my body
i have created a perfect
square perfection
so i can ascertain myself into my tactical george jar
not to bring for non it
with over watch for
over mr kitty
oh my
six fucking months
investigating the sea of strip clubs are given hand jobs didn't have back then
novel idea of his abuse of power by screw that they decide that they're going to do a literally politically motivated hit these guys basically deputized them to donald trump
and said we're going to help you mr president because we love you so much we're going to take this lying bitch is getting you in trouble with her accusations were going to make her look less credible so they literally just in trapped her so that they can discredit her allegations that's just like a fuckin that's that is literal fashion
i wonder like i would love to hear like how this all how because they didn't really talk about how it all went down because of to columbus police department most police departments they don't have to tell you shit
when they arrest somebody they don't have to make anything public
i just don't even know how they got away with be and like we're going to go arrest stormy day and
what a fucking idiot what a fucking bunch of eighty will take even because it's illegal here
there's like the strip club laws here really like
they're really specific it's like you're not allowed to like put your finger on a nipple and they're like oddly specific so i think that it just they were waiting to see one of these one of these people trip up and it didn't take much to arrest her that was wild
again it was retaliatory i think yeah one hundred percent i mean if you're a vice cop you have to be a trump guy gets one hundred percent
i think about that a vice cop is just like a guy who wanted to be a national review bathroom sick a writer but with some somehow too stupid for that
like a guy who's obsessed with sick or something and then do whatever it takes to find a sickle
only the bottom of the bathroom floor
this goes it's like are you sure you know you're for purify in a look within maybe they spend all their times being fucking tyrants like starting says we're reasons
pig
shit like i'm doing it for my kids that don't have but you god willing i will a
yeah no absolutes wine i don't think anybody i do think like if you went around and ask like one hundred people ninety nine of them would say get rid of the vice the vice squad on any police department because that i mean like nothing they don't they do they provide zero service to any but
all right
so that is but an appetizer
or are little taste of the chapel street bike that will be happening wednesday night

how many aw like roger air
he's been as mad said quiet lately like the like the golden state killer
you know some ancestry dot com results
some interesting information oh no
no no no there's not need not be okay
this column
this is a rod column that really takes you on a journey it's really pretty special
and i'm thrilled to share with iran i
this is from just earlier this week
the post american conservative dot com is simply titled nathan's story
hard to tell where this one is going to go but it really in my interest is hate really takes i am i really hope it was just that he was fooled by nathan fielder
keynes and ends there is i don't like the idea of him telling someone's life story
it's about bringing bad firefly make philly
none of my clothes know what this is or where it's going by the work so i'm the only one laughing as here for the first time yeah i'm the only one who possesses the secret rod knowledge
i don't know about that
okay this is how it began what what a fraud was one of us
just as sick on there there's a stranger in the bathroom
just a stranger in the bang birth
it begins like this
i've had these two stories open on my browser for a few days now
i'm going i don't destroy my other hard drive
one is that in incognito town
i'm going to go ahead and post them as a preface for something very strange
the first one is about a rash of cattle mutilations out in rural arizona oh boy you know
fuck that point if i ever
and he's quoting from this article
a cow and ball were both killed overnight an ear cut off a section of hide detached the screw them in penis carefully removed the vaginal cavity god the blood drained he just describing the operation of a slaughter out
no discernible tracks were found near the carcasses which were lying near in infrequently travel the road little blood was found on the ground and the cow was wedged up into a tree as if trying to escape from something by the way the i think the news site he's getting this room is corrupted facts dot com
now it's actually from i'm i'm sorry we have to go back does he think that when they're scared cows high increase
it would certainly appear that way not from the midwest
he said the south east asia louisiana i know says gumbo
the loot they were wedged up into a tree as if trying to escape from something that mean this is not rod writing this is no rod writing by the way this is corrupted news in fact report dot com
it is decades of living in the scrubby pinion juniper forest north of williams the sixty six year old the hand has raised horses and small herd of cattle and seen animals killed by predators such as mountain lines and coyotes he has witnessed scavengers such as ravens and vultures picking it carried but never has he wins
mr deliberate dismemberment he saw last week for people to come out and purposely killed and mutilated animal for their own pleasure is just unreal it's sickening he said as he took his weather beaten hands into his well worn pockets
that's a little journalism they like
try to be a little to right early
around on in your hands in his pocket perhaps they were very special you know now this is a brand new salvage denim city slicker
this is why they have to start making movies about journalists just this guy from like you know the hawks bit press is just like oh i'm like the spotlight
especially since every time some pencil neck fucking journalists tries to describe any fucking like white working class guy they end up just describing a tom of finland painting
yeah i am really muscular hands and by
biceps i can't believe somebody would torture and kill an animal for their own pleasure he said walking into outback steakhouse
there is a twinge of sadness steelworkers voice but elation as he said we work hard play
the state inspector who is investigating this said this isn't random the people who were doing this i would say are professionals he said they was no way way when professional cow
i'm a professional cow vagina
yeah that that's the kansas city mob that the only thing they do any more i had a barrel for post
your understanding you show up at the bus station a downtown kansas city there's a guy a trench gaga wanna buy a cow pussy
like like that he is putting a mob boss is putting its out on cattle and bowl
i want their pushing up by spite of our border
okay so that that's the first story that rod how did his browser window this is the second and this is rod again
the second item is this description of a new show coming up this month on net flicks the chilling adventures of sabrina a darker take on the arty can't
renate
no
should have no he's doing he all right
i yeah i also know where they're going but haven't
louder a flaccid pro are feeling the chilling adventures of sabrina a darker take on the archie comics teenage witch character excerpt from a story about it now this is the excerpt not rod the series which stars
here in in ship who played don draper his daughter on man been as particular orphan daughter of a warlock and the human begins with sabrina spelman sixteenth birthday on the horizon a milestone for which kind in which like a demonic but mitzvah every which are warlock must minutes
yeah
yeah they're guy
must participate in a ritual that includes signing your name and blood in satan his autograph book like a bar mitzvah
and subsequently going off to what is essentially hogwarts from hell for sabrina however the choice becomes a dilemma she's half mortal to and while her father was a heavy a half or so
fucking a cat say something either dies or fucking does it so my mother my mother was a mortal and my dad is a warlock so i get my eye of newt at seven eleven

i had a mortal not in the literal sense of mortality but in a way to categorize the done magically inclined yeah see this is ray science they don't approve of
thank you which find her texas
the cards and rather care i don't think you need a theater
that is have and the community so going on it says the new teaser certainly drives home the fact that this is this darker redo of the cheerful ninety sitcom sabrina the teenage witch is coming from the makers of riverdale the dark streets all time he cars and trio of cool girls and matching outfits all keep it in the same universe as the hits
c w show but now is in riverdale just like staff quarantine porn like a porn but it's like it's like dark archie essentially in our area
where did you have less money
is that doesn't it
the models swarm have
but do you think i got a c w programming
if say having your game with right cause it cheerful but the viewing rot also approved of the nineties t g i f sabrina the teenage witch because i highly doubt it
he thought the idea of a talking cat was anti biblical i pure rod has an article that slick but really how can clarissa explains
it says just the end of the description of this you know he says but no beals above is here and seven foot tall angry goat flesh and thankfully a metro nick salem has been replaced by an actual cat l same okay
how do they make an actual can't talk
here's a ring as an a b c g i evolved years or they get back to rods actual commentary
this is rod breaking and he goes okay the mainstreaming of satanism in pop culture whether you believe this has nothing this has to do with spiritual realities or is merely symbolic is undeniably culturally significant the guardian being the guardian suspects that this new wave of pop up
colt some of which sabrina is but only one example is a manifestation of the political will
what is what does this church
isn't or keys an orthodox christian aren't they supposed to know i mean like my people believe that satan is like walking around and buying a bus ticket we have a very literal interpretation but is this this this even think this is not canon for orthodox people is why i'm asking i wish i knew anything about the sugar
i think like regardless what denomination rod is or isn't he he's going to switch around a few more times
but he he has a nineteenth century interpretations eight in which is like a mean guy new tricks you into being horny yeah
he went on tumbler any found half of push wake reading tarot cards and he's like oh this has got to stop
what about a greek orthodox churches that they do korean you knew the euros credit as are on
so it's not to worship in there because they keep all these exotic birds
ha ha ha ha ha
i've got this bird shit everywhere they have they have jesus on the cross but he's always turning under a heat lamp
the what the priest is reading scripture he's like yeah want to be for curse for dude
i'm not going to i'm going to skip over this guardian article because it's basically just about how witchcraft and cool and which is being adopted by young women is kind of a symbol of feminism and female power etc etc everyone here is a in the dark lord
which is good and cool
just the last quote from this guardian article says when you break societies conforming rules as young women as young women are you are punished the which is an icon to help young women be strong in the face of the push back they get every day so for me these new shows or heartening yes even the horror films okay now we're back to iraq
those first few things that i just talked about this is all a preamble to where the story is actually going this is like the prologue this post called he goes well i agree with harrington that the cold boom is a sign of the times what it signifies is another matter i'd say now that's a set up
you to tell you about a strange telephone call i received yesterday
grandpa same simpson as article where that
whoa oh covered over be the type of books on the colts will speed up as above
i hesitated about whether or not to blog about it don't worry about it too
get of his head as never hesitated before blogging about anything he's a pastor
the color an old friend from whom i hadn't heard in a decade or so gave me permission to blog about it as long as i kept names in identifying details out of the story his name was flash flood or
i love like ten years like this is true detective
the investigating you all back together to scour the mc bathrooms
so he goes
he said others may draw hope for it he wasn't exactly sure why he felt the urge to call me about the matter but he did background nathan as as all called my friend i forgot about neat and it's been so long even discuss nathan i completely last clean ember we need to talk about
nathan
you're hearing about recipe it's not as good as it used to the here's the back or nathan is a devout catholic who lives in a major us city and who works in a for sophisticated professional mill you he is in early middle road was tuxedos to work
he is it an early middle age a husband and father he and his family go to mass daily to fashion weekly i would have noticed
oh i'm sorry
you go to bass today's it i want to have been crazy
when it goes is why do you do that
is out
that's felix's me and my cousin character year we went to bat daily here
you know what this contest where we can go to any mass free for the rest for logs also not as if you if you were you a mass daily like you little you to skip a major meal
yeah do we get a foot up his nephew
ha ha ha
okay guys that's the background this is all the preamble are you ready for this turn here's or he drops
nathan started his story with his jaw dropping line for the past year my wife has been under the care of an exorcist
yeah
you never disappoint
i've never had that particular fetish but i get it
i guess i do
have you considered lancaster veron father
so i you think being caught by some guy that were fast friend spread their
i was about to say like what are the odds that he's like oh honey i would love to go but i see my exorcist
i have to go on a cruise is my exercises
oh shit will draws out of the my wife's services john read corn

okay
i don't know nathan's wife as well as i know him well have you tried putting on a habit or hey
but i can tell you that she is worldly and sophisticated even a lot is devour we are right
he is one of the last people you would imagine having a problem like fifth
you know i sound like a fantasy
damn i can't believe i got possessed i got sixteen hundreds on miles eighties
like i love that only bad people get possess very proud to one of us
the least agree to repossess
will not ever
my be mere man i think our felix i don't know
probably you would probably enjoy the demon to mind
can you imagine would hit it out
oh and hit it out
can you imagine i think we'll is the most likely to readers unwisely i don't know there's i yeah if you're a courteous man
you would be you but you were on this tour i guarantee your go to go to some antique store and purchase a strange lamp or violent just got oh that's cool i just drink it yeah year the nicest guy any like antiques
i feel like virgil like he would get businesses but the team would like his internal monologue would defeat the demon
ora ora we need our living room water that's gotta be a different than the bed or water because you're in a given how jesus as the prince of lies nice ad hominem why are you try some facts estate is just like thought
lucy shows back up and how i'd say was like
you are supposed to be presenting that guy for a longer time he's like yeah i can spend that much time in the bathroom
and let's get get the heck did carriers friend's wife getting plowed by a guy had a bishop fact
nathan sold me the story of how things came to this point
i won't give you too many details out of an abundance of caution
is he holding a flashlight under his chin when he's right not happen
rather it i just like this
this is the of behavior the midnight snack his own
goes it turns out that his wife had an eating disorder as a teenager and tried to kill herself twice back then
now in the middle of her life depression returned but with certain strange characteristics that seemed yeah maybe call
mass every day you fucking freak
now in the middle of her like this is what i was like just imagining what this marriage must be like and he goes now in the middle of her life
depression return but with certain strange characteristics that seemed off
he began to despise religious things inexplicably
and again he said they go to a mass daily
what what insane person wouldn't get sick of that
i tire me sick of the fuck a marvel movies and i see like three of those a year
you imagine if you had to watch like
yeah every fucking day which is the exact number of times you should go to matt yeah every time you don't have to go to mass daily no the dough instruction to do that like twice a week is crazy now i think james joyce use that as like a footnote for someone who is that extreme irish nationalists
you don't unless you're in like an occupied territory there's no reason to go to that my hairy i'm pretty sure you don't get extra grace for going to mass every day
to go to a letter had just frequent flyer miles
the mezzanine section of heaven with the open bar like it here keep your cat it is all open a guy who guy even imagine what their marriages like i can not you're going to find out by the guys there's a lot there's there's a lot more of this ago so i i gotta get through that so he goes when he
went to a quote healing mass there was a manifestation that indicated something dark in alien was at work at in her catholic exorcist today work in a professional way
that's not really ruling out all other medical possibilities to explain the behavior before they start the exorcism of nathan's wife has not been a single event but has required multiple sessions which are still going on
yeah daddy
the exorcism of this is why says a good porno ne the the nathan nathan has been part of the rituals
he was visiting cries in the corner
he told me that eight different spirits have manifested themselves through his wife
oh boy
yeah a strange strange being possessed my wife told me that she wanted me to make her cum once
eight different spirits have manifested themselves through his wife he's been at this long enough now to discern which one is which
they revealed through the rituals that they entered into his wife's family through her grandfather who was involved with the colts in a ritualistic way
when my family brings their work home
i love it when i just get should face to watch heretical but call roger hair and crying
but going back when he says catholic exorcist their professional there's no such thing as a catholic exorcist right because they have denounced actors
the have know it
oh my god get on that they still do it they still do it and white american evangelical protestants look modern i don't like i said though it's more professional it's like you show up and it's like that loony tunes cartoon you in the demon both punch in and say born and sam more and wales above
very professional
nathan said that depending on which evil spirit manifests in particular moment his wife is
there is dina there is patrick think i need to finish this he says nathan said that depending on which evil spirit manifests in a particular moment his wife's face contorted into expressions that he has never seen in her
nearly two decades of marriage yeah he's smiling
she's smiling
removing all the time is literally just describing been married a robin williams
is that were thing this is like every fucking day this woman is poor woman is that to go downstairs and her husband has his back facing her in reading her the options for breakfast in latin
yeah i wonder i wonder if anything about the marriage has your depressed know it's got to be the eight demons
he's basically doing she's basically doing like some sort of demonic fucking improv show
it's like i need one of the kings of hell and a profession
mind your gold the old you'd still try to take away from the show
however it's yes
mind you nathan is one of the least woo friends i have get goes to church every day of his life again he works as what you might call a symbolic analysts in a very worldly occupation and lives in one of the biggest i don't know what the fuck that
advertising rain so he goes way
oops and colors triangle square circle circle
finally normal
a church or five of the afternoon on a tuesday just him and bonita mussolini's grandmother
so he goes
he has been a faithful catholic for as long as i've known but not especially interested in that mystical side of the faith once you've seen reality through the eyes of spiritual warfare he sold me yesterday you can't go back it's everywhere
okay here we go he told me other detailed stories including accounts of bizarre pulsar go see things happening in their apartment and his wife being unable to stand the presence of blesses objects and then in parentheses
is a classic sign of possession
yeah i mean i brought home i brought home general franco's skeleton for commercial
to possess again readers he goes again readers if you knew these people nathan in his wife you would be even more shocked by all of this you are now
this is the kind of family that takes european vacations and lives a sophisticated causing an adequate as it yeah yeah
the family who goes to lords
and yet his horror has overtaken them though color that
he's got needs
the wife goes through periods in which he hears foul blasphemy is and feels compelled to commit suicide in the exorcism sessions nathan says the demons under composure compulsion from the exorcist speak of these things in particular how they intend to destroy nations wife and her family life
far be it for me to endorse the episcopalians but maybe it's time to take a step down to allow our church
just like anything later early anything be yeah whatever
be a fucking unitarian like and make fun of them but like it's nice to like give blink it's the poor people or whatever they do like the advice that probably coming you know
like the worst thing unitarian do is be on real sore throat
yeah
this is where and four when will she be free of them the exorcist can't say the fight continues in regular sessions in our long phone conversation well as i've known as the recession's a day
in our long phone conversation yesterday nathan says that this ordeal has taught him about the power of prayer and the churches weapons against these things he knows that his wife is not his enemy despite the things that sometimes come out of her mouth and he is resolved to hold from to fight for her
through his prayers and to help or be free of these militias intelligent spirits
i like the idea that there's just malicious don't the spirits
people talk about
my wife that he kept saying things like know if i win the lottery first we don't do it was bought a book in liberal a chilling old high school
nathan is the sort of man who would have been played by jimmy stewart or jack lemmon and the nineteen fifties you know how i
yeah
can you imagine that that's the worst movie ever made the man who love church
me tell you right back by wife she if it's so many evil spirits and side of a you don't even know why wife he put fifty in two thousand and evil demons inside of her it's basically it's please please please
he
so all mean that having entered into this world he has learned that more and more ordinary people like him and his wife are turning to exercise
that's a good fight for itself society a dick
i give you like like just like a cage for how you're doing as a civilization how many people are consulting exorcist seems like a good short he has come to see the demonic attacks on marriage and family are increasing and he wants people to know there is hope
but laying claim to that hope require is recognizing the nature of the battle i don't know how i would do if i were in a situation in which our be lying in bed at night and my wife blurted out i hate you
oh boy oh boy
a world i can't imagine a world where by yells i hate you instead of just muttering it quietly
oh like
worst thing you all like oh and i heard from the wise just pretend to be asleep
oh my god this is like it will at last be a demon who else could it be
i imagine you're lying in bed at night and your wife blurts out i hate you and then started growling and an otherworldly voice that's eighth is reality now
that sounds like that
to be our whole message that's that's like a pitch for cbs sitcom
if he is he's a good church go man she's process by
if he if she is like depressed obviously tremendously resent her catholics like husband issues like as a gag like one of just pretend to be pizzazz and growl at he fucking rocks
both iraq and coming
coming to cbs this fall my wife the legion
by the way i love it again he's is like of you imagine if you're lying in bed in the middle of the night out of nowhere your wife blurts out i hate you and then starts growing i think what he interprets is grappling is just the sound of her vibrator
he starts humming in a weird frequency that's she's was asked by eight david
the worse than which is named hitachi
or one of these people
they seem like they're really enjoying life though they're basically living in a d in the game
this coming back soon
oh i think i think my bag boy he's a drought
that's nathan's reality now why he is not afraid when it does this ever come back to the horse vagina is no no
the cabbage it rather oh yeah
you ever do that you accidently like paste your elbows on you're jerking off to
as around i mean i'm assuming he's claiming that these cow to sections are satanic ritual
same with the first the prologue is that like there's just a rise in a cult islam and demonic activists are but cattle mutilations are not the workers say this they are u f o's every fucking don't
can be utilized classic fucking
activity
what's a hard fantasy psi phi divide in this part
a passenger side of a fantasy world and everyone knows that cattle mutilations daily it's not fucking say i do aliens want to immediately cows

no i don't know that quickly and aliens are lazy
and as always the synthesis of these to these two systems
oh
where the allianz a real but their religious and are in fact name the covenant except the sadness aliens and there you go with wide open power felix is the best marxist among us
i've just a dealmaker to i love making deals made one
that's a sublease is was making deals as his is nafta renegotiate okay wait sidebar
he renamed the nafta
no renegotiate nafta is good deal
however he renamed it
the us mexico canada
and he didn't say deal but you know that he wanted tail agreement he said the us mexico can't agree because north north american free trade agreement was too bulky he just had to put list every country that was in false because he forgot
and you know he wanted to say deal well i mean wary eye on canada us mexico
the calm agreement
i'm up
okay back to nathan this is this isn't nathan's reality now and he is not afraid he has to play is early afraid he hit me yeah
that he's either terrified or full of shit
up up up not being afraid if i have yeah
david's it by while he sleeps next every night for that frayed buddy you don't really think are demons living next to you every night
yeah your analyzing getting caught
he has to play his part in rescuing his tormented wife dude just give her a divorce if you want to fucking rescue your heard from her torment to my money
even the know
play who i should say this is great
this is a great line for rod
yes a play his part in rescuing his tormented wife who i should say fully consensus to the exorcism she wants to be free of this through that's the first time rod has ever taken the idea of consent seriously
that sounds like one of those poly couples where the guys like yeah by wife is totally into it
a
what nathan's wife is going through now is like what director william fried kin
a non christian witness then film that his recent documentary the devil and father a more a he goes on to talk about this you william freaking documentary i mean i'm a big fan of the devil and father jones
it's a great movie so he basically just goes on here to i another letter from a friend of mine who met the devil when he went down to georgia
challenged their to a have accessed
oh really
this whole article rod
vouching for nathan's credibility is has been oh this is a guy i am with sometimes and he called me on the telephone
after ten years have no contact and
this really just shows how american he has his real vouching as he works with symbols
so he can't just be a crank yeah her amp or sand percent sign a pound sign you can he sometimes a euro sign that circle with the line through the indicate you shouldn't do something for it and better the killed key
i just i love our rod responds to like any stimulus that all like you're really that's really like only child magic i mean i know it's an older child but it's like just anything he's given he's able to create a world like if you showed him kingdom hearts can you imagine
not on
the walls are bringing down goofy he's met a roth say
anything would drive him insane
so that that is the story of nathan and his wife however if you're a fan of roger i like i am you know the real gems are in the comments or yeah yeah
this comment your mother said talk in hand
my suite mates
you know like a rug call it was like a day or like a fucking like like a port shank or something and then this is like the fucking the thyroid these are the people who write letters and call him on the telephone and the to be like rod my wife is working with them
our read this comment
the encounter i'm about to describe happened six years ago
oh boy i'm disabled and can't drive any longer okay i rely on friends and terror transit for the disabled to get around but six years ago i still took the bus fairly often the driver was moved from another route to the one i use the most often there isn't it
tangible coldness to the woman which i cannot recall ever having been in the presence of before okay this straight
let me at all
not kill me to have a good day i tried taking heard numerous times i tried hailing her numerous size as he gave me enough it
i thought that that
okay
and he enjoyed driving half a block past awaiting rider were stopping half a block short particularly in winter weather and most of all if the waiting passenger was obviously limited mobility
classic demon
that i don't know that's a demon i like how you know a report of of demonic activity is just a hippie yelp review the paper i experienced a horrible counter won't middle school a young man slapped all the books out of my hand
goddamn imagine how many millions john pradesh encounters and a daily basis
the slippers order was half an hour late clearly the work of meals
so she goes i mentioned her to one of the parrot transit drivers who looked at me with dread own
he told me that frida no kidding was president of the local drivers union
if we yeah
if you're a member of a union
you might be
up
as the stop when you're driving a bus my papers by the doubt
any working class hero is now automatically a demon a surly bus driver it was not kissing your ass is now a demon yeah god bless this woman this this kid who works at mcdonalds jacked off at a big mac he must be possessed by the devil
i just like the idea of a bus of the sign at the front just says
do not accuse the driver of being possessed little has even
so it goes here
one day i tried a little test on frieda
a lot to me that though

i tried a little test on frida before i went for the bus i took down a wall crucifix and place it in the inner pocket of my jacket
my trip to walmart was uneventful
any know is as big cat is like you feet high and has a sad he's it like she's carrying a saw shot gun under her like bubble goose jacket
so it goes you know convulsions or shrieks from free to however when the bus returned and i boarded to go home free to seemed incapacitated he sat behind the wheel as though in a trance and her eyes shut and head moving back in for her
this woman whom i never noticed whom i never noticed the human emotion was moaning as though she was in agony
i know it's anecdotal people can dismiss it
yeah fair here is the best part i know it's anecdotal people can dismiss it perhaps she'd just been assailed by been thrill crickets
i love catholics i love that
because that is literally out of the idea of exercise that began it was with another fuck it period
it'd be like that yeah
oh my
it could have just been menstrual cramps but i wonder
last last i reckon i find this paid him like buy her a big presenters
radical support for freedom
last i recommend hostage to the devil by molokai martin it's the hardest book emotionally and spiritually i have ever read if you lack confidence and jesus christ it's probably best that you avoid it
the
there's been so much catholic magic in the past month
supreme court
connor mcgregor
oil of catholics because like day like evangelicals lake
oh we have to adapt to the bone world and like we made our church and help
like catholics try to live in the modern world and just lake
to the older dumb as concepts in there their just like just hearing them like go about their day in encounter like people who don't like that and be like satan
see somebody will jam on their hands on
stick moto there you go oh getting mad at your face after you receive a five percent tip that's the work of satan
this gives me like a deep visceral sympathy for free that because it just makes me think that the last real job i had with where i became a five guess through which was i worked at barnes and noble and i before i got moved to the info desk which i was very good at night actually kind of enjoyed i was i was at the cash register
for hours i would get so bored and frustrated that i would slowly just kind of lose it and buy like our three or four which is almost vibrating with frustration that i was there and i would just be like just angry and i would just have to like consciously suppress my desire to scream about how awful this was just standing here
doing the same thing it's like it was the worship of the world because it was a combination of the mundane sort of factory reality of like working on an assembly line and then like having the smile at people that like having a customer service that was the worst of both worlds and had just imagine if doing that somebody come up to me
flicking holy water at my face
i don't think i would have reacted well i like when i was thinking like this week
you know about like different like dumb liar guys with my friends and i was thinking about this guy who at my old job of being a bouncer who you'd come when i would bounce in the back near the bathroom huge king out there and he was like the type of like dom liar guy who like befriends the manager of a bar so you like really can't tell him to fuck off
what's wrong with feminists who
and here we get free drinks
he's literally disrupted being a bar patron is awesome but every time a woman walked by a quarter
and was yeah she's saying there was one one time the most distant memory i have them is this woman like said oh hi where this guy's name was out of earshot he goes yeah you are almost a quarter put my friend texted me she had herpes and i just left
it it's great because you know that stories ally like why would you lie about that but just like just six seven hours of a time these like a mind numbing interactions and yeah i would just stare at one point on like a outlet plug for five hours just been like
this is all you kill yourself just because you feel like this now there's like the rest of your life isn't this is feel like this version of once they had a job
it's been a while
i had this idea the other day we all have rod we all love the police we all of her
and we all love the
letters that people right to rod that he includes his post real rattling as articles and i wanted to do with this kind of long term troll where i would in theory myself to run by his writing and an email saying you know i'm a good catholic got to go to mass twenty four seven i live in mass and
just as some issues going on and basically just write him and nine letters seem plausible and i mean like most of these don't seem plausible and eventually it evolves and just stores including
quotations from chairman mao
i would encourage all of you to just do that everybody if you have some free time just befriend rod hello
what's on your mind but make everything magical you know like oh you're really matter your boss but your boss is a secret gremlin one
alright guys that was really a manicure presents chopper trap house the exorcist starring rod air and may thing
pittsburgh pennsylvania
that is it for us and i think you guys so much
it's for you guys folk iraq we are sharper trap parents think you guys so budge
cheers everybody can i









feeling like my my my elevated sense of humor was offended by the crew to eat something like celebrity death match for at least there were fucking attempts at humor now is just no no doubt the joke is that they're all sad they all those jokes and both jack horseman they are there are jokes in it yeah oh oh
season three episode fourteen the depressed horse shit heard realizes that his attempts to spend an open relationship are stemming from him neglecting intimacy that stems from childhood issues good thing i brought my hand because that shit is a fucking nice lap
so why i'll i'll go and you can't play with serious topics is now what are some sense the way it does it is the same as always fucking shows which is to say you know this guy he's a shit but he is aware there is a piece of shit but that's not enough but then he's just going to keep knowing his pieces shells and especially on it has to go or
saying was wrestling
michelle i'm not i'm going to be honest with you dude i've never seen the show
i've decided that i don't like it
i don't think their comedy should ever take on serious topics in fact i think that the hate of comedy was when the main comedic genre was like fat guy trying to move the safe was so good yeah
i think there's i mean the shows weakest point i figure it's very feeble attempts at satire but i think what it does very well is it makes the horses tribulations like that
have a man
oh wait wait wait so he's doing the thing a person would fuck
holy shit to do oh my god what if what if the budweiser clydesdale self harm i got one for a while that
she'll be any different if none of them are animals
it would be there's jokes
oh no doubt of and you say and show as jokes the jokes are literally the puns because there any other upon the all the jokes are plans the lowest form of humor so it's the pressure on our jobs there's banter
what what what a project horseman was on celebrity death match against agent smith from the
enemy agent smith was like looks like you're going to the glue factory mr horseman our this before
when celebrity death that versus the horse head from the godfather see
oh yeah that's the kind of thinking that made that show brilliant i can't get coming up next a very special episode of both jack orson the one where steve platypus kills himself
so who it was also increasing you like this just shows also increasing asexual representation and media are now we're cooking
another slap her i prefer the intellectual and sexy cartoon for adults have an earlier era eon flux on mtv
i am flux
i was honestly too scary for me as a kid sister for me now hirst has and obama skinny everyone was assists
no thank you a little thing called stripper ella oh hell yeah stanley was involved in there
yeah it was it a block with surprises
spike tv is a adult animation block with the red and simply where they're gay and they fuck yeah and gary the rat gary the rat
who will be like the high point of of cartoons
a western culture and that's the culture of the make fun of the late nineties so much but
if you told us at the time
the best it's ever going to get a big no way i would argue we can be better than than than the partridge family killing the manson family and machine
we can do better than that turns out now can't do better than that and i love and happens depression and then everyone's brains explode and now all we are sad horses lynette too
iraq's well let's look at the news
yeah yeah let's take a look at the front pages to take our minds are as bad comedy out there
it's it's so depressing
rad it sucks so bad it's bad so let's rewind the clock to the beginning of the week
we talked about a day
mean news story that dominated the week up until you know a couple days ago was of course the the pipe bombs being mailed to prominence democrats and robert deniro yes and we that story
it resolved itself fairly quickly and predictably in that the person who did it was just honestly what of the stupidest
it was equally stupid insane man
that now but what if he has exceeded you smart and a as we said fox news brain destroyed boomer as i say we also you will you were on that episode version also know that oh no oh i know my older our act you were afraid that it wasn't of fox news mag now
i thought it was probably a faxes gravel but i said and private it seems weird how literally none of them work not by accident if you sent thirteen pounds one of whom will go up turns out not if you are this incredible moron
so is this fox news stripper with the magic my kicks ass with the deal with the trump detail van who was like a late bloomer early access or exactly when we would have imagined another interesting threads caesar say ah story is that he's also stealing native american vela he asked
multiple times he's part of the undefeated seminole tribe but apparently that is also bullshit yeah i can always okay
i was willing to hear him out before but now there are no he's lying about that's honestly what you're saying is running for the massachusetts
the real time
a lawsuit against cheap and nails or something because he had some sort of rival stripping company that was using their copyrighted material something like and he was claiming that he was working for ship and adolescent i said no and as normal manga stuff lawsuits against ship and dales a lawsuit against circuit yeah
they don't if you read it
his tweets it look at the van it's clear that he is impaired in i'm way but also not indistinguishable from one hundred million people on twitter
lately i didn't
but i thought the most interesting thing was that he had his house for close down after the mortgage crisis by
by a company that illegally robo signed his mortgage will happen all over the place and then it was later part by steve fucking many options bank so they'll trumps can't say for love his beloved trumps treasury secretary helped steal his house from yeah thank you mr president
it's wonder if you think i made it onto any
we're sticker on his car i don't thank you mr minute
thank you for a to do you have given me the honor to live in my van thank you for suicide squad against or is a thrill ride just as a quick sided then i'm here
i would say it's very fair to say won't be running requires me about this with every extra bumper sticker you have like one two three equals an exponentially increasing level of insanity i think that's a very very yes that's a sign that you see some of them are they
back in their car has over seven bumper stickers walk away it's true i will make eye contact with them have slowly back away
regardless of their political kona now
it has knowledge i had this tennis instructor who was like a run
very easily how many fucking chapter on our entire life
yeah
a hard core like nine eleven truth or and he went out and yeah sorry
yeah i can't believe you've been sitting on his a shitty beat up car and he drove around and there were pictures of american and israeli war crimes
on the windows of his car what guess that's cool how he must have been a really good terrorist threat any would and he said like yeah
people don't like it when a off
a lot of as the looks and acts but you know what era your serve was never better so totally worth it ace everytime the only time i ever want to drive is just to get the most confusing bumper stickers possible
i want like keep hanging i'm for i'm thinking of a free cyprus
i don't even know what they mean
powerful everyone who drives behind mirror
worth the accidental vehicular murder he committed most confusing bumper stickers go okay i got obama isn't muslim if he was it wash his hands

now what you got my other car as my wife i don't know okay
oh i got a portion stops my beating heart
oh okay okay
we already had domestic glad it's called circumcision
that's pretty straightforward i agree with that i would have were getting your and
if you tailgate me convert to islam
so yeah now i think i'm buying a car all here's what we're more calvin peeing on another calvin's face
that's like that's just like author or have era
calvin peeing on a word with the word is disrespect
and it makes you think like it's lazy democracies back for being a pro respect it's part of my viral marketing campaign for my awful new film cycles of hate that's about the lives of six people into research new york city and oh by the way it is this is an absolutely true and baffling bumper sticker there's a guy on
it's very park his car parked all time
any as back window cow
it's the sons of anarchy logo but it says new york chapter
yeah we don't have any motorcycles out here with the world's only motorcycle club the ride the subway baby
his family stickers
that but it's all nine supreme court justices
oh wow what be very is no one likes all of them i about
that's my team some people got the red sox i read this the record that sucks so much for joining us one hundred and i i fucking
it was only fifty out of the week us version or the supreme court justice bumper sticker idea so yeah there's the pipe bomb story which had the added benefit of
slightly frightening but more absurd than anything else
is this really was just like someone whose brain has been melted by fox news
the internet and he's already you know already extent mental illness i decided to send pipe bombs that like everyone he saw on the new everyone who was mean do his beloved donald trump okay so there is that and of course people were already in high dudgeon over an outline because it involves the tax on the media
and this overall question that we've been talking about again that this political climate of tribalism and disrespect and violence and know how is it over how he ever going to get better or change your problems are that of course the weekend rolled around and i woke up on saturday to find out that some fucking right wing lunatic neo nazi walked into a synagogue in pittsburgh
ugh just slaughtered eleven mostly elderly
jewish people and that one is just horrific and like they are even know what else to say about it other than the fact that hey if you ever even remotely you were concerned about the caravan or concern troll the idea that it is just an absolute
racist hysteria guess what you believe exactly is the guy who shot those eleven people oh yeah because i mean he attacked the synagogue very specifically and in his own words because of a jewish community group that was working to resettle refugees in america he will need about the caravan i think about an hour before he walked in the door that synagogue
he was obsessed with the idea that you know what did they show that charles for the you will not replace us it was obsessive the idea that
jews are financing the replacements of weights third world immigration in america this is an idea that is aired on the conservative media and in fox news probably about it again an hour before the shooting and probably even after it that's mainstream republican thought i mean late one degree removed with them
any emily st george soros all the time like that's still see jews are doing this but they just say george soros enough liberal elites
like it's couch in those terms but yeah this has been this has been a state at the bottom of all this country's anti immigrant hysteria and paranoia there is that idea this is the idea that motivated guy this is why he killed eleven people he said to the cops after they're doing a genocide to my people all jews must die this is just
great out neo nazi all right white genocide fantasia the base and based around this idea that the caravan represents an invasion of america or a clear and present threat to you know our lives here in america
economic refugees from honduras just desperately trying to cross mexico or seek asylum in the united states
there was a lot of back flipping after the shooting a lot of contort eating their own bodies to would it just happened with the right who had just spent the last month screaming about people being rude to the d h s lady at the mexican restaurant
people being unfair to jeff flake cetera et cetera
you know taking on this very precious definition of violence and the most violent people in our entire political arena
just started become problem
let's raising awareness of the issues with raise awareness of violence all lives matter should whenever this happens because the moment that you actually started thinking about it is what will said just the logical conclusion of kevin mccarthy winning about how george soros is funding some great replacement anything like that and the thing is that they're actually
stuck with it which is why they're pushing back so hard and not really doing the sort of apology you'd expect after an attack of this magnitude because there is no other explanation they have nothing else to sell people when they're trying to explain what's going on in the world because there is a straightforward explanation for things like refugees
and the caravan and everything that people are scared of i mean you have a combination in central america of countries that are financially collapsed into not failed states with the help of american military coups and genocides carried out on me in the last thirty years and also reports now that a lot of people in central america
who are trying to move out are people in small holding farms the can't fucking grow anything anymore because all the sun there's an water for some reason sometimes happening while and economy they're coming from honduras by the way they had an election that was overturned by coos rotor by this country and hillary clinton
personal account as i threw say
overthrow guy who wanted to redistribute land maybe make it easier for a poor person to stay in honduras
like that's pretty straightforward but if you can't accept that as the explanation for this thing you have to have some sort of conspiracy because it's the only way to to square the circle of what's going on and so it's the same thing with the way the talk about soros and
you know there's a straightforward argument about the influence of money in politics it's that all the rich scumbags use their money to control the agenda of the government
but their ideas know these guys like the coax or whatever they're all they're all just concern american citizens who want what's best for everybody george soros you'll notice when they talk about soros their don't talk about them having any kind of self interest of the agenda it's always he has this like long term plan to replace the white people to some sort of subversion of our democracy
what does that get him
what what what so how does it serve his interest in it only serves as interest if he has some sort of alien agenda that you couldn't make sense of because he is different from you in some fundamental way i use a jewish lizard man and of course you know
i mean what happened on saturday is the single worst hate crime perpetrated against jewish people in american history
eleven people yeah it's the same boat of course we know where this is going again it could not be clearer who did this and why this is this is a this is a guy who hated jews he hated black people hated immigrants he hated muslims
dude in right wing propaganda in media who committed an act of mass murder on behalf of is very clear racist right wing beliefs
but we know where this is going of course i can i've already seen and delicate least a half dozen articles about this or tweets about this
it's all going to be like it's going to you about how anti semitism is so bad we have to come together to confront anti semitism be it the guy who just murdered eleven people or louis farrakhan or bt yes or anti zionism and they're already trying to do that in conjunction with the israeli foreign minister or they're like that
is taliban
the education minister who
among other things basically anyone below an orthodox jew is unrelated you etc etc he believes in a version of genocide reduce air but now i mean to this to those zionists it's like oh congratulations you've got the fucking world you wanted all that fucking netanyahu shaking hands
with fucking viktor orban probably the single most anti semitic world leader on the fucking planet
this is what you want the destruction of the assimilation of american jews do american life you got exactly what you fucking wanted and for all the people that spend all earlier this year talking about fare con or linda sir
or or fucking whatever you know it's going to come for you to and just don't fucking cry when you get what you want some going to miss you
lot of thing is good in tel aviv
not a big one thing going well
and this is part and parcel of like a huge and concerted effort to portray jeremy corbin as a vicious anti semite to a bernie sanders as an anti semite that's a cool one
i'm taking place in the background of as a reference netanyahu literally shaking hands and align himself with viktor orban in the far right wing nationalists in europe they don't want to use in their country and guess what
neither does netanyahu he wants juice if feel afraid everywhere in the world so that all come and live in israel now it is
fuck in know so he'll have friends
like a perfect marriage because
they are on the same page about muslims and they both want no jews in their country what what what the israelis zionist and the far right when her in europe or america share they hated squishy little fucking pussy diaspora you more than any because that's what they to leave
if they're not like we're like biological races with the hero choose instead they don't have a country that therefore they can't be part of the nation and the not trustworthy and that they they want to undermine all of your solid you know social orders that exist because they can't be part of it well if you send him to israel then it's amazing how quickly
up all those things so i mean here's a thing
there every single anti semite in the world have any real consequence or power and i'm not talking about like all right great burgers or people posting on the internet and talking about actually anti semitic world leaders media figures politicians guess what they all love israel including
our new friend in brazil paulson era yeah another and
the next thing but honestly depressed me more than anything this week
is the election of boston arrow in brazil an hour right fascist offices are no question about using our rate fascist who is spoken openly about the fact that he is immediately wants to murder probably tens of thousands of people extra judicially torture kill them
then pull those the fucking rainforests and kill every last indigenous person still living there
yeah like an out and out open fascists brazil's actual president has been sent to jail by that foreign country for maria for forty for the former president bill he likes israel so oh you know he likes israel now he's a big fan of israel lot of his supporters and of waving israeli flag he plans to visit there soon
yeah i did you really think paulson arrow or viktor orban be like jewish people personally no i honestly not
either they play they love israel they love israel and just the i'd be prepared for it because you're about if you have any any level of criticism of the israeli state or of zionism in general get ready to be guilt it into believing otherwise well i mean
new hero the resistance max boot has tweet just now where it says speaking of anti semitic dog whistles it's not only global and george soros neo con is often use the same way by oh my god
yeah okay
where's your cash a do
that is for you all right as to how you fucking warm what a fucking oh my fucking god much boot
that as i know it's not enough know
it's an office now enough for him to just like crawl back in the world after both the helping purpose out of his fucking diseased urethra
he asked every yes to retroactively make it make it unfair to criticize him or bill kristol or any of these other fucking asshole
the display that is the most nausea golfing for your second scumbags are the architects of a huge percentage of the current crisis that or it and they're just they just walked away from it and then like you know what let me tell you how to fixes this thing i help make aren't broke the fucking world
and now it's now it's now it's the same is shooting eleven for can used to death in a synagogue to call you what you fucking are go fuck yourself see what was so repellents about the immediate responses to the shooting
with so many people like maximum boots
for the whole the both you could have who's instinct was to use this to grind some other acts whether it was
about farrakhan or they're mad about being called the neo con i'm sorry again my lord i know i had a mattered sanders or again i don't i don't i can't believe i have to say this but i think it bears stating nation of islam numbers and out walking in the synagogues and gunning down jewish people linda source or is it
bt as activists or it's just openly killing jews in the streets of america
it's this guy fucking power and guess what he was on gab and fucking like every other right wing fucking shit hole like that that is who were there is no fucking equivalent of this on the left and and isn't that quotes because i'm not an american hundred thousand email and reactionary might buy anything economically colts
he has a right winger and as far as an axe to grind the attendant to like you're anti zionism is just as dangerous to the jewish people of america than like four on neo nazi his and white nationalism is this idea that oh you know you can't go over there
only the only this man is responsible for his actions and you know you don't do it uses the grind it acts against the president now fuck that trump is absolutely responsible for this shit i mean responsible in so much as he is open the gates all this he is fine that his supporters believe all this shit with the like he makes no difference to him
am and i think as i've said over and over again it's not that he says is for i'll go out and kill jewish people but in him being president and him saying things that he does and the people he surrounds himself with his language about the caravan and soros and and medio de mi and to me that people i think he is given
people who are inclined to do that essentially a kind of permission well that's the thing is though is that the way he explains what's going on in this country in the world to rile up these these rooms
i don't think he necessarily wants them to draw these these and similar conclusions and these races conclusions i don't think he cares but said it's the inevitable thing because it's the only way to explain the world if you believe this if you believe that there's this conspiracy that things aren't operating on any kind of record
nice bow material basis that that isn't just capital accumulation working its way out in imperialism
then you have to fucking have villains identifiable people not forces or classes and and they have to have an obscure in a cult agenda and so people are going to make the people have to draw the conclusion because there's no other way to make sense of it otherwise it's just it's just noise and you don't want that you want to be conquer
sweet enough for people to put their hands around so that they'll say on your side and keep going your rallies and and voting for your your guys were staying activator because that's what he is honestly done i'm like any politics american president i've seen as trying to keep his voters activated after he won which is basically the opposite of what obama
most presidents not even both very few of them even care to do he is trying to keep these people in that election day fervor all year all day throughout his entire presidency and that's kind of never been done but surprising because it is it makes sense to do that now it's small
politics but the thing is it's a piece people are going to keep getting more anxious it will be
keeping more and more scared of the they have to keep worrying about the caravan they have to worry about the consequences of the caravan maybe they were you ever they've got super airborne anything i want to clarify this point because it almost sounds like you're saying oh the republicans have just chosen this tactic of stalking
white supremacy in the country
whereas maybe they could have run on something else like taxes or whatever but i believe that it's the case that it's not a choice it's a necessity because that is fundamental to their movement whatever it is right now
i think it's i don't i think the thing wouldn't necessarily take it if they had other options but i think you're right that they don't have other options because it's the only thing that gets the popular gets popular passions up you're not going anywhere
people to stay motivated and tax cuts it's not going to work even though that's what you actually want that's what for both of these people are they really care about that's not going to keep these looting deep shit showing up at these rallies with her q shirts they need another story they need something more visceral and terrifying with something with enemies something with monsters something where they can be heroes and fighting
and that's not going to work with fucking tax cuts and getting rid of the mandate for obama care
that's why i have to figure wake every country that i grew up and like the best country in the fucking world to live with your jew it's not going to be the case because it's a miracle right that we haven't had as much of a cultural semitism is like france right because we're very we're one of the lease in class conscious
countries on earth oh yeah
and a lot of anti semitism i think a lot of it is just it's people who have never fucking mad a jewish person and you live somewhere where there's no one like that you will this fucking shitty life that socks and you turn on t v in yeah you see like lloyd playing find or somebody and you
you don't really know to do is you just you don't know like the cultural history or the consequences of the history semitism are you know billion things you would have to know like okay why why why as a separate group of white people it's like very powerful you would just have to suddenly figure
sure that this is an alley group that just wants to harm you and not just that like okay some like german jews
and finance and there's an achievement things are the simulation blah blah blah
but it's going to get worse from here because yeah the only thing that will keep people coming out is that election day fervor and the only reason most of these people vote is because fuck the other side
not excited about anything else they're going to do i give you working st paul this is exactly what the tax
exactly what axis is exactly why is enough and excited for that but if this is the only thing that keeps republicans coming out yeah we're gonna we're going to become more like hungry or somewhere like we talk about one guy in particular
which is very germane to this discussion of like is a republican party as it's currently constituted like is there any difference in the modern republican party and just like a white nationalist political party
steve king of iowa
steve king of i were poke and congressmen he is the closest thing in america that we have to like an openly white nationalist a european style right when he just the other week
to some funded junket where he visited auschwitz in poland
he visited auschwitz and then immediately after it gave an interview to an extremely right wing austrian newspaper i think where he said
it was very profound and moving but i felt the need to get a non jewish perspective on the hulk i wanted a polish perspective on the holocaust and i wanted to find out if the communists were worse than the nazis you know what happened is he went to auschwitz and then he snuck downstairs and in the room with a bunch of filing cabinets
and he opened up the box that says jewish lies and i found her dog
if they gotta they gotta honestly put a guard other door it's like it's getting embarrassing but i read lloyd through those a man this guy has grossed but you know steve king
far as i can know he doesn't actually do anything for his constituency
he doesn't pass emily isn't sponsor any bills really what he what he does do is go and press junkets with f for right nationalist politicians and europe
we'll there is that fucking lunatic and other very explicitly white nationalist political movements in europe
and then he says things like you know we can't have a future with someone else is babies and i remember a while ago year ago jonathan chait wrote an article in new york where he was school once again doing what he always does scolding the left for being too bellicose are to quit to tar the entire right wing in this country with the
the sort of neo nazi label and steve king was one of the examples and i asked him is one of the only times he replied to me on twitter rice said john how would you categorize this quote and it was the quote about we can't have a future with other people's babies and he said oh you know i think that's sort of edging closer to rain but not oh
openly white nationalists and it just like what the fuck are you talking about
are you drawing here john and why and i think again very telling if you think about fascism as the rise of fascism as historical phenomenon
this is guys like jonathan chait do they would never ever be as ruthless or parsing to the fucking right wing as they are to the left edging is a good description of jonathan chait writing process
looks as eluding price and it looks like you're trying to sign into white nationals and tell me how many school buses are in this picture and i will decide if you're actually an artsy as john steve king very helpfully kind of laid it on the table somebody in front of them about hanging out with all these cycles you know like users vander racism minorities
like you know from the austrian cricket hate crime party and he goes hey these guys would all be republicans have their in the united states
crack they would be rolling that to parties they really don't have anywhere else to go they would definitely be horribly steve king is like you got a feel for him and away because he's literally just he's like what do i have to do is like looking for hitler his ashes to rob them on his face is like no to and this job changes like
think he's like a newt gingrich public
so many of these guys are like him and that they're just medio figures they don't really have any kind of they don't have an even have an agenda they just they're just kind of hanging out and they love triggering the liberals and people love watching them trigger the lips and it really just shows how hollow even they're like idea for politics this is that it really is just spectacular acts of outrageous races
some the get people mad at them it's not really even designed to be and even constructive even on their terms it's just it's just nihilism provocation and then the next step if if you if you have a political movement that it's not really dedicate anything of his denial a provocation against lives
jews and immigrants are not realistic spectacles violence
that's the next step and that's what happened in pittsburgh and that's why i think like you know bauer and gab is a natural outgrowth of all this this whole moment is sort of instructive and that kind of shows especially coming the exact same time as the election and brazil is that it really does show how the different
basically between fascism as a as a coherent an effective political movement
and fascism is sort of an ambient cultural feeling in brazil and the united states are good good comparison to point that brazil is almost a textbook sort of postmodern fascist situation where you had like a social democratic president of priests
fighting over and economic and social crisis the high crime and
stalling economy
could basically get could through the functions of the of the administrative state she was she was removed from office
an impeachment proceedings that was highly dubious by a bunch of incredibly crooked conventional conservative senators most of whom had done thing far worse than anything she was even accused of
by the way when paulson arrow who is in the senate voted to impeach her did so he dedicated his vote to impeach to the guy who tortured her when she had been a insurgent during the dirty war when they had the dictatorship
and when they removed her from office
the guy the replaced or michelle terror from the from the old fashioned like establishment right basically had no popular support no legitimacy by the end of his term he had something like two percent approval rating as remember talked about the episode she did was ben fogle just no no popular support at all
her attempt to sort of just to cap a taper left was totally without the sort of grounding in a popular
mandate that would have made it stable in the long term and so what will happen is that a party led by this guy who'd been a bozo the a clown and just over a far right provocative who are for all of his current government that had been a very small party just fill the gap
and became this massive transracial to degree and transport class party that harnessed all of the resentment of corruption and failed economic development
again against basically the left party that had been power for so long into this effective mass organization and one of the good definitions pocket definition of fascism robert patterson says it's the suppression of the left amidst popular enthusiasm and that's what
that's paulson arrow is is the conventional right the establishment right wanted to suppress the left party once and for all but did not have the legitimacy to do it and a long term basis and poem
this movement
arises to fill the gap and that's fascism
and so now we have a fish out fascist his personal personal life largest economy in the world
a massive country yeah the fifth largest country in population and they're going to those the fucking rain forest which by the the of hours
what's left of the amazon rainforest in brazil which has already been deeply deeply care summit you understand the course of our life they'll finish that are now saying he's going to turn all over to agribusiness and basically kill every indigenous person as i mentioned earlier the amazon rain forest provides i think a quarter of the world's oxygen yeah it's one of the biggest carbon sinks
the world but that's fine with okay we don't really need it's only a quarter in an era of were what the un says we have a decade to handle global warming cutting down all of the fucking trees we have left that absorb carbon is definitely going to help but as i said so that is fascism on the march as a mass movement with purpose with support of the elites and with actual
voters with an actual popular base of support among among actual citizen
we have the united states is still the establishment right wing party
republicans who are losing legitimacy the same degree that the democrats are in the slow rolling continuing crisis that we've had ever since the economic collapse because we never really recovered from it and we're just sort of re inflating the same bubbles that led to it in the first place and are just going to pop again and that legitimacy is is
weakening and to sort of prop up their support they are courting these feelings of the a great so that stuff shirts like paul ryan and and
john painter and and these guys who don't really give a shit about anything but but the tax code can stay in power and they're happy to use a clown
perfume figure like donald trump as the charismatic front man for they care but they want the judges exactly but you know in the long run if the crisis continues and certainly if we have another collapse
the that patina of institutional legitimacy that they still have is going to be even further eroded and that's when you have to start thinking about a genuine fascism as a feature of american politics in the streets
but that's also going to depend on whether or not the left it begins to an actual threat which they haven't until now but we'll see i mean that's the thing is that the left is also starting to emerge
in power
and influence and try to change the the agenda and the dynamic and that's the kind of thing we can lead to the right turning to these sort of fascist movements to try to counter it
i think that distinction is a very good one and keeping in mind in like the contrast between like you said fascism as a sort of ambient cultural frequency and it as a actual mass movement
which i don't think we have in this country now yeah
yeah but it doesn't mean just because it's week now it shouldn't be opposed all the more vigorously because of the fact that you know better now than later
and i swear it's really about the gab thing i've been enjoying that because i was it briefly about so gab is currently being the platform because the pittsburgh shooter had an account on it he announced his intention to kill these people on gap i mean gab is basically just like an incubator for future school shoot school or mass shooter
and what i find interesting about it is that they pose as like we're defending free speech on the internet
but as soon as this guy killed these people they censored his account what happened is free speech to discussing yeah we need a new gab
fucking bullshit and their cart
starting your class action lawsuit for the shooter goes posting lights on gab i mean i mean it is amazing how fucking shorter cultural memories are because i remember for instance when
culture tilted like popular culture tilted a little more sent your rate right wing than it did now the campaign the right wing campaign against the fucking dixie chicks was more obnoxious and more punitive and more insane than even the most fucking stupid liberal culture like
cancel acts causes yeah the nobody nobody sense the bush years has driven in public a fucking steamroller is over albums maybe that's because we don't have albums anymore
right over a bunch of phone or with as part of the already have laughed
then we need to remember though
i mean i don't shed any tears for what happens to gab
but
the way that this is going to be defuse the way this movie has been to be defused and the freedom this not going to be through any kind of corporate decision them the bottles aren't going to the odds are not saving us the only thing is going to save it as a revitalized
muscular left movement that seizes troll this country frankly before fucking crashes and yet you trust like jack dorsey forty one year old man with a nose ring and like his team of confused people who confuse people in another country who don't really speak the language being forced to work support for like thirty two cents
our that's your vanguard yeah i you know
i think that good man the one thing that would help in the one thing that i'd like to see are these earnest are presumed earnest and seer resistance liberal types coming to terms with the fact that there's no such thing is valerie republicans are valerie conservatives and that they're not
conservatism
you know it just boils down to white supremacy up and down from the steve king out now nazi types to the paul ryan types who you want to destroy the federal government on which sold and e non whites rely by the way just saw story yesterday about in georgia a bus full of elderly africa
american voters being taken too early
early voting on monday
were pulled over by georgia state troopers and essentially forced out of the bus and sent back for doing illegal political work or something
it is just like cannot be more obvious thirty percent of the electronic voting booths in texas are just changing people's votes from beta or to ted cruz and the official say there's something about it that's why i like the impression it was a the voting machines aren't malfunctioning and i'm like yeah know
shit
there's still people you know in the aftermath of the massacre who were saying it you know this
this is due to tribalism
we need civility and i want republicans to denounce steve king i want them to denounce matt gets whatever is an answer or in florida and what do you think is accomplished by that that you say the words and you
your absolves of your sins you are republicans to just to ritual penance while staying in power and continuing to rely on a voting base that is now largely made up of explicit white nationalists made up of people who believe every single thing robert power did is walking he's not
it's a like that like oh yeah of course soros is paying black lives matter to the story by community and is paying for all the caravans is going to flood america with illegals and to be a supporter of this version of american nationalism and to frankly be a supporter of this you know global capitalist system as american hegemony is to be
a white supremacists
oh yea but that's not gonna worries and even economic migrants to the country is to be a white supremacy okay
that that's what it boils fine but that's not going to work that's not even when i didn't suggest anything when do you mean what i'm saying that that frame of of putting everything and a racial category is not gonna get the keep the numbers you need people to sign onto a left wing agenda because there's too many of them are white amount of white people have
an instinct reversion to the concept of white supremacy a lot of them to out all of that's a problem well yeah but you're not going to solve it by scolding people you now have an alternative i'm solving anything right now i'm on a show
okay obviously none of us are solving and they are saying that it needs to be framed in terms of of of pointing out the way to which their agenda harms people's in their day to day lives and how a different sort of economy would help them that has to be for a be the first thing people here because the rest of it honestly as much as it's horrible
the hear this from for somebody who does have you know what
considered obese advanced moral sense
just
white noise pardon the term sure i don't necessarily disagree with that i'm just i'm just frankly sick and tired of having to broke these compromises with white supremacy that the democrats have four years now in very much so guilty of why i started with the police when they go along with all of this nationalistic
militaristic nonsense when they say things like oh this is the sort of violence that should be happening in the middle east not here
or the other thing is i mean saw some of the new republic today it's like decent people can support trumps like tax problem by all these other policies but not his stoking of you know anti semitism more violence against the media and i'm sorry no decent person can support their on the hubble can tax plan or they're fucking immigration power
is or any of that one more thing
this is a regards the democrats and these the browser resistance here's the other thing so far i do not want to fucking here it was going on all week even before this fucking synagogue shooting joe biden in particular obama as well as giving these they're speaking publicly about this and trying to be statesman like the
he talking about it's like trials and they keep talking about this division in this country
we're so divided or whatever and like the problem is the division and not like one side of it i started a problem in america is not that were divided if you're a democratic politician or anyone with any moral sense the problem in this country is the republican party and the right wing movement which is a vehicle for they
are the problem they need to be defeated it's good that we are divided from them but let's go a little further yeah in terms of like actually identifying in combating what is the source of this division
that people are angry or that our politics or so divided is in it of itself not a bad thing
i mean it's an inherent in politics is by definition division because everyone agreed he would need politics politics is managing disagreement and conflict but what's needed to do is not just to say those are the bad guys but to elucidate explicitly what makes them the bad guys what is it about their control of the levers of economic power over people's lives
ability to to to a commiserate the vast majority of people for aggrandizement and their cynical use of of racial resentment and and right wing fascist appeals and order to maintain that that's what makes them the fuck an enemy that's what makes them the that's what makes the division the because they can't have it all
if you have any they have to take it from you to have it all to going to do anything it takes to make that happen i want to respond what will notice the people the left of center people who say i you know you can be a decent person and support the tax credits but i don't like all this white nationalism stuff that
where you draw the line you have to draw some kind of distinction there and implicitly that is the idea that you can have this economic conservatism right you can have this small deregulated free market stay without militarism
without the racial violence without the racial caste system in this country and that's impossible that's absolutely impossible that's a that's a liberal fantasy basically and you can't for instance have the you can have this rigid economic racial
hierarchy in this country without mass incarceration you can't have a prosperous american hegemony without
one hundred billion dollars defense expenditure without torture and violence and murder that we export you have there is no all a cart approach to this is a total isis of exploitation that needs to be overthrown
yeah you can't you can't get people who are being fucked over by an economic order to go along with it without a whole lot of of cultural grievances and resentment based politics and fear to distract them from it so there's no honorable republican party because stripped of all that shit they were on that path before trial
they were looking over your face of electoral relevance they wrote the paper after two thousand and twelve because romney was the unadorned republican agenda of hey tax cuts a corporations are people hey business friendly any lost people like this guy doesn't care about me if he saw me you fucking him his keys because it was a fucking valid
and they were panicked about that and then against their own desire just by the by the
the sheer yearning of the lump in american reactionaries for someone my trump he just gifted them the fucking solution to the problem as a i can fucking sell this dog as long as i can give it the pageantry and the spectacle and the racial button pushing that it needs to be
to be appealing to people who would otherwise find it clearly exploitative and not to their benefit and packs it back that paulson arrow as any mentioned earlier i mean i think that was in here with him and trump much to my own she attic what we're learning i was wrong about it is will it
cities figures there is nobody too stupid or foolish or out there who cannot achieve this high level of power know like that illusion is well whelan yeah i hadn't gone now it's gone i mean and it's one i had up until very recently yeah i'm in italy as often the case is
the canary in the coal mine we had berlusconi a figure everyone looked and said how is the bongo bongo porno tv over the fucking perpetual prime minister of this country and then when he fell he was replaced the leader of the biggest party in italy of the five forbid is a literal clown
preppy grillo he was a fucking tv clown like you walked around with the big lollipop of the propeller be any on his head
bows and arrows a guy they drag out on the brazilian team for years and say check get a lot of this dark a ligaments know him what an idiot and now is the press that yeah there's no limit to it because we were you saying is we need to find and who the dumbest person on t tv is now and just make them they'll they left leader see we thought about this and i want to talk about it
in a future episode or something because i honestly don't think that can work for the left because then because those figures your carrots up on speed
because because the strength of the left comes from clarity of purpose writing it comes from identifying economic sources of exploitation and misery and identifying the causes of them and then identifying solutions and trying to speak to the speak to the needs of the material needs of people clearly i got it i yeah i know exactly who he's kind of he
this each figure today because in the nineties he was on the sitcom where he was he adopted these three orphans and it was just like very like for how see type sitcom and his career took a downturn now he's you know addicted to drugs out
i him at a
fuck you
with this guy tar he's of
oh jack or spin
honestly though i will form the draft matthew lesko super
that's you on a free believer the government add he comes out arenas his question marks it and donald trump is like you look screen
oh you're triggered by the cool that it or not
there was a do your job
research skills the man that's really like the other with short circuit truck because you don't try to make these like really awful shitty singers like people try it on trump like those question marks should be exclamation points right so you're yelling too loudly right it's like you beat you become him
donald trump's voice shows he starts moving his hands around he's like frankly i feel like people asking for free money is a symptom of a culture and matthew lesko was just like tossing things that he's like good to get start a this
you could even be a landmark say
oh my god
here's my i closed my we're going i'm one of those visions out how has that made one of these okay because there was year two thousand and twenty three
field marshal and per wife matthew worth it
up
ian abrams tank
the brazilian military who were all wearing denim shorts
snare him down
we go we want to pave over the rainforests and destroy the bio to get rid of all oxygen

don't i've never seen it was probably an okay show i'm going to be honest but it's kinda depressing more you need to watch matthew lesko infomercials
you need you need the stay in their hear yourself up i'd like to recommend a series of youtube videos i've watched recently which are guinness world record breaking attempts
to smash break open the most amount of walnuts with one's head in under a minute
they are really impressive
the guy who just be standing record is a pakistani martial artist and they have a whole table set up with a double row of walnuts and he just goes the make an incredible noise the entire time just just absolutely sure reading on that the entire way down and i think it is almost two hundred and under a minute
insane and is fucking forehead is bleeding and the whole time he just like
oh and just plowing through all that either guess i just keep that in mind yeah that's going to be as folks were going to plow through the wall of fascism
heads rather pleasant thoughts we can national cat

beijing's vasco gotta pay for alcohol bullshit
don't state year for video you're forcing that's honestly going to make your words it's like you wake up and you drink and energy drink that should be banned and then you just crash after thirteen hours straight of awful anxiety don't force yourself to feel something you don't feel inside and don't take that there's a baseline of happiness because there isn't unless you're just like
the perfect
hi ah college football fan dumb ass guy and chances are you're not you're not that lucky
but you know the the most desirable be fine
is that you face all the awful things that you see everyday and and keep going that's really all you can ask for an hour of made fun of this advice when it came from my grandmother you've got to keep going the advice of people lived the the great depression but it's true there is something to it
you know you can feel shitty you can feel very hopeless at times and you can feel
what's the way out
that is exactly what they want you to thing you want you to feel fucking beaten down and there is no join your life and sometimes it is very hard to find that joy
just what i said
the sas episode when i said like you know you know they've won when you stop caring about the shared are you start feeling sad or angry or depressed about it like there is good reason to feel hopeless i mean like it does i mean it does feel like fascism whatever you want to call it like advice is just tightening around all of us
then of course the backdrop of catastrophic climate change as well there's reasons to feel despair but nihilism is inherently reactionary
believing and nothing is is handing the keys to the kingdom to all these holes but i try i think the way to to prevent from all just from becoming more build or to sort of self indulgent to spare is to try to act on your beliefs anyway you can i mean i don't know
re listeners situation so i can't give any kind of point out is small percentage illustrious who should not act on their beliefs
but i just like you know and this is hard for people who sort of live online but get off to the degree that you can and talk to people around you if you have a job coworkers
oh organizing at the workplace in organizations
campaigns
do something to feel like you're trying to push against the tide because otherwise you just going to get drowned by it
i will put it this way i don't know the exact course the future
neither do day but if they were sure that it already won they wouldn't want you to stop caring i think that's a good place to leave it
throwback as as
i'm good start but actually i have a great idea
come here and even a trial
maybe i'm naive about how can anyone can tell you i ask of my campaign

well i'll take your word for it speaking of things of a technology that we find vexing and ever churning making our lives better
you ever notice smart smartphones actually just many people stupid
i've got i've got a little follow up though
listen recently got some followed news on the app
right oh that faster
brainchild it's called it's called sorry
i'm sick note and brothers or know about parker brothers or whoever owns the sorry game has sued her yet but it's the sorry app and sisters
that is recorded are reading series on her launch of the out the app has actually come on why it's launched its live now you can download sorry app on your phone use use promo code i'm sorry to get fifteen percent off your first apology
we bought we all downloaded it before the show and it is it's the most pointless
to exist says you you've got nothing to apologize for your already there so i was i mean fresh he was our sure i'm good but the thing is that all you can do on this is the only things you can do is you can record a video apology and then uploaded into the stream and then other people can vote on whether to accept hundred
that is it
the top apology on that site which i believe his van susteren owner in favor of it has i think twenty views
catching on reddit varied is doing better honestly
how did you ask
so i'd kick things off here tonight i for
you guys here at the bell house and broken five us right now i'm going to record an apology on sorry out
now when you when you go to add your apology
sorry hits you with some suggestions on how to apologize
and it says before you hit record here is a few friendly tips
no great apology was ever made was angry
ah false i've only made apology is wrong
yeah have you listened stains this dog discography
john it out of the second try
tip number to his body language and eye contact can speak louder than were her eye contact with what you're fucking phone what contact
millions of people presumably how are you going to make eye contact with them all if you if you look at the camera it's like the waste news anchors do it's like there
he told that it's obvious this is stupid
the total of a dog making eye contact with the entire world
and number three i think most importantly just be honest just be understanding just be you you've got this you've got
so here we go town to apologize
i will mimic you're here on the sorry app live at the bell house in brooklyn
feeling a little contrite feeling a little humble ray to say the words i'm sorry to the bill house brooklyn venue for
what i did to the green room just a few seconds ago because certain items in our writer which are clearly clearly laid out when we agreed to do the show were not mad green upon items that were not met at all and indeed flagrantly violated i'm sorry for the property destruction but i'm agreeing now to bear
some of the cost for the damage died so i'm sorry
just trying to do better but again like the concert writer is a contract that's an agreement we we all agreed on it before and i'm sorry
i accept the healing begin
going to just post that right now
okay
review apology to i want a caption it personalize it just going to submit

second apology in the van susteren apology app in all caps
all you guys are going to be in it but i'm recording myself

at least other video interfaces like chatter day
russia chat
easter easter and eastern bloc on his
and i just expected the customs of those mediums to carry over to this new one and i'm sorry to the app and i'm sorry to will and will if you take actual our currency instead of tokens to
behave in suit
we have like twenty minutes in between shows

you had an apology for us but i didn't do anything wrong
fair enough right
moving on then
two other news of the week
so we visited on a previous show i've taken the moment now to check in on the status of a certain a wager that has been made
between her jaw and mad over an upcoming special election in alabama would you like to update us on the stakes and the state of play
man are you feel about it i'm feeling very confident
not worry family not lonely
that so we we bet on who is going to win the special election alabama roy more or doug jones most well now in touch a peace
no jobs of course most well known for his work with more no toro
in films such as pan's labyrinth of cowboy
well the because the halls of the polls
right now are shorter consistent lead i believe you can confirm the world's oil and more polls i will only release three
mr jones and me wanting to be big stars
washington so yes the poll suggests that jones is going to win i scoff hardly of those polled the same polls that show to hillary clinton as a shoe and win which is why we are scheduled a fucking why show for a
because we thought it would be fun for everybody
cause we thought we'd all i have like a lab for see the results that take taken i saw okay we've avoided that but instead halfway through the fucking show we get news oh yeah the world is on fire and you're all too
other forty minutes of comedy that we had the fucking you all because got their balls told us that hillary clinton was going away was hubris take the title that show normal world will never end
i say to those small sir i i ask you to stick them where the sun don't shine and i say and said that i believe in the people of alabama
i believe they will make the worst was indefensible in monmouth monstrous choice that they can well that's what mattered saying i agree with and i think all of you agree with roy
no matter what he's done are people saying balls he has good ideas
and that's going to shine through
i found out a lot of our roy more in the last couple weeks that i never knew or wanted to know
a fact that he was almost fragments own soldiers in vietnam for big piece of shit
yeah they called they called him the pedophile marine because they are jealous of
he has basically doug meter meyer from animals but they didn't kill well i don't know if this is ethical or not to do when they are are stakes been involved in a wager with people on the show but there's are why to say there's one other factor found out about way more is that he lived in alaska australia i'm sorry for a year as a young man right and from
i understand he moved there because he thought that on the southern hemisphere the age of consent was go the other way
it's called the korea less effect

now they are school years coming to an end i dream of the day i can pick you up from the roller rink and my burger king size sedan with horns on the front of it
until then i remain dedicated to my service to the confederacy by arresting urban teens for wearing their socks too low
forever yours roy

lucinda as i've always decided you wanted the easy ones who came out of their value of wickedness to know he loves daughter until one by one they get beat the sea and land that could see a goal the lamps family is court and the unjust bread bakers of the city of sought
each man must pay three times his first born child's weight soul to atone for the inequity of sought forever and ever amen
wow i think that verse says a lot about our friendship
you know it's true that sometimes you meet someone who you think you'll hate because they're a sixteen year old j the volleyball player in you're thirty three year old assistant district attorney
she wears short skirts i were a little root beer colored leather vest that holds my little gone for baby and pussies
you get it
but the more you get to know each other
the more you realize more similar than you could have ever known
you just plain rock
you told me so much you're you're going to camp this summer and i used i used to the only jews did that
i hope you bring the same smartness cool attitude and kindness there that your grace this school with in your sophomore year
and that you don't come back as a jewish person
if you do all learn to accept it because friendship is about it if someone where they're at and where they go kill the un roy more

why is kind of different
hey trevor eat a dick you're a huge bitch if i see you at the mall again you're gay ass is that assistant district attorney

man did happen around

so we'll see how that news shakes up the national news cycle and the special election in alabama when when this hits the airwaves i should be touching the poop you'll be touching the in
my friend you will be the want to
we shall see
i've already gazed into the future in my mind tunnel and it has told me what happened as as leonard cohen once i've seen the future brother and it is to touching
virgil touch
it's december ninth two thousand and seventeen in thirty seconds they touch the poop
just another bit of breaking news or current events
when you move onto the main part of the show night
i just found this today this is some news out of the music is where there's a a new country music song
takes aim a meal in during the national anthem
of course in east texas country music star is released a new song neil mccoy maybe it is new single taken me my ass i won't take a me
say that ten times fast take my ass
kapur nick i got a place where you could put your knee
i just took a knee and boy is my ass tired
you mother fucking code care it every issue with your face on the cover and i don't want my ass with it even though the really heavy the glossy stock to shreds my androids and turns the bathroom and into the chainsaw see from scarface
i was looking really forward to this month's issue you
i want to know what chris him worth was like what he's not acting
oh
i think
let's hear a little bit of take my ass
so here we go
damn son where'd you find this

racist genders
this video looks like the assassination of benazir bhutto
gay marriage
yeah that right about it
other united states
every time

yeah
homer
i have no object
one man
okay

oh
i with him
i don't think about that is okay to make fun of him for being a reactionary but honestly he just knows his audience
modern country music is just discussed thing just palo her that these people cynically shovel out to these rooms and they they think they understand like age but a truck of air and american troop it's like everybody country function because is this
are you in the fuckin hillbillies that should be every fucking saw nobody hillbillies are listening to hip hop from ten years ago there were all wearing a unit
the people in the suburbs and excerpts who have convinced themselves that because we have about one fifty that are cowboys
the famous f one fifty driving car
yes because i live i live i live in a gated community and they've got they've got a little like a longhorn steer on the fucking arch above it when i drive through after punching in my security code that makes me a fucking cowboy i'm just a frontiers man who spent a combined thirty seconds outside of iraq
conditioning since nineteen eighty two
does anybody remember the chicken fried by the zach brown band
in my mind this is the peak of modern country know som will get better if you don't know what the songs about the title is pretty self explanatory it's about how awesome it is the chicken fried steak what about what about zero show me the i know it through this whole song is little beta chicken fried call bear on a fresh pair of jeans
fitzgerald right it's just a list of fun things to do in america
start the fire for people with heart
exactly
i actually
the fire for people who been to a pizza
but then there's one verse of the song that stops the whole thing the whole narrative about having friday night chicken fried steak to say that we got to thank the troops
because their sacrifice allows us to eat chicken friend that's the saw they felt the need to throw that in there and just the patronizing nature that is so disgusting i just like to think that there was a guy in iraq in two seconds before he bled out after getting fried by an id was thinking yes i'm dying for people's ability to
eat chicken fried steak
i love using my x box controller on the highway of death
just so people can go to golden corral i think the most iconic country song is the jays and all the insulin where he wraps and talks about beating up a guy because he talked shit on facebook
that's the real lifestyle
that's our lifestyle that it's my life and constantly voting people over headphones
so if you spend friday night you know having a beer some chicken fried and looking at nice girls chances are you spent the whole week leading up to that doing mind numbing drudgery of some kind of i'm talking about will work
talking about work folks is what we're doing we're working for the weekend here the song goes and that is the main theme for tonight show
on on the on the actual pod casts of course you do the reading series for fans of
reading is for champs
reading is for people who are listening to the show on headphones while working out or pretending to work everyday sucks
viewing series watching over the ads who come to the bell house
yeah
i bet you fucking virgin sowed out the words in your head
not anymore you're going to hear them
so yeah this is our very first for you this audience here at the dollhouse not even the second audience it's going to come here know
but you are the guinea pigs for the very first ever chop of viewing serious
and the theme for this feeling series is like i said work and we have curated
election of videos for you
are intended to be watched as part of being part of a team if you were may actually fun yeah
is the fun part of the incomes part of being a team and getting a paycheck and wearing uniforms like we're doing here
so
i think you'll learn very early on
a theme to these sort of the lessons that the people who created this video wanted it's intended audience to receive and chief among them is that joining a union is really really bad
squares yeah
oh
i'll tell you it's not on fluke organized labor
yeah collective bargaining healthcare plan looks like you're from
but before you're into that i mean unions obviously have been in the news and by the news i mean the media because there's been a union news so of course they're comforting it and just breaking today
vox has decided to form
stack what is a union
so you know we support them obviously i mean will not box but their union
yeah the only striker through if the pinker into showed up with a gatling gun
oh why every like are now as you're going to see in these videos you know it's hard to convince your fellow employees to join the union and they're always going to be some people who maybe don't think it's such a good idea
just horn subjects just natural born peasants company man company and fucking men to the not really fucking and men like male technically men people yeah should we male ask figured who was the scab that word
french german loop a german lopez will as this sounds like one of those venezuelan opposition leader
whose family came to venezuela my way of how i
by that was a very strict counsellor at a summer camp and occupied poland
i love italian about the dictatorship
yeah my dad he was a great guy he rehabilitated convicts is all ages
by work program and you know now now we're going to get it as well on track german lopez sounds like one of the fake names from episode one
alright german lopez who said looks like a bullet
i am against vox union
i know writers you want a union as protection from laziness
which will make a lot of things worse including for writers
i don't know if it allows laziness and to be pretty great
either football game and become a writer in the first place if you weren't looking to protect your laziness
if you work ethic means anything he be working in a fucking railroad driving spikes and an now says the pod casters exactly where even higher on the totem pole
the galaxy play or the galaxy guy
on our german
sorry as bought as the bond to hitler hitler's not done
the fall of the final tweet is this is the most the base thing i've ever read on the what would achieve cave used to post more than be like five hundred replies that would be like fill my whole up with com
give me a baby going to board it ledges area
i registered i if that guy in the navy
is that i don't understand it chief is like that's that's an honorific that's a rank and keep is the first name
at our owners
he think that they there
it's that keith
keith with an f
matt has your absence rap and john wayne
but now this is the most the base shit of ever probably ever my life
vox media is a generous company
usually so for digital media and some people want to take advantage of that first of all what the fuck second for you okay box that
the follow up to that tweet is just gag and noises
ezra you need a back rub and they're trying hard
i love being a little baby sitting in his ruins just feeling is warm want bosom
thinking father for nurturing me father's gifts that x l s
medical uses choose up the spreadsheets and rick irritated
right
is that enough of that good german love
the g lopez yeltsin with her tonight i let's get into this going into this feeling series his first video comes courtesy of kmart and this is a very specifically really see like a number of different i'll i came i
is anyone from sylvan came our country
i grew up in our town okay came out i everyone yeah yeah yeah let's hear it for shop co oh
we've cut out i know that shaka i were to see like the first of many sort of tactics that are taken in these in these videos and the first one is that you're going to see here is making the workplace seem really fun and cool with an awesome song so you're young
with avant garde anti art
k on my and print
you didn't know the contrast between the music in this building that looks like the police his place imaginable
have fought a powder
the bad
we're putting green
no
pass
oh my
my and way
right on
this is the violence is saturday night
di maria
here
women now
lines while
where are you in over the world
oh
every one of the shirts you're wearing
and around
yeah

that's enough for the the singing away you guys and him i sounds like a
so if you're seeing everybody in the cave our distribution center and as soon as the camera pfizer and they're all smiling and waving yeah it's just how they are
it's like david attenborough found them
the wave is sign of their appreciation for employers
the union union organizer into their habitat
so that's that's where you have
you get people on your side with the cool song cool upbeat song that again is contrasted with be working in a building and location that is look slightly less cheery than under no bulgaria pre soviet union collapsed
so
next one
this one comes courtesy of target and this is a little bit more sophisticated this is like they're really going to give you the employee the street though or why unions are not for you can i just say that the first kind of ethical concerns argument i've ever heard was that target
oh i could hamper i go to hard
and it was actually difficult because we didn't even have a walmart yet we had a kmart so like it was just it was not even on our radar
so this is the ethical company target

welcome to target where we know you'll have a wreck experience
and i'm maria
if you already started working here you're already part and important team and a great target store or i tried to
retirees take the word doesn't think your industry and open conversation with your family your work learn something new everyday
and we throw in a while
also be a lot of challenges but there's nothing we can't solve are working together a leadership team and your fellow members are anxious to help and to make working a target a positive and rewarding experience
if you ever have a question all you have to do is asking everyone here from a c o down want you to go to the ceo store bad
i learned about how should i won't be any of those on the city was federal here asking out or anything but i haven't ever leaving your always the ended this tape is a santa dr helena number and school children here daily are key part of our culture and a key part of our success
one a very competitive business and we're changing all time we have to in order to stay ahead of the other guys now just a few years ago i had reliant much the way if you read the ice out well
we're a target because we're i economy of the world trade unions and that represent grocery store workers when we think business away from unionized grocery stores that means they need fewer employees and fewer grocery store employees mean fewer union members and fewer men
oh that's a problem for the union business that's right i said business yeah that's an idea this as a pulse rate heard it in the yeah
a union is not a charity it's not a club and it's not part of the government it's a business a union and intake in money to survive
and a product that just wants holy land membership said care about you is already source of income my monthly charge money for initiation dues and fines and assessments you get
anybody on is never enough members there
so the union nine tell you they just when you hand jobs with icon
so
like this is the first major theme of these videos will you'll notice like the third out to the team members tell you that you know target is your friend target is an open door policy from the ceo of all the way down to you and like that's the targets just all about whereas the union
just wants money out of you
a union is a business unlike target them so target
family union business that's easy
we're going to see further examples of this tactic but when i think is fascinating is the way in he's training videos they projects all of the shitty is aspects of your employer onto a union
a union is a business whose to exploit you get the most out of you for the least amount of money possible
i call it turns yea
that you in mind sassy easiest and something
i've never shopped at a store with an armed guards
organize this hearing their union membership sit down and here's why
deterrence only goes to the thorns of games like it could also there are no better way of doing business and old and rigid structure old fashioned it's right being unable to change quickly and adapt to new opportunity being flexible
key to running a successful business and people are hit not had those either way now
no one knows exactly what could happen but there are lots of examples of how richard grocery store union contracts going to thirty four the origin
are you decide to ridge am actually heard out and mind in the process
here's what we make here's the nightmare relic say know
and stationary but you're walking through gymnastics on hang on something again
and ask round the guests
without even thinking about it you'd start and give them any that if they require and then they ran in our planet outside of saddam
do you don't the gas sorry i can't help you
that makes you look bad but more importantly made me later he doesn't get is going to get it so he died might not come back with no wonder everyone gets hot
yep the
that looks like a nightmare and then where i can't stop on the way to my mandated lunch break to tell someone where to find the curtains ma'am oil you tell me where to find the linens that are made by orientals
i do like that she starts with this makes you look bad as someone paid ten dollars an hour to go heard a bunch of fuel suburbanites around a target i'm like yeah and when a middle man i already look in the mirror and feel bad and what difference does this mean i want to be respected by the and phase
cretin middle manager with the lot of when he comes the most oranges thinks everyone with a name tag is temporary slim
want him to like me
normal idea the last the last item from this is target video i want you to guys with guys to watch is just a i want you to pay attention to this incredibly hard cut that they're going to be just this less turn out of nowhere like going from the to nice team members to something else so check this out because the yeah
you need your dues money at some point you might be asked to join while talk about their tactics organizers might use and a meant like learned you want one for you to know target philosophy on to your house
whoa whoa rubber team members have the right to join unions but they also have a right not to join you
you're honest that is glad that we're it's totally agree
is not in their beds you know
alan impacted the one group of todo going to you know what could kill his chosen to be represented by a year you may ultimately as won't won't read us be harder granddad okay liberalism is the ability to mimic have been outlawed
this fucking bond villain
i think that's what
he a stroke in a small cat to be like you're here usa
yeah i'm going to where the most trustworthy out that a turtleneck in a blazer
it's not it's not at all what you were when you're trying to pay for your son's private school tuition with go game
he looks like he's trying to blow up the moon
sport coat to hide the bullets from the shoulder holster
by the way anybody else that could see my man look like it's below drift
like annoys them
like if you join the marines with the flatter what i love about this hard cut to daniel que pinkerton is this terrorist target right and in these bullet points about target will do this target revolve result but they're just showing you the employee a target and then it's just like their points in a couldn't
i love that guy so much i want to stand and we keep feeling when he learns bits of other languages just so you can call the cops and other people
his vote and is all issues and grow the business together without their parents of a human or other third party
third party representation trying to divide us is contrary to our company philosophy employees yes
firemen tries to create a clear what
ones that were all the embrace the new order by working together
all of us team members team leaders group winners supervisors and man and he is starting to the are excellent
and in our service the circus
concerns the target is over her
and keep rising
had you your these things because i
for one hundred percent pure drink juice
as the round version of the golden dawn logo
you did you you'd you'd you'd just divide us and they go gets the target policy of one book one nation
i hope that guy's dead but he's probably and or something that guy know that guy that guy is under secretary of labor yes
like involved over now right ear baby
that guy is the bash gorka his office manager
they just said pleasant banter but in their stupid voices
greek is
next up is targets older the older cousin
walmart
right let's see a walmart a red state magazine
the cultural signify au revoir ever forget my dad told me that the actors in the target had her are in the sag the after
if you're gonna out to spit in the craft service before the that's one of the things i enjoy about this chap the way walmart associates can really make a difference in someone's day i also loved that the people in the store are like a second family to me when really pulled together to take care of our customers
the world not anticipate a cigar age and charles manson have the same length of attempt to fucking appeal to people were family it were a family helter skelter it's coming
check no matter how big the company gets this place is special to ask a special because of the people and we all have our care for different reasons some like me want to carry the internet
and a safe working environment as not want to get older in the long term career some walmart some just the a part time job we have seen as well as i didn't know what i pay for school
you know it's kind of isn't that all the thing that different people
england that don't want to be rounded the soil and seven
some people enjoy putting on a vast and waiting for death
it's somehow it all works i guess that's what our founder sam walton had in mind from the start
is that all these videos they all reference their glorious founder like it was always there dreamed have their employees is there for example the of crop of america you know he thinks it his employees of his family because all of his descendants literally have a compound for their fucking family the you're not allowed
he invented accompany song for warn that he made his employees saying every more
no there's the fact and he would he would he would go to wal marts and lead the
and it would involve him in front of an audience who were just trying to get through there
that's he would lead them in a in a call and response thing of give me a w give me and a he would do a while say that coming and oh give me a square ugly
for the hyphen between walmart
getting give me an ad in age well artie add they pay period and so if a i'm doing that was like that was fun for him the hell out of about north korea but at least they're fucking style like bank doesn't genius suing the ship
yeah it's not just like a loading dock guy named darryl
the hook
divorce the hook to the famous sam walton song is still used today it was pushed me to the edge all my friends are gay
i just started there's just one more than rap is that rap there's just one more thing over the walmart for i want to share hogan services are yes
it's emotional wrap my favorite canada who
lose evert what kind of name is that you are
i'm not i'm not wrong path
easy is a gun i know that what the fuck is a her
vertical vertical what it sounds like oh jesus
yeah that's right
it's stupid
i just want stupid and i don't like music at all like i've never known you to listen to music he is growing more knows more about young people culture

yeah him female that's all i'm saying
that's favorite songs are all civil war margins
it's just that one more example from the one granted
which inevitably rousing i'm sorry
another problem is dead
are also made by old is he
well associate class warm our jobs are flexible jobs gaming associates the opportunity to balance our personal life without work how we usually i get on a few i just love that because they're only walmart or flexible jobs in the example they're giving the mindless teeny on
slightly straight and for person
i love the opportunity at walmart if all the food is lined up perfectly parallel i can be buried with sam walton
i could be a supervisor in the afterlife
this next video i'm going to just only one selection from a this
gives the perspective from the other end this is a training video from was designed for management
oh you real behind the scenes sure what to do it there's union activity in why you should treat treated we actually have to watch this because we are each other's manager yeah this is open shop shadow trap
open and management is on the other and becomes a very divisive atmosphere with a breakdown in communication and collaboration year and making it hard to be efficient and competitive that's exactly the opposite of what lows wants to establish in our business it is lava
i love that they say that because they created a coffee occasional us vs that atmosphere almost as though our profits are due to the surplus value that we extract provide employees
say aerosol can retain labour which the band's the largest share possible of surplus value and management who also wants the largest share possible of surplus value which is just not says i guess
that that by its vibes issue yeah it's like why you gotta bring up old shit
now that's why you gotta bring up shit from the eighteenth back okay it's the twenty first century
hey guys
ted talks guys management no know if you read my pace been but the unions are creating very toxic environment and i'm not enjoying this anymore
okay this next one is sort of like this is like the union horror story where they're going to show you like real footage of unions acting scary a bad crowd out dreams o'keeffe thing where they they went undercover to get the real dirt the horrors of unionists
oh
oh
oh oh oh

well
yeah


yeah
oh

yeah it's like don't join a union you get to scream swears that your boss
there there's you know you get
it all of those men possess a hawk
all of this women even larger hawk
all like yeah god forbid you join a union and you get everything you want in your manage with fears you get to hang out with a bunch of cool guys who look like eric paddock the coolest the best brother in history
he had a patient mustache yes that's right they will call the swarm
union the
i just like that they all get called jackets yeah that inherent credibility nice i know it's cool that's an incredible enticement slag yeah yeah and it's like only one guy in the retail company gets a cool outfit which is like the
over burst your general counsel guy that we saw he only gets the cool turtleneck you know
okay moving on this for is probably the most sophisticated effort and this is put on by fedex in this one they've created a whole sort of narrative to go along with it so let's just take a brief sample of this one takes solicitor a typical holiday cooking a david mann and production
should the state so
what
there there
while the money's going to be rolling in couple months tops so you they so
straight
oh
did all day
socially socially
think that your little union is going to be when an first
that it's like you say damn straight worth it
i don't know why
as usual
because all collider
not how his back on
jersey made it earth
that
we went to can ask what we got everything
okay
mothers
yeah
these
snails so he was a
like an anti load
the said
take that the company said in elections
we we got one steep toss in the trash
he didn't watch it
he says this country don't watch every asia he got washed need to see what honest
a called on job and six
watching that video is like seven days only at the end of your collected by burning right
i actually i'm working on a wiki that encompasses all the characters and that thing
it's a dizzying array and they'll have rich back so i ship steve
other major work
what i loaded up the scene between the wives as she goes what you did watch the v h s you've got a hell of the company v h s but what sophisticated but this is it it carries on with this narrative were like the guys grilling outside one of the wants to go union and the sensible one doesn't but then it cuts back to the y
they have this sort of like are still within a film
for most expressions from the guise of a neighbor comes as a huge actual you're struggling to become a player in the small package delivery we're not quite or after shift
red shirt
customers pictures every profitable
business
he wanted me to see this just keep watch
the only game in town
but independent that was you yes this is fedex you see
how do you see now
witnessing to a great becoming stay to the becoming of a non union
just just watch the video and then maybe you and your husband or decide that you want fedex to be a third of the early
just watch the video and navy and seven days you won't have to vote at all
it's very sophisticated the film within a film i think this was directed by michelle gone very nice on tell because i thought it's dogs
okay
the next video moving out of her after the ne felix guided abilene bad
honestly i want to watch a movie that someone who like eric's weird in a cafe
sounds good man
watch real movies like data
the record of doing that i found on video
and the dragon ball z highlights that to ops and
my three favorite movies
now widely wisely chose not to join and there are a lot of other opportunities you can have in work life and yeah and you know learn special skills on the job as you'll see in this next as long as career from the union organizations doesn't prevent you from being cross trained there are other shift gears
we begin with your second shift
and serving guest
they find enough to it to that boy i'll say well as they put the campers arabic a lot of it
guys went method making a friendly conversations like this is a big part of greeting and serving guest
at other buffet style restaurant
guests often feel there though
what's the almost like than the faith at all country
oh there are two different islands which one do i start away or that what as a cover you spelled little more time with guess the team members that means you have a great chance to make them feel welcome and appreciate definitely want to hang out ideally the gets horribly and oh thank god someone to the cottage or serve them act like you
everyone a they were it
i haven't got my god or henry years at least i can help you hold with guests should i say if he was born in kenya he just said
are you want to predict the guest started a brief covers your that the un handwriting that the airlines yeah i can answer
you might ask something like this
that they called them on the phone do not come into work did you catch a game last night or this and the child was that's my favorite
conversations with our younger guests to have your own ellen de of shallow which fresh as well as i say why
the cross head i actually here to how to talk to children ever stations with children by saying something different
at school or this and decided what does that you're going to have
yeah i don't watch gladiator when we have such
elder of crustacean it's time to move on to the second half of his shift duty serving the guests begin by asking which definitely have a handful of what's guests have chosen what they want your cover slice of how come the american people and i was an ambulance your judgment call on your part
less us makes us special request we don't limit the second half we do however manage it to you don't limit how much it was a reserve the right
cheers for is too much this is great when you're against lucca advertising that i believe what i love that
right related over the bear or i can't wait to never even after the children usually prefer smaller portions of them as my kids
fucking and carbo loading
if you're gonna make the goddamn slur this year
quarter cut or a half cut of the meet the guest requests
sometimes guests will tell you exactly what size of cut or number of pieces they want some time as you read and you'll kill us
did the exact dimensions these days guests ah feel they are getting more when getting a thicker cut actually the think cut interest them a tender piece of meat which is why we carve dime fake mrs that's why if a guest

oh
hi







oh it like army
okay
british military below you can be crushing military it reads like the marine corps ads with the guy climbing the mountain and killing the dragon or time and album
that they weren't for a serious serious boys it's like the difference between a guy who's pretty good at games on the weekend and a pro gamer everyone in the pressure military was fatally
shitty navy though
we're we're actually waiting for a phone call yeah we have already been for phone calls and moment but while we're waiting on can someone explain to me the latest james o'keeffe news that i saw breaking
god is still a favorite oh
such a sun kissed dollars i've got more offense syndrome and a desire for the truth
themes o'keeffe the conservative provocative your and video artists of project
a fool i guess you'd call yeah just untouched just bungled the world crates nothing with failure and disaster and is totally untouched while though i mean isn't that planned parenthood video he did government taxes and he got a he had a coroner yeah that's it but to be protected
further rebounds to our awfulness that we allowed this absolutely confident dip shit
any success so what does he either know well so james o'keeffe hired some middle age woman from georgia to pretend to be a victim of roy more and in an attempt to deceive the washington post some some fashion so they went with the author of the original roy
more a watching post what was her me stephanie the reporters fanatic from it
look you've sent this woman to pretend to be a victim of really more and the woman brought a
a purse to this interview with the post reporter with which very obviously had a camera in it
had had
there's not act like that where are hat
so the post figured this out pretty quickly by google the woman's name she use her real name and she had made a goal fund to me to send her because she got a job in new york media as a journalist
to take down the liberal elites are what oh my god
that's upset that's upset for days so the post decided to do their own little little gotcha so they brought their own hidden camera people
food quarter cafe or when or where they met and were most interesting details i found was that was the post reporter puts her purse down in front of the other woman's purse and the woman has some move the purse very obvious
it was like how high when dave chappelle is trying to get them to say the code word as a half baked
oh how high his or her method that read bad smell out of every
good good
a nickel in the movie job at the shit out damn it
so the post reporter comes in with all these receipts like a print out the go fun me and says you know you did you get that job and she's no no i didn't get that i interviewed for it
by i didn't get it and the reporter says oh okay what would you in are you for he says
daily caller and she says okay well who
who interviewed you

sweet thread courtesy of one of the more obnoxious pratt's twenty first centuries
one true genre near the with i was thinking about this guy in the whole it also it has been a guy his name is benjamin wits and he is a senior fellow at the brookings institute and mean if you didn't know if you need me to explain further why that explains everything you need to know about this guy well there's one other thing and that is yet
sweet a few weeks ago or maybe i'm on three said the washington post editorial page is the closest thing i have to a political party the moon's own said something
the key
a announcement reminding people to wash their hands after they poop is the closest thing i have to my political and he replied by he replied to himself preemptively to say i can already hear people getting ready to bring up the iraq war the lady i'm bringing that up crazy petty as what it is so silly announcement saying if you see something say something close
i have to military service
this is like is an i
this rant of course was got a positive of nod from the gotta pause the by a bill kristol who said for what on earth by that he said for what it's worth i'm with you to everyone read the thread and and benjamin replied to this guy with it's worth a lot though
if that doesn't somewhat why i am so viscerally repulsed by the resistance movement in one where a cc scum funny
the ease and glean with which they have embrace a figure like bill kristol unemployment so i'm sorry i like about those pods save america though is going to do we just had a big thing the other week with their like it's like we're teaming up to fight the alien invasion on her invading somewhere else
yeah your i love about this is like someone like weird like the dude
who are there like i can't believe we're keeping up with you build crystal and it's like no you go you basically liberals and neo cons
always kind of team it's never been any liberal dogs yeah you guys have always like you just slightly disagreed over country you should and it's all like it comes down to make marginal tax rate and school choice maybe or something like that but they all think they're and lord of the rings and they're like dough
doff my calf
but have a lower hands or get together to a rubber hands over another fucking middle eastern bloodbath were cooking up between ourselves yeah
i can't believe that liberals and liberals who sometimes care about the deficit are getting
anything time i was going to read a bit from benjamin wits
when he calls a statement of principles for the hash tag coalition of all democratic forces remarry
a political manifesto and eighteen tweets he writes here and he begins with hash tag i believe i will really
a gross in cynical and mawkish way of trying to lake tie this to the me to moment
that's how i read that i believe it's certainly branding and three days
i reading this to eat storm i kind of wish it ended for me the same way that ted kaczynski manifesto did it's also it's a great song yeah i said union of souls know it's an r kelly reference nano i believe the phone
the
it's also the song from the lost boys i still believe that the the guy with a saxophone oh yes and zones facts man with the chain like i was actually benjamin with
what does he really believes that any issue that americans do not need to be actively contesting right now across traditional less weight divisions americans need to be not actively contesting right now across traditional that right divisions and a horribly written sense that gibberish when you're also or i'll answer
yeah i know says here or what do you eat out or you die or not from the diabetes that new tax bill that wants to convert poor people into can bust of will fuel don't think about it right he says we have grave disagreements about social issues about important foreign policy questions about tackling don't know each day went wow what are his disagreements
bill kristol in foreign policy now he already thinks it's out of bounds bring up the washington post support of probably the greatest foreign policy disaster in american history
that's out about of the grid it comes down to it comes out to does al qaeda get do they get the ground a ground missiles or the ground to air missiles that's the extent of their disagreement right him he says
he goes on the about what kind of judges he goes i believe hash tag i believe in putting them all aside have shack i believe in a temporary
i believe in a temporary truce on all sucks all such questions an agreement to maintain the status quo and major area is a fantasy
you know the i don't know what we were doing before we got to pay for that is fucking status quo pham says an agreement to maintain the status quo and major areas of policy dispute all americans of good faith collectively and together none of those americans of good faith collectively advance
together to face a national emergency i have i believe that facing the national emergency requires unity i remember it another time where people set aside their differences to accomplish a great goal and you know it was after nine eleven
nothing bad happened nothing bad happened from fucking talks like this
i remember when adam sandler
i was a hash tag i believe that reasonable americans across the political spectrum she's unite around a political program based on protection of american democracy and democratic institutions that means among other things and activity offensive the first amendment mentions of free speech press religion
i also means a focus on ethics and government and long term battle against the corruption prone opacity surrounding the president's personal finances and business interests leo
i am afraid to use the word
so it goes on like this
you get the point like it summed up there and that the first few things were what he's proposing is a truce so that we maintaining the status quo choose between liberal and conservative yeah what's really a truce between liberals and six guys in dc the only family of the crisis and
horowitz that's another neo cons who hate donald that's it that's a handful of people yeah oh also the idea of like the dow extremely powerful democratic party on all through
he always wanted to the super absolutely well then he had this is the hilarious part of this is that he's calling for a truce at a time when the democrats control three statehouses in america and not a single branch of the heralds have a six steel eight now and i went up a double digit
twelve
although stuff to stave off a constitutional convention what i what i like about this okay remember when tromp like sort of barely cobbled together a few words that equated to iran is bad when he went to the united nation
every fucking scumbag
at all to and elliot
brahms to all every one of these pieces of shit code they were like well i've had my doubts about mr trump but the fact that he could not talk about candice bergen and just told us closer to a war with iran shows me that he may be maturity
like yeah they're going to go back to it is roy more and shit like that but within six months there no
the iranians like shoot at one of our boats that's not crashing in their water they all seem to be doing now or whatever they'll be right back at it will be right back at trying to sanitize certain members of the trump administration because all they care about our their imperial goals and this fucking quads tweed storm will just
athletes don't it will just linger in the wind lake
the vapor from a depleted uranium shell one benjamin witless one some fruit with the people who are the malignancy it's not the administration needs the institution of the republican party and and it's the republicans in congress or the early ones we have no desire to do trends yeah
early evil is cod sadly constantly it's not this imbecile in the white house who obviously would violate every single democratic norm
had a brain that wasn't fucking sponge cake if it wasn't a wandering around the halls of a white house
pokey
yeah it's this
dumb ass child who got on twitter today and was
let's have a key the cod style
fox would win only
he really accomplishes our existing republican policies like i think the problem is the donald trump wants to have a tv contest
it it will be more actually actively doing evil things at the trump administration guess what it's not true because he's not smart enough to do it it's lifetime republicans it's people who are in good standing in the public can even harder to people who are held up as a responsible ones i would maintain our the most evil
like like how a monster matters yeah
felicia minute everyone solution because these fucking hot looks cool
foreclosure fucking but it's like you want to tell you about who has the most bodies on them when they got in there it's work in madison kelly the people that everyone respects and kelly that fucking piece of shit i loved it when he got up there and was like all the cord families that lost old global on the military
can't believe he's doing that it's like he's almost acting like he ran get mon tip of the spear in iraq and that his son died in one of his stupid fucking was a good to watch president what brains hands and make him appear legitimate so he can believe that his son didn't die for nothing which he did sorry
my point about about benjamin been better been with senior fellow at the brookings institute is i think in this this mentality and in that little thread there we keep poses setting aside our disagreements on important political issues to maintain the status quo until trump is out of office to me
so like everything that is endemic in the disease of contemporary liberalism which is like oh he's just position themselves is like five to ten degrees left of wherever the center is but the center keeps being move so dramatically to the rain that like the idea at maintaining the status quo is like
the dream or political goal of liberalism just shows are like the brookings institute shows how utterly now just impoverished their imagination is but just how evil they are in general they think that that would be like a worthwhile goal is maintaining the status quo just until we can get trump out of off well but that's because their vision of of
is absolutely one that erases the the factor of voters an actual mobilization of politics as people with political views they see it entirely as a as a capital fucking game between professionals and this is all about the professionals coming together
putting their differences aside forgetting the fact that if you do that you basically demobilization entire voting block and make yourself basically open yourself for being just annihilated by people who are willing to still mobilize voters on their behalf it's also say that it let's turn back the clock to two years ago when everybody was doing great
totally agree
how the fuck do you think we got here do you think just over night or people who are races
i wasn't racist still us on the apprentice
tell me it was okay but now that that is a thing they did think of it is a game professionals and that's why they like that
mark halperin style rating of like oh well he's he's just a kill killer and substances policy walk and she's just when hillary gets out there and she gets going to religion they sports because is a have never had any physical courage they may be played like some boarding school sport or you like through
if sock into a hamper and it's sponsored by like slave trading company but they have to talk about noon that way because it adds they have to believe that their lives are like sexy and there's a level of skill and it's not just like an accident of birth
turning people out it's not a numbers game which is what it fucking as it's not this delicate dance of strategy it's right route binary numbers with the wish of contemporary liberalism is that we could forget trump like the wish of contemporary liberalism is that we can just put aside all of these disagreements and like an episode
they really view themselves as being outside of ideology seem like they view that their position is essentially the correct objective one that is untainted by the grocer vulgar things like passionate hobby a little of populism the races ignorant probably was also the selfishness and
nationality of of socialism because they think that socialists are comes from the same sort of pit of selfishness as as hostility to other races they think it's all just bass bass emotion and that reason but yeah like the brookings institute is an organism think tank organisation that was four square for the iraq war promoted it
carrot midwife fair entire disaster also libya and every one of these for everything going on
we had originally it's rich this idea that they're going to put aside their foreign policy disagree
have any foreign policy disagreements with the status quo and also a yeah i the idea the idea of them shepherding some sort of like i'd know even status quo moderate fiscal policy it's like you fucking fucking absolute dollar were promoting paul ryan for a six year
ours is like oh i don't agree with him but he's smart about look at this graph it's like anyone anyone who looks you in the eye and says racism is not an american value will gut medicaid and you'll smile
yeah what the the brookings people like their whole critique of iraq war is that we should have said half a million troops and center of like the paltry number that like the rumsfeld defense i love that the democrats won in two thousand and six and they actually were running on let's do the iraq war right yeah let's cover every precious american troop it adam auntie i'm so over there
get hurt
i'm have enough body armor
it's easy to criticize without offering a solution and i want to tell you the listener well you need to do is go down the street to the gay community your tower go up to the fucking local hot tub salesman's house
the door as for his son who spray painted should i or law on a mask
a who is who is disenchanted with trump when he found out that his daughter as a jew and say welcome to the resistance
yeah yeah this is a grand coalition it's a grand coalition between cupid
two groups of people with one thing in common
they were all somebody his nephew
episode
no talent nepotism never you marty
they aren't oh yeah that's what we should fucking call it a bipartisan consensus party that is sort of losing all legitimacy but it's still desperately crime to hold onto the whole fucking political spectrum that's the fucking nephew partner i took an oath when my uncle said that i'd be good for this internship thirty five years ago
yeah because you know you're making these deals the people who are convinced that russian box were the ones who convinced them that a guy who was a commercial with fucking grimace
he was going to make them racist and that's the people who you're so convinced are totally pliable even though these are like deeply held beliefs and have bubbled up to the surface
yeah you're going to fucking beat them by just trying to trying to be reasonable and say that there aren't there are conflicts back to the original point about benjamin with a man who said that the washington post editorial page is the closest thing he has who is politics can you imagine looking at that fucking dog shit
and picking yeah looking at fred high hiring shadow this isn't me welcome to like that is an elite club of yang asshole else was unopposed has some really good reporting and they sometimes every once in a blue moon will run and opinion that is like maybe we know maybe we shouldn't turn yemen into a half pipe
a giant half by the muhammad did som could family glide down in a hollowed out f thirty five but it is mostly the most this collection of scumbags people who sold their soul so they could go to aspen with luck in band are bush it's they sell every
a single war and every existing war the problem is that we haven't ranted up enough every fucking every person who you saw in the movie lord of war those are all the people are touting his reformers it is the most morally bankrupt
like major op
wall street journal it's and shit but mean crazy their create that but they're just openly like a serious conversation about sharia law and the boy scouts and it's legal what watch what you're getting of respect and i respect their gangster because the wall street journal editorial pages like yeah trumps you just fire
yeah a lot of ideas
get a real they keep it real the washington post or bunch of merely mouth fucking just just reptiles area
that they use that milk toast presentation to sell reactionary fucking nightmare foreign policy as the sensible center yeah really as you can't do that with wall wall street journal nobody's buying that as the voice of reason
those that's part of and they saw side by side with sort of like center lab center right goals like we need gun control we had to return to civility and it's like i wonder if there is like an effect on the national psyche in our culture when you know we every week we hear something like oh we accidently killed one hundred and fifty the wrong people mosul are the last
and we did that actually was one thousand oh we have to be any i'm in for some reason we have to the slaves in libya the who knows look it's whatever look it's a game of moral grades we tried our best and where the if we don't do it someone else will that there may be in effect on the culture of civility that we love so much if we're just constantly bombarded by this
the rationale that we need to murder everybody was speaking you maybe a little bit in in these fucking mass shootings that's that's when they really bring the passion back to politics is when one tenth of what they inflict in other countries happens here
and
purchased no connection no connection between an imperialist motorists culture
and what people do here when they break i have to disagree with him i think the wall street journal does reach undecided voters
you know if he wipes hours and eat out a people waiting in lobbies
well this is actually a perfect segue into reading series from this week and i'm going to use this once capacity other than merely mouth piece of shit
we're we're murray is a lateral move from just
abominable institutions of the liberal press that are just got off on every respect movie watching your post editorial page to the new york times every series designed to to hit all felix's anger and pleasure centers home
alcohol normal feelings and already royal navy that's the thing i on good i don't i
it's like i know this is a boy tommy but it's like i kind of you know what i don't have the hate for tommy that i do for like fred higher because tommy legitimately believes that this shit
had a fucking is a golden retriever tom it to for those that you don't know tom friedman got the start his career but got its start because you know anyone who looked at him in the times and like the seventies eighties was like okay this guy's a fucking idiot they sent into lebanon because they just assume no one would care what happened there said that's not a mine big deal
right nothing but that's what i would do you know then the lebanese the war becomes a big story and tom friedman's the lebanon guy even though he just like he chews pennies
there you go and looks can get you everywhere
friedman's of focus
well plus you're going to be hard this article and i it fills me with and it sounds i knock on his own image
yeah and work imam remaining calm what's hear this is thomas friedman
saudi arabia's saudi arabia arab spring at last the crown prince has big plans for his society now before i get into reading this article people drag this bullshit a lot when it came out of but not nearly as much as they did that this sort of stupid profile of that neo nazi guy
get out there are people that one insane over that one which i thought i was not nearly enough noise here
it was a shitty article but the guy was trying to whitewash nazi clearly thought this was still the nineties and people would take white supremacy white supremacist or white nationalist supreme massage bad yeah but he just didn't he wasn't at the time he thought he thought that the kind of a contrast between the guys views and but his banal details of be like schilling sort
aren't thing yeah it was just like we've seen this a million yeah and this isn't fuck it shocking any was there's no point to this exists and he didn't follow he didn't really he kind of turkey like their their word on things didn't really follow like what the logical through line of their policies would be but you know people will forget about it there will be another article about
there will be a think these attacks texting that era will yell about but he really want to talk about an evil article human someone
arab someone little actual power or maybe this spring that sounds that sounds good arab spring got rid of those autocrat know it was already successful that let's dive in feel he gets hominid rate been like i said we they're a business experts their mindset experts thomas friedman is like to call a world expert
yeah what you call more fucking renaissance of thomas friedman mr a worldwide and so he knows you know the facts of the hedgehog right
the hedgehog knows one big thing in the back on there and all this on a entails

you're okay
sears thomas friedman
i never thought i'd live long enough to write this sentence
i hoped you would it
they hope you will
any sentence
this sentence the most significant reform process underway anywhere in the middle east today is in saudi arabia yes you read that right
though i came here at the start of the saudi saudi winter i it's only one hundred and thirteen
i came at the start of saudi winter i found the country going to its own arab spring saudi style
not knowing into writing this is my favorite police academy wrong and either way
saudi style unlike other arab springs all of which emerged bottom up and failed miserably except in tunisia
know had dad bought about that soil out arabs
this one is led from the top down muhammad been and just hitting the back wall
big daddy top
evolution has been topped from the bottom bracket and getting top in the double in the davos forum
tag gender
all this article is him giving tops and man how many of us are like for sure that country's thirty two year old current prince i mean once again
to find out another person younger than i am
five years younger than than crown prince muhammad i think i got some time
older than him but i haven't killed a single your many i feel like a piece of shit goes
if it succeeds it will not only change the character a saudi arabia but the tone and tenor of islam across the globe only a fool would predicted success or indeed right glowingly about it and the first place but he says but only a fool would not root for it you better understand it i flew to riyadh to interview the crown prince
known as n b s who is not spoken about the extraordinary events here of early november was will home had been solomon yeah i know that i know that from you talking about it that's right
an educator and gentlemen when his government arrested scores of saudi princes and businessman on charges of corruption and threw them into a makeshift guilty jail the riyadh ritz carlton and so they agreed agreed to surrender their ill gotten gains you don't see that every day yeah yeah i mean not of
his of the family none of their games are ill gotten it just it was really coincidental that the people he threw in prison where like you know
hotel prison or you know a guy that controlled the saudi national guard which is one of the institutions of they fear fears one of the only competent national military institutions even though it's still shit military body and a guy who the media about a in
oh you've been to lol it's very coincidental you just never see a regime leader neutralize leaders of opposing potential powers
never see them and also there is a very coincidental helicopter crash that
so i just wish he of i'm nineteen seventy now
saddam hussein has made an unusually bowl power move his party's comical
i think he's doing so the know to keep building exercise with a grenade
there's a lot of trust fall
but he goes your are we met saddam songs are budding filmmaker
i don't get it
it run its remit at night and his family's or neat adobe wall palace in we call it we we just north of reality
spoken english while his brother france could lead the new saudi ambassador to the us and several senior minister hear a different lamb dishes and space conversely space the conversely and these guys are the fucking asshole guy with the nazi article did the same thing they're obsessed with these guys eating while i don't fucking care i appreciate
as a writer myself that double meaning to the words it's like in those fantasy books about george r r martin always takes effort to tell that everything all the evil pies
isn't as the food is spicy as we know but the key the spice to the conversation like sprinkle tell that's why he's got a pulitzer oh yeah it's like you know what's the fantasy series about the the mouse is also a night that wall read wall where the hell yeah they're a hungry raised by livestock fans are out here
his good
if bread with a nice jam
the new york times and how the style is the right
writing about little cute little well it's also races will let's hear more about this food
the efforts are there is no more about the food after nearly four hours together i surrendered he won fifteen and and b s's youth pointing out that i was exactly twice his age
it's been a long long time though since any arab leader war me out when a fire hose of new ideas about transferring them in his country
like i got to get my stomach pumped after that
actual why yes it really is how did i say this before
while since the young arab leader cream pie to be with his ideas
oh run that back run that by run that back it's been a long time though since any arab leader warm
a fire hose
he about this country
that's the thomas frieden a mixed metaphor
that is the time
sure move i was worn out what am i this young barrow
so
a fucking master he's you can't even imitate his mill had a forest style is astounding new worn out by a fire
classic thing that happened so he goes on and he says here
he goes it's ludicrous he said to suggest that the anti corruption campaign with a coward grab thinking i was talking about the rapper he immediately gesture to enslave
he pointed out that many prominent members of the ritz crowd had already publicly pledge allegiance to him in his reforms
a majority of the royal family is already behind him this is what happened he said our country has suffered from a lot of corruption from the nineteen eighties until today to high on the corruption index in the economists one hundred percent the calculation of our experts is that roughly ten percent of all government spending was safe and off by corruption each year from runs hotter levels to the not
this is one family owns all the oil that sounds like one hundred percent right
so when his father who had been tainted by corruption charges during his nearly five decades as governor of riyadh ascendancy the throne in two thousand and fifteen at a time you're falling oil prices he vowed to put a stop to it all and the said my father saw that there is no way we can stay in the g twenty and grow with this level of corruption
yeah that's the problem
oil is is not long for this world is the primary primary fuel vehicles or that your other chief export is leg
graham comments
that's why they need to diversify don't forget and will have islam right all right well they get into that so he basically just prince verbatim all of m b s's statement about how this anti corruption campaign is going splendidly and is not at all about consolidating his own power
then he gets neo there is no way to root out all the corruption from top to bottom so you have to send a signal and the civil going forward know is you will not escape
if there's also the signal we send to all migrant worker
sorry take their past
robinson's most women yet
this a black person recently it all over the stakes are high for m b a he calls it this entire article because it's cool
he spent billions of dollars on a pole or that didn't work
because the stakes are high for us and it's anti corruption drive if the public feels that he is truly purging corruption that was sapping the system and doing it so in a way that is transparent and makes clear to future saudi and foreign investors that rule of law will prevail it will really instill a lot of new confidence in the system and then he qualifies this by going you know but
it could go otherwise cynical toys is the best it's like you know most writers they won't admit that things go to his but tom friedman will say something could go two ways but it'll say the forklift to progress can always run into you know like the who who
reaction isn't honestly if want to look at this from like a geopolitical powerpoint power politics perspective doesn't this whole of neo liberalism that the be ph
the also be an i b m i is carrying off here
doesn't that just make it all just look like a giant basically attempt to buy himself out of the doghouse for being the world's leading exporter of terror and solidify his western alliance is against iran
because it's there
hey you want you want to buy stock in or ammo how you want to you want to live in my floating topiary city and the red sea
these are incentives to sort of solidify those bonds in the face of iran
while i mean everything they've done even when the model of and songs deputy crown prince there was like a sort of turn before they like when they turned on muslim on muslim brotherhood and basically just fucking dumped dump truck full of gold bars en el cc to wipe them out and
secret contacts that have been going on with israel since pretty much start of the syrian civil war but i mean this
what's going on now it's like a more overt play of what they were already pivoting to but muhammad been solomon what freeman will mention is that mountains almonds like kind of fucking dumb oh
hilariously bad at all this like shit all the evening so so yemen with his project and they expected to invade yemen with pakistan's army and they were like we're good
as i stood out man
so like they're only way out now is to make a deal this delay the ex president who they were in part fighting against all this
like pope that he turns it turns back on the movies which may do and what they just did in lebanon i don't know freedom and gets to that does say
he only united the entire country behind their prime minister who they already the they actually fucking hate the he turned lebanon it's just a unified country every sacked going like give us back our shitty dom as prime through i'm going to jump ahead now i'll go to the resistance
he does mention it but only to see the m b s wouldn't comment on the strange goings on with prime minister is yours
we'll have an aunt is very obviously and they've they've got apparently black water guys beating the shit out of these dudes and the hilton while that was daily mail's satcher it maybe it maybe i mean like they definitely do use me they're getting tortured come on up yeah but the torture is like you know they show them a sexy woman and bikini and you can not
comment
bad they weren't all here's here's a picture of a made for malaysia doing her job without getting threatened you could add not going to torture family
so my family are reliable average of around here but he goes on to talk about how like actually the most important thing he's doing is not anti corruption but reforming islam and he goes here
it is if this virus this is friedman again if this virus have an antique pluralistic massage units think islam that came out of saudi arabia in nineteen seventy nine can be reversed by saudi arabia it would drive moderation across the muslim world is surely be walk around here were sixty five
the population is under thirty so he's like yeah all the people who use religious fundamentalism is like a tool to address their agenda and create like in conjunction with america create like this wave of political islam to you
counter arab nationalism and socialism in the sixties seventies any and also to hit it regional enemies well outside yeah exactly if the people who introduced in conjunction with africa
the as he calls it the virus of this he never mentions will have risen by name it in assembly
he does not know the word were hobbies it does not appear anywhere on your article or if there's anything about if there's anything about like a violent reactionary strand of a belief is easy is it is to get rid of it
as it is to spread it very easily invades the example sorry i you actually does mention one hobby clerics it's the example of pandora's box you open the box and all the bad things happen i do is put it all back
just by and i like that that i'd like that detail of what sixty five percent of the is on the thirty that means are very impressionable they've got different interests from the older ruling class
they like snap chat this is the snap chat generate if you will you know who isn't all the most organized group and the entire country outside the royal family it's certainly not people who are even more religiously art london
going to go what they can do is they can get this guy brandon war down
i'd okay is a different way and do something else arcs court t jang if they are afraid of the few other tidbits here
thomas recites goes the saudi education minister child in that among a broad set of education reforms he's redoing and digitizing all text oh hell yeah sending seventeen hundred saudi teachers each year to a world class schools in places like finland to upgrade their skills and now seeing that for the first time so
saudi girls will have physical education classes in public schools and this you're adding an hour to the saudi school day for kids to explore their passions in science and social issues under a teacher supervision with their own projects so they're adding gym class and going to have i pads and saudi schools so that has asked for rugged
the i pad in the school thing is just one other the honest but it's also for guys like friedman it is a panacea it is like spanish fly it's like they get a whiff of it and they're just wet they get so moist over just the words fucking
computer in the classroom they think that's the solution that every fucking hate that kids are going to be like oh boy i pad i'm going to go to wikipedia and learn everything i've done with the letter a
and i just did a google they're just going to type in like sex porn dot com a ratchet fight
they're going to run our call themselves and their friends beating up some girl at the local law and put it on youtube oh i think i think a lot of ads to resurrect will keep i think a lot of them are going to become gamers are some great games in the eye on the apple store
i just editing of the saudi a stone team is going to look out for them in nexus i just i think it's having the reader in the classroom there must be like when ned flanders showed homer his his cable tv package there's like fifteen hundred channels all blocked
a good saudi game
it's a variation on counter strike he plays the french commandos that rated the grand decisions every night but you only have five minutes before your temporary conversion to islam whereas we will
get a booster
passengers of the correct
i've got loot and crates
keep your keep your gaming going on when i was as argued about that with somebody i forget where but we're we're saying that late for the five minutes of the french guys were muslims that are were like what if one of their friends died in there like we all thought we would get out of this mission be able to draw muhammad again
so hard for us not to draw muhammad ten minute well there was an the the surviving commandos found charlie have done but there were there was a big controversy about loot crate because all you can get our skins of the prophet muhammad
so now living gaming job
i get that sadly leech them with so
earlier when they get to foreign policy
he says he won't comment on a prime minister hariri of lebanon come on the saudis
saudi arabian announcing his resignation seemingly under pressure so here's where it gets really revolting he goes he insisted that the saudi he backs worrying yemen which has been a humanitarian nightmare
not like
thomas didn't put the word humanitarian and for a nightmare but i think like he really was thinking public relations nightmare
area in which has been a humanitarian nightmare was tilting in the direction of the pro saudi legitimate government there which he said is now in control of eighty five always and and over him
it was all i see has been given the fact that pro iranian who the rebels who hold the rest launched a missile at riyadh airport anything less than one hundred percent is still problematic
anything less than one hundred percent control and he can only pitch it towards the safety of these inbred shit heads in riyadh not the literally millions of people are starving to death and getting medieval disease and he owes his general view seem to be that with the backing of the trump administration he praised president trump as the right person
the right time the modalities soccer the saudis in their arab allies were solely building called he doesn't mention their israeli allies or other but he goes we're slowly building a coalition to stand up to iran i am skeptical the dysfunction in rivalries of in the sunni arab world generally have prevented forming a unified front up to now
now which is why iran indirectly controls for arab capitals today damascus son a baghdad in beirut the iranian overreach is one reason and b s was scathing about iran's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei you'd think you'd think that the who these just are iranians by the way people write to them
the right about them i mean it's a logistically impossible for them to get the type of support that the saudis gave to say like any any of this law is herbs and syria or or any any of the when they helped start isis into those and six i mean that it's him
possible for them to do it and they're not in lockstep the iranians obviously back them because of a bunch of guys and sandals can destroy billions of dollars and saudi equipment go for it but a series or gets really good and on one who she is iranian and iran and just dominated by iran anyone who's soon he is in a grand coalition for democracy
so he goes
iran's supreme leader
b s year around supreme leader is the new hitler of the middle east
but we learn from europe wide yeah i knew it was the old and hitler and his dad
sit oh my
saddam was the old hitler the middle east
hitler are you writing that he is the new hitler the middle east but we learn from europe that appeasement doesn't work we don't want the new hitler in iran is little car my head
you know precipice of an enormous crossroads we laud from the european example dead dead preoccupation with p don't work this is just like richard chamberlain when he went to manage
goes we don't want the new hitler in iran to represent to repeat what happened in europe in the middle east what matters most though is with saudi arabia does at home to build its strength and economy like of these two paragraphs is that friedman goes from obliquely referencing the humanitarian nightmare in yemen that's being carry
eat out by saudi arabia with us support that many people have basically said his genocidal at this point the starvation being carried out there among that portion of the country that has resisting saudi control in this disaster and they started epidemic their the era of yeah disease and starvation that has been
posed by saudi arabia and america as basically a were silent partner and all of this world that we're letting this happen
you want to are not a partner
we love it we we gave the saudis laser targeted does nations he's one of the of the bombs a bit strange
so he goes and describing that situation in yemen obliquely to than just letting and the ass call iran is leader the new hitler
because he because iran now has influence in four hour of capitals is iran currently carrying out a genocide in any country
i mean i guess they would argue they would argue they would argue that area
the point is a rich the call iran hitler when they are carrying out their own genocidal war and yeah also i have the feeling that mountains on and just found out about hitler
calling around eight dollars
very asinine a historical seems seems like siblings very poor choice of where and which country which country is turning a generation of muslims into religious fanatics not like maniacs for the of the hell offices the indonesia it's not fucking more they stop the extremism cut it out of done with yeah fuck it though
i'm still massage and as though it has know i'm i'm still racist
slaves
still committed warcraft i'm still going to be a cholera i'm still starving yemen
still actually liked
actually exported surrealism into syria
extremism should have done with it
so last line here he says
but can m b s and his team see this through again i make no predictions he has his flaws that he will have to control insiders here tell me they include relying on a very tight circle of advisors who don't always challenging sufficiently you needs a team of run he has a tendency to start to many things that don't get finished he talking about yemen
there
hasn't had an idiot off there's a whole list but guess what perfect is not on the menu hear somebody had to do the job rich saudi arabia into the twenty first century and stepped up i for one am rooting for him to succeed in his reform efforts of for you guys chime in here is that when he said rich saudi arabians the twentieth
a century and i'm rooting for it my mind is just drawn back once again to vintage thomas friedman who said of the iraq war that that would help wrench the arab world into the twenty first century and then american troops would be the ones to go door to door and say if you don't like maternity how bout you suck on this socket lose second
look i mean wrenching along to the twenty first century it's like pushing a car out of mode and also you have cholera and you're being bombarded by an inbred shit head and three billion dollar plane that last year i have ever give up that last paragraph solid like the copy a v h s for an eighties movie about a plucky been
kids to save a community center or putting on a show or going to work average amount of the twenty first century it's not going to be easy but i think the whack it gets get through it
same be prematurely exuberant
i hope that he's successful and we get where the corruption and massage any and the bad kind of islam and up the good guy all man i just thought about what if jobs return at the exact same time as corruption and that islam and and saudi are going to owe a lot of people but what if he said i'm going to make
saudi arabia great new what if he said the words radical islamic
that's why the thought what does he said merry christmas
we'll see
it's a political party with the ayatollah to resist radical is what if they invade iran take care of their budget deficit
well what mean we share the washington post editorial page will be broadly behind all of their for absolutely and the new york times as well note and know that so guys that does it for this week but before we go we would be remiss if he didn't let you in its now that's special time of year is that most wonderful season of the year we're talking about

it guys so next week but let's nine on fire by everybody
oh alright
oh to be learned that your daily routine like i'm not wearing them
have seemed to be a meeting in buzzing noise
have you had a really good






okay
java it's go we're back that's your toronto earth
for would date world you'd probably listening to this
was just dive right into it obviously
we're here now
probably like
the big thing this week that we have to talk about profligate to spend most of the shows are going about his the this tax bill that's winding its way through the halls of government headed to the president's desk
and is surely going to basically i know just performed the final queue to draw whatever is left of i don't know
america our civil society
i wish i had something funny to say or something more uplifting but like this is just this is all bad and the thing that i said earlier this week when it looked like it was going to pass is
just to me like just the hallmark of just like a defeated culture and society they just seem like pretty much worn out by this and like the class war is over and i feel like the bad guys one and as tax bill is the culmination of probably thirty to forty years of the right when movement in this
it is thoroughly chip away at the welfare state
just transfer more and more of society's wealth and to fewer and fewer hands and they've pretty much done it yeah
i mean like look this thing was always going to pass it was always going to pass because you know the five respected resistance republicans they suck out of the same teeth as senator fuck in ceremony sam from texas so those donors told them they had the passes because what does
even the point of a republican president or congress if you can't pass this piece of shit it's their last ditch effort and wealth transfer so last ditch effort in beating down people so much they can't even stand up said oh you know what rightfully so they said the democrats could have done more they could have always done more but the thing is the only birth of that
stop this fucking thing is steven paddock had a season ticket pass the congressional softball i'm serious that's the only way because
no man nomad no level of congeniality your phone calls or anything means as much to susan collards as donor money nothing means as much as a post retirement speaking gig or fuckin no work book or whatever the fuck you flake is going to do those to him
yeah and that's so sobering to see because the the thought oh this was the of as the was well yeah they want to work for their donors obviously because they need to be able to fund their campaigns but at the same time there are certain things they can't do at the risk of inciting popular opposition that would overcome even a while
funded campaign but these these just fuckin took a fire hose piss on the third rail of politics here cutting medicare medicaid go on go on whole hog the saying yes we're transferring wealth from port the poorest people the fucking contrary to the richest people on earth in the history of earth that we're going to give them even more than they've ever had and you would think
why wouldn't they be afraid of the reaction of that but clearly they have made the calculation that having their donors
at their back and giving them money is more important to securing and maintaining power than actual voters
because they've clearly done the work and are continuing to do the work of gerrymandering and voter suppression and democracy demoralizing people that that competitive elections are sort of going away and as such the only thing that's going to matters whether you have the money to sort of outgun whatever yahoo honda dealer with a fuck
confederate flag tattoo on his forehead who runs against you in the primary because that's the only thing you have to worry about i'm in we'll see i feel like when a is coming in i kind of looked at the world around me during to those sixteen and a year i take a very on scientific method and i look at you know how much money but
spending on this or how much how much money net flicks is going in debt and you look around and you see this bubble fake cheap credit rolling around the same thing that we saw from two thousand three to two thousand and eight and you know that's the kind of green economy we had we had a jobless recovery for the two thousand and eight recession and we
we solve the bleeding by just shooting a thirty wrote not of fake money on everything where there's nothing actually created values just declared and things are willed into existence by ten figures debt that mean nothing to private enterprise and it's totally unsustainable
and i thought that maybe one of the silver linings with tromp was that the crash was always going to come and if it came under hillary we would get like a wave of competent horrible blood and soil fascists very quickly two years and but now with the tags taxable i feel like they've sort of took an happy pad or a test
oster earn an adrenaline shot and just jammed into this on the economy so we'll see maybe the crash comes a year later than it does maybe it comes in two thousand and twenty i don't know what happens when that does but while we're on borrowed the belief structured that the tax hikes are you know people making under like one hundred grand a year or whatever going to kick in
in two or three years so if the democrats do get the ways as twenty twenty altar of shithead supporters raise my taxes yeah it was it got advantages raise taxes
oh it's like i like these
then and the people who love this and they're like
do feel like you the government's money so much why don't you just give them more than what you pay in taxes or whatever like a more money in my pocket they're talking about four hundred dollars right
and i worked like four hundred dollars on one side weighed against like the entire infrastructure of like american civil society that's just being
did any just trash also what the fuck do you think the government is going to spend that on they'll instantly buy a new punisher de gaulle for it
then are going to give four hundred dollars for the poorest person you fucking moron and here's here's the thing going gonna use it to air brush rex tiller since fucking pussy that lives in is now
jared a new high chair
oh and anything that's actually good with the shit heads in charge and it was obama they would have would have been like a new gift machine for the white queen
all our a lot of people last cheese so this is crazy how know there's never really been any meaningful congressional action on climate change even though the evidence for its is serious impending threat is pretty clear and i think that this bill is really the biggest piece of climate change legislation or
going to see this is the way for the wealthiest among us to get enough fucking money that they can create the private infrastructures to survive whatever catastrophes coming the fucking bio dome is with laser dogs guarding the doorways and fucking moon basis for were fucking on musk it jack off it
outer space and watch the not get into a gravitational fucking field around the moon or whatever and that's what the money is going to go towards it's going to go to their nice private army is fucking helicopters because they're not going be roads anymore it's going to be like fuck it rio de janeiro
and they need as much money as they can before it all all the fucking wheels come off and this is where how they can get it but the newspaper that just business will publish inside leads him it's to be really good
oops on the baron trump administrative democracy dies within the earth's atmosphere
a slow on ilan mosque and rick and morty your brain waves at each other it's going to be fucking epic well here's the thing like you know it's not it's it's like this is a tax bill but it's so much more than that
is
as i said like a thirty to forty your combination of what the right wing
the their their donors and the billionaires in this country like the the coax for the murders or whatever have been working for which is a fundamentally like restructuring of american society that just leaves the vast majority of people just almost completely naked and vulnerable and and like i said this is why feels like we're living in
we lost a war or something like this is a lake well we did yeah yeah and they did it in like two weeks which is frankly i'm president that's impressive hazy but they got mike flynn for making a phone call too early
did it or dumbest man in america is going to be mildly inconvenienced or three months we did it i mean the the example that someone brought up that i think is a good one is what this is now like the country writ large what sam brownback that to kansas so he became governor a couple of years ago when you know arthur laffer advised him
how to like you know this is the old trickle down like just tax cuts will create revenue or pay for themselves and what he did was just blow a fucking the whole of the state budget and it was a disaster and there's something wrong or is doing and own or here they're going to now they're blowing a hole through our entire country's budget and like but the thing is like that's it's intended to do
yeah and it's intended to do that because as met said
right after the going past is tax bill next on the chopping block social security and medicare they were privatized both of those are going to cut him to the bone why because there's no money we don't have any money
it really helps to graze a we just put a trillion dollars money just a literal transfer a trillion dollars to the wealthiest people in this country and there's all the sudden worth the money go we can't do anything oh my god there's also many many provisions in his tax bill that are directly attack education both public and higher i mean
there's another orrin hatch orrin hatch put in a tax credit for if you send your kid to religious school so if you're looking to start a new taliban don't worry the government is looking out for you now i believe
exactly but i believe like this bill
deductions for like all higher education except for hillsdale college in michigan which is like that guy he's in a school that literally let's kevin d williamson be an honorary professor well they're the only one that invite him in
ecologists should be
they've got taken out but it was so funny it's like okay i'm the equivalent of that is in hyde park the neighborhood i grew up in barack obama
he is i'm in
there is the hotel health food store called monsanto and it's a terrific story it has all types of juices and amino acids and there's like a painting of jesus christ within a half row with the background is the milky way to juices the cosmos is
during that the stimulus bill
this village it's like we're is in the marginal tax rate on all income and bone half a million dollars to seventy five percent and we're giving tax credit to bomb santa fe i'm fifty third street and hyde park that so brazen it is but they don't give a shit and what's great is you know that sake mall harris does when or fucking curse can ran her you know
al franken john conyers super ticket wins and two thousand and twenty they will immediately work with the shit heads on fixing the budget deficit is will take them at their word about being the deficit hawks again at all only all i did grand bargain what was so amazing is that i honestly don't think that the republicans even understood how much things have changed in terms of accountable
to be totally destroyed but by the fracturing of the electorate by people tuning out or becoming hyper partisan and not caring about details because remember the beginning of the year it was paul ryan who convinced trump we got repeal obamacare before we do the tax cut because we're gonna need to have a justification for we're going to be able to say that we're paying for the tax cut with the savings
from getting rid of obama care that was his argument and then they tried it and they couldn't they couldn't get it to go and then there there were just like oh we can just do it anyway
and no one actually gives a shit about the trillion dollars that we're adding to the holy fuck like they didn't even fucking realize how far things have gone and now they do that are fucking kick him through the door the realizing the wood is completely rot
the only thing that bears
underlining about all of this is like i feel like right after the election like when we recorded are right after the election year zero show it was like in the pit of my stomach like you knew this was coming because like the right has power in this country
what they're going to do because they understand power and power is about maintaining power and taking away the power of your enemies the democrats do not do that when they're in charge and i think it bears
contrasting what the republicans are doing with their house and senate and white house versus what the democrats did in two thousand and eight and two thousand and these fucking pussies had a provision in obama care that people did sign up to vote when they went to changes and they fucking took it out because they're afraid it would look to fucking partisan
he met with a fucking head of all the big five bags and will the say with something like you know
what could do
take or your free lunch
i'm not looking to take where the dog gyro
i mean to amazing but it's like it's not that they're naive
they don't give a hit
that's why that they don't want the things that they say they want they don't want the things that their voters want their job is basically managing the expectations of people who they have no interest in actually seeing a having their lives may better and that was what obama years proved yes they do have a congenital sorkin
ass fetish for comedy and procedure and that is built into the liberal world view and a way that isn't the conservatives and that does stop them because they are do genuinely believe that they have internalized lot of the area but part of the reason they have internalized that is because that is part of the mechanism that keeps them from ever actually fuck
accomplish i have irreconcilable with actual actual ideology that you believe in to the extent that you going to do whatever it takes to pass legislation that fills that now
we're talking about like when people want to talk about the limited successes of the first two years of the obama presidency people will say well hey they had sixty votes but to those guys like max baucus lieberman they were basically they were being held hostage by these conservative democrats but that's because they they they all agreed that they are
we're going to go by the rules were they're gonna need sixty for everything but if you have fifty one people in the senate and the neighbor talked about certainly never talked about when democrats in power if you have fifty one people in the senate you can basically do anything you want read did that at one point and mcconnell famously did in order to get course i've gotten the supreme court right yeah but they won't do it
they'll do it now with legislation yeah they'll they won't do it with legislation even though they could yeah they could have passed with fifty one votes they had the votes for a public option they are the votes for car check which would have doubled union membership in the private sector in a country and they had the votes for the dream
two thousand and ten would have happened how did you think that to the sixteen would have happened if card check went through know but they you know what they don't want to hold on the house really really want oh god no the responsibility of actually holding power is so fucking bad because it threatens all of the members of leadership because then the expectations are made that they can't they have
no interest in actually fucking following through on and that is that's attention that has to be resolved some way and the best way is to lose one of those who we don't have to worry about it anymore but you don't to have to say though yes if they've done that if they'd random everything through they would have been called a crazy radicals who didn't care about democracy and rammed things through it
undemocratic fashion and as we know because they were so careful with the obama care stuff they didn't get called that by republicans for eight years
not worth doing it
i gained a lot of good will in good faith from their opponents by being that responsible the party elected a guy who got into politics by saying that he was born in kenya they don't give a shit they don't these fucking cock suckers even after the past the past this insane bill
bill on par with the to mayor government any authoritarian vote democratic government this scene wealth transfer to beat down everyone there were like yeah about obama care was passed kind of late at night they don't give a shit because they know what even the fucking national review cox they know what politics is about well i think i just want to read here from leader
or of the senate democrats chuck schumer his his reply
it's anti semitic present are generally speaking when he goes up there it is like the biggest tragedy of this bill is that are below good friends with battle thrall for him
i like it in order to retire from chechnya
he said about the tax bill he says he treated tonight i feel mostly regret what could have been tax rock you tax reform is an issue that is ripe for bipartisan compromise there is sincere desire on this side of the i also work with the g o p particularly on tax reform
but we have been rebuffed time and time again
he's right about that because their last wants this fucking fail to have their daughters want less taxes on their ill gotten game as much as republican donors do so there is bipartisan support for it it's just they want they want a couch it make it make it more middle class friendly but at the end they both have a vested interest in
seeing a massive wealth transfer to the to the upper percentages but the republicans have the numbers and why bother with these arsenals when we can just get everything and then get all the fucking build money because we could actually get things done
also in the democrats response to the tax bill
i'm not kidding
the senate democrats social media arm their social know put out the use any videos of ronald reagan passing more they also
this it you fucking as yields of bipartisanship and it's like partisanship is why the republicans controlled visually branches again there is no more bipartisanship they're going to elect a fucking pedophile you don't know what what were the means i i just like ronald reagan
you're here comes that boy and he's spilling arms all over all over a bunch of nicaraguan controls not forget the fact that reagan's fat tax cuts that they're lauding because there were bipartisan set the stage for thirty years of wealth redistribution upward am fucking stagnation of wages for actual working people that lets hundred
all started reading about fucking chart that was the first starving of the beast that's where the kansas blueprint came from you fucking moron where do you think arthur laffer made his bones one more thing
has party leader nancy pelosi queen
distract the tax word with a crying emerge face
you are born in the middle of world war one shut the fuck off
your friends with the lindbergh baby
iraq
so tell us how this tax bill makes you feel three of oh geez or less as karl bear had a blog posts i thought it was very important where he pointed out that this whole incident prove conclusively that incremental case for incremental reform that we keep hearing over and over again from establishment damage
rats
is completely bogus and meaningless because the virtue of incremental reform that were told over and over again as while yeah it's not classy and it's not what you want but you make things slowly better for everybody as opposed to if you're too radical then you don't get anything accomplished but look what happened everything all those little slow
fucking incremental things that they did in those first two years of obama obama care which by the repeal of the obama care magnet is in this bill and slightly higher taxes on higher earners and all that stuff that stuff is all gone now it's gone it might as well have never happened if they shot for the moon in two thousand and nine
and not gotten anywhere we would be in the same position but you know it might be different people might have seen them standing up for big bold progress of changes and maybe the rape alter is president heard it said that you know
lose in two thousand and eighteen when democratic the white house don't worry they're going to repeal this bill but you know how people say once you once you make an entitlement it's it's pretty damn near impossible to get rid of that entitlement the same goes for tax cuts in two thousand and twelve
obama and the democratic senate they made permanent most of the bush tax cuts
i have the same and the same we're going to get in the democratic don't require soon we're going to get into hyams the barn and the permits where he gave year
but
no talk about entitlements okay entitlements are tough to take away from people but like normal people who have entitlements that they actually need that are human rights he away from them because he just beat them down over generations and just yank it from their weekend hands but rich people they ever pathology where there is a little bug in their brain that tells them they're going to be happier with six
a million dollars and fifty even though they're just they live in a complete moral rod and their lives or allen they're fucking monsters because that is legitimate addiction to want a horde money like that you think they're going to give it up they've already gone to this point
i actually have fucking money to make sure that whatever happens in the future is not going to let them they were more if they wanted all they want it all the rest of us will have to bow and scrape for them to had the privilege of working for them unless we go a
talk about like in with regards like the democrats utterly weak response that's because here's the thing they couldn't stop this from happening
the problem is they could have done things like years ago they could have just chosen to be like or a party that represents the interests of their voters they made that choice a long time ago we're we're here now at the very presence or they couldn't probably couldn't stop this bill
their response to it is just so weak and selling because it just like i want you to think about contrast to the democrats response
above a nation of a tax bill that like i said is just indescribable be bad for everyone in so many ways contrast their response of the charts of chuck schumer or nancy pelosi you just like we're very disappointed we tried to be too late and we were rebuffed at every turn
compare that to that video know a lotta you saw online this week of jeremy corbett doing a video for labour where he said the bakers at morgan stanley described labour under under us as a threat guess what they're right
we are a threat to you then guess what they're a threat to your alive so you're goddamn right magic amazingly who who is the democrats enemy
if
enemy run from and rudeness
russia
i know chuck schumer could make a video but it's about to make night out will blunts in his car when you going to fund raisers it's a big video where he's lake i saw a blunt wrapping at the bottom of that that that matter my car was a gift for my daughter's wedding
who are they identifying as the enemies in our society and until we have a politics is so what there's a political movement in this country it says we can either have a democracy in the richest nation in the world that provides a decent quality of life for everyone or we can have billionaires but we can't have both
the i that is i like good value
battle is good billionaires a bad
i please and liberal institutions that underwrite them alex per he made this point i think is exactly right until they realize that they will be the target of a relentless rat fucking campaign by these people who have no regard for the decor of and decency that so believe in so lovingly until they realize that they're going to be the time
targets of this shit until they just take away the money for the fucking robert mercer of the world take away their fucking money machine is going to keep happening yet i mean look the other party is i cannot reiterate this enough they're voting for a guy this month and they're going to go all of them are going to say he did that pedophilia in this
nice it's okay
yeah that's they're all making their conscious choice you can't be they've made up their mind because they hate you and the like the people that hate you
and they will and as long as as well as long as they have the money they're going to pay james o'keeffe to dress up like pepe le pew and tried to seduce your house cat for something isn't really video it does it matter how fucking dub in ham fisted and obviously stupid and fake all this shit is it will work big got the democrats to fucking defined
a chord because of that that fucking could yeah an organization that actually helped register out register to vote and was one of the leading lights who understood that the housing crisis was coming and they got got they got you got a ludicrously any video and then they fired a theory sure the share out another and another
edited video because as soon as it happened they panicked they shut up bunch of squeak out of their ass holes and they fucking realize all is going to look bad oh man people they're going to be matter of no shit they're going to be mad at you they're going email to you no matter what you fucking do you moron whereas what they have that they have the pedophile senator gorman up and remember remember
mitch mcconnell when the first accusations came out and the first poll said that he was looking like he might not when they were like were selected we're gonna rock and kick him out of the it now now that he isn't lead now and pulls mcconnell said a lot of people alabama to know
shit like that was ever not on the agenda
because these people like the liberals exist and this continuum where they think that like the other side will be embarrassed when they see them at cocktail parties and they're not you you don't give a shit they're not you
it's instructive to contrast the resistance to this bill to the mobilization against the obama care appeal which was successful with the margin of one vote and the messaging against your care appeal which was all call your senators called the senators and that sort of thing it was straightforward it was going to increase the number of uninsured in the cunt
three
it's going to take away this entitlement and this time around the messaging i saw the mobilization against the tax bill it was not as potent and the message it was it was it was scattershot right i saw
planned parenthood talk about fetal person who had language in the bill i saw a lot of people talk about the drilling and anwar provision and it occurred to me that
the democrats no longer have a language that is useful to describe what is literally class warfare they don't have a political discourse that like you say identifies actual enemies who you should hate at home you should fight
feet as to his name but they very clearly pointed out that it will actually increase the deficit that's it that's all they had yeah as they have fundamentally bought that conservative right wing frame they are still so scared of reagan and all of this shit and the laffer curve that that's all they can talk about the deficit let us read the bill please before
for pass the anyway yeah part of it is like okay one reason the obama care repeal mobilization asia successful was because there was a precedent there was least her a few years there is president of this the tangible thing that they were going to take away because they actually as lacking is it was and how easily it's going to die
soon obama care with something they gave people one was the last time democrats gave people like a sheer just unambiguous then unambiguous economic program an unambiguous piece of fiscal policy that normal people could look at in their wives and say oh that time was better for me they can't because of the state
was this massive public private partnerships and loans for small businesses and fucking you can't figure it out it was intentionally designed to hide the government's role it was written the language of that of the stimulus was that it was supposed to be invisible right because they've spent thirty years
thirty years hiding their role because they're afraid reagan's going to come back from the dead
and there are afraid that people will notice that maybe one sometimes they want to spend more than the other party so when the time actually common game and it's like later dicks on the table is our vision world what's your vision the world their vision of the world is
this is like did you see an article about compromise is bullshit fundraiser were working on operated by the way he had a sore throat is what the fuck
is there a provision in the democratic party leadership they all have to be dying and have been
ages got up their dog about procedure what the fuck you know when you and it's not even working even like even their hollywood donor base of like bryan singer is donating while he has he has health problems the
when you hear these call it too much beer civility listening to both sides being friends across the aisle you've implicitly accepted a right wing reactionary frame that says that politics is just about these petty grievances because a conservative frame who are the conservatives enemies it's liberals pointy headed
college professors starbucks cops it's trivial shit so of course they could be lecture to reach across the aisle they could even do it because their grievances or asinine it has absolutely nothing to do with a day to day lives but whore that democrats enemies is it wall street which hedges it's beds between both parties is an energy seals every democrat elected in west virginia owns a wreck
dirty coal mine is it big pharma like joe mansions daughter is it recipients of big unearned inheritance is like all of their kids and all of their donors kids you can't have this frankenstein democratic party where we say okay we're we're we're going to have a huge like a powerful donor base but also left wing politics
it's impossible it's not going to exist it's just basically power through chicanery
why honestly there's good reason for despair because it's just like will who the fuck else is there yeah
i mean are likely at a point where like we're trying to do something here
to get our way out of this but like
said this sinking feeling that was suddenly right after the election it's like you do something like this they're exposed to become like i said that is the covert issued said over and over again of a long drive to basically do away with whatever little threadbare pieces of the new deal and civil society or a public sector is left over this country
and just to make america more the lives of people were more precarious more stupid more cruel and the lives of the greedy as nasty as people even more greedy and you know dave weigel several others pointed out you know okay know why why are people attacking the democrats who none of them voted for this bill
i'm sorry that's just the baseline behavior i expect is not showing up in signing on to it but you have within the caucus bernie sanders proposed amendment
that would
prevent any automatic cuts that will be caused by this bill and the deficit spending the social security medicare and medicaid and to democrats mark warner and tom carper showed up and voted no on it and mark warner said afterwards the you know listen i've i was a member of the gang of six or gang of aid or whatever
i'm big on entitlement reform mark warner was almost obama as vice president
paterson were beating with kendra lust and riley reid and were calling them to not do any more hardcore scenes until we take care of the of we don't want our kids pain and saw where the night
i love you where the fuck with like a pete peter said it is fucking deficit reduction rap squad
he was sucking this themselves out of an infant where one is fucking have a car and his his no
only able saw about lasting effects of this fucking tax bill my the way
deploy the capital
the capitol steps that of thing in during the voting and you saw every yes sir and you know i just like we are all acceleration
i don't know what else to say i i i i i hate that idea what do you want to despair you want to get even real or than this like i said after this tax well what's next so security and medicare by mistake about of those oh what's that have memorize it what say that there is some like big political backlash at how horribly popular nasty the oldest
shit is oh who's that it's like pump hail and tom cat and running our foreign policy will do everything in their power over the next couple of years to start of another massive are
i just say if there is one guy will just
spontaneous combustion to save the world were dead zone and som gotten it's gotta be that kind of god
had a guy who basically yeah
maybe you saw this i saw a piece about him interviewed him of the times as we were they asked him what is your guilty pleasure and have gotten said i rode every morning and i rode to every morning i get up early and go jogging every morning so i can reward myself by eating birthday cake everywhere with you running from
crawl space
not going to be really go going to be lit when the cia director tom cat in the sense ted nugent to kill the ayatollah with a fucking bow and arrow that's you know that that person is it humid i mean though the kinds of ads that that you should be running they should be specific personal attacks on this individual and his family and say this is not a normal human being who knew him
you might see he is a las colas op ed i'd psychopath whose only thing that really gets them out about of the morning other than fucking birthday cake is the thought of starting another massive us or in the middle east this time against iran and boy oh boy if you big fucking twenty seventh he was a dumpster fires
wait till two thousand and eighteen and twenty nine with till we lose and wait till iran starts hitting targets in america that fucking make make nine eleven look like a like a jade home rehearsal drill
it's going to be bad i mean like look if you are tom card and sexual partner if you like jack off with a man can you anything i don't know what can even take anyone down in america anymore if tom gotten leg he plays console games when he hooks up with to that mixer that allows you to use a mouse and keyboard to cheat that might work
just anything please
you have have of town cotton he live streams ebay on twitch and pretends that he's using his he only a lot
what they did not have gotten her
copyright authorities or yeah yeah
yeah just will acceleration
why you don't have to worry about the morality of oh should i root for are the worst to happen
i hope that it will accelerate the mobilization needed to stop it you don't have to worry about that were on that were in that time why it is what do you mean we will see you when we are now in the show in iran
with the new tokyo row saying that felix we went on
that okay well you're going to be a been acceleration and so it goes to show why you can't resist
this rightly in class warfare without in in in effective and monolithic working class party because the democratic party members of the democratic party elected officials who are just the same running birthday cake eating creeps as tom con are just always going to be widely reviled
and bad as you pointed out of course these poor slobs who won't benefit from this bill whatsoever they're just going to get fucked by of course they should vote republican because republicans will still give them something they want they're going to trigger the lives looking at the polling in this bill the messaging against it was totally ineffective you had
a massive number of people undecided they don't know anything about this bill there was no coherent opposition message so people just who had an opinion about it just relied on their preexisting affiliations in grievances and as we saw online
the child's are all holding and winking for this bill because it it will trigger that lives
i mean usually associated with you
had like a tweet that be viewer social media big declare your to tweet that did mad these and five figures is guided very easily it's no big deal for me i do one every day but all the replies do it from normal republicans are like looks like you got a dose of vitamin stupid and give you your life is
going to get worse and
not even that much time like you just fuck yourself to give boot booklet and to tax credit to buy his own pedophile
you fucking but i will say i like i can't really hate the child's that much any more than i could hate or raccoon for scurrying around my trial yeah but those really i do i hate the most are the sensible conservatives who wrote all of these are bad saying that oh we're
this is bad for the deficit where it seems like the republican party doesn't actually care about of fiscal prudence anymore and then the people who came out and said well you need to be nice to john mccain he's a hero we talking about john mccain it his the family
one of the arguably the mccain families taken more from the world than the term family we age is over time it's one of the wars families in the fucking world we should do one segment every episode for every single senator in the run we shouldn't we should do the walter we should do like stephen colbert segment where you like profiles and you'd better know it is it wrecks but we should do it
for a cancer cell and mccain
one of the worth living americans he wasn't even thirty years old he already had a fucking he already had a fucking basement volvo little vietnamese skeletons absolute fucking monster through and through and then in his entire public life all he did because dc journalist liked him personally i don't know why because he remind
your grandfather who had pulled him aside and told him a racist joke i don't know why add up to protect american though protect negative we had begun begun by the way you
sorry shadow
feinberg gotten a little bit of a around this week when she treated like responding to a john mccain support for this awful tax bill
congratulations to john mccain his wife and children or their upcoming tax free inherited a viable got mad because they're like were kids dying how dare you beg and became like demanded that she apologized to her mother and shit but actually believe that she did respond but she responded no way that i thought was very funny
and clever and was still basically twisting the knife so jealous and it megan again game out with african crocodile tears you owe my mom and you all my ball

and then she gets to utter fucking million dollars to swim around it like scrooge bit dark when it's over she's going to be fi hang on in cindy mccain defense she's also will fail daughter heiress know there is a comprehensive that is the falcon family because yeah that yeah and grandfather were admirals and john couldn't even fly a plane for ten minutes on the detour
ariel mode without fucking crashing in cindy fell daughter meghan one of the biggest male daughter's who's constantly shoved in her face when her dad fucking keels over we're talking about this the show she's going to start hot soup two point oh but it's going to be called like the steam after this game on a latte and meghan mccain just got engaged to that fucking
domino of bend domino from the federalist and like people found after their engagement all these articles that bed domino wrote about meghan mccain fucking just insulting area
typically could
oh that is alpha game
mind in the federal i wonder what kind of relationship she might have had with her father where a guy who was just being a mean creepy were all the time
it's interesting well you know what if there is i don't think ashley owes into your big an apology but usually she owes me an apology for deleting that tweet mainly can we talk about another political fail daughter which one talking about chelsea clinton and i want to talk about a piece courtesy of bill sure
our bill sure is the brain warm king bill sure it's like we've different argument in the show before but you know how like or make fun of articles that are like you know is the original rosa parks hillary clinton were like other stupid bill sure is like he's operating he's living in thirty seventeen like all these articles are like you know it
actually bill clinton is a black woman
why not yeah bills are rules he's galactic brain bill here will tell will tell you straight your face that fucking bob rubin should run for president
so as we were talking about tom continent is going to go to see yeah he's a currently a senator from arkansas and bill sure writes an article for politico titled clinton should run for senate caught in the senate seat and it's like clinton which was and he goes sure and he's like well you know hillary clinton she says would have to over

she goes hilarious that his bag baggage bill
he's got too much baggage to in today's sort of like post heart thing when i think rape is bad

because the people of arkansas still love the clinton family
luckily she has thought she has the hillary what arkansas as we remember
when she won arkansas six sixty people at fly people at arkansas have fond memories of the bin laden family because she has a clear today but little of the kids at baggage
she wouldn't hurt for day recognition
cash
she's a place chair of the controversy bag that known as the clinton foundation but he builds really sort of the presidential can't by wiki leaks this the state department so chelsea caught getting doing good seats or root out corruption by foundation officials and warding of problems with the haiti earthquake relief she's an arkansas native even though she hasn't lived there since you

oh and married a less attractive
he very good without the powerhouse jewish summer camp counselor essential charisma
their campaign ad is going to be them were in overalls and playing a banjo and washboard but then she goes let's talk better start better pay as you go measures dramatically
she goes no sorry i just got to be would bore paragraph here were bullshit are you fucking of you bill
can you do bill brad stevens will share he says we all go she's gearing up to road for something someday she sharpened her political presence on twitter
now
she's release two books this year the popular children's history books she persisted and the less noticed but wait a year governing global health who runs the world and why in which he had a global public health professor explore how effective international organizations have been in combat infectious diseases by chelsea clinton featuring professor frink
that book is this health professor just describing all the new diseases that were discovered on her mother
this article fuck
added bill sure
never and kids is obvious that they're we started earlier the biggest you
back back and there's a lot of despair in the first half but guys let's just have now
cell phone to talk about
can we too we just talk about that chuck grassley tweet
either you know chuck grassley the only person older than the the things mentioned about that is because it's about this tweet is about the the estate tax which was repealed completely i believe with the house bill yes and will probably make it and the committee because they really want to get rid of it some of this not controversy as long as i usa
that's what's it saying about it that's the easy for me the fact that you fuck up messaging and something like that tax is the biggest indictment possible because everyone hates rich kid yes thank you
as you get asshole never lifted a finger and then you get a bunch of money when your parent dies it's it is repulsive it doesn't even it doesn't like even a libertarian so fixated on a desert theory of wealth and things like that well you know people those seals work hard what their shitty ass kids sure as fuck don't we all hate the who's the bad guy and all the john
whit movies it's not a mafia boss it's the mafia boss is shitty fucking okay
that's true of every mafia will be every angle with that guy is always the shitty asshole kid who had everything handed to him never lifted a finger for himself and that is every rich ass holes kid in america there would be so easy to point them out and say these people do not deserve this money and yet we are fundamentally incapable of talk
talking about it that way part of that reason by the way is you have people like bill shoe and an entire journalism class of people gormley and totally take in the idea that these these dynasties are to meet you just expect of course these people's kids are going to be brought into the journals let's bring him meghan mccain let's bring in fuck
road in pharaoh oh is that abby huntsman at the door and come on it's a party you a bunch of fucking witless dip shit who spent your entire lives like doing coke a fuck it private school and an instagram it and now you're going to talk to us on the national media of course there's no fucking vocabulary to point out that these tickets
nothing to deserve their status and the money that they're going to get would be vastly better spent actually making people's lives better except there and defend baron different but like if david if there was a house fire david athens compound in like a fuckin
a plane crash your on wall street a more ambitious one and the entire donor class of the democratic party got wiped out and it became like a and party you would win every seat in the house if you did something like you found every descendant of like the johnson and johnson fortune and went to push week and went to their like performance art shows
this is what we're going to get if we don't need air and it's all about that's exactly why i don't give a shit children are not off limits to these ruling class sick goes we should be attacking meghan mccain we should be running ads showing that the fucking psychopath trump sons not bear and me in that old meghan mccain
chelsea clinton the castle beach boys girls people who are widely reviled no matter who you are or where you stand society a list or just an extreme partisan moron and just say the these are the people who benefit at your expense in society they're getting hundreds of millions of dollars that they never fuck it weren't for whatever but
we basically have decided to pretend that you're taxing that's why they i mean that was the frank that's right i am sachs you're being taxed at beth but you're dead the money is you're no longer yours it is going to a new person and that new person is a spoiled piece of shit he was going to use the money to buy a fucking low
loft in fucking dumbo just have a bath tub full of cocaine and it and another bathtub with acid to dissolve the make a dose on the cocaine and accidentally and that's the problem is democrats will never ever have the moral grounding to be able to make that argument when you have people like joe mansion in your caucus yeah
pippen pimp and job yo mansion pimp
let me let me just put and true threat here people
chuck grassley this is when he said this wasn't a tweet but this is a comment he made but the estate tax he says this was just today he goes i think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing as opposed to those that are spending every darn penny they have whether it's odd booze or with it or movie
oh okay
i'm going to alone
oh
ever heard
odd movie millennium
somebody had phosphates
wait till the circus is a tattoo next season
mr graham cracker
excuse me i to go way you know what actually he is right movies are super expensive now and another thing brain tonic his back and the for a new tropics were super gilded age only rocks dude my dad is john d rockefeller i'm in a ride my little fucking will fucking diary that i tried
smoking cigarettes and it wasn't for me and my wife during the temperance movement give a shit anymore
it was as a fourfold
work on it it's talk about
sort of a jared again
king
finally a man the bond do the ceremony jeered steiner to hand the torah
it's annoying
jared spoke again it is finally i think this is partly because it gets back exactly what you're saying about like if if only there were some democrats could do it just like well they had all these choices and the what they made was to have a fucking hyped somebody beat hillary could probably biggest booster an owner of that's been
a shithead who just hosted jared the sabbath sub it now
it literally think tip for what his baby a violation of the logan egg which was reaching for russia to intervene to a vote about israel old on hold on i quote ricky from trailer park boys among the sort of person says a toda so fucking a total
remember when died of a rush again we're like israel does this shit all the time whoa whoa whoa look is violating the logan act on be has to israel
what truck wasn't actually president when he made this overture to russia which is funny but it doesn't matter who cares are give a shit but like
i would just again i would love to see jerry go to jail obviously that's the only that's the only enjoyment we can even vaguely hope so this is the sub bonds the support forum
brought to you
the purple and from that yeah
i'm settlements
is a second
so you can
jerry talked about it because you know he is our special middle east envoy special his official title was special little perfect board
chapel middle east
it was going to little friend to feel so you to resolve the israel palestine issue and he said it's like a real estate issue
dude it aspect oh is just a bad zoning thing you just gotta pay a fad italian what are your favorite things it's a real estate issue because jared is going to just go to china and begs a billionaire to buy the west bank let's suppose sub bond like starts up by going this is endlessly impressive thirty six year old boy who think
gave up his interest in real estate to help us all and it's like the only thing jared is actually don't like use like i'm going to go to china to work on a deal and he just spent his entire their time their per diem five thousand dollar watches with like the on and chinese party officials and going please please buy a please buy it
this your know that offering green cards and exchange for fucking buying his shitty building which is just breathtaking something that is kind of astounding that we just kind of forgot that our forgot company take and how trump to deliver quote the ultimate deal of solving the israel palestine
yeah chris their said our goal is sick opie beyond citing a piece of paper into creating an environment that builds jobs and opportunities like never before said jared get to bring over palestine
is the real your of dallas nigerians going to get appear fell people vintage one of jared i mean how do you that led him to fix the middle east the guy who's two jobs were borrowing two billion dollars to buy a shitty building and turning the new york observer into a coloring book i know you said a as a joke
will china buying the occupied territories actually makes the most sense that seems like the most feasible thing that's probably what's going to have down
china is just take this whole thing over i don't care anymore present and a fine man
got some room for pod cow family man a g by como started really hard move into iran but i will accept china in one belt one road one pod cast present a g i respect you i love you
you're a pimp
you're a gangster
take play a big deal because he has ready for some more people
ergo were out for now
the washington post just came out with a hilarious account of corey lead drought skis lukas rescue and downscale fuck
that i grew up in chicago which is just the most polish people
this is corey your words a recording of them
they have like a highlight reel of is suzy be released campaign tell all book oh man oh man there are some funny shit and here i was going to be had here says the article starts elton john blair is so loudly or donald trump's campaign play that the staffers can't hear themselves think that's good press secretary
hope picks uses a steeper to press shrubs pairs while he still wearing them awesome trump screams at his top aides who are subjected to expletive filled tirades in which they get their face ripped off color and trumps appetite seems to know no bounds
with a dinner order consisting of to piggyback is to fillet of fish and chocolate bolted seems as if he didn't or
donald sandwiches for dinner every oh right
he'll be over there
hello world how is he still alive
rich the honor is dead and donald trump
he's still a lot how is this a tire intestinal tract just not like anal beads put their tumors
this everything inside of his body he is a piece when a single item of non processed food out in probably sixty as he does not eat fruit peters not eat vegetables the only reason he does the scurry is because of all the fucking catch up that eats all
this episode nine nine hundred of more presidential by the fucking day so bright early at six am right now we're watching fox and friends i'd go to walk over the t v and thank them for great
okay pause the gritty work i love you guys don't know how you get the fuck on t v all right
right now i'm about to have about eight by cubic doubles these are morning mixed doubles they don't have keys on them he uses for later in the day after jared tells you about for gold the chinese guy he had to don't appear to have right now i'm going to summon jeff sessions to the office and make him stand on
a ruler we have to have them admit that he's five foot six everyday life
i thought he can only keep doing racism if i had humiliate him
again
you can't you can't laugh at this is what the fuck are you better where nothing else to do to your bow and trump dog his first flight on air force one and there was this press cowgirl around him he says grinning like an eighty year old wow tv
larry
just like new york one or something and you have daytime news ads and you just hear one eight hundred am
so fucking loud and just only here
what about one of the bad children is fairly in a child
dogs are bad santa he is lauren graham
i am not used to
she's but mermaid
for the advent calendar
oh
myself kill themselves trying to to whittle or wouldn't
i'm very i don't get it if it's not edible why would would out with on the detail about flaring and elton john it's like fucking almost famous they're also a tiny dancer on the other day this is an extra really for a bit about
about men for it where it says in a section of the book written by lewinsky trouble is described as flying on his helicopter when he learns that metaphor has said trove shouldn't be on television anymore that's the cardinal said that he should it be on the sunday shows that metaphor it should appear instead trump was angrier lewinsky he had ever seen him
ordering the pilot to lower the altitude so he could make a cell phone call this is now did you see i shouldn't be on tv so day ago a tv any goddamn fucking time i want and you won't see it or their focus worried about me truck yielded metaphor tone it down i want to turn it up
political bro you they are pro life
i've been around a timer to i know guys like you with your hair the skid gonna god
guys like you with your hair and skin those weird
guys like you have weird
with your epidermal layer of protection to keep you from being damaged by whether you weird bitch
i just have a thin layer of slime fifty years of eat the chicken
you're all fire i'm hiring a car choir of dancing skeleton sort of a nineteen thirties
says
how about why would he said i know guys like with your hair is already said other pro life louis and ascii called the quote one of the greatest take downs in the history of the world
you should lose does video of like a feral hogs screaming at another over an apple you'd be like destroyed what does the opposite so there's always a joke somebody was cursed like you know they ran over row or you know are they fucking kick the leopard
yeah what does the opposite of that like if he accidentally give a leprechaun an orgasm are in scotland and about it because he is the most charmed off in the history of the world he eats nothing but but charred grizzle and grade f meat
seventy years has no cancers he is nothing but fails and fucks up and loses billions of dollars and he just keeps getting it back when it comes fucking who
not this not know either loon goes thing is perfect because he is not even like just on his service he is not like a clever charming person in any way budget any of the insane stupid things he says like thirty percent of the country including korea who does he is like he's yeah he's a wizard with words you so cool
gets up there and he's like you know
i'm just gonna say right now her although we've had a turbulent relationship and people are like fucking die for you
cool what's so amazing though that america america is awful
atavistic capitalism is propped up by this ideology of have deserved wealth and and the self made man is is this fantasy figure that basically justifies all manner of of grotesque inequality even if he doesn't exist the idea of the self made man exists because we don't
want to stop that from happening that glorious miracle of someone rising from nothing and through their own guile and grit becoming rewarded with massive success because we want to make that possible were willing to overlook devastating horrifying and equality and injustice and then the our president is the anti
horatio alger he is the guy who just fucks up repeatedly is manifestly incompetent and corrupt and never pays for his entire existence repudiates the entire fantasy behind american capitalism and yet people just can't process that i guess so they just turn into
i'm like know he is he he wouldn't have the money if he wasn't smart good at his job
this is country
it's it's transparently is sham but fortunately i think more and more people are realizing what a sham meritocracy is and what you need is an actual political movement or structure that takes advantage of that allowed have yeah we had a lot of despair we i think we need to have a little bit are fucking sunshine and a little bit of
of of optimism politically and else going on sunshine and it is the fact that we've clearly are seeing a change in the way people think about yeah we're clearly seeing like we were talking about after the off year elections how you're seeing the beginning of sort of bush era post two thousand and six souring and ah
on national republicans and a willingness of people to come out to vote against them but this time there were so many people who are getting brought in on that wave who are out socialists who are genuinely purporting forth that class first vision that we've said has been missing so it's coming back yeah we need we need you
come over here
that's very true mad and know obviously a lot of people are going to be swept in his wave and it's also going to be a lot of you know d c d trip favorite candidates like stuttering veterans who talk about means testing medicare and things like that so if you think that
i hear people talking about this like if you if you maintain this fantasy that that this rift in the democratic party is is anytime soon going to be bridge
in time for two thousand and eighteen or beyond that's just not going to happen one side has to win and that's it this country is unseemly who and probably do but let's just be time back into this article because it's really fucking funny okay
this is
and another episode do and douse he describes house staffer sam nunn berg was purposely left behind at a mcdonalds because don't berg special order burger was taking too long lead him to said let's go
my getting us troops fast food diet is a theme on trump force one there were four major food groups mcdonalds kentucky fried chicken pizza a diet coke the planes cupboards were stacked with vienna fingers potato chips pretzels and many packages and orioles because trove are now geographer
would not eat from a previously opened package the book notes that orchestrating the orchestrating and tiny being of mr trump's beals was as important as any other aspect of his watch to the presidency and it describes the elaborate of efforts that little douse he and other top aides went through to carefully tired their delivery of hot fast food trucks played
as he was the party his rallies wet point hot
others food must be highway
that's i to think that our fires what's going to take of down is probably a salmonella outbreak and eight after people that the fucking crusty the clown uncharted the
yeah i know fell by the us the yards amazing is that the other campaigns and is the greatest collection of hyper ambitious goes and they had over a billion dollars
you to live would just a bunch of guys who were taking chinese off brand see alice in giving big bags to an infant
i am one
people twelve years old were thinking about their entrances days to harvard versus just all these dumb asses and the big
yeah baby
with luck
one
i wish i wish i could have been there to see the looks on their
what did the only regret i have about our election show is that we were wasn't it had avid enter it
i'm about i'm seeing just chewing psychopath he thought he was going to be like a state department under secretary when they like
the donald's guy one
the team of guys who can't go under pep boys because they said a racial slur wrong racial slur to i shudder
you know fair and square they did but they were helped along the way because the g o p s oh nice chewing psychopaths had made had plowed the field for them by doing voter suppression
the states
and decreasing turn out by by increasing voter id laws and making it harder to vote shutting voting voting places and they were doing that with that clear they were doing that with a clear eyed psycho intensity of any of these professional political operatives and then it all went to the benefit of the fat orange idiot rolling down a hill
in a giant barrel
diane minds the
there can i get up in obstruction of justice
i haven't had a really bad is this criminal gene
walter white
a day where he treated what many lawyers it basically said it is it admission of obstruction of justice and then drugs for oil
just came out and said i did that which is why
all the dumbest most selfish revenue folks over everyone who believes in him as a lawyer named ty cobb that it is bad and four hundred
but it's like but they didn't he would fire that guy which if oh yeah i treated something under my client's name that is an admission of of just say you should probably be fired but he's still there will makes me think he was just like i said it i wrote with iran
i did the ag
out that amazing thing about trump trump folks over everyone needs clothes and stuff like you forked over christie to her
giuliani now this lawyer guy and it's like there's no reason to like ride with him unless you need to sell a shitty building but is it just keeps people are still like now i want to be with this guy this untrustworthy petulant fat in it will be going that that lawyers as that under a host benches kids
part of the still wins the as drugs later told you he was a fucking
you fail at the hundred gets of they made that deal he does it hold up into the bargain i am going to happen so
we're almost over here i mean as a show and to society
i actually i do you are equals one one just serious thought that we've been hitting out like obviously
if you're feeling a lot of despair like i i share it with you
it's getting harder it's hard to imagine a way out of this in the near future however i i do believe that the majority of people in this country
if someone were to articulate a vision like you know if we had a figure like corbin who
he said you know rise like lions we are many they are fewer could articulate a vision that is contra to this like nightmare that we're living in i think people like i think more people than ever in this country
that is like the broad base of support for that it just doesn't exude like that the political infrastructure for that doesn't exist and then are there are people going to be gotta try to create it from scratch or just do so there are people i'm optimistic about specifically carlos rosa in chicago running for onerous fourth district vote for carlos when the time comes boat yeah
you know like i could come out of nowhere people really can yeah
in the absence of a leader you need a movement mass movement
and they need like a more
same as as a as an arrow is pointing out like the people that all the answers know this and that's why they're trying as hard as possible to take you know make people's lives more precarious through their awful judges that are going to be judged in infest our entire federal judiciary for probably as long as i'm
fucking alive
make it to our democracy even more of a sham than it already is going to have they're going to empower the game facts a message board moderators and disbarred
auditions had truck has dominated the judiciary you john mccain rubber stamped every i cannot wait for the viral videos about the trunk justices yeah street magician destroys pro choice to most elegant you talking about i think that logan and jake paul are going to federal judges
so we we we destroyed all this horrible shit that they're doing and that they're getting away with but like they're doing it because they know how fucking like that
in a functioning democracy they couldn't do this yeah right and they're doing it
to hold on just clamp down even more of the fucking power and money that they have because they know it can get taken away from the and we have to that's that's the only thing to deal with there and they're going to use the law and government money to make it harder and harder to do that but like
again just there are more of us are there are them about our i don't know what else to say
what i will see as a start at least it's a start
i want to leave you guys now
with something that i think
like i said just really sums up
just america
our culture honestly if you ever get it and i did if if somebody there was somebody who isn't a two year coma who woke up and looked at what was around us and spent a good for five hours and sputtering incoherent
rage and terror and confusion and then said what the fuck happened i think he could sit them down and show them this commercial and it would really tell them everything they needed it out so
that's it for us to this week
we'll talk to you soon but until then i give you trump be bear the wind whispered through the forest a storm is coming you cannot defeat to store from the trees rooms a resounding voice i fear nothing i comb when the trumpet sounds
storm i also cold weather

ladies and gentlemen for your own listening pleasure radio shadow is pleased to percent a christmas carol

brendan was dead to begin with there is no doubt whatsoever about that the register of his own edge was signed by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker and the chief mourner matt signed it
and man's name was considered a good for any piece of business or roasting he choose to put his hand to render was fucking roasted nude mad and dead from the shame of it all now i don't know what it is particularly about being nude and mad i would think that being mad wouldn't lead to being nude but far be it for me to change
expression or the country's done for so permit me to repeat once again emphatically that brendan got so nude mad and read online that he died and was fucking dead
man knew he was dead of course he did how could it be otherwise
man and he had been pod cast partners for i don't know how many years
that was the sole executor his so administrator is so friend and the only man who mourn him if mac can be said to have mourned at all
and the mention of britain's funeral brings me back to the point i started from there is no doubt that brendan was dead
this must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going to relate matt never painted out old bend his name their it stood years afterward above the racism factory door mat and brendan the from was known as chop own associates
it was bitterly cold and the fog was because come on that christmas eve of two thousand and seventeen when that sat busy and is racism factory with his cloak virgil nearby trying to warm himself at an i phone but since he didn't have much of an imagination
failed that is until that's french helix arrived
many games missed and on the sure of that what
mary games with game save you the gaming on chris this a bug
yeah thought i was getting our christmas
oh why talking like that i don't i try and so indifferent trance and an urban i don't know to do that what i'm trying to say is there no hard feelings between us

there are many things from which i have benefited they don't show a profit i dare say things like friendship and eye coordination a new racial slurs i learned on international servers
gaming is that attire binds but a chain that links together all the children of the world who did not want to go into the dining room on christmas and here their wretched ants ask if we have girlfriends yeah for we're you it alone
but together we can cap points a be before getting anti vehicle pick and totally asked about the other teams vehicle spawns in the choke points with i profited judges at the end of the match shall i win and fuck you shot gun pussy if i lose hear hair another sod out of you and you all keep your games this by losing your opposition them

they were a gloomy sweet of rooms it was old and dreary for nobody lived in in but matt the other rooms being all that out his offices
the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed as if the genius of whether sat and mournful meditation on the threshold
driving and chambers matt took off his crops and outdoor t shirt and put on his house crux and indoor t shirt along with his night cap before he sat down before a fire to take his cruel for yeah to hold in his head it was a very low fire indeed nothing on such a bitter night he was obliged to sit close to it and
brood over it before he could extract the lease sensation of warmth from the handful of fuel

hi with my business the common love affair with my business

another i was going to say a boiler suit because that's not the type of sooty makes pretty easy
he so spend spend spend your hangover journeying back with us to the year that was through the lens of chopper
what what what do we got on this playlist this best of highlight reel well hey everybody it's me it's chris i've been insinuated into the pie gas before but i think this is my first official like introduction not use the cousin oliver of shepherd her happiness replaced
a classic character gone out for various reasons he was actually not say his name you not say is i want i want i want to wanna
no you're not he is dead
the nameless one who is also of course in the room right now i thought that the physical presence will be a good handshake but yes i put out a call on various media's social and otherwise to see what fans would enjoy hearing from this kind of thing and obviously the first thing that i her back was don't do this thing all you will hurt
was slow moving and winking yeah
re
the the various sounds of farm animals just crowding my years but we did have some broad consensus is the favorite bits and i'll just list he's offering them
the noise bit was
confront the noise
this is an aside but did you know that the noise campaign ended because he has seen guys named noise and kill don't
yeah it up a truck and he took hostages at an atlanta area dominoes because he thought the noise was about him and he actually one of the pizzas and then he killed himself
for the flip the fuck that's why don't we don't care for that
people always like when nine eleven happened you know
now this reflect on islam but no one says anything for the annoyed
she's not accountable i think that never should have got away well he must be avoided if the
then it would it would be kind of funny though if they brought the noise back and then found out that he was
i've got super league of faster food spokesman pedophile this latest like that it leeway to second domino's pizza domino's pizza ceo apologize that they're like crust it was a little bit cardboard he has the subway
ever apologize over there i covered as we talked about earlier they covered that shit up
they're covered up allegations that fogle hoover photos and it's like
you know you just like father and opus day the guy he never officially apologized for vocals
what is are doable i'm sort of the government frame burger
resorted to barack obama was jealous of vocals careers moods way in had is crooked justice department laura and i say an essay
an essay for surveillance at reveal that fogle was going to endorse drop yeah they needed to liquid a neutral only will was going to speak at sea pack and i wonder if there were people in the country and never watch the news so had no idea that fogle was arrested but like watch you know all the commercials and saw him and all these commercials and then he
then he disappeared and there was no explanation and just got to do you like it
there was a hokey nerd and now is not on t v anymore and there was no no resolution to that club yeah i don't get any better yet again
was my by jake david chase that's how the noise people felt because the noise was just off tv when i get really invested in the no era to someone in corporate was like whoa whoa wait hear me out here we don't have to retire the noise will do a thirty minute special a healing special hosted by the noise called gonna come to the know
no he no longer to be avoided
guys i didn't know
i didn't know
i think about best gas yeah adulthood and look like
i'm gas lighting myself here because now i just feel even though i don't have no evidence of it happening i feel eight donald trump and sodium did the know
a job as some specific grief that the kids that annoyed that even in general
i didn't know treated me very badly for many years
will always mentally
i want to get a pizza
where they got its name from
by the sudden
the dead dead
i talked to general kill you he said that it was a fictional t v
kids you care to a signature drone strike against the noise
imagine i don't want to hating are sure
could anyone listening to this shit mean like them
power and grow
power
yeah democratic
after that
oh issue
that toy it's about the door was originally about folk in
during races
marginalizing the noise the real every the real n word as the know
draped over it
supporters have been invisible eyes
go
the oil it out the noise was not there are nine eleven or the world trade center
want to talk with him
this room and nine eleven
what a stupid show
i don't know how i don't know how to actually show ever going to are the actual reading series in the top that noise
the point was that
in this conversation

we should wrap it up a reshuffling how i'm going to probably about fifty yeah political analysis
yeah got oil
no i am a discussion about what office furniture we're going to get these days
that's what i really did more political stuff yeah i like the noise bed and i think it belongs on the best of because i think it's it's a good primer for people who were like maybe you want to introduce to the they're like it's the school political talk show you that it's like political they they speak so like you know the left about socialists
and our times or and then also just sort of lake
long forgotten tv advertise not as gods out of a little the shows you know we're not scared of getting a little controversial as sure so we're going to call out the noise
you buddy my table stop ruining my pizza
favorite part of that a bit is how in the middle of a you all say that this this show right here in this moment
the threat to standard liberal yeah because that's the same episode where we talked about our peter dial personally called us out and said that he unlike other liberals recognized the danger that you post as and later that day we spent twenty minutes talking about the noise
fifteen
i'll never forgive you for that by the way they were great minutes their goal
like tears in the rain as as all these bits are
she's on a dominance
coming up in the top five felix's black mirror risk
yeah it was is it was really weird and i didn't think that anyone would find out who it was that she would have been treating about me but i guess while she was seeing their angry she was dragging me for for the
hi sweetie is on mind this is definitely the most boring episode of black mirror
actually it's probably not
actually had a hand held what what if your phone knew your name
if all of you or of you and your computer had the same birthday
or or to what if what if your mate was a t v
what to have to plug you'd you'd dog into law charge
what do what if what if instead of someone saying all how was your day they said what did you download

can we said way for that potentially that that be in future
to two hours
so good that surgeons professional comedian has decided
they wouldn't got
without attribution i don't give a shit already made
yeah i had a funny and modern were felix was in the audience slide okay i already it's already out there but the bit
yeah so going a little bit into my thought process
your we're going to lock the gates give us the behind the scenes of your process
like say you guys have saga thrall
muhammad ali you know comedy is with dealing with the world
and take things like racism donald trump phobia capitalism
communism all the ideologies are take what's wrong with all of them
and i sort of synthesizers into this thing where people could swallow the truth so thank you through my thought process of this one i was like what the show black near was thirteen percent charity or
accurate estimation as a like from this that the description of this bid on the bonus episode what if your mum was a mobile
perhaps funnier than any of the actual riffs coming up next is mats a higgins impression on t you don't think i saw that says called on me let me tell you lie and i'll do the access
like what is his job
congress may in the house you house what he used to be one of those fucking few it started out the first generation of cats
to start small town caps writing letters yeah don't want to get famous he was the absolute right
letters ungrateful celebrities and now is clicking conyers gorge
he's literally in a gas chamber right now
self i saw that gets activated
keep those hearts go and seven
about twenty minutes
then
and enslave loom our keep that camera still his his cage and accent is incredibly to strength
you
you choose to be good at it is you get you some tuna salad
now no
these jews and have no toilets

did it did use it fifteen minutes

certification sailed punishment
if you're it's just his giant egg like head just dominating the frame is he saw only tells you about the man's inhumanity to man that he just learn about this
every year in europe
call for help
yeah because stop
world's a smaller place now in a world war two it's not
status more accessible
no era like this
our to walk away from
gas chambers and ovens
without a sober
need for mister pip
commitment unwavering commitment
you is just didn't word
it people got a raw deal
the how great it will be when trump it's the can
slide show notice there was still
the show
i got it
hell yeah that was ah representative good shit
primo levi say that no marks or book made who will for free older day
while osha has to be stopped
the last image was like the last it resist still have just his his bowed head covered in a cowboy had with his arms out with his police uniform unleashing uniform on super impose american and israeli flag
adolf hitler
remember when clay hagens ran for congress first because he was a joy or pio wanna be who did the crime stoppers videos that got him fired because he would just rate up moonbeam like local criminal
and the celebrity thing but before that you'll be interested to know he's not even really a fucking cop he was a used car salesman just like
so cobb dollar he became a cop there some fucking like steven seagal
then he like had jobs in the fucking police and now he's still a legal law enforcement agent in lafayette louisiana
oh the places he pleases lake
mcdonald's employees and citizens arrest yeah give them in france yeah he's that guy you posted this on facebook thing a couple months ago just literally just calling for the genocide of muslims he's one of the worst people align all that after you have to the same muscles real still genocide
elsa and this is like this is a good view into his apocalyptic mindset that the muslims are coming because we have opened borders and they're going to set up death camps for their your they're building the right now
every mosque is that that's why they ever curve top that's how they store all the cyanide gas i would say this guy is know setting himself up for a fox news career but you know he's probably going to be in the senate and a few years
as a three and sure if jon benet beat him to to be the first cat
higgins a louisiana politician who wins our and i doubt
show people that you get some jewels or you put them together with germans on the east l front a well while to mon ami you got some out
some common
another great one rounding up the end of the year actually is felix on you liberalism and cutesy apps
i have a little theory about why bernie's old this actually helps because people are hundred clinton honestly that was last year revised people of your one good and that's literally it the reason that people like bernie and like corbin so much is because this stage of neo liberalism is just it's a daycare everything has been
right fucking pastel colors when you look at ads for shit you look at ads on the train it's on rob and like apps that help you do we live in a garish time yes all the ads are all the ads like you are a little good good boy you deserve it
today we're like them
the ground
and when you when you when you call when you call like your fucking when you call your fucking life is garbage have a sand dune
ugh
and when you call your fucking garbage monopoly a telecom company is your shit doesn't work you get like a little in fantasizing jingle they paid played a tyrannical fat children to calm them down like to do to try to get to you and everything everything is a nurse everything's worse your money buys less half your fucking income is going to read you

where it because your life because you because your boy i found or even say i yeah yeah
fiddler hydration fucking after nine hundred water because your boss now is like you principal they could call you at any time to get you in trouble for anything school never ends and you when you're on the phone with your principal you're on the phone with a fucking in fantasizing customer service or just everything in this world
seems like a daycare you want an adult to break through and yell at somebody and that's bernie that's your fucking angry grandfather who at least respects you to tell you how things are and that's corbin and i think that why people have an emotional a little bit of white people who have an emotional connection to them now i'm serious
so you know part of my creative process is
you know once a while take the train and listen to my favorite tunes and not listening to my favorite rappers are
ross hobson
you know instead of them blowing my mind i'm thinking more i to to her to do with these guys do and so i look at ads on the train and i try to write a rap song like hobson and i fail and angrily call my mom on the phone and ask her why she didn't turn to foster musical talents with him because i wanted to be enough
emotional rapper and then i throw my phone on to the train tracks and then i remember we have to record and then a have the only the only non true thing about that is that he would not be on a subway
take the train twice yesterday
lads on the subway now for of
ladies underwear that you can just months waiting
and that means we're really close to having underwear for men that you can just piss
those that are fucking depend though they're called it's called adult adult undergarment nowadays
pants trust me i'm not old enough now types or not that's a totally different thing i'm talking underwear that's form fitting and stylish that you can just go hog wild in and we have the technology obviously you on mars is making it he's hoarding it for you see i think that would require some sort of matter real
beijing ability that we've demonstrated that we're doing it the ultimate goal of eon stacked knowledgeable innovations is just free pissing forever that would be good yeah i would let him be lord god emperor of the world like it just a giant floating head
some sort of machinery
i'll just czars are all just like exactly and we're all just like blood boys who must like render unto him blood and oregon's for him to live forever if i got to piss of my pants without it causing a problem our going to convenient we're going to move on
because he's in the room again will not say his name but the traders great it
yeah that from his pennsylvania campaign
chapel blondes
host mocking cold open
oh yeah it's really funny when someone you think was your friend
everybody it's brendan
so look we had a pretty good show lined up here this week it was actually really good we had
barack obama on the show
but unfortunately felix spilled a great knee high on my laptop and we lost this one so we're in a tight spot
everyone's busy and they can't record today
but luckily i have been producing this show for a pretty long time and by now i can basically you know act out everyone's stick almost by by rote so
what i'm going to try to do is basically fill in for the gang here i've got other mike's set up where they usually sit and i'm just going to
channel them and
yeah i think this is doable
okay
hello friends it's chopper
it's this week's chopper
chopper let's go it's me will monitor your host the main one and with me
felix be vermin
reminds me of soda
when you leave your protein powder
the german then you're playing in the soil off ism
crispin
i'm so mad
gar i can't stern prestige tv art is all the tv have to be so good bullshit
also joining us is amber
oh i found a bad on the subway i'm going to take it home even though it's covered in radio and virtual texas
yes you know i'm getting hungry can we can can we call the crown fried chicken in newark that's the one i like i won't eat any other food oh now now my tummy hurts so i don't want any food never mind now i have to go to sleep oh so this week
we've got some news and a reading series and it's all here on on chapel i'll try to talk directly into the mike even know i usually forget and and brendan has to do even more work keeping the levels balance sometimes taking him up to two hours just to add one episode
oh there's the theme song and other thing brand it has to do good let's let's make sure none under fan art includes him by the way he doesn't deserve to be represented
he's not technically flapping his gums on the air every second of every show every single
i've been on well so yeah stay tuned for trap oh cap has
look i love the line okay great and that's another thing i guess brennan's going to have sex good another thing for brennan
no doubt it if i had known people were in like it that much i would have liked planted out more of it is literally a last minute decision that i had no no insight and hours going to do it but it was fun it was fun to do it and yeah i did get a little let out there was a little bit pissed off
it does take upwards of three hours ten down
well
this will my lens on do a little more broad discussion about the year
the another a big big fan favorite was the risk on
trump brain state around them people oh yeah
this is true speaking of his son in law he goes you know what i don't even think apartments here's why nobody did anything wrong look at jared everybody and we do appreciate your editorial but everybody said jared kushner carries a very private person he doesn't get out i mean maybe it's good or maybe it's bad what do i do but at least people know how
i feel carrots this really nice smart guy who'd love to see peace in the middle east in israel okay
again it just like
the wheels just keep spinning just me it's bad maybe that's what what does they had to see to that
he is he is a president of deals and we all know that that's the makeup of as has his dna i think that every moment if you actually this is a little theoretical but if you were to zoom into his brain every moment is a deal and he is negotiating with like his own brain
birds and he's like i really like you see what will can give me they get
local milk people
here and can't get any better
better sense than that looking people that's not too good i don't think that's going to somebody that
not everybody i know it has come know people say it or else that's it i'm out
i can negotiate of his old bray that was the original order the deal is like look over on the flintstones israel everyone has the martian that tells them
he has a pretty smart guy but nine times out of ten a trick and
that's what he thinks jury it is
it sees as are
although had be afraid
geared committing usury caveman time
it's a living
betty go go go
not going to terry back though calculator
i end up like steak is stores is writing an open letter
guys guys
i want to take this chance to ask you guys like just looking back on the year in total we've now
lived suffered
thrived to survive survived and thrived in weird persisted states under the rule of of hair trump
how do we feel about him is a personality a characters like what what to make of this looming figure over us after a year well first of all i think of him as a leader yeah i think like for all the jokes make like
he knows he's doing the best he can which is actually pretty good like he's starting to figure it out i says defeated brought her back
taxes cut stock market booming yeah
i mean this is back christmas you can now legally say christmas again
the guy has done everything he promised there was a giant glistening wall
the mexican border it's got casinos in there there was a fuck him all you can eat two thousand and four hour buffet it's it's amazing
yeah you can see all the way through it so no one could throw a big brick of drugs over the top of it in the head
now he rules he is exactly as stupid as we thought he'd be but somehow more he's able to surprise is able to introduce new stupid things all the time he taps himself on a regular basis which i didn't think he'd be able to
i've been pretty impressed frankly i think i think he said something like this game at my impression of the first year of trumps presidency is it like he just keeps coming up with quotes and like still images like math you said that if you were to have sent back in time to any human being would have caused them to just like yeah
this is an actual this is the future
like your brain where they would have immediately passed out or die or committed soon as you know and they had to send for that far back
yeah i know one year two years i'll say two years because he was he was already well in a position where thinking he could be president was realistic but if you set back three years just any picture of him
in the rose garden leaving it film as a boxy joseph a bag suit do with the double thumbs up with the fuck and a hat on that said usa on it and just like with the giant fucking tie going down to his his knees
anyone would think this is not reality this is absurdity your chin send to drive me insane but it's our everyday truth now and
continue to think we should know that are keen on earth
a twenty four hour
we'll win a game will be a ninety year old god emperor her where his body has dissolved into fucking chicken gelatin but his plane will still be alive and it will be connected directly to the twitter
server so the he will be able to instantaneously issue all of his proclamations on twitter and a real and a lot to follow them
it'll be is it was a frightening specter about a year ago the notion that he would pursue this staunch white nationalists agenda and we've obviously seen fractures in society and increase in violence in society violent racial hatred the empowerment of just wretched
dogs in the border patrol in customs anyone with a badge frankly is in power to crack heads down and that is what what we always really was the worst of it but in terms of what he's done as president
things have gotten a lot better since the deep state took control and the global us said you know we're going to need a steady hand on the wheel here and they just put them down in front of daytime talk show television and they've been john kelly
real cheap
a ball president now he's pretty fine job bang up job i think but ultimately when i see tromp i don't feel this immediate revulsion that the liberals feel because he's such an obvious senile clock own idiots
it is completely feckless president but i do feel just the most violent revulsion what i see paul ryan and mitch mcconnell virtually any public in congressmen fucking god that's really nice
these are the actual monsters and coastline what virgil said for me it's the guys like ben ass like i see ben sas up and yeah i'm doing his like you know i'm i'm reasonable thing or went on the nice guy that turns my stomach anything more than more because like i was so good about this i was thinking about how well
i would see george w bush on tv i would get a not my stomach
a visceral hatred wouldn't take over me throughout his entire province here
and that doesn't happen with trump as no matter what he says because it's so transparent because he's so obviously a puppet because he's so obviously his brain as the he his ears because his existence is such a perfect distillation of america's cultural and political trends that he seems perfect
to be there and i like the fact that is there in a way i like the fact that this destruction of america this final dismantling of america and
poet peace has been sold off of the highest bidder is happening under trump it makes sense
politicians who put on a fuckin smile and act like politics is still a thing act like there should be a political k fade the idea that we should act like there's a public interest that we're all working towards that lie is much more nauseating than any just like would trump goes up with steve school is who got shot
the awful fucking policies these guys are trying to put out and he's like you know that's one way to lose weight
it is like rodney dangerfield president and there's only so much hatred you can have for that were as a guy like school east you're like why the fuck couldn't that bullet have to spend like a little bit higher
i really feel visceral hate when i see like john kelly or nikki haley the people pushing like the same neo con bullshit like the thing that this missile the same thing that like during the primaries all these fucking hucksters like max boot were like this guy can't win because
then then we will send money to the
hitler barbershop quartet in ukraine and like of course we're doing all that like day we just started selling weapons to ukraine which is great and we're doing all the evil shit we were doing under obama but more because his foundation for defense of democracies bullshit but when i see them and when they do their little things like haley saying like oh i think trumps accuses deserve their day
in court and people praise them it's like now fuck you you fucking road and you're getting up
do you think donald trump is a rapist because you're getting up there and you're pushing your fucking neo con le could nick bullshit line where you get to go in the land and talk about other singling out israel and talk about how we need to get rid of the assad and now we need to send weapons ukraine and give them ninety two every fucking sexually repressed dip shit from london who goes
anywhere in the middle east at the behest of the saudis you want to do that while also having your cake and eat too and saying the donald trump's a reference or purse and fuck you you worse than him because at least he has fucking dementia you're just a fucking hyper ambitious road and creature you know what i hope they all go to jail for fucking rush shit i don't give a shit about any of that but i hope they all go
gee i hope nikki haley as to do interviews of fucking basile in their dog about participants she fucking said at the un fuck all of them but especially fuck the ones who want to be who want everyone to look at how pain they are like little marco when he cried when they ask you to endorse drop and he didn't leave me to say a know he needed say fuck it
oh he said
i don't know and that he did you fucking did it because he a in all these people are fucking pussies and they'll all this is all they care about is their resume and they're fucking bullshit neo con ideology and their austerity politics and will degrade themselves anyway if trump asked to use in marco rubio is foods foot all know
is only condition for building a third temple or whatever fucking creepy shit that goes through sheldon adelson was he fucking do it and fuck all of them and their crocodile tears would put that rant in the best as twenty
right after
the violent the hateful and the he staggeringly ignorant narcissistic pronouncements from the president on his twitter feed
and it is identical to what a random mag teak shot at it in a facebook group called case the confederate flag to trigger the black lives matter thugs
it's identical to that kind of nonsense by somebody who just watches fox and friends which is just it's i mean i respect that more than somebody who watches the daily show to be fair but it's obviously just it means it's not just melting your brain it means your brain is already melted that you're at that space and it's obvious that the
president doesn't direct policy it's a totally unprecedented situation that the country is entirely governed by what is the mainstream ideology of the republican party which is naked greed and eight and islands yeah we should honestly called us like the fucking like i don't know the the coke regency
or something
all right i just want to run through a few more of these classic chap of funny is real quick and maybe we'll just do a second or two to toss into them
but i just want to get a special shout out to virgins

yeah the hundred u
as i passed i passed doctor penny farther
this man is clearly suffering from psychosis and is experiencing an acute bout of hysteria which is unusual as modern brain science tells us that hysteria is a female affliction caused by menstrual and balances the proper treatment is to inject him with a strong sedative from your medical bag
yeah this man seems to be suffering from wandering womb
the calm him down so i can do the proper abdominal investigation
oh yeah i'd just take a big gigantic fucking
amp fuel full of oh sweet mommy opium and injected right
order order know
you bring it up by you think maybe i could also
oh yeah i mean i'm just i'm not holding regime
i don't
what are my favorite bits from this year you have something i thought he laughed harder it that like was going on around the obviously bad news is a of gravity and troll and it was very hard for me to to credibly try to write a classic love craft insane character
and have that be a liberal because they've just been so sensible this entire time
it i mean i'm sorry if that stretched everyone's
ability to suspend their disbelief the notion that the hash tag resistance individuals
might actually not be all there
this one is
somewhat of a fan request but more of a personal request i really enjoyed mats dispatch from see the boss baby and also amber
requesting more information about the war the tolkien catalyst infants i am so fascinated by bass baby is so happy to know that there's not only going to be a sequel theatrically but there going to be a net flicks series about the boss me about about the world of corporate america infiltrating even seat right because
there's such as as show here
it opens such a can of worms in terms of what the world
baby lives in is like what what does the structure of us and i can't wait to see the future and how they fill in all those gaps and i will report back with all my findings from all future boss baby franchise endeavors for fun fact that is twenty billion dollars in debt
and there's a scene towards the end where the boss baby goes back to baby having succeeded and gets a huge party and they're spraying and with formula and honest to guy looks like a cocky
we were like look at each other like anybody who goes this movie unattended with a child deserves to be chemically castrated including both of us
then they go to when they're spending time in baby hard like i was just yelling basically under my breath
does he have a house does he go home
the restaurants and stuff
are there other baby is doing like manual labor and things are like is their boss baby city year they're about
because there isn't money yes i know how navy couples yeah either married babies so past baby you would recommend going to see a movie highly aggressive go just go in there is you will be occupied either by being viscerally upset by the really perfectly rendered digital baby asses
and when we walked out as like holy shit i'm glad we decided not to see the three d
and i just want to toss to have one more than many many people requested the baseball crank
a giant read animate opening
so yesterday
there is some argument i have no idea what the context was but it was a couple of superstars of of the web heavyweights heavy weights
big dollars
enjoy and read m s n b c pandit arguing with our our old friend the baseball crank our own your own
oh yes and
to me
scanning the conversation that people were laughing at it just read extremely like and a dialogue and i couldn't get it out of my head so there's something about the cadence of these two and like their statements to each other that sounds like it's been translated between two or three different language and then back again exactly and it was just and it's just kind of implied in in seoul is going
nowhere
caring for some big just imagine the the the action lines radio
and so is it really did seem like an a and i thought what if what if it wasn't and and there was a of a
i think it would go a little something like this

my name is joy and no one cares he was the baseball this guy's a superfluous
these guys
my own name on the web for seventeen years man
nixon dispensed with you get eggs those who did no such thing
you jumped into my mentions invited baseball show yourself out the same way you can made if you don't like the response
i prefer factual accuracy so i so disengage from what you were offerings
no
how can i miss you and i don't actually care that you were even here

say tentacles this is all
journalists that large i've heard there's a big school about tentacles
oh
it's another one of our combatants is enter the oh my god
i that you are doing is wrong
that you will not stop me from using all the birth control those mega do that
prepare to be destroyed i will eat them as humorously as the mice on the new wins
taste by rat by sanctimonious prayers go a baseball


one person on twitter i thought very delightful he said that he played well making breakfast for his toddler and now every time the toddler hears wills voice the toddler says go away baseball
there are of very it's very shallow kids it's happened next generation a coma we gotta start like a algorithm based j content generation mechanism that makes chapel content except it's all like baseball crank heads replacing with
gorka youtube video yeah because these kids are the ones who are going to shelter us and our old age and the after escape when we're running from cannibal gangs and we need a night
in front of a fire with with with some canned goods it's going to be these kids and remember us and take a sudden i think that was the last cold open that i wrote and edited and i was it was bittersweet was thinking a lot about the show and my time with it and i felt good but if you had told me
the than their infants and children would hear it and then start to build is there were old and memories from it i don't think i probably would have done it and i'd regret doing it and this is a public apology
the us hear something there
japan are sort of sad buzz in the air
that is tapping to get your cats
it sounded like a traitor
everybody this is chris from the added i just wanted to pop in and introduce a few clips that were highly requested but we really didn't get to a live recording

yeah
this is a little behind the scenes grew from a this is a highly requested bit of losing his shit about megan mcardle grin fall take so hard security had to be called on him from episode one eighteen all the political will and the world cannot conjure up enough sprinkler systems and sprinkler system installers to instantly transform money
asians housing

yeah
absolute
i think it's a good point because we can do it overnight we shouldn't do
okay
great
unless it's instant coffee i don't
up is that yet
all arms
byron
her think about what her annual salary of bloomberg is versus what would it cost to install a sprinkler system in that building that's enough
can and will more highly requested mad man on the rick and morty sash one sauce disaster from the patton oswalt episode episode one forty eight but when people found out that limit certain stores were going to have actual session sauce the bum rushed every
and there were two our lines all over the place a lot of the store said they didn't have it a lot of the stores they ran out immediately and so there were hundreds and thousands of insane only pissed off nerds screaming about how mcdonalds did not give them the session with sauce that they have been promised never get between and virgin in their condiments
people were fighting the police were called
a coward the mic on yes if they had more upper body strength that could have been a real threat that would be that is going to be a red october
i think it will be because this is a real revelation i had about this is that so you're young subject of late capitalism it doesn't work for you in any meaningful way your life is shit you have three or four awful part time jobs you have no health insurance you have half a million dollars in unsecured student loan debt will never pay you have no future
in any meaningful sense
all the avenues that you've been brought up to believe we're going to lead to prosperity and stability in your life gone but the one thing that capitalism promise every stupid shitty nostalgic or phone nostalgic indulgence you can have yours at your fingertips and eat my life is a fucking neoliberal hell but i can't even get a fucking
cup of sash want sauce yeah why the fuck am i still allowing the system to control me we should burn it to the fucking ground
oh right okay so we've done a lot of dupes in this clip show but i did want to highlight some of the more serious or insightful in and inspiring moments as will might say we've got the the sweets but we also got the veggies so here are some of the the more thinkers the the think he bits from this year
first a i think really a central moment this is tim thousand on health of justice from episode one twenty nine i'm just gonna do a series of these for years
what really more importantly
i think a federal thing i said before that i really want to touch on his lady at the federal single payer is a giant instrument for healthcare justice
oh and you can begin to realize this but a federal single payer beans that finally the federal government bears the costs of providing care like paying doctors and nurses and not providing care which is people getting sick in people dying and people are getting sicker from preventable conditions that somebody else should have cost
your insurer doesn't give a shit about you long term because either you will change plans are different and sure or you'll get old and go under medicare so they're actual like they care about keeping your costs down for as long as you are with them slightly know you to pay for it but they're not really like a positive actor who cares about your actual long term well being because
those costs aren't born by them because you become not their problem the federal government which is just a proxy for like society everybody around you does bear the costs of you getting sick long term so i think it's pretty reasonable to make them me that people that bear the costs of providing care in the first place like join those incentives together and so when that's the case you can begin doing things that you see it
this thing called be a social determinants of health which is like understanding what happens in the world to cause folks to get sick or then trying to address it
no the new york medicare medicaid happy birthday medicaid by the way is like a fucking under valued unsung hero in america it's really been tackling these things the new york medical director jason hello and what a big paper on the it's fucking dope do it if you have a federal single payer bears the cost of providing a not providing care then if part of your population is getting sick
and dying because the food they have access to is unhealthy and the food that is healthy is unaffordable because it's not fucking profitable to sell commodities healthy food where they live in so little of in the food desert than the federal government has an incentive to provide affordable subsidized or free healthy food
population because food is health care if their housing conditions
lack of affordable housing or lack of housing altogether are causing people to get sick and die because you die from exposure way faster than die of brain cancer than providing affordable or subsidized health care becomes a form housing when i was an income support
doesn't that open the door to this kind of nanny statism that the conservatives are constantly pretending to care about right now the government have an incentive to ban smoking or alcohol use right now we delegate these decisions to private entities who seek to make profit off of i would rather delegated to like the collection of people that make up government makeup society right
another good example right like a thing that isn't really addressed as that like if a person in your population is being assaulted or beaten or harass like at home or at work or by the police or by the domestic partner than providing like safe havens is a form of healthcare like all these things fall under the umbrella of health justice that's the actual thing we want to get to
single pair is the tool health justice is the goal and kind of along those lines but one thing i think hasn't been said not but people like me
is that like single payer is one like important process one important tool in the push for health justice but it is not alone things like repealing car several drug laws is a form of reaching for health justice right there is no reason that like one it prevents people from getting rehab if they needed are going to get tripping
if they needed and to you put a jillion people into prison that don't deserve to be there and that drives cost of a quality of life in an unhealthy if it comes down to
let's talk about like the housing look at like the fucking grenfell fire in london right obviously providing safe housing and mandating safety norms as a form of healthcare that as a movement that has like parallel like a partner in the fight for health justice and lastly like the hyde amendment right which prohibits federal money from being used on abortion repealing the
hyde amendment
is an extremely important part of the fight for health justice it is a parallel fight to the federal single payer program like there's this idea that you can only have one at a given time fuck off man i can walk and chew gum at the same time i can fight for repealing the hyde amendment and pushing for single payer the same
one is a bit many people mention from episode one thirty three
i will call a new liberalism will not see
and here's a it is the fucking lightweight it wasn't share blue people in our or fuck in da da vinci people or people waving hillary clinton signs that was in the streets actually fighting these fucking nazis and stand by the way standing up against racism and for the fucking rates that we do have and should have in this fucking country
against people whose explicit stated goal is to eradicate them there was the people were sending out and the people who that asshole drove his fucking car into was the i w w p s l people that have a yeah they were
course that black on black lives matter yeah all the like the whole span of the left leg left of us
yeah yeah but who was posting
that's the real cause who was roasting the the shoes that look like a fan that those nazis were wearing on twitter it was the resistance but like it
i support i mean like this to echo what our tea set on our show a few weeks ago like to sort of risk
to respond to the charge that like the left quote unquote is the one who wants to make common cause with racists or make a separate peace with fascism or whatever or like doesn't stand for like against racism
don't even respond to it like i know it's hauling but like you have to understand what these with these people are doing which is they have nothing they have nothing so just keep talking me they have nothing in terms of an argument or a coherent world you are a useful practice what they do is they are speaking on behalf of a
hedge i'm monique liberalism that is going to get us all fucking kill
you don't talk to them but because they're distraction from the real fucking problem which is that fascism arises because of the collapse of institutional legitimacy of liberal institutions that's our that's how we got fucking trump tower going to get what's coming next after him that's going to be even worse
because if you think there's not going to be more logical and economic catastrophe is in the future that liberalism is wholly unsuited to fucking deal with and that failure is not going to lead to fascism feeling that fucking whole you got another thing coming and that's what these guys are these guys who marched martian charlottesville these are the people
who aren't aware of the unspoken premise of this sort of zombie neo liberalism were living in which is that we're coming at a point where there's going to be ecological catastrophe and it's going to either require mass redistribution of the ill gotten gains
the first world or genocide and these are the first people who have basically said well that's the choice i choose genocide and they're getting everybody else ready intellectually and emotionally for why that's going to be okay when it happens why they're not really people when we're when we're putting all this money into more fucking was
balls and drones and bombs and guns to keep him away and so that we can watch them die with clear consciences it's going to be because we've been loaded with the ideology that these guys are now starting to express publicly on the other side of them you have people who are saying in full fucking voice know we have the resources to save everybody to give
everybody a fucking decent and worthwhile existence and dad is what we want and that is the fucking real difference between these two the you could tell that to the next asshole who tells you that there are actually two sides of the same coin
here's a little collection of virtual grants from episode one sixty four the deficit rag this is a collection of virgins take on the political responses and possibilities in response to the passing of the terrible terrible tax care bill and then after this we're going to be back into the record and material so you won't have to hear much more me
when you hear these call it too much beer civility listening to both sides been friends across the aisle you've implicitly accepted a right wing reactionary frame that says that politics is just about these petty grievances because a conservative frame who the conservatives enemies it's liberals point
headed college professors starbucks cops it's trivial shit so of course they could be lecture to reach across the aisle they could even do it because their grievances or asinine it has absolutely nothing to do with a day to day lives but a whore that democrats enemies is it wall street which hedges it's beds between both parties is an energy e o's every democrat elected in west virginia own
it's a rickety coal mine is it big pharma like joe mansions daughter is it recipients of big unearned inheritance is like all of their kids and all of their donors kids you can't have this frankenstein democratic party where we say okay we're we're we're going to have a huge like a powerful donor base but also left wing pa
critics it's impossible it's not going to exist it's just basically power through chicanery it goes to show why you can't resist
this right wing class warfare without in in in effective and monolithic working class party because the democratic party members of the democratic party elected officials who are just the same running birthday cake eating creeps as tom con are just always going to be widely reviled
bad as you pointed out of course these poor slobs who won't benefit from this bill whatsoever that it's going to get fucked by of course they should vote republican because republicans will still give them something they want they're going to trigger the lives looking at the polling in this bill the messaging against it was totally ineffective you had a massive number of people
undecided they don't know anything about this bill there was no coherent opposition message so people just who had an opinion about it just relied on their preexisting affiliations in grievances and as we saw online
the child's are all hoarding and winking for this bill because it it will trigger that hymns that's exactly why i don't give a shit children are not off limits to these ruling class sick goes we should be attacking meghan mccain we should be running ads showing that the fucking psychopath
trump sons not bear and me in that old meghan mccain chelsea clinton the cast of h b o's girls people who are widely reviled no matter who you are or where you stand society unless they're just an extreme partisan moron and just say the these are the people who benefit at your expense in society they're getting hundreds of
millions of dollars that they never fucking worked for whatever
so coming out of a whole series of more inspirational grants i just want to say what are we looking forward to in the coming years we've we've had a lot of despair but we've also had a lot of positive visions between
but your your cat
tim thousand what is there on your horizons
who were
get pay for if it sells well
please burgess the boat for brandon sake
the book me and twenty eight team i've had
i had a really good time writing the book i mean it was like obviously reading a book is hard but when you have you doing with your mates with your best buds sort of by committee
others like the best of chopper for me was just reading the book with you guys is here and i think people are really going to enjoy it when it comes out also now two thousand and eighteen
the democrats will win bag both houses of congress and at most one seat in the senate but still make a majority now
i am keeps ago or if he retires somebody else will take a fuckin
racist
one of the racist california raisins will be will speak or the house are going well it doesn't matter what happens in politics and twenty eight in or really ever actually looked up studies in for economics nothing that has ever have in politics is infected anyone's life other but what does affect people's life is content coming in

more on sport like football where hip hop divas disrespect the flag and the brave men and women who are protecting them and they're very games meanwhile in may
all the athletes respect the police and that's what my documentaries about
i look forward in two thousand eighty and although honestly it might have happened by the time you listening to robert
all are we fired by ronald donald trump and it'll be the funniest thing in history

on that one
omar obama and half group
they will do the acts of terrorism across the country kidnap and execute figures in the national government and will be back it'll be basically like like mid seventy's italy it will be the day it will be the days of lead the years of latter common folks i love the strap the fuck it i love the idea of the bill marble
taking hostages and they give the police the demands and they're like none of these are demands just as new new rule
the helicopter and

police negotiator new rule

i just love i love to see the whole the whole chopper team shannon
a few times but
before i even came onto the show the way that ten thousand is able to talk about the essential illness of health care not just as real orchestrating the healthcare system but real orchestrating the entire system of providing for people in this country as a whole system of jail
as a whole was actually incredibly revel a tory for me personally and a real refraining from this entire debate that was just absolutely on present in any other thing so i gave us a lot of coverage of this year of the republican healthcare appeal plans and as well
well that a wonderful thing taking his show on the road going to say chapters beauty meetings all over the country in our deliver his methods message of health
in order to deliver his message of health justice
a trunk thing auto played on

i like the gorka thing so much because i feel like for a very long time
comedians would tell me about a domain like that he was really funny way i remember one trump vs bernie was running before going on t v like every really funny comedian i knew would just dog in these amazing term about a domain and then you know the first time we had him on like obviously he was amazing he did not just gordon like it was pre gorka it was all these impressions but
like because of gorka because it became such a big thing people are finally realizing how good look of james is judged to be pushed up because it was on a hack pushed up basically everyone did bush but if you watch it now even years later he is incredibly funny and that's like really challenging to do to actually make push funny after all that stuff leslie
