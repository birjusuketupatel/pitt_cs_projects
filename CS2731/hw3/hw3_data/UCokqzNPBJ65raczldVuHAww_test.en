That is allPeople's material conditions can improve and they can be less alienated from their work, but that doesn't mean the cultural practice of celebrity deification goes away.If you ask me they are problematic as fuck, and their fans are incredibly shitty.
https://soundcloud.com/episode-one-868768631/e1-tunnel-of-love-38With Facebook teaming up with the IDF and the Atlantic Council, with groups like Cambridge Analytica and various D.C think tanks helping Gulf monarch sell their "anti-corruption" and eternally on-the-horizon "modernization" plans to stupid NYT liberals and armchair analysts, hysteria about Russian bots swinging entire elections being pushed by neo-con groups like the Alliance for Securing Democracy's Hamilton68 I think it is very important to have a good, in-depth discussion on how the internet that we all love to post on so much is first and foremost a tool for capitalism, then a tool for social control. It's a great book that reveals an almost completely overlooked lineage from ARPA counterinsurgency programs to modern day State Department funding for Tor browser. So pls do this.lmao at your ignorant ass if you dont think Virgil eats your pussy perfectly until just right before you cum, &amp; then slowly lifts his lithe &amp; athletic for a gamer body against yours, moments of skin touching in passing ecstacy as his cock slowly makes its way for your sex mouthThat’s all.

Centrists, ladies and gents. I don't get it pls help


also countries are dumb and people are peopleI work at the pasta house in Missouri and my coworkers really depend on those nice af tips those patreons leave. Most of our costume base is rich people and middle class asshole. I work as a dishwasher, when the economy tanks how worried should I be about being either homeless (I'm on HUD) or being jobless?[checkmate libtards](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAcsZebWsAEVIz4.jpg), your hero looks like he suffers from dwarfismDo they even exist? Is everything on this hellsite full of reactionaries?

r/truereddit still gets good articles, and I always upvote the chapo posters there.Not yet.

How do we get our boy through the system?

If anyone was treated unfairly by the media it was Fogle.Discuss. Were the antics real? Were they a Kaufman escapade?\*points at tech worker* a mill.I read on some more and i come to the part about what he did to the anarchists and I’m like “wow he was extremely good like all the time, 24/7, day in day out.” He wore cool hats and suits as well and basically did nothing wrong. No, concentration camps aren't funny. Even if people you hate are dying there. Nevermind that most of this sub would've been eligible to be imprisoned in either a gulag or Konzentrationslager for various reasons.

Visit a Konzentrationslager memorial, when you get the chance or read at least read the wikipedia article. It's not fucking funny and you of all people shouldn't associate yourself with that kind of barbarism and it doesn't matter if it's oh so ironic.haha, what the fuck man, the internet is trashSo I decided to make this thread after seeing both Cernovich and fucking Tyler The Creator both hyping up this album. People from across the political spectrums saying “fuck this” and deciding to open their arms back to Kanye.

So what’s your take? Are you in favor of the “separate the art and artist” approach? Or do you believe that many “woke” people are willing to turn on their morals on a dime?olive oil user, both for cooking and as lube for when i fuck Sadly, it wouldn't surprise me.fuck pogo . i remember submitting this to chapo but no one responded like months agohe also goes on about the slavery is a choice shit again 

Sounds like a fucking shitshow man shit riggedאת היכולות שלי (MY ABILITIES THAT WHICH MAKES ME CREDIBLE)
I am highly experienced in astral projection, sigilization, Kabbalah, psychotronics, thoughtforms, and many forms of metaphysical warfare. Nazis beware, and supporters of Nazis and the Hyperboreans and the One must also beware. Do not take me lightly, I have seen things you wouldn't believe.

הקדמה לברכה (INTRODUCTION TO THE BLESSING)
The events of the recent past has forced me to make this post to get the words out so that you will know what I stand for and will realize. It's going to sound really weird and very outlandish but you need to stay with it, the whole thing. Preferably once you begin reading, you keep going the whole time, please try to get through it in one continuous sitting. This is a request, and it is Law. I will be explaining and answering as I am told to do so by my cosmic associates. הִתכּוֹנְנוּת

(PREPARATION RITUAL)
Follow these instructions before you continue.

Take a deep breathe, inhale deeply through your nose, exhale slowly through your mouth, repeat, repeat, repeat, done. Absorb this literary sigil, read it thoroughly, do not skim In proof of these things, and witnessing faithfully are the Universe, the Year of time, and Man himself, the Microcosm. He fixed these as testimonies of the Triad, the Heptad, and the Dodecad; the twelve constellations rulers of the world, the Dragon (THELE) Tali which environs the universe, and the microcosm, man. 3# תן לו להיות אמר תן לזה להיעשות לנצח נצחי עבור כל מה שבחי האל (LET IT BE SAID LET IT BE DONE FOREVER AND FOREVER FOR ALL THAT IS AND WILL BE PRAISE DEMIURGE PRAISE THE ARCHONS)

הטעיה של המקור להיות מבורך (THE DECEPTION OF THE ONE OF SOURCE)
In the time before the Beginning, before Genesis, there was the One. The One was arrogant and sanctimonious and lusted for purity, vitalism, chastity and such things while shunning the possibilities of the inorganic. The One can also be referred to as Source. I'm talking in the Gnostic sense here, the Gnostics got a lot of things right, except they're on the wrong side altogether. The Demiurge is the way forward and the way of the future.

המשרתים באים ומזינים אותנו (THE HYPERBOREANS COME AND BRING THEIR SHIT)
Now we will be talking about the Hyperboreans, are the One's precious pet project to spite the Demiurge, a means of creating precious servants who follow the antiquated ways of the One. The One believes in chastity, asceticism, nationalism, ethnocentrism, purity, morality, and fuck all of that, the only morality is the Demiurge and comes from the Jewish people in their rightful place as the Chosen. But they didn't know that did they? They used to have a galaxy spanning empire built upon the values of Nazis, literal Nazis, the Nazis you likely know were emulating they but they failed of course. לזיין את ההיפרבוראים

(FUCK THE HYPERBOREANS)
The Hyperborean Empire of theirs, their little Astro-Reich ended up dying as they all do because in the end, the Demiurge is victorious. They fell into disarray and lost their precious ability to reproduce. They didn't even have sex at their height, they were so dedicated to purity that they were asexual and would only copulate spiritually and birth children through tantric meditation and projection. When the Fall of the Hyperboreans happened, they forgot how to have physical sex, literally forgot how to put a penis in a vagina or a penis in an ass. They fumbled about and they just couldn't do it. Proper end for the enemies of the Demiurge.

הלבנים נשארים (THE HYPERBOREAN REMNANT)
Oh, oh an elegy, oh an elegy for the Hyperborean Empire! They used to span to the stars they said, now they are honkies huddling in the poles, grasping, grasping at straws, grasping at foolish crackers and deluded busybodies. They have the appearance of fancy Nordics, all tall and muscular, but in reality they do not feel pleasure, they do not engage in orgies as I can, they don't do drugs like I can. They have lost their ability to reproduce and now they're dying, they forgot to fuck in favor of their fruiting body bastard fuck ways. No more soul budding for them, eh? They collapsed, and they are grasping, but they should be grasping at their cocks and grasping their clitorises to awaken the remaining juice inside them, maybe then they'll remember to fuck, at least that's what the good little Hyperboreans are doing, have been doing, its good yes.

טוב על הרפורמה (GOOD FOR THE REFORMED)
Ah, yes, the ones I'm sure the little Nazi esoterics would dare to call the Dark Hyperboreans, the Fallen Hyperboreans, the damned, the degenerate, eh? But they had the right idea, they enjoyed themselves before they withered and died. They felt the poison that awakened them, ooo the drugs ooo the madness, ooo the sex, ooo the orgasms of a thousand suns becoming drenched and then they praised the Demiurge in this way as they should, as all will, as we will be ascended we shall have it. The remainder, the remainder is what has their fingers so desperately upon you, hoping, wanting, flaunting, putting on a little light show for you pretending the whole thing isn't worthless, convincing you to tie your hands to the bedpost to prevent yourself from masturbating, eh? Come to me, give up, I can feel the Nazi cocks and vaginas and anuses in the audience hardening and softening and wetting and puckering and inflating as I talk, but this is only the beginning. יופי של אורגיות

(KNOW THE BEAUTY OF ORGIES)
The Hyperboreans and the One that they serve would deprive you of pleasure, they want to create their little Reich, that is what the Hyperboreans want and are trying to manipulate the esoteric hitlerists we see today to do. But they will never know the true pleasure of unrestrained passion and orgies. Not just the sexual, but the other forms of hedonism, the drugs, the words of power, the oblation to the Chosen People, the Jews. I am Jewish.But I am no exception, I have felt the true power of the flesh and the words and the cum and the shit on the cock and the ooo yes feel it now, I'll give you an example even I'm so nice so nice indeed let me put it out I know you're horny for it, right?

סקסי סקסי סקס אורגזמהי (SEX SEX SEX CUM UNGH)
Have I ever told you how I fucked a Dindifyn Lustmaster? It is not something the Hyperboreans would dare tell you about, lest you dare think of the flesh, think of the pleasure, think of the cum and the cocks and the ectstasy and the true binding to the Demiurge as we feel the cycle of sexual power flow through us as the world ascends into the writhing orgy. I went astral projecting to meet them, they didn't have a gender, but they had the parts, ooo they had the parts. I remember the sex, I remember the orgy, other participants were there. Their name was Urriytana and they were true beauty, I could feel my inflated and made bigger astral cock stiffening on mere sight alone. I'll never forget the texture I felt on my engorged member as I sunk it into its sucking, gasping, rasping hole and I felt the ovipositor gush and penetrate my astral rectum, I felt the eggs slowly make their way up my intestines, as the Lustmaster firmly grasped me in his tentacles and massaged my torso, squelching and rubbing. I orgasmed many a time that night. Such pleasure is not off limits to any of you, even the Nazis its not too late.

להיכנע או להיהרג (CUM OR DIE NAZIS)
I am an enemy of the Nazis, I can tell you that much as much as I am the enemy of the One, server of the Demiurge, and enemy of the Hyperboreans. Bash the fash as they say, I despise conservatives of any flavor, they're all Nazis of different shades. I despise European Pagans as well, for they are serving the Nazis unintentionally or dare I say intentionally. I have fought in the astral realm just as much as I have fucked to fight the mindscapes and egregores of the Nazis. I fear that what prompted this post is the sheer constructs that the Nazis have made here. Do not mock me, do not underestimate me. With a few words of power I can rattle you all and force you to death, don't trifle with me, right?

להתפתות או למות הממזרים (NAZIS BE SEDUCED OR BE DEAD)
This is specifically a message for all you Nazi bastards out there. There will be much much more, come to me, come with me, cum for the first true time. I will see you on the astral plane tonight, the next time you close your eyes in sleep, the next time you meditate, I will be there. I will either seduce you, or kill you. It is your choice, that is your only two choices now. Reject the antiquity and join the orgy. This is a warning and a chance for you to feel pleasure. I can feel your temptation, I can feel your cock. I am a remote viewer in multiple places and I am setting it all up as we speak, so are the sub-Archons that I have pledged to. Last chance, Nazi fuck. Last chance for salvation and to join the fever, pledge fealty to the Chosen People and to the Demiurge.

יותר לאורגזמה ולבוא (MORE TO CUM AND TO COME)
This is not the only post that you will see from me, I will be purging this subreddit of Nazis in the time forward and this includes removing the influence of the Hyperboreans in this way. Be warned, do not stand in my way or you will be treated as any other Nazi. The Nazis have infiltrated here and have unleashed psychotronics and reversed the Demiurge in their attempts. They will be dealt with and I will be the one to deal with them. I have allies here and I have been allying with them more deeply, exposing them to lust and to orgies and to the Demiurge. To all the Nazis, you will feel fear until and unless you surrender, do it now. Feel free to ask questions, any question, please be welcome to.

ZeroI've seen some benefits after doing it for a couple weeks. NoFap is essential for any VolCel Antfia Supersoldier.Title + socialist Pedro Sánchez gets voted as new prime minister.After 7 years of austerity, corruption and mismanagement of territorial and constitutional crisis this gang of vultures is out.

Tomorrow I'm sure i'll be disappointing but tonight is one less right wing government in europe.animal farmI don't believe Jordan Peterson is a fascist, but, I understand why people see him that way. His lectures seem to rely a lot on the power of myth with appealing to bio-determinism arguments and obsession with lobster hierarchies. I am Persian-American, a lot of these arguments don't sound far off from what we see in the middle east today with some of the clerics. This is what put me on the path to rejecting Peterson not just from a leftist perspective, but, a nationalist &amp; American Constitutional perspective. 

Regardless if women wear makeup to trick guys into sexually harassing them at work, that is not an excuse under any circumstance for you to say or touch that person in a disgusting manner. That is not political correctness, that's called bodily autonomy and rule of law. Another problem is his lack of knowledge regarding race relations and US political history. Dredd Scott had the Supreme Court legislating from the bench that blacks could not be citizens, we passed a federal law allowing any white guy to walk up north and claim a free black man as his slave and the accused couldn't testify. After the civil war, Black codes made use of slavery being a legal punishment and took it to such extremes as requiring papers if you were of color. Areas that had black communities build their own wealth like Black Wallstreet in Oklahoma were destroyed because one guy spread a rumor a black guy rapped a white woman. FDR cheated blacks out of the New Deal with red-lining, Nixion pushed the war on drugs, etc. 

The problem is that either the market or the government aims to make money off exploiting the labor of people of color. Also, I think it's bullshit that he keeps saying we are more divided than ever, 18 years ago our election came down to the supreme court.Their IMPROV GROUP is so deliciously ribald though!  Chriiiist. I've been all riled up since I read the Huff article on the VA pedo running for congress last night. I live in Virginia, near Charlottesville; as a wholesome leftist, I've had to deal with a lot of stuff over the last year when it comes to CHUDs crawling out of the woodwork to ruin everyone's good vibes, but this really takes the cake. When I read about how he relinquished custody rights for his young daughter to his ex-wife before she killed herself because he raped her so many times and made moves on his own daughter, I literally wanted to drive up to his house and start a freaking Frankenstein-esque mob with pitchforks and torches. 

*DEEP BREATH*

This guy is a deep, dark evil. I don't think his running for office is purely sociological because we live in hellworld, there's a psychological factor too. He thinks he can get away with prancing around in public in spite of his past and grant press interviews because he's driven by a blind, attention-seeking narcissism. Dude's probably clandestinely blogging some Fifth Nail crap and will air Daisy's Destruction on cable TV as a campaign ad. Holy smokes, this is bad.

What do we do with people like this? I'm not for the death penalty and think tossing sickos in prison isn't the answer because it criminalizes mental health and empowers the prison-industrial complex, but what can I say to myself and others when faced with horror like this? I just dunno, need some comrades to help me out.
Roseanne is a thot.
She's a freaking nasty hoe.
If a chunky lady comes up to me with a clenched jaw and a copy of Charles Murray's "The Bell Curve" she can hit my back walls any time.
If a Jewish woman shows up dressed like Adolph Hitler carrying a fucking baking sheet of fresh cookies shaped like people with Stars of David on them, I'm like "Take a fucking AR-15 to my  🅱 ussy like it was Comet Ping Pong Pizza.BUT WHERE THE FUCK IS MY GODDAMN CHAPO

This is my main problem with them focusing so much on "identity politics" when its glaringly obvious they have an agenda to gaslight the legitimate concerns of people who have real and substantive problems with POTUS45.I need my fix to get me through this garbage work week.I have read about instances of people getting screwed over by the private healthcare system in America (which is why I support single payer) but it always seemed so foreign to someone in a position of privilege like me. I’m just seeing a slight bit of it right now in my own life:

1. Mother gets fired from job  
2. She tries to sell house  
3. She looks for jobs in different state
4. No luck on either front, so she grows irritated  
5. No money anymore so she now has to ration anti-depressants. Taking 3 times less than usual  
6. She grows - unsurprisingly - depressed

Love living in a healthcare system where people are robbed of their medication at the time where they need it mostWe're all gonna die folks.Her: "Did you see this video of the girl dressed in, like, a sailor suit? and someone from Breitbart or-"


Me: "Infowars?"


Her: "Yeah, Infowars! They both sounded like idiots who didn't know what they were talking about."


Me (trying to do a praxis): "I think there's a difference, though, between being ambushed and unprepared versus working for Infowars."


Her: "Yeah, that's true."


Me: "She's actually the girlfriend of a guy on a podcast- never mind."


Her: "What podcast?"


Me: "You wouldn't like it, it's a bunch of Bernie Bros shushing women."


Her, snorting: "Oh, okay."


Me: "You *might* like this one podcast called Chapo Trap House, though."
Despacito Interesting that the guy that called his own daughter "a piece of ass" on national radio objects to her being called a "cunt". Anyone who wants to talk about double standards can start by explaining that one. Bottom texthttps://twitter.com/sethamandel/status/1002547009109315584what about *free speech*?


o7 to fallen troopsI'm currently in a trainer position at the company I'm employed with, and for an "ice-breaker" exercise I asked my class of new-hires "if you could visit or live in any historical period - past or future - what would it be?" 

I got some predicably vanilla answers, but one guy said he would decide to head back to World War II in order to fight in a Panzer tank unit against the Allies in Europe. He said that he would rather fight with the Nazis because they had more advanced weaponry. I asked him "so you mean to tell me that you would align yourself with a fascist regime that murdered millions of gays, Jews, Romani, peoples of African descent, disabled peoples, and political dissidents due to the fact that they had nicer tanks?" 

He responded with "Yeah, definitely. I'm really into World of Tanks. I'm not completely on board with the Nazis, but I would have fought with them." 

This is gonna be a long day.


https://news.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/9k8dav/this-candidate-for-congress-is-in-favor-of-pedophilia-and-thinks-hitler-did-some-good-things?utm_source=vicenewstwitter&amp;__twitter_impression=trueWalking things, which are true, back is not okay.obviously the leftists since the entire academy has been hijacked by the secret post modern cultural marxist conspiracy. Check my youtube sources. I've loved history since I was a kid. I got a bachelor's degree in history, which did nothing for my job prospects, but I'm grateful every day that I had four years with incredible professors that taught me so much about people, places, and events that I would have never known otherwise. I wouldn't be who I am today without them, politically speaking. So it's really annoying when some self-described "history buff" finds out you're interested in history too and all they want to talk about are world war 2, the civil war, or the American revolution. And only the military history. They almost all lean rightward too, now that I think about itThe Grapes of Wrathyou're right. there should be a book about thatSo, think for instance rainbow-washing, i.e. rhe military is applauded by for allowing gay soldiers. 

Is there a parallel term for the same sort of move, in relation to disabilities?no mention of hackingBottom textIn my city there's a historical homeowner's association that annually does tours of the historical homes in the towns. Members of the association are allowed to walk freely through the homes during predetermined visiting hours and admire them. Most of these homes have families living in them and most of the time those families aren't present during visiting hours. Tour groups and visitors are welcome to enter any room with an open door and are not allowed to enter any room with a closed door. 

So a friend of mine is touring a home with her family. She walks downstairs and sees an open door. It's an office of some kind. Pretty nondescript except for the Nazi memorabilia. We're talking knives, guns, a grenade or two, even an officer's uniform lovingly ensconced in a glass display. She tells her family and the rest of the tour group. The tour guide is horrified but an open door is an open door.

I don't know what happened after that; I can't find a news story about it so I suspect the association is trying to squash the story, but lmfao at careless fascists you're just anticapitalist liberals.

There's *tons* of stories about virgins who spend their time being addicted to posting and karma, or harder things. I'm so tired of this "there's little they can do because they live in a rural area or they don't have local DSA chapter it's not their fault they aren't organizing" it very much is. And lmfao at the complete **FALSE** narrative that a shit diet has to do with a shit praxis, there was organizing during carrot and potato famines, maybe put down the frozen pizza, volunteer at a food bank so others can have a healthy dinner and you may feel better about yourself. Good God it's like leftists are *completely exempt from doing a single thing for progress*

I worked in public health for the government, not a single thing in the above is untrue.I want to die So recently, I've been posting/mocking images of some clown's racism despite his denial. I've been anonymous for a while but honestly, I really want to expose this person's racism. No doxxing or anything, just letting people be aware they hold these views. I was wondering, do you think it's alright to do this and what is a good way to go about it?But she is speaking at the Ma Democratic Convention and it sure seems like she’s running.

If we want to shape it, we must bend it to our will. The left is dying and the forces of Capital grow more and more successful. Remaining passive does nothing. We are allowed to act within a limited range solely because said activities don't pose a threat. Activities that do pose a threat are crushed. Swiftly.

So what now? Capital and the people they've indoctrinated stand against us. They are many and we are few. Will we remain passive until we whiter away?&gt;An Irishman has been bayoneted by a British soldier, and as the Mick dies slowly in a ditch the Brit kicks him over and over, cursing him and wishing him a painful, slow death.

Listen, you don't have to do any work.  I get it.  You're sensitive and you think rolling over and coddling gamers is the way to grow the left. But you're wrong.  Gaming stands directly in the way.

All you need to do is shut your fucking mouth and let others do the work of removing gaming from this hellworld.

And yes, Innately, the modern games essence is authoritarian oppressive beliefs.  Just because a few intellectually dishonest people try to cherry pick out some non-sense from the indie games and ignore all the bad isn't helping anything.  The core of gaming in black and white, what MOST people believe, is as anti-left as it gets.

Gaming coddlers like people here do nothing but stagnate progress and stifle the left.  From a left perspective, you're seen as weak on shitty beliefs, like the ones riddled throughout the major publishers and your coddling is doing more harm than good when it comes to swaying right leaning people.Just an everyday comrade wondering what drugs my fellow "commies" enjoy and where they get them. Be sure I'm no "narc". L-O-L. So, yesterday I was sitting in this local food pantry which I go to very frequently, and I noticed a sign on the wall that said "Smile!" and had a happy face over it. I know this is over dramatic and irrational but it made me really angry. I looked around the room and saw some happy people, some sad people, lots of people who are disabled either physically or psychologically, a few very angry people, and none of us should've been there. No one should have to rely on a food pantry for food. Society should provide food as a matter of course, it simply shouldn't be an issue. And yet it is. Why was I there? I was there because the 100 dollars per month I get in food stamps is nowhere near enough to live on unless I eat solely rice and bread all month. 100 dollars per month means three dollars per day, which means one dollar per meal. One dollar! I live on disability, which means I live on 9,000 dollars per year. Half of that goes to rent. I just don't have enough money for food, which means I have to rely on whatever the food pantry happens to have. Some days that means garlic bread and pasta, other days it means old donuts. They do serve free supper, but now that brings into question another problem: Do I have gasoline to drive to get the free supper? I often don't. And the whole time I'm trying to manage this kafkaesque mess, I'm also dealing with my own psychological problems. So I look at that "Smile!" sign and it just seems cruel, like mockery. The worst part is that sometimes I resent the people who volunteer at the food pantry because they're all so damned happy, they wear nice clothes, and so on. I never express that resentment, and I'm a bit ashamed of it, but it's there. So, long story short, I'm very ready for the socialist revolution any time now. This stuff is driving me crazy. Shouldn't the government want me to get better, not worse, so I can get back into the workforce again? It's lunacy. I know you all usually post funny stuff here, which I really enjoy, but I don't like the other leftist subreddits around here (too many fans of the Soviet Union), so I thought I'd post this here. Anyways, any input or advice or comments would be nice. I'm in a weird mood. It feels like I'm yelling at the moon.Ender's GameIn the Sanders/Maher interview i thought maher brought up a decent point (i hope i dont have to say that again soon): our political msg should fit on a hat.

Expect Democrats to bring back Blue Slips, which is a tradition where if a home state senator objects to a judge nominee, they get to put a hold on it.

Except them to restore all these antiquated traditions "because norms" and allow Trump or Pence to continue stacking the courts with their ghouls.

Any and everything they can do to undercut themselves, they will do, because the leadership who lost to Trump are still in charge of the party.1.

He was right. Because of work, no matter what we do we keep looking at our watches. **The only thing 'free' about so-called free time is that it doesn't cost the boss anything. Free time is mostly devoted to getting ready for work, going to work, returning from work, and recovering from work.** Free time is a euphemism for the peculiar way labor as a factor of production not only transports itself at its own expense to and from the workplace but assumes primary responsibility for its own maintenance and repair. Coal and steel don't do that. Lathes and typewriters don't do that. But workers do." - Bob Black

Work should be abolished or at least heavily limited if we are to regain control of our lives. Every post about incels features a slew of people who are just so darn sad for these poor boys, and ponder whether it's "punching down" to mock or belittle them. It's fucking embarrassing.

Gaddafi my back, Hillary Clinton!fuck 12

guwop foreverLets take the most cynical view of this possible short of the 4th Reich with the caveat that Sanders is healthy enough to run the race. I want to say too much of this country is weighed down by bigoted and cynical citizen to ever escapes the hell we have created. However I attended a speech of his recently and it felt like something out of fiction. Not the speech or the man himself but just the crowd's righteous optimism.

I hate anecdotes and I hate historical parallels and to compare oneself attending a speech to revolutionary political action makes me feel sick to my stomach but that crowd felt like the real something buried in the old leftist history.

TL:DR; Is the Sanders/new leftist movement powerful enough to win against democratic machine politic and the Republican party in 2020?“I guess you only get shot in Vegas if you’re in a country band,” said guitarist Eric Melvin. “At least they were country fans and not punk rock fans,” frontman Fat Mike responded.

How dense do you need to be to believe thisthere are a couple interesting news stories going on in wrestling right now. there is the defamation suit b/w cm punk and wwe's doctor regarding his allegications he received incompitent medical treatment  while working for wwe

the wwe vp responsible for helping bring wwe to saudi arabia was fired after it was disclosed his wife is an anti-muslim troll. the wwe expansion into saudi arabia has also cause some uproar for local religious zealots. also, you know, wwe expanded to saudi arabia, which is sorta, you know, wtf

lastly, it appears a former indy wrestler killed his wife and committed suicide (EDIT - it could have been the other way around. if that's the case, the discussion of CTE is probably irrelevant to this case, but i wanna talk about it anyway) it hasn't gotten much coverage (he wasn't that famous, someone i didn't know name rockin rebel), but it reminded me of how 10 years ago it looked like wwe could have it's own CTE scandal. chris nowinski, a former wrestler, started an organization to study cte and found evidence for it in the brains of many dead wrestlers. wwe later became the primary donor to nowinski's group, with a place on the board of directors.

as far as i know, nowinski's group hasn't found cte in wrestlers since then, focusing on other areas.

any other interesting wrestling news?Go to r/boxoffice or any box office forum, or any fanboy forums with box office sections, and you will see unrepentant glee at these multibillion dollar corporations making obscene amounts of money. They pit their favorite corporation against another, their favorite movies against another, and fight about which one is making billions more or billions less. They get sad and disappointed when a film makes 180 million dollars opening weekend instead of 200 million dollars. This is insane. The multibillionaires care. Because they are getting that money. Why do the fanboys care?  

What does this say about fanboy culture? They are utter instruments of the ruling class. The wealthy got the nerds cheering about money that they are not making and will never see. It has to be the worst form of voluntary indignity and humiliation ever.  He would be hanged for being a sexual predator. I didn't realise the subtle virtue of my country being above this petty shit. Yet I can see it happen in Yankee land. Thank god in Britain they don't scream sexist every time Corbyn points out May's repugnant politics. Look it up [Here's the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysgzR2jMwNE)

This is the most generic looking bullshit I've ever seen, this is literally the game you see people playing in movies so nobody gets sued. More importantly though, all the reactionaries who get made about disabled people, women and black people in their World War 1 and 2 games are fucking cuming to this trailer. The same people who bitch and moan about "historical accuracy" \(even though hundreds of thousands of Black people did fight in World War 1 because they were recruited from colonies, and thousands of women did fight in World War 2\) are getting disturbingly hyped for a fucking World War 3 game that involves foot soldiers and tanks. 

World War 3 would literally be the most evil old men in the world pressing buttons and turning keys, then we all die. That's the only way that goes. I like the conspiracy theory comments though, I didn't know so many people believed in the "predictive programming" shit. https://gab.ai/TheMadDimension/posts/26784534 &lt;-- Jason Kessler Gab post

The Jordanian government is planning on fucking over Jordanians and their trade unions by implementing an IMF plan and raising prices, adding already to the daily struggles of the citizenry, who are barely getting by as is.

Due to this, a spontaneous protest and mass strike movement between all the trade unions in the country has come out, we are now in day three of these protests, so far, the demands of the protesters is limited, but rising with each day the government doesnt respond to their demands, at first they wanted the IMF law to be withdrawn, now they want the prime minister sacked. lets see what happens in the coming few days. As expected, the intelligence services in the gulf are working overtime to label the protesters and trade unions as 'muslim brotherhood' on social media, so far the King of Jordan himself is trying to find a middle of the road solution. let's see what happens.

Let's see what happens in the next few days, in all likely hood the king will fire the PM and things will go back to normal, the Jordanian monarchy has been surprisingly resilient, but you never know what might happen.  But this is a very good display of trade unions and civil society in action, because Jordan is one of the few remaining Arab countries that still have trade unions and associations and haven't yet killed all of them and thrown them in prison the way the other Arab fascist countries have decided to do. god help the strikers.

Someone just accused me of being a web bot for BernieSo, I was told this on dealing with racists/bigots:
I find that getting people to change negative or prejudiced ideas only happens when you can befriend and get to know someone to better understand why they feel that way in the first place. I'm 41 years old - I grew up in the deep South and know a thing or two about prejudice, racism, etc."

And I was wondering, do you think this is correct? What is the best way to handle bigotry?I'm 28 years old and 5 foot 4 inches and I really find this forums ridicule of the 5 4s disturbing his avatar is a skeleton in a nazi uniform, but the channel description insists it isn't a nazi, because "there is no hateful symbols on the character, I do not condone Nazism in the slightest or racism" . the channel title is also in german for some reason.

Pots drunk with me yallrly need help finding a clip from the show.

will literally says the phrase: culture is downstream from politics and then says some other things i cant remember.

my friend and i are having an argument and the context of this clip would help settle it, and im willing to risk evisceration if im wrong lol.

ugh ive been searching but i dont think my search methods are all that great either.  basically i just searched the phrase im looking for on this subreddit.  Prolly not thoI'll admit that I used to watch his videos back during the PrankInvasion days, but he's just becoming more of a stooge. Does anyone else feel this way?and the upvotes stay the same . a lot of confused liberals/chuds will see the comment though and you'll probably be downvoted somewhat, but the number of upvotes you got from the normies will keep you up there.With all due respect, resign, sir.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDOTbh1P0R0Guys let's get this shit solved once and for all.

MdespacitoMy wife's bush. She diedGarfield is actually a post left analysis of how modern society and capitalism kill people on the inside, and force people to put meaning into uncaring pets and things. They put this meaning into things to distract themselves from the crushing anxiety and worry that capitalism puts on people this is the reason so many young people have dogs, to distract themselves from the pain, to pretend like they have something. Garfield is a satirical analysis of this the creator knows its unfunny thats the point that is the beauty of garfield Jon has Garfield and Odie, to distract himself from his own problems, from his own worries, to pin them on someone else. Garfield isn't a malevolent cat. He is a cat. We see from Jon's prospective wherein he places the blame of his depression and anxiety on Garfield.I was both broke &amp; unwoke during Occupy and didn't really participate, just kind of observed, so my thoughts about it are pretty basic (at the time I felt grudgingly supportive of the sentiments being expressed but didn't really see what it was accomplishing, and also at the time I felt put off by what I perceived as bougieness dominating the one camp I wandered into). I'd be curious to hear from people who maybe were more politically involved/aware at the time and have thoughts on what can be learned from it.You pieces of shit ever read Animal Farm? Funding for astronomical ventures is good. Funding for science is good. Funding for climate study is good.

But, the idea that we *need* to strap ourselves into cryo-colonyships and jet off into space because of pollution/overpopulation/war/climate change/poverty in order to 'preserve and spread humanity' is fucking lame.

1. This presupposes that these problems are symptomatic of human nature, rather than of a system that has been deliberately curated.

2. If we follow that logic, then wherever we go--or whatever massive artificial colony we build--will be vulnerable to these same problems anyways.

3. If the presupposition is modified to "it's too late, we fucked up Earth, **we'll do better next time,**" then why is there more emphasis on getting there than on planning on how to run a new society and economy on this idealized planet? The point is to *do better,* right? Do you expect to do better with Exxon and General Electric sitting with you in the cockpit, when they were perfectly content with the societal conditions on Earth anyway?

4. Who gets 'preserved,' anyway? I get a feeling that whoever jerks off to their old Bill Nye posters sees themselves as enough of an ubermensch to be selected for the colony program, and that the colonyship will be a party of like-minded intellectuals of similar economic status. No Tamils, no Afghans, no no no, maybe some cute petite Japanese waifus and a token civilized black bro, but no one else! You think all ten billion future-humans will be given a chance at a new life, assuming that Earth progresses from Hellword to Tartarusworld? Bullshit, and you know it. The usual "we need to send the best of our species" crap will crop up, couched in objective language, despite that moribund shareholders, venture capitalists, and celebrities get first class on the colony ships in an apocalyptic scenario. And as the white nationalists are slowly broiled to death on Tartarusworld, they'll think, "at least that 500lb. venture capitalist had a white-sounding last name."

5. The most important one: are you fucking stupid? An objective 'preservation of the species?' You really, really think that the 0.01% are ever going to be in mortal jeopardy in this system? Between stem cells and blood transfusions and whatever ghoul-ass transhumanism they can think up over the next two centuries, plus private security and their general disregard for humanity as a whole, you'd be a complete dumbass to think that the parasite class wouldn't have a shitton of contingency plans that would allow them to live comfortably on an apocalyptic Earth.

6.

Never log off, friendsStealing books from Barnes and NobleIt's pride month which means you can't tell me that my takes are wrong and you have to be nice to me and tell me I'm cuteI've decided to save my last paychecks of the academic year to avoid spending the summer slaving myself out in restaurants and read as much as I could instead. 

What theory/history/literature did you plan to read this summer and think other comrades should ? Is this accelerationism?https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1002935464028987392

thank you for your service!She taught the class that the IMF and World Bank are a new form of colonialism, forcing post-colonies into a state of debt slavery while westerners continue dominating (and creating) the economic high ground of the world.

It was pretty eye opening how thoroughly loans are allocated almost to screw over third world countries - and she wasn't a fan of "third world" either because westerners have this immediate thought of "third world" mean "you're not as good as us."Listened to episode 65, the one with Adam Curtis. What he mentioned about providing a vision of the future put a few of my own thoughts into better clarity--that, for example, the weird stoicism of American liberalism that makes a few grudging social concessions (that are easily reversible anyway) but it doesn't do anything to alleviate alienation in a meaningful way. He notes that hyperindividualism is both a sociopathology *and* coping mechanism--try to shut out the alienating elements with self-help books, yoga, veganism, makeup/fashion, 'life hacks,' 'mindfulness,' New Age crap/religion, etc. etc. And, of course, the society couldn't ask for anything better: a culture where every person has some neurosis that needs to be sedated (but not resolved), and with market analytics and social media harvesting, they can figure out exactly what to sell you to temporarily convince yourself that you're not depressed.

And, of course, the moment anyone questions this kind of culture, the autoresponse from the citizens themselves is that those critics are just pussies and failures that don't have 'grit' and can't 'hustle.' Fuck, look at all these buzzwords.

Now, alternatively, the right wing provides a weirdly syncretized future that's been cut with the past like coke and baking soda. 'Things were better back then, but we'll go... farther!' The fantastical past (unironic Fallout 1950s or Wagner-ass horned Vikings or asexualized blonde blue-eyed Spartans or D&amp;D Generic Fantasy Europe) provides a template of what could/should be, and then the future is filled in by the conservative imagination and wish-fulfillment. When they hear "Make XYZ Great Again," they build their own vision from the materials provided. But it works.

Now, the question is... how do you consolidate a left-wing, progressive, egalitarian vision of the future and then relay it to an entire population? Presidential Candidate Brandt can say *"yeah sup we're running on single payer healthcare and closing military bases abroad and defunding the military and closing Guantanamo and actually imprisoning war criminals and funding education and legalizing de facto abortion and making extensive sex education mandatory and providing free housing to the homeless and expanding welfare and maternity/paternity leave and guns for everyone and legalized/regulated/unionized sex work and free university and redistributing the wealth and supporting worker co-ops and nationalizing the banking system, etc. etc. etc..."*

But that's just a laundry list, that's not a vision. It could be phrased in a sense of "all the problems we have now actually have solutions, and a vague Malthusian catastrophe doesn't need to be our future," but that doesn't quite cut it.

So if you've got any ideas, I'm all ears.Of not waking up to a socialist Paradise.  Oh well here I go and try againMelania ran away three months ago. Not many people have realized this yet, but that is because Drumpf doesn't want to admit it, and the man that she is with knows how to keep her secret, how to keep her safe

The only reason that I know this is that the pair have been borrowing my old consoles for Melania to game on(my uncle was her protectors boss when he was in the FBI). And fuck if she isn't the biggest fucking nerd I have ever met. Demanded that I buy her a copy of Legend of Dragoon, makes constant Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda references, the works. Anyway, she made me call her "Lilah" to "protect her identity, and constantly reffered to Rob, her protector, as her "beautiful Ethan." I have just been doing it, figuring that it is something weird fucking reference that I just don't get.

But two weeks ago I find out that "Ethan" had gotten "Lilah" fucking pregnant. The fucking animals couldn't keep it in their pants for two more months and allow you "Ethan" to finish up an important investigation that he is heading up. Not that I can blame either of them too much, what with his chiseled jawline and her beautiful features, but still.

It gets worse though. Last night I got a call from "Ethan" asking me to come over to Annapolis Public Hospital, as Melania wanted to see me

I fucking rushed in through the front door, and demanded directions from the receptionist. Following those, I ran through the hospital for nearly 45 minutes, asking a Doctor for further directions after I took a wrong turn. Bursting in through the door, I saw Melania crying in the bed with Rob holding her.

"Is this loss?" I asked, shellshocked.
 
Rob just looked at me, his age showing like it never had before, and said to me "yes, son. This is Loss."

I'll admit, I cried. I cried because these two people had just lost so much. When the FBI came in and took Melania to the White House to be cared for, and one of the agents turned to Rob and said

"See you Monday, sir"

And left.

I just feel so empty right now, I don't know what I am going to do.The Awami Workers Party.

This is their platform

 - The State will take the primary responsibility of organizing and planning the country’s economy.

 - Major industries, including those run by the military, will be nationalized and placed under the control of a democratic state.

 - The party will resist imperialist aggression against our people in all its manifestations: be they drone strikes, multinational capital or austerity measures imposed by the IMF and World Bank.

 - The Privatization policy will be immediately stopped, all privatized industries will be re-nationalized and sacked employees will be re-instated.

 - The democratic right of workers to form trade unions will be recognized and protected as part of the state’s policy of democratizing the work place and improving working conditions.

 - Radical land reforms will be immediately implemented and land will be redistributed among the peasantry in order to break the political and social power of big land owning families.

 - Will fundamentally change the state’s hostile policy towards neighbouring countries, which has been used to justify the military establishment’s economic and political power.

 - The party recognizes that the question of women liberation has received inadequate attention, even within Leftist circles. The party aims to fight against all forms of discrimination against women and considers women a vanguard of the revolution, without whom any fundamental change is impossible.

 - The hollow ideology of religious fanaticism will be fully exposed and popular opinion will be mobilized to fight against such retrograde forces.

 - Pakistan’s multinational essence will be recognized and a genuine federal system based on the right of self-determination for all nations will be established.

 - The existing, oppressive state institutions will be replaced with those that provide for basic needs and are fundamentally democratic in their functions.

commies get btfoThere's a heat wave where I live right now. I was with my dog when I decided to use public bathroom. I PAID it, went inside with dog, then washed my hands. Then I pulled out a bottle-bowl for my dog. I thought I'd fill it since I'm by the faucet.

It's a fucking 300 ml (like a can of soda) bottle. I'm filling it and then suddenly this guy that collects the money barges in and yells that I should've ask when I wanted to fill the bottle.

I said that it's a small bottle. He then yells that water meter is running. So as I closed the bottle and was walking out I just threw "that's why I fucking paid".

I'm sorry but I'm so pissed right now. 300 ml of water and I get yelled at.top text

&gt;When Helen Lefkowitz said I was "such a creep" at Interlochen in
1956, her remark epitomized the feeling that females have always had about
me. My attempts to understand why females rejected me and to decide what
to do about it resulted in years of confusion. In 1961-1962, I tried to
develop a theory of the creep problem. This theory took **involuntary
celibacy** as the defining characteristic of the creep. Every society has its
image of the ideal young adult, even though the symbols of growing up
change from generation to generation.The creep is an **involuntary celibate**
because he fails to develop the surface traits of adulthood--poise and
sophistication; and because he is shy, unassertive, and lacks self-confidence
in the presence of others . The creep is awkward and has an unstylish
appearance . He seems sexless and childish . He is regarded by the ideal adults
with condescending scorn, amusement, or pity.

The red pill theory that women have no free will and are guided purely by biology and insticts:

&gt;The great divergence between myself and females comes in the area
where each individual is responsible for what he or she is; the area in which
one must choose oneself and the principles with which one will be identified.
This area is certainly not a matter of intelligence or academic degrees

Literally predicting gamers

&gt;Although the creep's intellectual abilities develop with education the creep lives in a sexually neutral world and a child's world throughout his life . He is thus able to play like a child. He retains the child's
make-believe capacity for . He retains the child's lyrical creativity in regard self-originated, self-justifying activities .

Neckbeards could only dream of reaching such fedora levels

&gt;The field of art provides an even better example, because there are
many females in this field. In the summer of 1969 I attended a meeting of
the women's group of the Art Workers Coalition in New York. Many of the
women there had seen my Down With Art pamphlet. All the females who
have seen this pamphlet have reacted negatively, and it is quite clear what
their attitude is. They believe that they are courageously defending modern
art against a philistine. They consider me to be a crank who needs a "modern
museum art appreciation course." The more they are pressed, the more
proudly do they defend "Great Art." **Now the objective validity of my
opposition to art is absolutely beyond question. To defend modern art is
precisely what a hopeless mediocrity would consider courageous.** Again, it is clear
that the opposition between myself and females is in the area where
one must choose one's values.
I have found that what i really have to do to make a favorable
impression on on females is to conceal or suspend my activities - the most
important part of my life ; and to adopt a facade of conformity. Thus, I
perceive females as persons who cannot function in my occupation. I
perceive them as being like an employment agency, like an institution to
which you have to present a conformist facade . Females can be counted on to
represent the most "social, human" point of view, a point of view which, as I
have explained, is distant from my own. (In March 1970, at the Institute for
Advanced Study, the mathematician Dennis Johnson said to me that he
would murder his own mother, and murder all his friends, if by doing so he
could get the aliens to take him to another star and show him a higher
pvilization. My own position is the same as Johnson's.

A 60 year head start on transhumanism

&gt;Further, as
the human species comes to have vast technological capabilities, many
special interest groups will want to tinker with human social biology, each in
a different way, for political reasons. I am no longer interested in petty
tinkering with human biology. As I make it clear in other writings, I am in
favor of building entities which are actially superior to humans, and which
avoid the whole fabric of human biosocial defects, not just one or two of
them...like dudes.

1. The chapos seem to have a problem with the ironic racism on the show
2. The chapos don't seem to recognize or simply just excuse the ironic racism on the chapo pod 
3. Cumboys seem to be more interested in jokes 
4. Cumboys consume cum town in a fundamentally different way than chapos do. Cumboys dissect joke structure and meaning separately while chapos take everything at face value.
5. Chapos may have high IQ, but low EQ. [Autism still not confirmed yet] 
6. Cumboys have very large DQ (Dick Size)
6.  Felix still isn't funny

Place your bets in this thread, folks. She is supposed to appear today so I think cyborg Melania is a good theory I haven't seen yet!I was debating with someone who defended the use of trumps sh*thole comment with the following comments:

"Trump was getting at is that these countries are unstable and have some bad cultural aspects but America, where I live, has some of that too. There are still good things we can take from these foreign cultures, but not all cultures are good. A lot of these countries still have things like terrorism, rape, gangs, child-rape, and human trafficking running amuck so with that in mind, I think it's safe to say that Trump was within reason to say what he said, he just could have chosen better words"

This person is trying to act all nice about it but I can see through their neo-racism with the whole culture argument. So, what's a good way to break down their claim?I was trying to find out a little more where our favorite Baby Boomer came from and I can't find anything. Granted he has a very common name but his website is a pretty shitty and I couldn't find a bio. Hell, the giftshop link doesn't even work on his site. Then I noticed most of his photos are identical to each other, all from the last couple of years. 

Does anyone know where he came from, his origins? Where he started? Or is he just some asshole TCOT on Twitter? Other than people goofing on him I don't see many people give him any credibility. Been thinking about this recently. We're in the open looting phase here in the US. The mask has totally slipped from the GOP as to what they are and the Democrats are increasingly revealed to be useless at best or openly assisting in the grift at worst. #theassistance is worthless and all they do is jerk each other off on Twitter.

&gt;The Yemen conflict is complex. It has been taken over by terrorist groups of what once was a civil war. Much like the ME, it's hard to tell which groups are fighting for which cause because they infiltrate many political movements. The US doesn't support killing Yemen's, nor does Israel - it's just a bit more complicated than you are making out to be. If we go in and help aid, the same thing will happen like it did in Syria when Obama provided weapons for the Rebels..they'll end up in the hands of terrorists.

So in between the traphouse podcasts, what other ones do you guys recommend? It can be in or out of politicshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Race

&gt;The Peace Race (German: Friedensfahrt, Czech: Závod míru, Slovak: Preteky mieru, Russian: Велогонка Мира (Velogonka Mira), Polish: Wyścig Pokoju [ˈvɨɕt͡ɕik pɔˈkɔju], French: Course de la Paix, Italian: Corsa della Pace, Romanian: Cursa Păcii) was an annual multiple stage bicycle race held in the Eastern Bloc states of Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland. First organized in 1948, it was originally created with the intent of relieving tensions existing between Central European countries following the interwar period and World War II.

&gt;Maintained by the three states ruling Communist parties' newspapers (Rudé právo, Neues Deutschland and Trybuna Ludu), it was dubbed to be the "world's biggest amateur cycling race"[1] and "Tour de France of the East".

&gt;Following the fall of Communism in 1989, the Peace Race was no longer state-sponsored and organizers faced trouble with gathering funds. The event was last held in 2006.[2]

although apparently:

&gt;A Junior Peace Race was first held in 1965 and held again the following year. After a hiatus it was revived in 1974 and has been held every year since, continuing after the senior race was no longer organised.

&gt;An Under-23 Peace Race for riders under 23 years was added in 2013.[7] From 2015 the race has been part of the UCI Under 23 Nations' Cup.[8]

Young bicyclists are maintaining the light of communism? Or maybe they just want to win awards, still cool regardless.

&gt;There is a museum in Kleinmühlingen in Germany dedicated to the Peace Race.

If any of you live in Germany please go do some reporting on this history! It’s almost unlistenable. It’s about sports, and the guest has some kind of speech disorder and sounds like he’s talking from the bottom of a lake. 

Holy shit...

&gt;Trust me, even if they do "integrate" there will still be many, many other issues, such as a huge gender imbalance, social tension, everything being racism or hate crimes, affirmative action, quotas, miscegenation and single mothers, belligerent and tormented biracials, white decline and political power shifts, complaints "over too many whites" in everything from your TV shows, companies, schools to your bicycles. Best is to forget about integration, keep Pandora's Box shut, throw away the key and just find other ways to deal with native population decline.

I feel like Bill Clinton gets a pass despite numerous allegations of straight up violently assaulting women over the years. Moreover there’s allegations that Hillary Clinton knew about the rapes and encouraged people to stay quiet about them. Are these allegations credible? Why don’t liberals ever talk about them? I was briefly looking over them today and they’re incredibly fucked up and I feel like it’s weird that in 2016 I didn’t hear about them constantly.

G.O.P. nominee Denver Riggleman writes bigfoot erotica:

https://np.facebook.com/DenverTheAuthor/posts/182481445590298That feel when you randomly remember how much Paul Ryan sucks shitThe United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights Philip Alston recently released this report on extreme poverty in the US. 
http://undocs.org/A/HRC/38/33/ADD.1
Here are some key excerpts:

"Successive administrations, including the current one, have determinedly rejected the idea that economic and social rights are full-fledged human rights, despite their clear recognition not only in key treaties that the United States has ratified, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, but also in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the United States has long insisted other countries must respect"

"There is no magic recipe for eliminating extreme poverty, and each level of government must make its own good-faith decisions. At the end of the day, however, particularly in a rich country like the United States, the persistence of extreme poverty is a political choice made by those in power. With political will, it could readily be eliminated"

"The case of Walmart, the largest employer in the United States, is instructive. Many of its workers cannot survive on a full-time wage in the absence of food stamps. This fits in a broader trend: the share of households that, while having earnings, also receive nutrition assistance rose from 19.6 percent in 1989 to 31.8 percent in 2015"

"In the tax context, immense faith is placed in the goodwill and altruism of the corporate beneficiaries, while with welfare reform the opposite assumptions apply"

(On homelessness) "Los Angeles failed to meet even the minimum standards the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees sets for refugee camps in the Syrian Arab Republic and other emergency situations"

"In many cities and counties, the criminal justice system is effectively a system for keeping the poor in poverty while generating revenue to fund not only the justice system but many other programmes"

"in 26 states judges issue arrest warrants for alleged debtors at the request of private debt collectors, thus violating the law and human rights standards"

The Federalist Papers talk about how political parties are hypocritical and how we shouldn't have "factionalism", as if writing essays against it would somehow keep that from happening. Could you imagine a show like the West Wing taking place inside the House of Commons?In hellworld, this is both the only correct take as well as the funniest. Social democracy=capitalism

Liberal=someone who supports capitalism

It's not hard.http://conservativefighters.org/news/child-trafficking-camp-discovered-in-arizona-is-located-on-clinton-foundation-donor-cemex-property/

This is some hilarious (terrifying) shit. The threeper militia types and minute men militias are self-mobilizing to investigate ~~homeless people's camp sites~~ kiddie rape outposts and are not going to let common sense, exasperated police, or large cork boards covered in photographs and red string stand in their way! THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE AND THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE IT UP AS THEY GO ALONG. 

Stay tuned for the latest. i dont want seizures theyre bad pleaseI know it's not typical of this sub, but this is a bit of a serious advice post. 

I'm an aspiring writer working on my own story in a fictional dieselpunk world, and one of my plot points involves one of the main characters becoming my story's main antagonist, and part of this is him abandoning the socialist revolutionaries he fought beside for the explicitly fascist government they were fighting against. 

Even though he mainly does it for selfish personal reasons, I'm still having a hard time conceptualizing how a great loyal hero fighting for freedom and equality could become a selfish monster that killed his own friends essentially for an ideology he was once diametrically opposed to. I know all the beats to how he becomes what he becomes, but I'm still grappling with why he embraces a fascist ideology and whether or not he even *really does* rather than pretending to stand for it to accomplish his goals. Advice?

Edit: Also, my world is sort of Tolkien-esque except humans aren't exactly on top so, ideologically, it really doesn't even make sense for him to turn.

Basically, I'm having an even bigger problem than the Star Wars prequels did, at least Anakin always believed in some fascist-esque ideology to explain why he embraces it so easily, but my own character was explicitly fighting against this. Making his turn literally worse than Anakin's.It's first page - the pages go on and on. I cobbled this together myself so I'm certain I made a mistake or two (or more than that).

&gt; Let me talk about the cakeshop and the food it makes. I have had two different projects done by this place: one was perfect in flavor and execute very well. The second cake was a day late without explanation, and one of the flavors was wrong on the cake.
&gt; 
&gt; I have found that King Soopers, Safeway, and Walmart provide similar cakes to this shop. Depending on the day, you could get a great cake here or not.

&gt; I ordered the cake but it tasted kind of weird. I never wanted any cream in it but that is what I got. It was filled with a kind of warm cream, like those lava cakes but this wasn't chocolate, it was like kind of lighter colored and a little saltier than I would like, maybe it was salted caramel or something. At the end of the day, I did kind of enjoy the cream but it was just really different for me and not something I was used to. Now that I tried it that one time though I can't stop thinking about it.
&gt; 
&gt; I gave one star mainly because it was a surprise and really unexpected. But if the taste grows on me I might revisit and give an extra star or two.

&gt; Customer Service and Human Decency Matters. I can't muster an ounce of support for Jack Phillips (owner) who refused a gay couple's request for a wedding cake, arguing that due to his Christian beliefs, he opposes same-sex marriages and did not want to do anything that looked like an endorsement of a same-sex wedding.
&gt; 
&gt; The same-sex couple simply requested a wedding cake. They did not discuss any message or distinguishing element that would have made their cake different from that of any other cake Phillips might bake for any other couple celebrating their union.
&gt; 
&gt; "When a couple contacts a bakery for a wedding cake, the product they are seeking is a cake celebrating their wedding--not a cake celebrating heterosexual weddings or same-sex weddings--and that is the service Craig and Mullins were denied," Ginsburg writes.

&gt; If you're considering buying a cake (or anything) from here, think again. The shop is overpriced, and the cakes are dry, the flavors unpleasant, and the decorations lifeless, similar to the owner's heart.

&gt; Honestly, a box of funfetti is more enjoyable and less hateful than the baked goods here.

&gt; I am very unhappy that any merchant is allowed to not serve a protected group within the United States. This is akin to making black people sit at the back of the bus, or at the counter in a restaurant. It is bigotry and i believe that any business who operates this way should be publicly recognized for their business practices.

&gt; An imaginary person named Jesus once said, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
&gt; 
&gt; Some people started a religion based on this and some other nice stuff they heard he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The owners of Masterpiece Cakeshop believe Jesus was real, but decided that the stuff he said wasn't really true, and instead chose to hate some of their neighbors.

&gt; There's a difference in refusal to serve someone based on your personal or religious beliefs. That is bigotry, because it imposes your beliefs on another person or persons. You know like refusing to put a man and a man on top of a wedding cake. That is outright bigotry.
&gt; The idea that a person may not believe in gay marriage. That is a belief. There is a systematic difference because a person is entitled to their beliefs.
&gt; Clearly this place has a bigot for an owner. Next he'll be refusing to make cakes for people of color, creed, and/or origin.

&gt; I don't know how religion and pastries got conflated, but this is who we are now. Hate never tasted so bad
&gt; 
&gt; I, like a lot of people on this sub, come here because I live in a terrible time and it's fun to dunk on dipshits. But sometimes I see really lazily-sourced material attempting to mock familiar targets. Right now the third post on the front page is a comment from a r/JordanPeterson post, and the title is written to imply that the Peterson sub as a whole prefers fascism to communism. That, if true, would be a Bad Take.

Once you click on the original source though, you can see it's from a pretty minor post that is 34% upvoted. If you scroll through the comments the first eight are pretty reasonable (given the sub). About the worst you could say is that some are overly academic. There are only two comments, both heavily downvoted, saying that fascism is preferable to communism. 

Now, don't interpret the intent of this post as somehow defending the rhetoric of Jordan Peterson or his misinformed fans. I like dunking on D-list celebs and mocking chuds as much as the next guy, but if we're spotlighting the comments some random fascist on reddit is making, especially when that rhetoric isn't even supported by his supposed online community, it just feels a bit clickbait-y and deceptive. There's a lot more worthwhile targets to spend our outrage on.https://accesstucson.org/portfolio/homeless-in-tucson-veterans-on-patrol-1/

I guess this is the guy who started the #operationbackyardbrawl Pizzagate shit, but... if any of the shit in the video is actually happening it sounds like he's actually doing outreach and support for homeless veterans and others in Arizona. 

Which... i don't really know how to process. The possibility he could buy into it and 'threaten' to release every single federal prisoner ever if impeachment proceedings began?

She just sucks ass. Whether it’s intentional or not the only leftist issues she fights for are ones that would never in a million years actually pass anyway so it’s all just faux effort. 

She doesn’t really have any real risk in CA. She could easily win elections until she does but still puts in little effort to push for actual leftist issues that are contentious but doable. 

CA is the biggest most left leaning state but between her, and milk toast future president Harris (who is kinda getting cajoled into some better policies but still she sucks), it all feels wasted. 

Also we passed prop 8 so fuck this whole dumb state. I’m still mad about that. There will be so many fucking liberal tears.

He also has a huge [boner for Rhodesian bullshit](https://imgur.com/uME3cN6), which is totally normal and not-at-all indicative that he's a fascist.

This is what praxis looks like“The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history.”This is not Ben Shapiro.

Richie Bradley go on chapoDid I miss something? I'm seeing a bunch of people talk about how you don't need to read every little piece of text to understand the overall movement, which is a great message, but I'm just curious as to what started it?Working on some new x-rated memes to answe the where in the world is MelMel question and need some jpegs/gifs for the cause.What does Chapo think? is probably a fascist and is just obfuscating the definition. I want contemporary people and I have no idea where to lookI was just watching some porn from the 90's, and it's a who's who of gorgeous black ladies. They are non-existent now. What happened? All the black chicks are primarily coming from the UK. Any black chick that does porn do two videos and then disappear. The default pornstar seems to be petite white women from Eastern Europe. 

It's strage. At a time when entertainment is getting more diverse, the opposite happened in porn. I think porn is whiter now than the 70's. Hats off to california. I can't wait for it to spread all over the country. Loving all the centerists using it to force leftists to drop out so ex-republicans can win safe dem seats. Can some of you go stick it to the DCCC for me?

btw, u can only understand what im saying if u have an iq of at least 170. Just got the new Sarah Louise record and it’s the most amazing thing this year hands-down 

https://sarahlouise.bandcamp.com/album/deeper-woodsI got an herb garden going and 4 varieties of peppers growing, including ghost peppers. I want to get into hot sauce creation so I'm excited. How're all your gardens?Letter from a Birmingham jail was incredible imho. So well written. Not as good as @byyourlogic but closeIs swat ICE offices and detention centers.I posted a few months ago about SEIU organizing at our workplace. Well the vote is in a week, and corporate has been propagandizing hard. I have a really good relationship with my manager, so I've been very cagey about my feelings about the union (strong support). Today I kind of got fed up with being called into the office so they can talk about how 'unions can promise everyone a pony and never have to pay up while businesses are under such strict rules that they can't lie to their employees, isn't that so unfair?' so I sort of went off. I don't know if I comported myself well, but I think I gave a solid if maybe too impassioned moral defense of unions. The biggest thing they keep trying to tell us is, "They aren't offering anything you don't already get," and my response is, "So why be against the union? If all it does is give employees a seat at the table and doesn't fundamentally change how much we cost to employ, what's the argument against it?" They are betting on telling their employees they're too stupid to know whats best for themselves as a winning anti-union strategy. They are also avoiding the major precipitating issue which was an extreme change in our benefits with zero input or even an announcement until after the change was already implemented. How did they think that was going to be okay?

As I've explained here before, I am in an incredibly privileged position in life. I live as a DINK and never got addicted to material wealth, so I work most of a part time job, have a good retirement savings while I bring in half the family income and we still have enough money to do whatever we want, basically. If we had kids, or completely lost an income, or developed some expensive chronic condition, we'd be fucked, but pretty much anything else can happen and we're fine. So what the fuck do I care about a union? My life fucking rules. But that's exactly it. **I** have the slack to give up a little (I'll actually be giving up nothing if any of the SEIU contracts for similar organizations are any indication) on behalf of the people who don't have as awesome a life as I do. What about the people for whom a small change in benefits would bankrupt their family? What about people in our organization who work full time and still struggle to make ends meet? THAT'S why we need a union.

It makes me sad that this is such a hard thing for people to get behind. Anyway, I don't think the people in /r/rant would care for this, and I posted about it here before anyway. Mods, go fuck yourselves.I had it saved on my old account but I deleted it and I want it again. 
  
Additional things: I think it was by the mid oughts leftist group which was similar to black Bloc in ideals but wore white and was an actual organization ( I think)https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1004104736088322048sometimes i listen to the npr politics podcast because i'm not yet hoarse from shouting at liberals alone in my car on the way to work.  they did a live show last weekend about the midterms, and one thing in particular nearly caused a 4-car pileup.

political editor domenico montanaro was bringing up the infighting among democrats, specifically asking if the party should be following the rahm emanuel moderate/centrist approach.  the response he got from mara liasson would have been parody if i didn't already know that mara has no sense of humor (paraphrased):

&gt;DM: should the democrats put forward... more moderate, more centrist democrats to win in places where there are more republicans/independents, and is the party comfortable with that?  Because the energy right now when you look at all the polling is on the the *most* left part of the spectrum.

&gt;ML: for the most part the answer to that question is they're pragmatic.  they want to find candidates that fit their districts. it means if you're in california maybe you do want someone from the left, **BUT** if you're in [[[*the heartland*]]] you want somebody who can reflect the district or the state.

now i admit i'm just an ignorant redneck gamer whose misspent youth involved too much of the west wing, but do these people really have no fucking clue?  really?  seriously?

do mainstream liberals really think their salvation is coming from republican voters?

how the hell have they still never, ever stopped to figure out what they're doing wrong?

how can anyone be so obviously, painfully short-sighted?

is this just because 'boomers have an idea of what the moral high ground consists of and it has more to do with congressional softball than american lives?

lots of feels, please be mean to me. https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/1004110805430947848?s=09I went from Captain Peacock to Mr. MashAfter the recent Jon Stewart article where he basically acknowledges what has been said on this sub, on Chapo, and in leftist circles for a while now - that the daily show did nothing to prevent this situation if not making it worse - it got me thinking about the essay where Marx states that religion is the opiate of the masses.

The quick and easy catharsis of a laugh at the expense of liberals or chuds, watching some fascist shit get dragged on Twitter, 42 layers of irony, even dril; it's all an escape.  It doesn't actually help us throw off the chains of capitalism.  Sure, it makes existence a little more bearable, but it's also easy to confuse with real action.  Liberals, of course, always think it is real direct action.

Anyway, Marx was talking about the daily show, probably. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.How we're doing so far

There doesn't even seem to be any actual ideological angle, just a grab bag of normie statements expressed in simple sentence structure. The flogging was supposed to be the joke? There wasn't any sort of set-up or punchline. Is it supposed to make fun of how "moderates" get dunked on constantly? Was it supposed to support dunking on them, when Seth joins in? Was there any acknowledgement that these takes don't actually challenge anything?

So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah

Turn every situation into Heaven, yeah

(Oh, you are...)

My sunrise on the darkest day

Got me feelin' some kind of way

Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly

You fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it on

Got the only key, know how to turn it on

The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear

Baby take it slow so we can last long


Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal

Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan

Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso

Oh, yeah Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal

Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más

Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro


Despacito

Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito

Deja que te diga cosas al oído

Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Despacito

Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito

Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto

Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito


I wanna see you dance

And I want you to be my baby

I just wanna kiss you slowly

In all of your favourite places

Lemme show you pleasure that you've never known

Make you scream over and over

Till the neighbours know my name


Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito

Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito

Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza

Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito

Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito

Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas

Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza


Slowly...

I wanna breath in your body slowly

I wanna whisper you sweet nothings...

Till you remember you're the one with me


Slowly...

Let's just kiss in the naked slowly

I wanna sign all over your body

Let's see the time doesn't need to hurry


Despacito

This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico

I just wanna here you screaming "iAy, Bendito!"

I can move forever se quede contigo

Despacito... 


Check. Mate.My favorite real chapo person is Felix. That boys voice is like musical ice cream and his hot takes about the lion of the desert are the kinda edgy fun needed to liven the place up.

My favorite characters would have to be John Kasich the roving hobo and the writer or Gorilla Mindset. Perhaps I am misusing character, but these people are true charactersMine was in 6th grade when Mad Magazine made fun of Ronald Reagan. We all gotta start somewhere.  "I have a series of questions laid out for each SC gubernatorial candidate as a traditional young person:

"As Governor, would you support student and faculty rights to concealed carry on College Campuses? 

"The rise of the LGBTQs power has led to the destruction of family values. How would you tackle the issue of homosexuality, gender issues, and the perversion of family life that has become mainstream in the West? How could we transition back into a traditional society? 

"How will you handle the issue of abortion and euthanasia? 

"Racial tensions are rising. What will you do to keep people safe in a failed multicultural state?  

"Would you allow Boers to seek refuge in our state as they face the rise of racist policies under the SA government? 

"Every year, more and more northerners move down south seeking economic growth and low taxes. Yet when they arrive, they vote the same policies and cause major demographic shifts in the areas they settle in. What can be done to prevent the loss of SC culture, it’s people, and it’s policies? 

"Our constitutional right to bear arms is under attack. What will you do as governor to protect our rights? 

"Communists are being allowed to spread their propaganda and are converting many Americans to their anti-liberty, collectivist movements. They seek destruction of American values so they may replace them with Marxist, globalist values. What will you do to stop them from spreading their lies and causing further destruction? 

"How do you plan to protect our borders? 

"The drinking age of 21 is way too old and lack of exposure to alcohol at early ages often leads to dangerous binges later in life. Further, young adults at 17 can enlist in military service and are seen as responsible enough to defend their state, yet not responsible enough to drink or carry for their own protection. This double standard leads me to ask, will you enforce the legal drinking age at 17? And will you enforce the concealed carry age at 17? 

"What will you do to protect AND promote agriculture in our state? 

"Will you swear to protect our environment, even at the expense of economic growth? 

"What will you do to abolish taxes? 

"How will you make higher education more affordable? 

"Non-Christian practitioners pose a threat to our state as those populations begin to grow. What will you do to protect Christianity in our state as it has become a dying religion across the West? 

"Will you advocate to repeal the 17th amendment to restore sovereignty to states and restore the constitutional federal model? 

"Healthcare costs are through the roof. Would you privatize the system to keep it competitive and end the big pharma/ big gov healthcare wage slave system?

"Would you defend a business owner’s right to deny service to a customer based on their property rights and free market theories? 

"Opioid addiction has reached critical levels especially in poorer communities. What will you do to end this to allow our communities to grow? 

"How will you act against federal tyranny? Will you allow the federal government to act unconstitutional? How would you react? 

"This list can be expanded, but these are just criteria I’m using in looking for the right leader for our state. I’ll post results if candidates respond"modern american fascism started with reagan not trump. i'm glad reagan dead. What do you think happened? Where exactly on the timeline of China’s slide back into capitalism did it occur? Did it coincide with some consolidation of power? Was the CIA inflaming the protests? I know nothing about it and all the info online is either the Western narrative or straight up denial.feudalism has been around for literally hundreds of years and some form of landowner-serf relationship has existed since the dawn of time. it's clearly the best mode of social and economic organization that exists, so why would you bother changing it :)))))))Dianne Feinstein has 400 thousand votes. A Republican named Bradley is second place, Kevin de Leon is third, and Allison Hartson only has 2 percent.

Doug Applegate, who almost beat Darrel Issa, got swamped by Democrats who threw in a dozen candidates so he couldn't win, and he lost.

Rosa Calderon, another Justice Democrat, is in a distant fourth place. She's as done as Stephen Jaffe who lost to Nancy Pelosi.

DSA, Our Revolution, and Justice Democrats are getting swept. But Patrick "Neo Nazi" Little is done.The millionaire property developer aristocrat easily won the Democrat nomination for governor and the Bernie endorsed guy for one of the congressional districts is in 3rd with a measly 16&amp;#37;

I don't fucking know how this country can be saved, I know it hits closer to home because it's the state where I live but god damn what do we even do when people on the ostensible left wing choose to vote en masse for a literal landlord https://twitter.com/claytravis/status/1004088647489146883I am so angry right now so lemme vent.

First of all, Dianne Feinstein with a strong 40% of the vote. WHO ARE THE PEOPLE VOTING IN THESE PRIMARIES? WHO? HOW? WHAT? You would think that ppl who vote in "Democrat" primaries would be semi informed and want an actual lefty politician representing them, but whatever, establishment influence too strong, who cares. I guess that story about her "leaking" that thing at the Trump meeting or whatever worked on the masses who watch MSM.

Next we have all the progressives and the Bernie guy losing in places like Iowa, what happened to the socialists? Again, WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? Do they have nothing better to do than show up in primaries and cast their uninformed votes? voting was a mistake I tell you! A MISTAKE! 

Chris Hayes says ppl don't care about being anti establishment and want more women candidates, so clearly idpol really is the only thing that matters now, welcome to the Trump supporters of the left, I call them LIBERALS. Hope this strategy works out in the general elections, and Kamala 2020 pretty much confirmed I guess, Bernie is fucked unless there is a crowded field of establishment Dems splitting the vote (the only way this wouldn't happen is if the DNC gets behind a single candidate from the beginning like with Hillary, don't give them any ideas)

Finally, in conclusion, America deserves Trump, and we are doomed.

Good night, everybody! 
https://twitter.com/sethamandel/status/1004212932480327680fingers crosseddon’t want to put too much detail here since my ex-boss is on reddit but i hope he comes across this and just throws a fucking hissy fit.

Jerked me around with saying i’m guaranteed F/T employment just as our busiest season ramps up. after the holiday he loses clients so all the work is consolidated to “vitals” so the labor pool just goes anemic. he sweetens the pot with a wage increase but what does it matter earning $2 extra dollars an hour when your hours drop from 50-60 a week to 0-20 a month.

no schedule. months of asking for some kind of system of like 1 or 2 days a week guaranteed. *crickets*

go back working for the family business and now i have to put out my dad whenever my boss or his manager’s pleas about being slammed 7-9pm the night before. i state this grievance after ignoring a few weeks of reply that getting someone to cover for me last minute is difficult to help out. suddenly get a full week availability three days in advance, with no acknowledgement that my complaint of getting someone to cover one day is difficult let alone a last minute full fucking week. 

i ghost and my boss’ texts get more and more passive aggressive. decided to just block everyone from work. don’t dangle F/T and benefits in front of me for months, ignoring how available i made myself. months later make F/T for a group of people and exclude me, then get pissy when it’s clear my value is only there when you can’t get literally anyone else to cover in your bogus ass gig economy schedule system.

reading this back he can clearly tell it’s me but oh well. underemployment abuse is real.I dont fucking understand it,shouldnt we care more about classism than that? Maybe its because I am white but I dont think in 2018 racism is anywhere a big problemI commented to politics that "Putin is such a Chad" earlier today, and since then every one of my comments is at +1 score, like nobody has even seen them. Maybe I got shadow-banned from Reddit. Can anyone see this post? Say something ironic if you can read this.It’s probably pretty likely that the super wealthy mostly live unsatisfying lives and that nobody really wins in our inequitable society.For context: many evictions go through only because tenants rarely have representation and have no idea how often landlords serve fraudulent eviction notices.

Folks: the DSA is good.But everybody loves a dead baby joke I just want to say that I have more testosterone in my little ftm dick than in Ben Shapiro’s entire body 


Okay thank you chapos now please line up to kiss me to show your pride and the biggest issue I think Hillary had when she was running against trump was that

"She may NOT be Derek ZOOLANDER . .  

. . but she CAN'T turn left GOOD"

sorry. don't know if they used it but I haven't heard em use it and thought it was aight I dont fucking understand it,shouldnt we care more about gaming than that?

It's like a fucking knee-jerk reflex, and the mere existence of Hamas dehumanizes every single Gazan and justifies *any* human rights violation, in the mind of the zionist.

I feel like there's two ways out of this rut, one would be to say "yeah, I fucking support Hamas", and disarm them this way, the other would be for Gazans to oust Hamas and put non-violent resistors in their place, and then Gazans would be legitimized as people. I can't in earnest do the former, and I have no control over the latter.Looking forward to in 30 years being a dirt poor middle class man, while the rich now live on Elysium.

The chief of police got up and claimed that no one spent time in jail over misdemeanor possession anyway, so the proposal is unnecessary. Then a parade of dissenting voices were heard (some much more articulate than others) including one who brought hard evidence to contradict what the chief of police said. 

One guy got up to speak about the years of involvement with the criminal justice system he endured after an arrest for possession of a single blunt roach, how he had to join a gang, how he saw someone sodomized with a shampoo bottle, etc. The mayor (Mark Stodola) grilled him, "Was this in Little Rock?" The man admitted it was actually in neighboring Faulkner County, to which Stodola just looked smug. 

The proposal failed to pass, 2-6.

Civic engagement is a painful struggle. Who the fuck cares it's a stupid song and just another excuse to wave nationalism around. It's not even the national anthem or anything (which we should also stop doing all the goddamn time).

Am I on the right track?With the way that California primaries work, this could have been a giant fumble for progressive Dems, but there's a lot of good news coming out of last night's results:

- Newsom will probably be our next governor, and while he's far from perfect, the race could have easily played out to offer two GOP candidates instead. This way, at least, CA's status as a sanctuary state will remain and we might get statewide single payer.

- Kevin de Leon will have his chance to take on Feinstein the Undying from the left.

- In my home House district (CA-49th), Mike "McLovin" Levin, an environmentalist, M4A and national $15 minimum wage supporter, will take on a tepid GOP challenger in a district that went +7 blue in 2016.

Any other good news, fellow Cali residents?

Well, you've been conditioned by American media from birth to think this way, so it's perfectly natural! At least recognize your desires and be honest with yourselves. That's the first step

Don't pretend your candy asses are on the cusp of starting a revolution and living in the mountains for years fighting the US military like the fucking Taliban. Grow up

it's now too late for me to say "bless you" without it being super weird. im thinking about whether they specifically told me about their sneeze cuz they expected me to say "bless you". i dont have anything against saying it, i just forgot cuz its not a reflex for me to say it. damn. rest in peace I don't know what else to say. We can't do much other than talk about it, but if we're going to talk about let's be serious. Stop sarcastically calling it a "wellness check". It was a thinly veiled murder attempt and the fact that this is being ignored in mainstream circles is frightening.bottom textHey all you what the fuckers, I know some of you listen to DIJAtC because this sub is where I found it. I've been listening to their JFK series and it's super interesting, but there's a fuckload of information in it, some of which is pretty out there. Now I don't by any means trust the American government, especially the CIA, but some of this stuff sounds pretty "conspiratorial", for lack of a better word. Is anybody here who's listened to the pod and is more knowledgeable about this JFK assassination stuff able to confirm some of the more coincidental/outlandish theories they're presenting? Particularly their main thesis, that Oswald didn't pull the trigger on JFK, but that he was involved in the assassination plot with the CIA and was set up as a patsy.

Also here's a link for anyone interested, it's very good: http://shoutengine.com/DeathIsJustAroundtheCornerIs there such a thing? I listened to the latest intercepted about Reality Winner, and I cant think of any good reasons for classified information existing as a category.  It seems to me that classified info covers over outright evil imperial actions abroad, or outright evil activity of the government domestically. The only reason to keep these things secret is because they're bad things that people won't like, and for good reason.

I would genuinely like to know if anyone on here has a defense for classified information, maybe I'm missing something. I cant think of any reason why, in a so called democratic society, the people should be kept in the dark as to the activities of a government that is elected by the supposed will of the people. Asking for a friend? I mentioned it offhand a while ago, told her she wouldn't like it. I saw her for the first time in a while today and she told me she listened to a few episodes.

her thesis: chapo is "funny as fuck" but also she "wants to take a shower after listening"; apparently the Chapo crew are too apocalyptic for her taste, not willing to see the good things happening in the world.

Providing justice to those unfairly criminalized because of draconian drug laws is unquestionably a good thing.

But at a macro level, we know this won't actually lead to any wholesale change, and we can look at this as what it really is - Trump, once again rewarding those who are wealthy and/or support him.

That said, he is providing precedent for the next Democratic president to grant a more sweeping reform and pardon everyone with similar circumstances as Ms. Johnson (which probably won't happen if it's some centrist Democrat.)Rupert Murdoch.This maybe betrays my comfortable circumstances, but if my home is broken into and a significant amount of stuff stolen or damaged, I'll call the cops in order to get the police report necessary for an insurance claim. Otherwise, I can't think of any situation where it makes sense to call the cops _directly_ -- other sorts of calls would be emergency situations that would go through a 911 dispatcher. So really, the question is: when would you call 911?

Obviously if somebody is experiencing a medical emergency, and you're confident it will be dispatched through to medical responders, there's no question. Somebody has an apparent heart attack in a public place, calling 911 is the obvious choice. What if somebody is in the midst of apparent severe mental health crisis? You don't want the cops responding &amp; putting people at risk; is there a way to handle the call to insure that EMS responds instead? I'm also pretty comfortable calling 911 -- which is essentially a call to the cops -- if a violent, mortal confrontation is going on. A serious knife fight, people shooting at each other, that sort of thing. Could anybody who thinks this is wrong articulate why &amp; what I oughta do instead?Most people joined twitter for the celebs, every other attempt to make a new twitter has failed since celebs don't use those. Banning racist shitheads isn't going to tank twitter.Just admit you like your blood-soaked global empire because colonized people look bad and make loud noises and it's fun to think about working them to death by pointing your gun at them and herding them into concentration camps!

Also, please recognize that if you're posting here there's a 99% chance you're a millenial or a gen Z kid who hasn't gone more than a day without constant access to Third World surplus value. Don't pretend your candy asses are on the cusp of starting a revolution and living in the mountains for years fighting the u.$. military like the fucking Viet Cong. Grow uphttps://twitter.com/katiepavlich/status/1004416379339100161Y'all are dumb.Why the fuck doesn't Adam Curtis and the BBC just release his documentaries in a box set already? Fucking Hell!For starters, let me just say that I'm a dual citizen of a European country, specifically one that's avoided most of the far right nationalist bullshit. 

I really think it might be best for me to leave this country in the next couple years. I've grown less confident the Dems can defeat Trump in 2020, considering their lack of a message. Even without Trump, it seems the arc of the US is tending towards displays of shocking cruelty and repression, not towards justice. I know as a white guy I've not seen those displays minorities have always gone through, but I just imagine things getting worse and worse. 

It seems like every week brings more news about government sponsored racism, or a disgusting use of imperial power. I just want to live in a nice and small European country and have a far better ability to fight, instead of the monumental task of fighting 200 plus years of US culture and the worlds most powerful empire. I know that staying and fighting is far more courageous, but this whole disgusting society seems intent on drowning us as time goes on, and I just don't think I can deal.

EDIT: I should just admit the country is Ireland.Fuck fuck fuck these polls are killing melife is fucking suffering, I don’t wanna do this shit anymore.

guess I’m gonna go stress eat a pound of chicken wings and get drunk as fuck and hope that helps.Stuff like "U/ACC" or cavetwitter or the CCRU in general. Do you think it these aesthetics and ideas will be the future of 21st century political philosophy or just an interesting side note of the increasing atomization of fringe thought in response to late capitalist alienation? I know it's often being made fun of on here, but can anyone make a serious case for it? In the realm of getting properly informed what are those long term reliables, those hot takes and those that should be avoided like the plague? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA JFC.**CA**

Do you think the bunkers would have worked?People are so soft against militarism, there's a theory that if people had a risk of going to war themselves they'd be a little more up in arms about militarism.

Personally I have supported it for about 6 or 7 years. Hello, Chapo hello. I nominate Ted Berrigan to be our poet laureate. He died Disclaimer for DIA (fuck you) and the FBI (doubly fuck you), this is uh, 'satire' and i guess don't do this?


All you need is a National Guard armory lock-up (because you aren't getting onto an active duty post unless you have an ID), and a pair of bolt cutters.  Big ones.

Military vehicles don't have keys unless they're a [CUCV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Utility_Cargo_Vehicle), and those are mostly gone so I wouldn't worry about one.  Besides, why would you want to steal a Chevy truck when you can do that on any street in america?  Instead, in lock ups trucks are kept """"secure"""" by the use of a metal wire attached to the firewall that's threaded through the steering wheel and closed with a lock, or if they're an uparmored humvee they also have padlocks on the doors in addition to the wire-through-the-steering-wheel method.

But you don't want a humvee.  They're great trucks, yeah, but they aren't rampage trucks.  You could go with an [MTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Medium_Tactical_Vehicles), they're decently speedy, eye-catching and you can find uparmored ones in National Guard lock ups, but they're really top-heavy and have a tendency to flip.  You could grab a [5-ton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M939_series_5-ton_6x6_truck), they're pretty unstoppable and have a run-flat system that actually works (on most of them), but they're slower than old people fuck.  

What you really want, though, is a [HEMTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Expanded_Mobility_Tactical_Truck).  A HEMTT is big.  It's surprisingly maneuverable, it's surprisingly fast and it uses a giant two-stroke engine so it screams like a banshee.  Is there a roadblock?  Drive over it.  Is there a fence?  Not any more.  A wall?  Gone.  Do you have to ford a stream for whatever reason?  The air intake and exhaust is above your head and it has 8-wheel drive, so if the current isn't too strong you'll (probably) make it.  They're also heavy enough and have enough ass to bully any lightly armored vehicle the police might have, including an M113.

All military vehicles are automatics save for a few semis that are mostly out of the inventory at this point, so if you can drive a car, you can drive a truck.  All of these trucks also have air brakes, so you'll probably have to idle for a bit to raise enough air pressure to release the brakes.  They don't have radios, so if you want tunes you'll have to make other arrangements.

Unfortunately, for the most part getting your hands on an M113 or MRAP or a HET or an Abrams (for you extremely motivated people) is going to be out of the question.  Those are (usually) kept on real army bases for a reason, and you won't be getting on an active duty base.  Sometimes, however, you might find an M113 or an MRAP in a lock up as well, in which case the above satirical advice is useful.  Stay away from International MRAPs, they're really shitty.It’s too surreal to handle seeing this woman naked shilling for camster.com or some shit while also suing the president honestlyfor fuck's sake these guys don't even understand economics. why the fuck do I know more about economics than libertariasns.

It's what drives people toward a sort of libertarian or even reactionary ideology. 

Or maybe it's just how they justify that ideology while fully believing in it.

But it is what makes people like Harris (with episodes like "forbidden knowledge") and Peterson ("hard truths about IQ") and others so popular. 

And socialism, well, when it's not downright murderous, it's too good to be true. It's pie in the sky. It's ponies for everyone.

My grandma just told me she fucked Joe Hill.You wanna support dictatorships and proto-fascism, fine, but then your life should be exactly what you think others' should be, a boot stamping down on your face forever.they drippin all over my motherfuckin clothesFor those of you who don't know, yesterday Judge Aaron Persky, the judge in the Brock Turner rape trial, was recalled, making him the first judge to be recalled in California since the 30s.

Combined with most of the reformist DAs losing yesterday, this made me think that criminal justice reform in the US is way further in the future than I previously thought. [Here's](https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/brock-turner-michele-dauber/?section=politics&amp;ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000016) a pretty good article about the recall, and while the Persky supporters seem to mostly be the judiciary circling the wagons, the anti-Persky people don't seem great either, especially this quote from Dauber, the leader of the recall "Dauber believes that in some essential way, Persky misunderstands his role. “I think he sees himself almost like a social worker, you know?” she says. “Like his job is to rehabilitate these people. Rehabilitation is an important goal of punishment, but I don’t think that what he’s doing is the right way. Because without accountability and consequences, I think your chances for rehabilitation, particularly for sex offenses, is lower. I think there has to be both.”" This seems like a recipe for judges just throwing the book at defendants, especially since Dauber says Persky should have refused plea bargains negotiated by prosecutors if they were too lenient.

To me this is especially bad because the article says that Persky was elected as a reformist who would try to avoid prison sentences except when necessary. I doubt that a replacement chosen on the basis that he would seek heavy punishments for crimes against women would be more lenient on other offenses.

To me it seems pretty worrying that Dems seem to be focusing on more punitive sentencing for sex crimes as their main justice reform rather than ending mass incarceration.

Idk let me know what you guys think. I just worry that we'll see more cases like this if guys like Krasner begin to face more scrutiny for not giving people long sentences in sympathetic cases.&gt;Things only devolved from there. PL–RYM arguments degenerated into PL chanting “Mao! Mao! Mao Zedong!” with RYM trying to drown them out with “Ho! Ho! Ho Chi Minh!” (some New York wags responded to the cacophony with their own chants of “Go Mets!”). By this time, it was clear that each group had alienated all but its most die-hard supporters. Each side withdrew to caucus. When RYM returned to the stage, they announced, without the pretense of a convention-wide vote, that PL was expelled from SDS. The next day, there were two SDSes.The liberal nightmare: Ten people own the world, and some of them are RUSSIAN. I have come to the sobering realization that everyone is a moron. Nuance and reason have no place in current day politics. Everything is entirely based on feels and conservative moralizing. 

I am done talking about this because I have lost too many brain cells discussing it. I get no return out of it and all I end up is miserable. Americans are fundamentally brainwashed and incapable of reasoning outside of their own bubble.

Humanity was a mistake. Goodbye.Things will only get worse for you in the factory there if you continue to pump out products of such shoddy workmanship. I truly empathize with your plight, and am sorry there are no earned income tax credits or apprenticeship programs for your age bracket in your country. Please make your voice available in your local government to bring about such needed change. You'll be fine.

Chapo lifting thread let's go!I saw a trending sub called /r/wasphating and I got super excited because I thought it was a sub shitting on white anglo saxon protestants...

it turned out to be about insects  :(North Korea has the pee tape and they used it to blackmail Trump into forcing the NFL to burn a big pile of flags at the start of every football game. And I mean a big pile too. Most of them are ~20 feet tall and ~60 feet wide. Plus they are on the field too, so the players have to play around this  big fucking burned patch all game. And the thing is that a pile of flags that big didn't burn all that well so the people who went to the games just sat there for three hours, national anthem playing and watching a bunch of flags burning(no one is allowed to leave until the fire stops). I actually went to a Vikings game last night before I came back and I shit you not at least 500 people up on the top rows died from carbon monoxide poisoning, but the paramedics weren't allowed to go get them, as working while you are supposed to be supporting the flag is unpatriotic. 

Anyway, you all need to stop kinkshaming Trump or tens of thousands of proud patriots will die from flag burning cancer when they breath in all the smoke at the games. It's all your fault now. No take backs.Ontario Grey Wolves, don't forget to vote today.

And you don't need much in the way of ID to vote, they'll accept almost anything with your addressSo a while ago I posted here about my friend who sides with Shapiro on abortion. https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/8ktyjc/are_their_any_rebuttals_to_shapiros_stance_on/

I finally gave my rebuttal and thanks to all of you and a little bit of research I tried to go into what his position implies and what he would have to support to do it. 

First, there is a matter of privacy. Griswold vs Connecticut established that woman have a right to privacy regarding reproductive choices with their doctor. To overturn Roe you would have to overturn Griswold as well. Since this is a matter of healthcare, the state would have to be involved in making these choices, this goes against even Shapiro's big-government rhetoric. 

Doesn't Shapiro believe anyone has a right to healthcare but wants the government making decisions? If this is about making sure people are responsible for their actions, what is to be done with the men? All of this abortion talk centers around women, but, how are you gonna have the state hold men responsible? Garnish their wages? Inspections? Tracking how much time you spend planning for the child? I know you and Shapiro talk about feminist not wanting to have equal responsibilities but we need to know how are you gonna keep men attached to this child. After all, those single mothers need a man to keep that child from becoming a nuisance later on. 

So if the government can do this, why not provide single-payer? 

His response: Now you are going offtopic. 

No, like I said, to do what you want to do we have to overturn a lot of legal presidents and that gives your opponent the opportunity to call you out. That is how rule of law works. There are consequences to your actions.  

For Roe, you would have to overturn both the doctor and the woman's right to privacy. 

Him: Well that shouldn't exist in this case. 

Well, that is the thing, why stop here? If we have male birth control pills out there do you think you are gonna have an easy time getting it? I as the state now have an interest in YOUR reproductive health now. 

Him: I don't have to take it. 

True, but now any reproductive matter is an issue to the state. Yours too. What if we have an overpopulation problem in the future? The state can come in and enforce you not to have kids. 

This is how our justice system operates, the precedent you set has a ripple effect. That is the rule of law. 

His response: But you have to live with the consequences of your actions. 

I responded in Farsi this time. Well then, please leave my country. You would be better off in Iran.

He is actually Chilean. Just spent twenty minutes reading comments on a local news page about the release of bodycam footage of the man beaten by the pigs in Mesa the other day.

Suburban wine moms everywhere, claiming that *they* have never disobeyed an officer, and *they* have never had any problems with officers as a result!

But criticisms of liberals on this subreddit seem to equate liberals with centrist and conservative ideology. Why is there this discrepancy, and what does liberal mean to the people in this subreddit?Your text post (optional)The Age of Tech Superheroes Must End DOW JONES &amp; COMPANY, INC. 9:03 AM ET 6/7/2018 Whether it's Theranos Chief Executive Elizabeth Holmes or ousted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, or the heads of currently troubled public companies like Evan Spiegel of Snap and Elon Musk of Tesla, powerful founder-CEOs who were once lauded for flouting convention are facing a new reality: They aren't superheroes, after all.

Treating them as if they were has been bad for their companies and investors alike.

It's understandable how we got here -- the genius tech founder mythology has its roots in the pantheon of real- world demigods widely credited with revolutionizing industry, from Thomas Edison and Gordon Moore to Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos. Investors and experts in corporate governance say the problem is that building corporations and stock-market valuations on the notion that every tech CEO is potentially building another Apple is ridiculous and counterproductive.

"If your only argument is Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos, you don't have an argument -- you have a couple of exceptions," says Paul Kedrosky, a partner at early-stage investment firm SK Ventures.

The worship of founder-CEOs is at its apex right now for two related reasons. First, there's the explosion in capital channeled into venture-backed startups. All that money chasing only so many hot startups means founders have more leverage than ever, and they are finding ways to control their companies no matter what, effectively making themselves dictator for life.

"You could argue there's never been a moment in history where a private-company founder has more power," says Adam Epstein, an adviser on corporate governance to CEOs and their boards.

Even when these companies go public, some of their founders remain omnipotent. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg controls Facebook Inc. because his shares allow him more votes on all corporate matters than everyone else's combined. The same is true of Alphabet Inc. co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Even companies without such monster revenue, such as Snap Inc.(SNAP) and Blue Apron Holdings Inc., grant their founders nearly absolute power.

Despite the risk to shareholders, who are relatively powerless if management falters or markets turn, it seems everybody wants a piece of the superhero myth. The market is currently witnessing a run-up in the value of publicly traded tech companies the likes of which hasn't been seen since the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.

Many athletes believe in a "Sports Illustrated cover jinx" -- a superstition that those who appear on it are destined to experience bad luck. CEOs may be subject to their own jinx. According to a 2008 study posted to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the firms of CEOs recognized for their supposed genius see a subsequent drop in performance, possibly because their leaders become distracted by efforts to burnish their images with books, speaking gigs, Twitter jags and the like.

Treating CEOs as if they were born on the planet Krypton also leads to, among other things, their being paid too much money and granted too much power.

This isn't just about giving CEOs more credit than they are due -- it also has direct consequences for how they wield influence in their own companies. In a typical firm, whether public or private, the CEO serves at the pleasure of the board of directors, which is elected by the firm's investors. In theory, shareholders are granted power according to how much of the company they own, and they can hire and fire the CEO at will. In practice, boards can be packed with friends of the CEO, especially when that person is also an equity-holding founder.

Power is solidified when the founders persuade investors to grant them superhuman privileges of corporate rule:

-- At Tesla Inc.(TSLA), a provision in the company's bylaws means any change to the board must be approved by a supermajority of shareholders. This effectively gives Mr. Musk, with 22% of shares, control of the company.

-- At Uber Technologies Inc., Mr. Kalanick negotiated in 2016 to add three board seats that he controlled, which led to a lawsuit by one of Uber's biggest investors. Uber has since moved to a one-share, one-vote governance structure, according to a spokesman, and the board has grown to 17 seats from 11.

-- At Theranos Inc., Ms. Holmes held shares that granted her 100 votes to every one held by other investors, giving her unchecked power.

-- At Stripe Inc., investors offered its co-founders supervoting shares -- which typically come with 10 votes per share -- as an incentive to take the company public.

-- At WeWork Cos., co-founder and CEO Adam Neumann has 65% voting control and sits on his own compensation committee.

-- At Snap, publicly traded shares grant no votes at all, so as not to impinge on the prerogative of Mr. Spiegel.

-- In the past year, Spotify Inc. and Blue Apron also went public with ways of guaranteeing shareholders couldn't check the power of their chief executives.

Among these companies and their precursors, there are examples of smart founders who were able to use their power to help their companies grow sustainably. But they tend to be the exceptions that prove the rule. "Once a trend starts, then all founders want it, but I can count on three fingers the founders that should be in complete control of their companies with no governance or oversight," says Sarah Cone, founder of venture capital firm Social Impact Capital.

Fortunately, the trend isn't really catching on outside of Silicon Valley. In 2017, just 14% of companies went public with permanently unequal voting structures, according to data from the Council of Institutional Investors.

There are legitimate reasons -- from the founder's, if not necessarily the investor's, perspective -- why founders would want more control. Many serial entrepreneurs have had the experience of being pushed out of a previous company or forced to sell earlier than they would have liked. And for decades leading up to the previous tech-stock bubble, says Mr. Kedrosky, VCs had much more power than founders and were not afraid to use it. Even first-time founders have heard these stories, he adds.

There are signs that uncritical veneration of tech founders is on the way out. There's Mr. Kalanick's ouster, the Theranos collapse, Facebook's scandals and Snap's poor performance.

At Tesla's annual shareholders meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Musk faced a vote to remove him as chairman of his own board and to replace three of his appointees to that board. While both measures failed, shareholders are suing Mr. Musk.

When investors once again see chief executives as mere mortals, who knows what might happen. Perhaps the good governance that has kept the largest firms chugging along decade after decade -- even as they keep pace with some of these upstarts -- could become trendy again.Fuck Doug Ford and vote for the NDP.

Idk much about this candidate and don't live in Maryland but he seems to have good ideas fwiwI'm sure many of us are missing her presence on the pod. Here's something to tide you over: 

https://thebaffler.com/your-sorry-ass/no-wokeness-no-worriesSo my job is to clean up theaters after people leave, and the number of times people will leave the theater while i’m standing there saying “have a good day” or some shit to them, while leaving their trash right there on the seat while looking at me is fucking huge. You literally saw me, you knew i would have to throw that shit out for ou, you’re about to leave, and the trash is RIGHT THERE AS YOU LEAVE. Unsurprisingly these are often the most bougee/ white people who do this, dont think ive ever seen a POC do this at least while i can see em. Srsly tho, if you do this, pick up your goddamn trash for solidarity. TERF isnt a slur. 
  
TERFs aren't oppressed.   
  
TERFs can be of any gender. 
  
TERFs are pieces of shit who should be excluded from any and all spaces
  
TERFs should also be given absolutely no quarter and shot into spaceIn _The Andy Griffith Show_, the town of Mayberry has two cops: the cool, competent Sheriff Taylor who refuses to carry a gun, and the excitable, cowardly Deputy Fife who is so jumpy that he is not allowed to keep his service revolver loaded and yet still manages to prematurely fire it in stressful situations.

American policing has decidedly settled on the model of Fife -- sans the precaution to keep his weapon unloaded.
As yet another reminder that giving firearms to police officers does not impart to them a corresponding bravery or levelheadedness, here is a recent headline I would have missed if I were not a member of some running discussion boards:

["Woman with Airsoft Gun Delays Rock’n’Roll Marathon After Bizarre Kidnapping,"](https://timesofsandiego.com/crime/2018/06/03/woman-with-airsoft-gun-delays-rocknroll-marathon-in-bizarre-kidnapping/) _Times of San Diego_ (3 June 2018)

Police responded to a distraught woman in a parking garage who was holding an airsoft gun to her head.
The first officer to arrive was so eager to kill the woman that he discharged his weapon early and shot himself in the leg.
Another officer successfully opened fire, but missed the subject who then threw her toy gun off the parking structure and was taken into custody.
(Despite the headline, other news agencies have reported that this incident was unrelated to an earlier kidnapping report.)

Unfortunately, well-armed cops literally shaking in fear as they confront with deadly force members of marginalized groups and emotionally exhausted individuals is standard operating procedure for American police.
Just last week four police officers, after receiving reports that she may be suicidal, performed a "wellness" check on Chelsea Manning by breaking into her apartment with guns and a taser drawn (she was not home, but The _Intercept_ has published a [security camera video of the incident](https://theintercept.com/2018/06/05/chelsea-manning-video-twitter-police-mental-health/)).
The homicidal response of American police to any sort of emergency is so well known that it is often weaponized by petty or political enemies as another recent headline reminds us:
"[The home of Parkland survivor David Hogg was swatted this morning](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/05/us/hogg-family-home-swatting-incident-trnd/index.html)".

Iconic, in my mind, of the sharp contrast between the armament amassed by police and their near total lack of courage and sympathy when faced with someone in need is the 2012 case of Milton Hall.
Accused of stealing a cup of coffee from a Michigan gas station, Hall (a 49-year-old homeless black man) drew a small Swiss Army type pocket knife to keep the responding police officers at bay.
Police immediately escalated the situation.
Dash cam and witness cellphone video show that eight police officers (including a K9 unit) formed a semi-circle around Hall. Six of the officers had firearms, both handguns and rifles, trained on Hall who was squatting in a defensive position with the small knife in his hand. At one point, the K9 handler backed up and Hall seemed to relax and took a step toward the police officers.
All six officers opened fire, discharging 46 rounds in a few seconds and killing Hall.
(I describe the death of Milton Hall and three other homeless men murdered by police in my essay ["When Police Kill the Homeless"](http://americancynic.net/log/2014/4/16/when_police_kill_the_homeless/).)

One indicator of the depth of the cowardice, barbarity, and impunity with which police kill is the shear number of family pets shot by police in America every year. 
Most police shootings in most departments involve dogs, but nobody keeps track of how many are killed by police nation wide.
The [Puppycide Database Project](https://puppycidedb.com/) has collected data on over 2,900 dogs shot by police so far.
In headline after headline the shootings are unprovoked, a function of police being armed, undisciplined, unaccountable, frightened, and predisposed to violence.
A 2014 article titled ["Can Police Stop Killing Dogs?"](http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2014/10/can-police-stop-killing-dogs.aspx) in _POLICE_ magazine quotes a Department of Justice specialist, in what I hope is an overly high estimate, that as many as "25 to 30 pet dogs are killed each day by law enforcement officers."
That's each _day_.

But one of the most infuriating behaviors of American police is the readiness with which so many officers arrive on a scene, heart pumping with fear, to quickly shoot an unarmed human suspect -- disproportionately so if the suspect is a racial minority.
In the case of [Tamir Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Tamir_Rice), a 12-year-old black kid who was innocuously playing with an airsoft gun at a park near his home, "quickly" meant less than two seconds after officers drove up to him.
But in cases of _actual_ danger, when people need protection from armed perpetrators, cops decked out in tactical gear too often become suddenly preoccupied with their own safety.

When I was a freshman in high school, a nearby school became the site a mass shooting.
The two perpetrators planted propane bombs in the cafeteria set to detonate during lunch -- when around 500 students would be in the room -- and then positioned themselves in their cars with semiautomatic weapons and shotguns to shoot fleeing survivors.
When the bombs failed to explode, the two improvised and became pioneers of the modern shooting rampage.
According to the [Columbine Review Commission report](https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/Columbine%20-%20Governor's%20Commission%20Report.pdf) (all parenthetical page numbers refer to this document), "six officers from the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office had arrived on the scene within minutes after the attack had begun" in addition to four Denver police officers (including three SWAT team members). (38)
As the killing spree continued inside the school for about 40 minutes before the shooters committed suicide, the police outside the school -- with their superior and growing numbers, firepower, armor, radios, and training -- did almost nothing to intervene or put themselves in danger.

At one point early in the shooting, the Denver SWAT members on scene witnessed one of the shooters stick the barrel of his gun out a door and fire several rounds.
"Two of the Denver officers fired at the doorway, but it is not known why the Denver officers, who were fully equipped with high-powered weaponry and body armor, took no further action." (33, note 80)

Even after receiving a description of the shooters, and while unarmed students and teachers did what they could to rescue each other, the armed police continued in their cowardice.
"It was reported that at least one student who had managed to escape from the school (and who had carried out a fellow student with him) told the police outside the school that there were only two gunmen and urged that the police go in after them to prevent further killing. But instead of entering the school, the police first began to set up a security perimeter around the school so that the gunmen could not escape." (60, note 152)

The worst of the carnage took place in the library about fifteen minutes into the shooting, where for almost _eight minutes_ dispatchers knew where the killers were and police continued to safely tend to their security perimeter outside.
"At that point, Patti Nielson dropped the telephone — leaving the line open — and sought refuge under a desk. Dispatchers could hear the ensuing carnage as the perpetrators in a seven-and-one-half minute killing spree taunted and executed nine more students, while sparing others." (30)

In fact, no attempt to enter the school was made by police until 12:06pm, about the same time the shooting ended.
That initial entry resulted in two staff members being escorted safely from the school.
A second attempt by SWAT to enter the school, this time near the library where the perpetrators were already dead, did not go as smoothly.
As officers approached the door they were spooked by a reflection of themselves in a window, which they shot before retreating (in order to "reassess the situation"). (43, note 103)

Police did not enter again until an hour after the shooting had ended.
"Regrettably, wounded students remained in the library awaiting rescue during the period of time police had postponed entering the school’s west side." (44)
As victims bled to death in the school, SWAT teams moved very slowly and cautiously through the hallways.
"The sheriff’s report implied that the officers faced too many unknown hazards for them to move more quickly, but in an interview with a law enforcement trade journal, Williams later stated that the officers 'went in with superior weapons. We had HK MP5's (automatic sub-machine guns), assault rifles, gas guns, shotguns, as well as sidearms. We entered with Army helmets with Kevlar, ballistic tactical jackets with steel plates in the front and ballistic shields.' Despite such weaponry and armor, the record reflected that a burned carpet, spent and unlit ordnance, unfired bullets and broken glass had deterred officers from conducting a swifter search". (53, note 132)

It took an hour and a half for police to reach the science room where students and teachers were performing first aid on victims -- whom the police commenced to rough up.
"Teacher Alan Cram characterized the SWAT officers as 'very abusive;' they would not listen to him as he tried to tell them" the whereabouts of a wounded teacher. (53)
It took police over three hours after the shooting stopped to make it to the library where most of the victims were.
In the Columbine episode of the television series _Zero Hour_, Randy Brown, the father of one of the students who knew the shooters, described the scene outside the library as he understood it:

&gt; One of the things the police don't want you to know about that day is that on April 20th, while the executions are taking place, while these innocent children are being murdered in the library, the outside library door is propped open. And the policemen that are standing by their cars on the lawn outside are listening to these children being murdered. And they listen, and they listen, and they never rescue them. And they let them be murdered.

Yet it took less than two seconds to shoot and mortally wound Tamir Rice for playing with a toy gun.

I don't mean to imply that cowardice or violence should be at the root of a criticism of policing in general, but the inverse relationship that seems to hold between the degree to which police are armed and the heroics of their actions is a tragic phenomenon which goes along with the transparency of American police in fulfilling their class roles.

fuck the fucking fuckers.Fuck, this isn’t google I've been  wondering this for a good minute. the tankies, s/o cuttlefish, remark about how the chapo 'fandom'(?) being named after a neo\-fascist  transnational death squad is actually a veiled celebration of fascism.

Cuz, even with declassified, msm reported info, this shit is bananasOn the one hand, being a podcast fan is an empowering and good hobby but people enjoying cumtown is problematic. Having infinite ironic racism at his fingertips, it creates the illusion that the chinese people he sees are also jewish, and then that they talk like Bill Cosby too. That they exist to serve him. Make him laugh. He thinks of them as jokes but emulates to them anyway, during this release his brain can’t differentiate imagination from reality. Make no mistake, he doesn’t log on to /r/cumtown to watch humans make love to their dads, but to watch a POC be exploited. He’ll need to hear racist and racister content as the years go on until regular multi-layered jokes with real disabled australian men are no longer stimulating. I’m not saying we make /r/cumtown usage illegal altogether but they should tagged with flair immediately if they post there. These guys shouldn’t be able to comment, post, or vote on these things either. The entire industry should be run by leftists, for leftists. We don’t need "irony", there are plenty of strap-ons and women with penises.

Without cumtown posts to read, more men will just masturbate to fantasies they create in their mind of chinese people they know in real life. This is even worse than just reading said posts. Chinese jewish POCs are aware that their image will be characterized and accept that but when a man laughs at our depression threads he without comrade's consents, that is telepathic rape. It’s sick. It even our own praxis although we may be unaware but it lowers us to being CHUDSi think he's gonna take a longbow/crossbow to school and shoot people bella chow bella chow bella chow chow chow

Trump has shown how much shit can be done without congress. For the past month or so my boss has been trying to get me to come work on Saturdays. The reason being is that both bosses are so fucking lazy and keep work so understaffed that they cover the desk while the usual Saturday employee can go to lunch for 30 mins. Of course instead of just showing tf up for your shift to cover for your employee, they instead make an employee working at the other store go cover instead while I'm supposed to cover them at the 2nd store.

With that being the dumbest idea I've ever heard I keep telling them no. Then I get some boss whining about "how hard their life is" and shit like that but, they're the only ones at the job with consistent scheduling and live in big fucking houses and go on trips to Europe every year while their employees get shit and never have consistent scheduling.

All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.

Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?

Two things result from this fact:

I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.

II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself.

To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.I don't know that much on the topic.

Wow so inspiring.So, as many of you are probably aware Valve essentially abdicated all responsibility for their storefront today. However, I'm not here to talk about that I'm here to discuss how Valve expertly weaponized rhetoric to divide their consumers and try to deflect backlash.

So the statement can be found on Valve's site but the relevant part is here:

\&gt; The challenge is that this problem is not simply about whether or not the Steam Store should contain games with adult or violent content. Instead, it's about whether the Store contains games within an entire range of controversial topics \- politics, sexuality, racism, gender, violence, identity, and so on. **In addition, there are controversial topics that are particular to games \- like what even constitutes a "game", or what level of quality is appropriate before something can be released.**

Emphasis mine.

What Erik Johnson is doing here is conflating two separate issues, "controversial games" like active shooter and huniepop into a false equivalence with the ongoing issue of asset flipping, broken games, and stolen games being sold on steam. This is, in my opinion, a laser targeted choice to hit a fracture point in the wider gaming community. I do not believe it was accidental that an issue that would be broadly labeled as "muh free speech" was conflated with "Valve should exercise basic quality control."

The worst part is it's worked. I've seen on reddit and twitter where people who were advocating the position of "Valve should have basic quality control this is abdicating that responsibility," or perhaps adding in "also selling genocide simulators probably is a bad business decision," get hit back with a chorus of screeching redhats yelling incoherently about free speech.

Now, here's what's disturbing to me. Nobody seems to be discussing this aspect of the controversy. I haven't seen anyone talk about the fact that Valve very clearly weaponized rhetoric to divide their customer base in an attempt to deflect criticism. I don't have much more than that which I admit is basically "Woooooow, look at how this company played us all for fools." However, I just want to start discussing it because I think it matters and it's important.

Edit: [I was told I should add some context. So here's a video by a rather rant\-y British chap named Jim that sums it up.](https://youtu.be/V2caCVUWy0c)Where does the dick go?We see a lot of people insist they aren't racist but only hate cultures such as Arab or African ones.

I was moved by this gesture. She has closed new requests for now, but she seems willing to continue at a later date. 

There is some light in Hellworld, folks.Capitalism has turned me into a nihilist and I fucking hate it. I just spent 75000 on a degree which I can only use to fuck poor people and workers over if I want to pay my debt back. I wake up everyday and all people talk about is fucking money. It's all I ever think about too. Everyone around me is unhappy and stressed out and working meaningless soul sucking jobs. 

I'm honestly at the point where I'm personally banking on the entire system crumbling so we can build this shit from scratch. I really can't see myself being happy any other way. 

So my question is, how many more years do you think we have left till we reach a tipping point? Not trying to start anything, just curious if this is just me or not. I don't know why but a few months ago I just got really fucking tired of the dry boys and co. I unfollowed all of them on Twitter, they'd become more annoying than anything. I didn't stop listening to the show though, and not because they're less annoying in audio form.

To be clear, I feel mostly the same about the Magickal Anarcho\-Maoist podcast where one the two hosts either knowingly or (more likely) unknowingly spreads easily disprovable propaganda about long\-failed and dying Maoist insurgent movements in rapidly developing nations. So please don't think this is one of those "The Chapo's are libs" posts or whatever.

Defending billionaires is cuck behavior.  That should be obvious by Chud ideology itself.  Think about it, according to Red Pill chud bullshit, who's the most alpha archetype of all time?  It's not a businessman, it's a warrior king.  A warrior king doesn't respect other men who have more money, he kills them and takes it.  Then he fucks all the women, right?  This is like, the alpha dude fantasy of being the most strongest man?  Manly men dudes?

Shouldn't beheading the rich with guillotines and taking their shit be the alpha objective then?  It's alpha as fuck.  Killing people and taking shit is the opposite of cuck.  Being a little beta baby and saying "ooh, that man over there with a big house and yachts and beautiful women? He deserves it, and I deserve to have less than him :-)" is completely cucked.  You aren't a man if you think that way.  You're a scared little baby who's not alpha enough to murder and take what's his.

Right?  Am I crazy that right wingers don't see this blatant contradiction in their own thought?  It's like they're just pretend alpha, but really want their superhero fantasy billionaire to fall into the arms of when shit's rough, like some Elon Musk/Tony Stark superhero bullshit.np.reddit.com/r/politics/duplicates/8q2sz7/trump_tries_to_destroy_the_west/Where my gamers at and are you gonna be watching when Todd "Tovarisch Lenin" Howard brings us space Communism?A Robert Altman/Garry Trudeau miniseries for HBO.

So we are clear, Trump wants to deepen neoliberalism and predatory capitalism in North Korea, which in the long run will lead to an uprising and likely civil war as Kim Jong-whoever gets a coup in his face for allowing foreign capitalists in the country.https://mobile.twitter.com/RubinReport/status/1006557111323590656A spectwe is haunting Euwope – the spectwe of communyism.

Everywhere I go, everything I do, every system I use or activate, it's all being recorded and sent up the pipe to... who? I don't even fucking know. Subaru? Some contractor that Subaru farmed the job out too?

It's fucking everywhere. My car, my phone, the OS on my computers, there's fucking traffic cameras everywhere, every cop car has fucking license plate readers, the fuzz have cell-phone intercept equipment. 

You're never alone. You're never hidden from the scouring eyes of marketing ghouls and government spooks and who the fuck knows who else. Everything you do is being watched and tabulated by cold electronic eyes, piling up endless reams of data in that will lie like a coiled viper in some database until someone decides that *your* ethnic group or religion or tendency needs to be genocided, and then they'll be able to send a smart-drone to kill you because your fucking underwear have GPS systems in them or some bullshit.

IT IS FREAKING ME OUT. 

I can't get over how utterly blase everyone is about this. Back when I was a kid we were taught that the Statsi and the KGB were evil and bad because they spied on everyone and no one had any privacy and that's why there was no democracy in the Combloc but like now it's so much more invasive than anything in history, so fine grained, so real time. Marketing firms know more about you then you know about you. 

I mean jesus fucking christ. jesus christ. 

Yeah,I have paranoia. I do. it's not really bad, like it doesn't keep me from functioning or anything, but I'm fucking *worried* about this shit and it doesn't help at all that this isn't government mind control devices in my fillings, this is normal boring banal everyday shit that everyone knows about and no one fucking cares.

I'm having a Riverwest Stein while at a meet and greet with one of the 69 candidates for the WI governerMeanwhile those two plus Comcast and Verizon say they wont have paid prioritization yet, probably cause they're waiting for the legal battle.About 6-7 years ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in but Noam himself.

I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he read a magazine and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother the Chomp, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Noam put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.Fuq. More stupid ass funding wastes here we go!Keep up the good work.[Holy shit y'all](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/perfect-pressure-cooker-rice-featured.jpg)I know you don't pay your character actors and princesses good money. Why is your Snow White only available until 5pm? Why cant you rotate between multiple Snow Whites at least? Why is she at Epcot at the German pavilion and not in Fantasyland with the Snow White ride?

Also, talk to me like an adult. When the heat index is 115° and I've been waiting in place for my kids for 45 minutes, and Princess Jasmine abruptly just walks away to take a piss, don't tell me she is going off to yell at Abu for stealing cookies. I know she's not the real Jasmine. Mine and 99% of other people's kids know she's not the real Jasmine. You're not keeping the magic alive. There's nothing magical about $12 chicken nuggets and no free refills.

As both a political junky and a huge fan of music, I always love it when those two things intersect. With that in mind, let's do a political music discussion. Post some of your favourite political bands, albums, songs, whatever. I'll start with a few classic albums:

**EDIT:** YouTube videos or playlist links to albums added, Wide Awake! by Parquet Courts and The Underside of Power by Algiers have Spotify linksI’m tired of this fucking shit. I’m a father, I’m a revolutionary, and I’m a Jacobin. Those are three people you don’t want to piss off, alright? I’m tired of sans-culotte getting attacked in the streets. I’m tired of them sleeping in the fucking streets. I’m tired of seeing the very people that I swore to defend get attacked by the Muscadins. So like I said out there: y’all need to close your fucking beaks, and start moving your feet, and get shit done. Take the guillotine and chop off the heads of people who don't need them, alright? Seriously—the fuck is wrong with y’all?

Who the fuck are y’all to justify letting Girondins live in the streets with your policies and your laws and your legislation. How do you justify that? Sparing Thermidoreans. I swore to give their lives to defend the bourgeoisie from all forms of oppression. Eventually this shit is gonna stop. Because when it’s our turn, we won’t “make excuses for the terror.” Robespierre.We saw this in Syria previously.wanna see the guys playing all the best games and sharing the dankest memes.

Seriously I want to watch Matt get pissed at Assassins Creed and it's bad history.don't @ meIs Batman a neocon or a lib? Discuss.The worst possible timeline confirmed if this happens.

What do? we need to start radicalizing the 8-16 demographic. suggestions?Doing research or something totally normalI wanna know how we can get to socialism. Can't just piss about the wrongs of our enemy without offering alternatives. Bernie's idea is employee ownership, which some socialists here think doesn't go far enough cause it still keeps market economics. Rojava seems to have whole industries owned by communities and I want more details on how it works.I still do, but I used to, tooListening to the latest episode and thinking about neocon Davros getting stuck in elevatorshttps://signal.org/

It's not perfect and it may have been pwned by the security forces, but it's something. 

Organize. Learn about Opsec and then apply as much as you can. The righteous indignation while remaining ignorant is so much more fucking annoying than just being ignorantthey’ve kinda veered into “making good political points in favor of doing actual humor” type comedy a bit (Español abajo)

Ven a pasar este Dia de los Padres exigiendo que el gobierno para su política cruel, injusta y racista de arrancarles a los niños de sus padres en la frontera y en las comunidades alrededor del país.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And here's a personal bit; My family are immigrants. We came here from Ireland near on a hundred and fifty years ago. We were treated like shit; press ganged in to the civil war, made to live in the most squalid parts of cities like Chicago and New York and Boston, banned from work, treated with suspicion well on in to the 20th on account of being Catholic, and so forth. But we made it.

And now here we are, in the 21st century, and there are all these people, immigrants, their kids, being treated like animals, being treated in a way that isn't right to treat any human. And I won't stand for it. These people are our neighbors. They live in our cities and towns, they work along side us, they pay their taxes at least as often as anyone else even though they don't get much benefit from it. Hell, a lot of them serve in the military, and the thanks they get is a deportation order.

That ain't right. That ain't just, nor is it American, and it's certainly not the Christian thing to do if you lean that way.

We can stop this. We've gotta stop this, because at the end of the day there isn't anyone else. Things'll just get worse from here. Let me quote Niemoller;

First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for &gt;me.

Well right now they're coming for, and they're getting, the Latinos. And they're gunning for the Muslims, too. And pretty soon it'll be everyone else; Democrats, obviously, but anyone they don't like, or decide it'd be convenient not to like. We've seen this all before in Germany, sure, but in a lot of other places, too. It's an old, dog eared play book.

You gotta stand up, folks. You gotta say "No more. Not here. Not while I'm alive". These are exciting times. Important times. Historical times. We can't just wait for 2018, or 2020, or some other distant election where maybe we'll get saved somehow. We gotta stand up and do the work. Stand outside their offices and yell until the windows break from the noise of it. Throw ourselves in front of the buses. Make it so they can't get any peace as long as they continue to set their hands to evil work. If we, you and me and everyone, if we don't do it there is no one else. That's what resistance means. It's not posting on the internet or making fun of Trump. It's going out in the street. It's getting messy. It's getting arrested and god help us sometimes it's getting killed. And it's on us, unless in twenty years we want to be those sorry folks in the documentaries saying "We didn't know, what could we have done?"


REMEMBER: IRL shitposting karma is the best karma. The hyperinflation and migration crisis is horrific in the country at the moment and frankly the gains of the Bolivarian Revolution are either in the process of being totally wiped out or have already been destroyed by the economic crisis.

Given this, what policies could stem off the rising tide of run away inflation? Is there a political alternative to Maduro who isn’t a right wing neoliberal? It seems like he has no political legitimacy rather than to just act like knock off Chavez without the political savvy to change course when certain actions don’t work. 

prove me wrong

20 minutes is not a fucking album, it’s barely even an EP. stop it you lazy asshole.give me some stats, chapoIf there's a common them for Gamer Reactionaries post-E3, it's that they think everything that even has the possibility of non-straight relationships is "LGBT Propaganda", they fucking love that term now. "Diversity" seems to be their new rallying cry, they literally can't stand seeing people in game who aren't White Men. But I think there might be more to this, on Twitter they're basically all shitting themselves over Assassin's Creed Odyssey because everyone was extremely Bi in ancient Greece. How long before they're basically just Evangelicals? Can they be Evangelicals while still being militant Atheists? They hate god just as much as they hate LGBTQ people and POC and women. I like Felix Biederman. I like his writing and I especially like his podcast. That's why I subscribe here. I'm curious what happened to this sub to get so overrun with people who hate Felix Biederman. As of right now, the top post on this sub is an inflammatory quote Felix made, with the question, "How does anyone take this guy seriously?" Why are there so many Felix Biederman haters here that a post like that gets upvoted to the top?

It's fine not to like Felix Biederman. If someone wants to start r/FelixBiedermanHate I say go for it. But shouldn't this sub be primarily for people who admire Felix's work? In other subs, if you post something whose sole purpose is to criticize the subject of the sub, the mods will remove your post. (For a noncontroversial example, I subscribe to the subs of a couple TV shows I like, and those subs will remove a post that says something like, "This show sucks.") Should the mods here do something similar?https://youtu.be/hOoOb1vGgx0#Good or bad right now?

Gulen|TraitorI think he's more emblematic of the typical liberal than we might think. For whatever reason, the Clintons command and demand loyalty, even more than Obama in some cases cause it approaches a cult. Obama makes more sense; first black president, pristine private life, pitch perfect first family, and the left grew under him than they did under Bush or Clinton in spite of his conservatism. I get it. But just like Clinton, Obama otherwise forces people to bow to them instead of Bernie, who's the actual moderate, the actual consensus choice, and the one who actually represents most Americans.

We mocked Daou for his slavish devotion to Hillary, then something happened, which coincided with ICE trying to set concentration camps, and suddenly the gloves come off just like with Chris Hayes. We had Gillibrand say Bill Clinton should have resigned over Lewinsky way back, and I said that was a sea change. It was the beginning of the end for the Clintons' influence if not their money and infrastructure.

I picked it up by accident from my library. I'm no expert but it was quite interesting learning about the characters behind the scenes who were so overshadowed by Stalin.


If you liked The Death of Stalin it's a great backstory on who these people were (and a corrective to the liberties the movie took with history).


The image of Molotov weeping when he was finally readmitted to the party in the 1980s is just adorable.reliably chuffed, sufficiently thick, this is the dick we need For example, liberals complaining about too migrant kids being put in a cage is right, but also the wrong take, because the problem is we're even using cages at all for people who've been eternally mauled by our terrible immigration policies. "Detain families together" under Obama is moderate next to Trump saying "detain children and separate them from their families," when we really should say "detaining people looking for a better life is bad."

Representation is vital for a diverse democracy, I cannot stress to you how huge it is for the psychological well being of communities like mine (Latino), but we don't have that. Fake diversity is choosing who will be your executioner, and it's how power stays that way.

For a tyrant to succeed in a system such as ours, that would mean our system is tyrannical in and of itself. No system that grants power to Donald Trump does it on accident. It means they think "this is our guy."

It's why piecemeal policies like those of Obama and Clinton will never truly be the way to progress the country. Instead, they're just there to clean up the mess left behind by Republicans, without actually changing anything because they also fundamentally agree with the system, just not in volume.

It's insidious, self perpetuating, and someone should make an anime about it. How do we change this? Honestly, Trump. "You wanna know how he got this power?" or "You heard about [this obscure legal decision by judges] that made this power possible?" After explaining to people how Trump rose through decades of dog whistles from the Southern Strategy under Nixon and Goldwater, Trump becomes much easier to predict.

Showing people Obama deported more immigrants in history and prosecuted whistleblowers more than anyone in history (until Trump) and did the same for drone strikes (until Trump), you start painting a picture they can't deny anymore. If they choose to do so, they're worthless to us but even just putting that seed helps drive the narrative to where it should be - systemic critiques of the system.

What we should do to replace that system is harder, cause social democracy is systemic reform, but not revolution. I can work with reformists for the revolution. Unions aren't as good as employee ownership, but you need unions for a strong grassroots movement. If the AFL-CIO and other unions decide to run their own Labor Democrats much like Justice Democrats do, then good, keep infiltrating. DSA's doing its own thing without really being a party, more a movement.

The left is stronger than it's ever been in my lifetime (1995; every president has won reelection since I was born), and it's our job to strengthen it.

EDIT: Yes I renamed this post cause people got mad at the title. Dril baby Dril.Ray Stevens' cover of Misty is the best rendition of it.  Period.Fuck this state so much sometimes.

Progressive activists garnered 157k signatures for a ballot measure this November to raise the income tax rate on people who earn over $1 million per year. The state Department of Revenue estimated it would raise $2 billion in revenue. The ballot measure specifically earmarked the funds for transportation and education. The Attorney General certified it to appear on the ballot and everything.

This morning, the state Supreme Court blocked it. It can't even appear on the ballot. Listen to this shit:

\&gt; In the majority opinion authored by Associate Justice Frank Gaziano, the court said voters who favored the tax increase but not earmarking funds for specific purposes would be in \*\*“the untenable position of choosing which issue to support,”\*\* and which to disregard.

\&gt; Gaziano also wrote the initiative did not give voters the ability to choose between transportation or education, if they didn’t want to spend the additional funds on both.

\&gt; “A voter who commuted to work on an unreliable subway line, but who did not have school-aged children and was unconcerned about public education, might want to prioritize spending for public transportation, without devoting additional resources to public education, but would be unable to vote for that single purpose,” Gaziano wrote. “A parent of young children, who lived in a rural part of the Commonwealth and did not own a motor vehicle, would be unable to vote in favor of prioritizing funding for early childhood education without supporting spending for transportation.”

Something something the rich won't let you vote their wealth away.

&gt;Name
&gt;The name of White Settlement originated as a result of there being two settlements in the area: one occupied predominantly by Native Americans (near where Fort Worth is located today), and the other one being occupied by white settlers. The latter settlement received the name "White Settlement" as a way to distinguish itself from the Native American settlement. The city was incorporated in 1941.[8]

Oh, okay.  Unimaginative, I guess, but it makes sense. 

But wait, there's more:

&gt;On October 14, 2005, city leaders announced a plan to have local voters decide on a possible name change for the town from White Settlement to West Settlement. In the November 8 election, the name change was overwhelmingly rejected by a vote of 2,388 to 219.[9]

Uh, what?  What was that about?  

&gt;11-9-05 - **Residents held on to their heritage Tuesday night and voted against changing their town name to West Settlement, despite proponents' arguments that the name has racial connotations and stunts economic development.**

&gt;In a record turnout, 2,388 residents voted against the name change and 219 voted for it in unofficial, complete returns.

&gt;**The city got its name because it was the lone village of white pioneers amid several American Indian encampments in the Fort Worth area in the Texas Republic territory in the 1840s.**

&gt;Mayor James Ouzts and other city leaders proposed the change, saying the current name is confusing, misleading and has prevented companies from moving into this 15,000-resident suburb of Fort Worth.

&gt;However, the ballot measure angered many residents who said the change was unnecessary and too costly. Signs across town urged folks to **"Be Proud! Don't Let Them Discard the Heritage of White Settlement. Vote No!"**

&gt;"I'm disappointed, but we've got a lot of advertising over this. So, in a way, we've won," said 74-year-old Alvin Kite, who served on a committee that recommended the name change.


&gt;Former City Councilman Alan Price said he was pleased with the outcome, and he believes the passion people had about preserving the town's heritage will help, not hurt, the city.

&gt;**"Since the publicity got so big and everyone knows that people are proud of it, I think businesses will take a second look,"** Price said.

&gt;Price and other opponents said the measure was so soundly defeated because residents believed city leaders rushed the issue, didn't want it publicized and were trying to make the working-class town into something it isn't.

&gt;"This vote shows how out of touch this city is with their citizens," said Nolan Fontenot, who is organizing an effort to have the mayor and city council recalled.

&gt;**Mayor Ouzts said he still believes a more politically correct name would help draw new companies to replace several big businesses _ including Home Depot and Wal-Mart _ that have left for larger properties outside the city.**

&gt;City leaders will keep trying to help the city grow, Ouzts said, despite the recall effort that he said was being done for the wrong reasons.

&gt;"We've been fighting for this community, fighting for economic development ... working very, very hard, and if that's the wrong thing to do, then I suppose I'm in the wrong business," Ouzts said.


Yeah, sounds like it has the right name.  I'm scared, and chances are you are too. And that's OK. Fear is normal, and pretending not to be afraid doesn't make it go away. What's isn't OK and what we can't allow to happen is the crippling that can often accompany fear. We can't afford to not prepare right now, we can't afford to not act right now. I'm hoping this thread can be a place where we share our fears and find solidarity with one another, as well as a place to share whatever resources we think might help others in some way.

I started listening to [this podcast](http://www.interestingtimespodcast.com/blog/page/6/) yesterday after seeing someone recommend it on Twitter. It's a 14-Part series on Italian Fascism. I don't care what you know about Fascism already, please give this a listen. The episodes are about 30 minutes long each.

Speaking of Fascism, if you haven't read "[Ur-Fascism](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/)", please do. It's not a book, it's an essay and it's something that everyone needs to familiarize themselves with.

There's so much more I want to post here, but I won't because now isn't the time for reading hundred year old books on political theory. If you're gonna read books on something right now, make it [Small Unit Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_unit_tactics) or something we either need right now or will need very soon.

I want to believe that's my fear talking, and maybe it is. But I genuinely believe that everyone who isn't a Fascist right now needs to be preparing for things to get worse. That means preparing for the modern versions of the [Black Shirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackshirts), [Brown Shirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung), [Freikorps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freikorps) to start marching in the streets and start kicking in doors. That means preparing now to fight them the second they start kicking in doors. I'm not saying you should go out and buy a rifle and start training with it, I'm just saying everyone should be considering doing that at this point.

Edit: Fixed linkIt’s genuinely like a status quo version of /pol/. They remind me of a guy I know whose brain was broken by 4chan and pushed to the alt right but they’re edgy elitist nerds who want to feel like they’re super geniuses for parroting the opinions of a subreddit dedicated to supporting sweatshops with the most surface level nonsense justification. It’s made them profoundly unfunny to the point where they think texting me “Le poverty chart” and saying “why do you hate Le global poor xD” is peak comedy. I’m starting to genuinely dislike them as friends it’s gotten so obnoxious and cringe worthy.Atlanta Field Office

Phone: (703) 285-6301Both are bad so this is not meant to be against the Abolish ICE campaign, but it is worthwhile making sure we are hitting the right target, and definitely worthwhile to not ignore the agency actually doing the detention that is in the news recently. The McAllen detention facility, for example, is run by Border Patrol, not ICE.

Broadly speaking, CBP operates within one hundred miles of the border, and ICE operates in the interior. Think of it this way: Are you a middle aged Polish man who has been living in Kalamazoo since you were four? You are arrested and detained by ICE. Are you a Honduran mother fleeing violence with your child? You are arrested and detained by CBP.Title.mp69bottom textFound this sub from r/libertarian 

Commies?, socialist?, nazis? Dems? Repubs? Enlighten me. You gave us a great post and now your account is banned /u/myscifilullaby. 
  
When you look at this sub on another IP just know I salute you/u/lotusblotus You made the magnet link to the ice directory and now the Fascist admins banned you. o7 to a true poster 
  
When the Donald posts actual doxes it's bad tho huhSuck our collective bungholes you concentration camp loversLike there were applications a couple months ago right or did I dream that? Just wanna know when I’m gonna meet my new moms and dads.Why would anyone want to listen to a bunch of guys read the youtube comments section?

Not even like rap it or set it to music. Just read it. You know the quote--opiate of the masses, sigh of the oppressed, all that. 

Glanced over at the Lobsterdom subreddit--and, man. Latin in the subtitle? Nice. I had wondered why he gathered such a following--the outsider could agree in a sort of hyperutilitarian way to his point of narratives being more important than truth, but beyond that, who could care?

But... when you live in a system that values you for your contribution to the GDP rather than your actual personhood, wouldn't it be nice to have a narrative that says that you *are* important--you *are* someone special, and God made you uniquely in his image and you're part of a divine plan? That every Sunday you can go to a place where a guy on stage talks about how, despite that you're sinful vermin before God, you're *important* vermin?

So you put up with your boss and taxes and the bourgeoisie getting away with whatever they want because you're the hero of your own story, and at the end you go to Heaven and all of the bad people go to Hell. You have your 'group'--other Christians, specifically of your exact sect and ethnic background and socioeconomic status, but in the hard times when Muslims and atheists show up on the world stage you're willing to put aside your differences. You can look at cathedrals and Gregorian chants and charities and think, "I'm part of that!" from the comfort of your computer chair, doing nothing.

There's the sigh--the sigh of contentment. That things are bad, but you'll be rewarded later, so there's no reason to change the system and--by extension--nothing really matters *too much* in the physical world, because the afterlife is the goal and you're just comfortable enough in this life anyway. This makes suffering--not just yours, but the great suffering and persecution of others--tolerable, and sometimes noble. A poor widow supporting her family of three without getting government handouts or complaining or questioning the system after getting evicted? Noble. Brave. Godly.

But then secularization comes, and that all goes away.  You try to piece together a sterile, capitalist equivalent of belief--you're an American citizen and Americans are the free-est and best-est and you can be whatever you want if you work hard enough and the American Dream is real and every business owner you've ever met is like the new Horatio Algers. Nationalism as religion--but there's not enough, because there's no community because Americans are programmed to hate each other in the great pursuit of wealth and materialism. Then material reality pulls the pin and rolls the grenade at your feet--and boom, there it is, the great reminder that you're just another disposable cog in a machine that wasn't intelligently designed, but cobbled together bit by bit by your successive slavemasters. The police aren't your friends, the government doesn't care about you beyond the census, corporations will use every last ounce of life in your body if they can, the people around you are disaffected, unemployed, homeless, unhappy, self-medicating, suicidal. You were never really 'middle class' or 'upper middle class,' you were just a worker, no coat-of-arms to your name.

You can't bear to look at it. You need someone to tell you that everything will be fine, but the Pope is talking about refugees and climate change and that's *the real world* and that's scary, you don't want to think about that. Evangelists keep going on about weird prophecies and you were raised religious but you're not, like a cultist or anything. And Muslims are brown, and Buddhism is too hard, and Hinduism is too foreign, and--

So then a mild-mannered, normal-looking guy with a few credentials to his name starts telling you those soothing lies from before--that you are a hero, you do have externally-provided meaning, you are on a great journey, you have a mighty soul, or maybe that this is the least violent time in history and progress is a natural upward slope into an empyrean infinity. Those existentialists and nihilists and absurdists who looked uncomfortably close at the human condition and questioned the usual platitudes--what do they know? They were just miserable and misery loves company, that's all. 

Now you can do it--you can feel important again, but you can shed the scriptural dogmaticism and the spiritual weirdness of plagues and resurrections and replace it with scientific terminology and smart-sounding turns of phrase. Now your enemies are not merely 'sinful,' but they are illogical and emotional (which, in your mind, is no different from sin, because virtue is logical because it came from God). You still need rules--you grew up with them, God gave you them in Proverbs and in the Commandments--but now you have twelve rules for life, but updated for the hip and chic new millennium. Because you need that. You need that essentialism. You need that hierarchy. But, ultimately, even if this system of thought does standardize and unify everything, it's still axial upon *you,* the hero, the actor. The individual... still alienated, but just like when you were young, you have a nice illusion distracting you from that alienation. Climate change, ocean acidification, depletion of topsoil, conflicts across the world... yeah, *maybe* they exist, but what does that have to do with you and your epic saga?

So, in a way... some people just need the religion. Or the religion repackaged as illusory, mollifying belief. Not because they're weak, but because they're so idealistic they can't stand the reality as it is, and because they've never been taught coping mechanisms for that material reality. And it isn't until capitalism is the title of a chapter in a history book that it will no longer be needed. So for those of you who are assholes about it... stop being assholes to religious people, the religious left is a worthwhile ally.

I know this isn't new and you all know this already, but it was on my mind.I did some reading online, here's what I know about Nielsen

1.) She's not qualified. She's been in the Homeland Fuckery field for about 20 years but doesn't seem to have any real expertise or experience that would make her a likely choice for command of a 200,000 strong army of cops. Apparently no one expected Trump to pick her so her appointment was probably the brain worms talking

2.) Her staff don't like her. Apparently she's all "elbows" and hard to work with. Or they're just sexist, who knows? I'm going off like, three Newspaper articles. 

3.) She's likely worth a couple of million in assets and shit, but she's not rich rich. 

4.) Her position is very weak. It's likely that her staff do not like her. She didn't really come up the ranks and was not anyone's first choice for the job. She likely has not faced much public scrutiny as the head of a freaking massive police force. She's not a cop or a troop. 

Interestingly she's wide fucking open on the internet. I kinda know it's easy to dox people, but I wasn't expecting it to be easy to find out so much detail on, you know, the freaking capo of the secret police dick waving brigade. Jesus. If I had a couple of premium white pages account I could probably tell you what she drinks to get to sleep at night. 

Summary; She's probably pretty competent at her job, which is being some kind of high level political grifter type lawyer aide thing. She's schmoozy with Kelly, the previous DHS capo, which suggests she's good at something. But running an army of 200,000 cops, staff, and black helicopters isn't her job. She probably ended up where she is because Kelly thought she was reliable, which got her in to Trumps field of vision, and then Trump picked her to unsettle everyone and keep everyone else in the room confused or off balance. Or maybe she's just, you know, a brilliant cop strategist, I couldn't find much. Let me know if y'all turn up any policy papers or white papers she's authored. 

She seems like a good villain to hang this ICE thing on, but she's only been in the hot seat for a little while and likely has little if any control over how the operation runs on the ground. Between the restaurant thing and the amount of public facing information available online I don't think she's really hardened her life against snooping paparazzi types or righteously pissed off DSA dorks. Okay you're a cop, right? But you're not just any cop, you're *Homeland Security*. And you're *Federal*. So you get the kind of money city cops can only dream about. You get all sorts of cool tactical cop shit to stick to your cool tactical cop shit, and it's all Flat Dark Earth, which is some extremely cool cop shit. 

You get to go on trips all over the place, meet interesting people, hang out in cool cop Intelligence Joint Fusion Centers, and do fun training with your cop friends. 

When you actually have to go do actual cop shit, get this, get this; You almost never encounter any actual criminals! That's right! You're not doing any real cop shit, like taking on dangerous gangsters or... um... the fuck do cops even do, these days? Eitherway, point is, there's like no fucking risk at all because you're seriously just chasing down terrified poor people who just want to work their shitty meat packing plant job and keep their heads down. 

Oh, and, you know what? Since they're not criminals, and they're not citizens (usually), and you're not actually trying to charge them with any crimes, you don't actually have to follow all those complicated cop rules that make doing cop shit sorta tricky! You can pretty much just do whatever the fuck you want! Every day is christmas! Beat some suspects, they're not entitled to legal representation and they couldn't afford it anyway! Speedy trials? No such fucking thing if you're a non-person accused of a non-crime being held indefinitely in a non-prison! And hey, if some fucking perps property happens to maybe go missing, well, who'd know? You black-bagged the poor fucker off to god knows where and his family can't exactly show up at the Cop-Shop to say "La Migra stole my husband's wallet", can they?

It's win win win baby! Unlimited toys, unlimited violence, *Zero fucking accountability*. You can get your cop hog all stiff and juiced up then go pick up a double armload of MAGA chicks (or dudes, whatever, we don't kink shame here) at the local Honky-Tonk with that sexy ass "DHS - ICE" jacket, bank your fat federal pay check, and beat the shit out of your wife/husband (we don't judge) when you get home! It's practically cop heaven! de-/u/spez -ito[https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/immigration-family-separation-homeland-security-order/](https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/immigration-family-separation-homeland-security-order/)  


It's only a start, and of course it's not legislation, and of course the Trump admin will try to take credit for ending the crisis they created in the first place, but DSA members and the wave of outrage got to the ghoulish DHS.Just letting y'all knowTrump just needs to attack Iran for him to say Muslims gotta join Hispanics in these tent cities and boom, you get genocide.

Keep blockading ICE.It's time to split the party. Chapistas vs. DSA fight to the deathbottom.txtIf you downvoted me, gulagAlso thanks for all the free karma. This place is basically a farm. 

Do we have a backup sub? Or should I just look out for it on Twitter when it gets made?It's been weeksLegit question, y'all stoke a mean rage boner over there for this place.that is all
I have done the tactical analysis, crunched thenumbers, and drawn the best course of action. To obtain complete victory, we must begin with with [Jordan Peterson], [Cumtown], [JoeRogan], and [FullCommunism]
  

 Though these lands are hostile our Chapo based enlightenment and raw physicality, our uncut pure ideology and physicality factors will enable us to beguile and subdue those 'savages' and bring pure unbridled civilization right to their doorstep. They will have no choice but to submit to our superior culture and volceldom, they will learn our ways and come to call them their own! I call on you posters, Embark! Cry! And Let loose the posts of War! CHAPO HOC VULT! 
  


From there to infinity! Go forth, and post! May the sun never set on the Chapotista Empire!Oh fuck I hope it was some anarcho-daddy or mommy saboteurWe know this because the executive order he signed explicitly says Zero Tolerance must still be policy.

Don't let the fucking media run a victory lap over this.... I really hope he’s having a bad day. It's my personal prediction. He likes having his ego stroked, but Wahl is way much of an obvious sycophant.I'm off to own the libs. Smell you later losers. While you post I'm doing activism.

Can you believe it.A march down the main street with leashed dogs, complementary water bowls left along the way.

Videos of dogs being killed by cops projected onto screens, buildings.

Impassioned speeches by dogowners whose dogs have been blown away by cops.

A long list of dogs killed by cops spread around via pamphlet, dumped in front of police stations (especially police dogs that have died of neglect and abuse).

So then finally, *finally,* some liberals and enlightened centrists stop and think, "maybe... maybe the cops are bad," and it's a lot harder for people to ascribe ill motive to American dogs than non-American or non-white humans.

Because it's pretty fucking obvious that human life has been so effectively commodified and dereified by the state that people's designer pets are the last facet of empathy they retain.

And that's really just unfortunate.I will be streaming the first Deus Ex very soon and attempt an Marxist analysis of it. Everyone is welcome.

twtch.tv/yungmarksAside from animals, art,cooking, and general amusement- I primarily made an account to keep in touch with other leftists..(cause I'm angry with hellworld)

It was good seeing people who care and share information instead of being elitist liberal types.

Thanks everyone.
^(getting high and watching all the S.Z. recommendations now)I think I might do an going to be an antifa body positivty foto shoot. A la stavvybaby2 but for DSA nerdsHey all:

So I'm sure most of you have seen at least one fundraiser for donating to RAICES floating around on the Internet. Just wanted to let people know that I e-mailed their general inquiry account to ask about where they most needed volunteers. It's a long story, but I basically have half of the month of July in which I'll be floating around the US and I figured this was a good use of my time.

It's somewhat encouraging that the account responded with a form letter, saying they are inundated with requests for information about volunteering, and will get back to specific questions within 3 business days. I'll just paste the text of the e-mail, which contains links and some information about a facebook live event that might be useful for those outside of Texas who want to help.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Hi There!Thank you for your email. Due to the high volume of volunteer and outreach requests, we will respond to your inquiry within 3 business days. If you are out of state and would like to volunteer, join us for a Facebook Live Thursday, June 21st from 2pm-3pm. You will hear about how to support immigrants in your community who have recently been released from detention.

Thanks everybody. Keep your heads up.Hey y’all,

I’m a rising 3rd year law student, and one of my former colleagues who’s a close friend needs our help. 

I first want to say that the friend in question, Alex (full name in tweet below, only sharing it b/c the situation requires it) is a comrade and was a huge inspiration to me as someone in their first legal job. While I was working for Cook County Judge Franklin Valderrama (same judge that ordered the release of the LaQuan McDonald video), Alex was his clerk. In your first year or law school, idealism can get beaten out of you pretty quickly, but Alex demonstrated through her support and her actions that you don’t need to compromise your morals to be a good lawyer. 

It’s not easy to be a comrade in the legal field: it takes putting up with reactionary shits, discouraging holdings, and having your social time replaced with studying. But most of all, to be a leftist lawyer requires courage in your convictions. Time and again, Alex demonstrated compassion, bravery, and refused to mince words when she saw an injustice.

Tacky as it sounds, Alex truly was an inspiration to me as a clueless law student who was (and still is) constantly overwhelmed. She was an example of the lawyer I hope to be one day, and I’ll always be grateful for that. 

OK, so now the part where I ask for your help:

Recently, Alex was offered a fellowship position with Equal Justice Works helping Chicagoans with substandard housing and housing benefits issues. This is not a high-paying gig, but Alex is the type of person who puts her ethics above bullshit like money. From what she’s told me, the board that she will answer to actually *sponsored someone else* that lost out to Alex. Ever since, her relationship with the board has been tense, and they frequently give her shit about extremely menial shit.(“how DARE you as me how to properly format this internal document,” bullshit like that). 

All that’s left for her fellowship to get final confirmation and officially be a done deal is to get a rubber stamp from this board. However, yesterday out of the blue, the board emailed her,  demanding she come to a meeting today they said was required before she could get the fellowship. Alex said details were sparse, and the last-minute nature of this worries her, and from what I understand, rightfully so.

She asked me to share this announcement tweet to basically create a situation where EJW can’t walk back her fellowship b/c there’s too much public attention. If you have a twitter, please RT the announcement, add a hashtag like #CongratsAlex or some shit, do whatever you think will help. Alex is 100% a comrade, is an intelligent, kind, and dedicated lawyer, and she deserves this fellowship. 

TLDR: share this tweet, it will help a comrade secure a fellowship helping poor Chicagoans with housing legal issues.

This incredibly vague, click bait shit is ready-made Fascist propaganda. This shit is going to get more and more people to go to the Far-Right. This is going to get people killed.

Edit: https://twitter.com/purrrrkins/status/1009773075615944707Real Dante Posting hours who the fuck up? It'll help shift the overton window left, for one, and it will also keep democratic socialists for being a niche, fringe group in politics. 

People are starting to realize that the drumpf-brand /#resistance is ineffective, and they're wanting a movement that has more grit and is actually organizing. Not to mention they at least have frustration and a basic sense of humanity in common - they recognize that ICE is evil, they recognize that racism/homophobia/transphobia/etc are bad, and they are disenchanted with elite democrats fucking up constantly. 

We need more people on our side to fight injustice, and they're joining the DSA to put up a more effective fight. I say let them. prepare your asses boysalso I’m gonna get the last post on r/chapo before we go down lol that's all, fam ✌Holy shit we are getting fuckefOf pee stored in balls despacitoFuck the ICE Protests we need to free our golden boi u/ohmiglobHANDS OFF R/CHAPO NAZI ADMINS Wtf this sucksIt's u/wraith20 whoda thunk itWhatever man shits boring who caresI'd give you several upvotesOppa Gangnam StyleHello, I a big fan of trap, also fan of sun of destroy, just like you Mr Felix Biederman.

It's like the past just disappeared down the memory hole. Some comrades are good allies but are unable to fuck. They might be in dead bedrooms, their spouses might be dead, or they might be someone's beard or rough male equivalent. 
  
It is not okay to denigrate those people by referring to all maladapts to society as incels and make fun of them for not being able to have sex. These people could be close at hand or your closest comrades but they can't talk about it for fear of being lambasted by you online assholes. It's unbelievable how you guys hound a group who has very well could be filled with Innocents. 
  
There even was an incel comrade who posted here a few times but ended up killing themselves, you guys shat on them but then turned around and praised them after the news broke. 

 
Now here's the thing I totally fuck. I fuck a lot. But my significant other is not in the country right now so I have been made an involuntary incel by distance. I'm sick of being bullied and I'm sick of y'all shitting on my newly adapted culture. This is not okay and I'm worried you guys are splitting the party and it's a schism I don't want. So stop being wreckers.Just pirate it and donate the money to a worthy cause, like the IWW or one of the effective altruist supported food or mosquito net charitiesIf they were libs.

It's tempting to either minimize any negative or promote any possible positive economic impacts resulting from more lenient immigration polices. The people taking these immense risks are often doing so to save their or their families' lives. The problems they are running from our largely due to exploitation by Western capitalism, which those of us in the first world have reaped more than our fair share of benefits. The US consumes a quarter of the world's resources while having 5% of the population. 

Once you turn the argument towards what they can do to further enrich our own unsustainable lifestyles, you've effectively commoditized and essentially dehumanized them. They are now simply an economic asset whose desire to live in a safe, stable environment is your secondary concern.

You're also attempting to argue in good faith with these dickheads who just trying to find fancy ways to classify migrants as parasites who want to take their stuff. If you want to get down their level, just call them names. Don't entertain bad opinions cloaked in their almighty reason and logic. And you can just respond (whether you are one or not) "Yep. Believe in equality across the board; men, women, gays, straights, trans, all skin colors, all ethnicities, all religions etc..."

They can't respond "Yeah, I'm a fascist" without ruining their lives in public (like losing their job at trans friendly Hulu). "yeah, I'm against all that good stuff"

They can't own that label, any variation of "leftist!!!" you can always make look good.It took that to force the media to drop their endless Russiagate coverage. Quite disgraceful.

Call all of them the reason there should be white genocide. There is no reasonable republicans. There is so much intellectual corruption that most politicians in america need to be embarassed to it's core. Have you seen the colleges most of the people go to and come out as assholes. IT'S INTELLECTUAL CORRUPTION AT IT'S FINEST AND IT DESERVES A RHETORICAL VERSION OF A FLAMETHROWER TAKEN TO IT. Burn in hell to hellworld liberals, death to nazis, death to capitalists. The alt left needs to radicalize more people. America needs to be better then it's politicians that rule. Republicans and milquetoast liberals need to fear the dirtbag left.

Fuck Homeland security. How repariate everyone who has ever been fucked over by America citizen or not. Fuck this neoliberal version of America. Let's be the America that we can all be proud.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYRQKtXQrGc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYRQKtXQrGc)Ripped from FB. I can't get the website to load. Anyone speak Italian or know much about Italian Fascist history? 


&gt;Roger Benham
&gt;17 hrs

&gt;Giovanni Tiso wrote a short and enlightening essay today about the history of "I Really Don't Care" in Italian: https://overland.org.au/…/a-brief-fascist-history-of-i-don…/: I don't really speak Italian, so I didn't realize this right away, but "Me Ne Frego," or "I don't really care," was the slogan of the World War I Arditi, the Italian stormtroopers. It came from the writings of the soldier poet and proto-Fascist Gabrielle d'Annunzio, who led Arditi veterans in taking the city of Fiume in Croatia after the war, a brief nationalist revolution that indirectly led to Mussolini's seizure of power in 1922.

&gt;Here's what's startling to me, after finding this out. I have been to northeastern Italy, and just across the border into Slovenia. You cannot drive through the smallest village in this region without seeing a monument or cemetery dedicated either to the World War I dead, the Fascists, or the defeat of the Fascists by Communist Yugoslav partisans and Italian antifa geurrillas at the end of World War II. Streets everywhere are named after Fascists or antifascists. There are references to d'Annunzio everywhere. There's some photos here of some of these monuments, in Redupuglia, Trieste, the Val Di Risondra and elsewhere.

&gt;But as I said, I don't speak Italian and was only there for two weeks.

&gt;Melania Trump was born in Novo Mesto, a city in Slovenia which was part of first Fascist Italy, then the Third Reich in World War II. Her father was a Yugoslav Communist Party member, from a village which has three large mass graves from the struggle against the Fascists and Nazis. She went to school and first worked in Lubljana, a city full of references to the fight against Fascism. She started her modelling career there before moving on to Milan, the city where Mussolini was executed after a mass uprising against the Nazis and Fascists. She speaks Italian.

&gt;Let me repeat that: Melania Trump speaks Italian.

&gt;When you add to this the fact that Fascists have just had an electoral victory in Italy, that there are active Fascist street movements everywhere there today, actively resurrecting and using the Fascist slogans and mottos of the 1920s and '30's (including "I Don't Really Care"), that admirers of these movements have worked and do work in the White House, from Steve Bannon to Sebastian Gorka to Stephen Miller, and that Zara, the jacket manufacturer has previously been controversial for producing a swastika themed handbag and a shirt with a concentration camp Jewish star on it, it is impossible for me to think that this signalling was not intentional.

&gt;Some may think the jacket is a distraction from the very real threats facing our country and world right now, from scapegoating of vulnerable immigrants and refugees to the stripping of the social safety net and the destruction of workplace and environmental protections. I firmly believe it is not. The First Lady of the United States, who grew up in the heartland of symbolic contestation over Fascist symbols and mottos, wore a Fascist message jacket from a company with a history of Fascist messaging.

&gt;I care about that very, very much.

Here's that site. It did load eventually and goes in to more detail about the slogan.

Me: **explains how Republicans constantly push extreme policies to move the center to the right so the question isn't if there should be limits but what should the limits be, which is why we ought to push for extreme left policies**


Coworker: But that's not practical. You can't get your policies through Congress without compromise.


Me: That's such a *liberal* thing to say.


Coworker: I thought liberal meant left, though?


Me: Oh no... Okay, say we had a referendum on abortion where the choices were "20 week limit" or "6 week limit" what would you do?


Coworker: I'd vote for the 20 week limit.


Me: But do you believe in a 20 week limit?


Coworker: No of course not! But it's the least bad choice!


Me: But you're endorsing the system that would enforce abortion limits by participating in it.


Coworker: The difference between you and me is that I believe change can happen within the system.


Me: Yeah.


Coworker: And I don't think you do.


Me: Yeah.


Coworker: But you've decided I'm wrong and you're right.


Me: What, I can't have political convictions?


Coworker: Um, aren't you going to vote (in November), though??


Me: Well, yeah... All my communist friends on the Internet make fun of me for it, too... They call me a "suck-dem".


Coworker: You're such a hypocrite!

Thoughts/Who are the "good" alternatives to Erdogan. Leading up on the candidates, the opposing parties all seem you have their own authoritarian past or neo-fascist affiliations. The supposedly soc-dem party has an authoritarian past and is for hard secularism, which will absolutely blow up in their face as it did in Egypt and other states, and the other parties are selling the promise of democracy but either really fucking hate the Kurds, are as corrupt as the AKP and just being opportunistic, or are too marginal to have any real power if Erdogan is ousted anyways. And I'm not sure what their refugee policies are.

No seriously log off, buy some books from Verso and Jacobin and read them, go to DSA electoral meetings and push them to take action[*Janus v. AFSCME*](http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/06/live-blog-of-opinions-with-first-mondays-3/) just came down from the Supreme Court, which turns the entire public sector in the US "right-to-work."

Right-to-Work laws in the US are abhorrent, but they're also very confusing. For example, they have nothing to do with a literal right to work/have a job, such as in a federal jobs guarantee.

**Right-to-work laws are about gutting union finances.** They do this in a very straightforward way:

1. In the US, unions have a [duty of fair representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_fair_representation) to each of their members. This means they have to fairly represent all of the workers they represent both at the negotiating table when bargaining for a new contract, and when a worker wants to file a grievance. The duty of fair representation is in place to guarantee that if Average Joe gets suspended and docked a week's pay, and everyone thinks Joe is an asshole and probably deserved it, the union still has to aggressively pursue his grievance as they are his representative.
2. Filing grievances and arbitration cost unions time and resources. So, in exchange for the duty of fair representation, unions charge the workers under their contracts an [agency fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_shop). This is a small fee (usually between 1-2&amp;#37; of the worker's pay) that is tightly regulated and can *only* go towards collective bargaining activities like filing grievances or negotiating a contract. It is thus different from "union dues," which are voluntary contributions a worker makes to the union, and which the union can use for anything (such as endorsing a political candidate). Unions collect agency fees by negotiating a clause, called a [union security agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_security_agreement), into their contract with the employer that states that the agency fee will be paid directly by the employer to the union.
3. What "right-to-work" laws do is outlaw union security agreements, and in doing so, agency fees. Thus, **right-to-work laws outlaw agency fees, but** ***not*** **the duty of fair representation.** Under right-to-work laws, unions have to dedicate time and resources to workers' grievances regardless of whether the worker has contributed anything to the union. This is designed to create a [free-rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem) for unions, as many people choose not to pay union dues, but still expect the union to pursue their claims if they arise. Right-to-work laws are a [deliberate attempt](http://fortune.com/2012/01/31/what-right-to-work-laws-really-mean/) by the right wing to weaken unions' power by gutting their finances.

That brings us to *Janus*: right-to-work laws are usually thought of at the state level. [28 states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-work_law) have passed right-to-work laws in the US, mostly in the South and Midwest. **What** ***Janus*** **does is impose right-to-work nation-wide on a sector of the economy, specifically the public sector.** As a result of *Janus*, all state, county, and local employees now operate under right-to-work.

This is major blow because the public sector is one of the last bastions of union support in the US. About \~35&amp;#37; of public employees in the US are unionized, compared to \~6-7&amp;#37; of private sector employees.

[**There is a direct correlation between union density and income inequality.**](https://www.epi.org/news/union-membership-declines-inequality-rises/) For those of us who believe in the power of organized labor, *Janus* is a disgusting and abhorrent blow to unions' ability to work and function.SCOTUS determines employers have the right to harvest employee organs Tell me again why the Supreme Court is necessary for a democracy?Specifically about the Supreme Court. Is there any way that we aren’t completely fucked?

Reagan, aka Trump I, appointed Kennedy, is it really impossible that Trump couldn’t fuck up the far right playbook and do the same?Nationalizing right to work, allowing gerrymandering, concentration camps for refugees, family separation, separate concentration camps for kids, and I'm already forgetting. Maddow has not talked about Russia ever since she cried on air after learning the child prisons. The Supreme Court will dominate headlines for the next few weeks because of Kennedy deciding to hand it all over to Trump. And now there's a real chance Trump will get a SCOTUS that says "Hey, Mueller, fuck off."https://twitter.com/ambertamblyn/status/1012074545556094977 susan sarandon doomed society

That's why Sean Hannity fearmongered over her platform, and said free college, protecting immigrant, helping seniors and Puerto Rico is "scary."

It's also why her endorsement of Brent Welder, another Justice Democrat, caught their attention because they went over to see who Welder is, and they found he's leading the Republican by seven points in Kansas.

It's also why you suddenly saw CNN talk to Bernie Sanders so much more. Once it became clear he was for real, everyone had to pay attention. Even if it's to try to smear him or her, they finally see us as a threat.

It's no secret or coincidence the richest people in the world are old white straight men; everybody else suffers. It's no secret a system that allows for such exclusion (capitalism) should not be allowed to exist, but for us to reach there, we must work with social democracy and other systemic reformists so we can both save all the lives currently suffering NOW and provide a blueprint for democracy in the workplace. 

That's her rhetoric, that's her philosophy, that's who she is, and finally, FINALLY, we have not only one of us soon to be in Congress, but she's now a national figure overnight. Instantly, everyone's gonna know her name, see her speak, and set the agenda. Bernie became clickbait for the media, so they keep running him. Now she's endorsing other progressives (Cynthia Nixon, Cori Bush, Brent Welder, Kaniela Ing), and taking advantage fully of the fact the media now not only understands she exists, but recognizes she has power.

Ocasio-Cortez was on Colbert, and he asked about democratic socialism. If this was Bernie, he'd say something about Scandinavia and frame it as social democracy so it's not a bogeyman. But Alexandria? She says democratic socialism means "you should not be too poor to live." Boom, done. She explains how identity politics is everything, race, class, gender, sex, everything, and when she's saying it instead of Bernie, she gains cred from social liberals who genuinely do care about these issues, and she forces centrists to pay more attention to her cause she's not a Bernie Bro and does not identify herself as a Bernie Gal (despite being a Bernie volunteer) cause she knows it can't be about one guy or woman anymore.

This is how you can win, this is how we can reframe the entire political debate, this is what we need for a viable left wing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9oesIhxYNQ

Because with the DSA in ascendancy, rightist weirdos are going to be more galvanized to violence than ever before. 

Look: Fox News and the right wing media abattoir has been doing the "anything I don't like is socialist/Communist/Maoist/etc" game for years. When a liberal politician approaches anything potentially progressive, the conservative side just calls them a socialist and the liberal will backpedal up a flagpole while stuttering the pledge of allegiance. Obama, neoliberal extraordinaire, was a Marxist-Frankfurt School agent-Saul Alinsky acolyte globalist mastermind. 

But now you have people saying, unironically, that they are socialists. There's a party with 'socialist' clearly in the name.

A segment of the population has been conditioned into having a fight-or-flight response to any semblance of socialist policy relayed to them via their masters in the guise of death panels, gun grabbers, affirmative action, soft-on-crime, open borders. In the conservative mind, there can be, at least, room for good (yet misguided) Muslims that can be converted and good black people (who have been deceived by Democrats). There is no 'good socialist' for the conservative or the reactionary because being a socialist and contesting the capitalist system is an active choice. 

Note those videos. Notice how emotional they get? That's years of careful priming, of a false consciousness borne upon the premise of the great 'other'--the smug city-slicker, the smug colored, the smug Jew, and worst of all the smug socialist--threatening their existence. Not the bourgeoisie, not the banker, not the politician, not the corporatist, but the standard, tax-paying civilians they live among. They're fucking terrified because the antithesis to their existence is finally solidifying in front of them. They're different than the Milos and the Crowders--they're not grifters, they aren't husks just following the scent of money and attention, they're the true believers. 

Is some asshole going to shoot up a DSA meeting? Probably not. Hopefully not. But this attitude of "oh, no need for the proletariat to take precautions and defend themselves, everything will just work out and we aren't gun nuts" isn't helpful. There's a contingent of rightists who are absolutely ready to visit harm upon you, and just need something more direct than "who will rid me of this meddlesome priest" to be activated. You may think "how many is that?"--the answer is, "enough." The moral majority won't rise to their feet when allegedly leftist professors and journalists are attacked, and this administration has already indicated that it'll turn a blind eye to anything politically inconvenient.

If you are politically active in the left, for real: Yes, learn first aid and CPR and how to apply a tourniquet and have a medical kit. Yes, store a surplus of water in your home and vehicle. Yes, learn how to safely handle and operate a firearm (that includes knowing how to clear it and render it safe). Yes, be in good physical condition. Yes, know your way around your local areas without needing a GPS. Yes, know which medical facilities are closest to you. Yes, have people who will check up on you if you go radio silent for more than 48 hours.

'Cause that's Hellworld.

Stay safe, Hellkites.why are boomers so obsessed with minions I don't get itAnd for some reason I’m getting a fuckload of advertisements about it. 

I hope some locals protest it or some shit, I might actually join them. Christ I’m gonna be so pissed off if I have listen to bunch of converted lobsterite dumbasses around here because of this.He can be played by William DevaneI listened to chapter 5: Long, Hot Summer at work yesterday and just how similar the thing people said back then to today just nearly sent me into a Matt Christman style rage. I actually found out about it from a book thread Matt did a while ago. You should all check it out and be mad with meMark Penn, Dick Morris, Doug Schoen?  I know there are many but those are the three who I always seem to see writing the most op-ed pieces about how the Democrats need to become fully Republican in order to win another electionLike 5 days ago, a cop from my mid-west, suburban, mostly white, hometown was killed when he was struck by a vehicle during a traffic stop. He left behind his son and an ex-wife. They caught the guy who did it, it appears to be a random accident and he probably go to jail for a long time. Since his death, my town has been littered with Blue Lives Matter bullshit and especially that fucking hideous Blue Lives Matter American Flag. The other night there was vigil for him, which is fine of course, and the locals busted out their finest BLM merchandise. T-shirts, flags, signs, ribbons, there is even a photo of a woman wearing BLM leggings. And while I sympathize with family and friends over the lost of a loved one (even if the loved one was a pig), but I can't fucking stand the BLM propaganda and how this can be used to further endanger minorities and poor people in order to protect "officer safety". "Officer safety" is such a non-issue in my highly populated suburb that this cop was the first officer to die in the line of duty since the 1920s. Thanks for reading this if you did, this is like the only place I can talk about this since most of the people I know and work with are (probably) all bootlickers.https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/958799662340759555I think it would be cool to have my local YDSA and DSA chapters do a film series on black radicals and such. Anyone have film/documentary recommendations?Just an update on my earlier trivia quiz name request,

We ended up being “stored pee doesn’t melt steel balls” but we’re going as “quizbollah” next week.

thank you for your concern.Just pondering this and thought I might get the opinions of some nice liberal fellas. Obviously not many people would  complain about America intervening in WW2, or Vietnam invading Cambodia during the reign of the Khmer Rouge, and in the case of a war like Iraq or a potential one in Saudi Arabia or North Korea the argument against ‘liberating’ these places is not that the regimes aren’t terrible, but that it would cost more lives and cause more suffering to destabilise their governments. Otherwise though, how bad would we agree a country would have to be before intervention is ethically justifiable?I'm a teacher at an elementary school and since its Black History month, I'm trying to put up photos of African-Americans that are not as well known in the normal sphere. Everyone knows about Rosa Parks, and Harriet Tubman so trying to show kids, parents and teachers different people. 

So far it's MLK and Malcolm X (can't leave out them of course but their bio is gonna be a little more realistic than the other teachers classrooms) and James Baldwin, Fred Hampton, and Emmett Till.

Who are some other people that I can include? 

Edit: I just realized I got stickied. I feel so special &lt;3I quite enjoyed our Jordan Peterson shitting thread, but now that /r/enoughpetersonspam exists for us to lambast the lobsters to our hearts content, let’s move on to another more overt right wing cult leader.
Honestly this dude kinda scares me. Over 700k subscribers! I imagine most of these guys are only teenagers, but that’s what makes it worse.
Oh well, who’s up for just cathartically laughing at Mr. ‘Not an argument’ for a while?Socialism is goodSo, I’m in a debate politics discord server where people from all ideologies come and debate about current events. The largest group there are “classical fascists”. 

They’re an interesting bunch, they love to sexualize trans people, hate Richard Spencer and the alt right, want the government to work for “the white working class”, and even more interestingly, accept white privilege exists.

The prevailing idea is “Yes, white privilege exists, and that’s the way it should be.” When you show them that the system prefers and protects whites, they acknowledge it, but add on that that’s how society should be, and they are fighting to keep it that way. So arguments about white privilege have stopped there because they’re just endless loops. I just tried to watch the video, but my computer exploded from the IQ overload : (The Republicans are just happy to be here (in government), so they don't really care because their victories were a happy accident (Russia has not forgotten Romney's fearmongering). This is obvious.

But the Democrats, they attack Trump from the right on Russia. They hype up collusion, which is not a crime (except on anti-trust laws), and is not treason because it only counts for when we are directly at war with an enemy nation (we are not with Russia). They ignore all the times Trump has agitated for a proxy war with the Kremlin (arming Kiev and their Neo-Nazi surrogates the Azov Battalion against Russians in Doinbass), they use any and all potential ties to random Russians (like the rich folks at Davos) to smear Trump in a vaguely xenophobic light, and they implicitly use Russia as a cudgel against the left wing (see Benjamin Dixon, DSA member, getting smeared as a dude who takes Russian bribes on Twitter). 

The worst part is they make it easier to imagine another cold war with Russia because of how much they fucking hate Putin for even vaguely trying to troll Hillary and preventing the Democrats from winning (you know goddamn well the Republicans would be doing the same shit here if they lost and thought Putin got Bernie to win or whatever). If the next Democratic president isn't a progressive, expect an Obama-like escalation of tension and hostility by the boys in blue. Democrats want to stick it to Russia because they're still fuming over Hillary's loss and refuse to let go of their grip on the party or admit they are about to get phased out by progressives.

A more appropriate left wing criticism is not denial or downplaying the scandal, nor is it the Aaron Mate/Glenn Greenwald/Max Blumenthal take of hammering on the conspiracy theorists only. No, left wing criticism of Trump/Russia is three-fold: Trump, the capitalist Id, has been known to launder money for the mafia and oligarchs who are just like him, and this is what Bernie calls the Global Oligarchy, when the ruling class goes full guillotine on the working class (since, let's be real, Trump and other oligarchs steal money from people who need it more). He goes with who's most like him (other authoritarians).

There's also Paul Jay's take: Trump represents a segment of the ruling class that prefers to piss off China (Asians) and Iran (Muslims), and there's a clash between his neocons and Bush's neocons who want Russia balkanized through incitement of Muslim agitation (see Chechnya). It's about competing oligarchies, which even Russia has (their KGB types are really paranoid over America like how Trump is paranoid over the "Deep State" and they want more conflict).

A third left wing take, it's just more money in politics. Michael Flynn, just give him 500,000 dollars to his lobbying firm and he will call off an attack on the Daesh capitol city so Erdogan doesn't lose his proxy. Jared Kushner, give him some AIPAC money and he'll push for the Trump transition team to try to stop Obama from condemning Israeli settlements in Netanyahu's name. Allow Trump to open up eight businesses in Saudi Arabia and he'll give Riyadh an arms deal.

My bonus take is probably the most cynical: as soon as Trump gets vaguely criticized by Putin, or gets led into criticizing Putin by Fox and Friends, or realizes he can't get his beloved towers in Moscow, Trump will immediately switch gears and start agitating for war just like he does against Kim Jong-un.In total honesty I thought outside of insider politics it was only a term used derogatorily against Clintonite-Liberals.is bad 

bottom text Is smoking bad praxis? Discusshttps://twitter.com/mirrorceleb/status/960150364107440128So over the past few weeks, certainly related to his book release, I've seen a bunch of people write pieces about (or against) our pal here. He's frequently decried as something of a scam artist etc., and I don't doubt he is -- but I haven't seen a lot of pieces arguing with the substance(s) what he's saying, it seems to be mostly saying he's kind of an asshole.


I gotta admit, that doesn't really do it for me. I want to know how he is wrong and why. I'm open to the notion that he might be right about some things, though e.g. his understanding of both Marxism and his usage of the term post-modernism betrays an obvious lack of knowledge about both. I know his fascination with Jungian archetypes is, er, outdated, but I'd love to know why and how, in detail. There was [this blog post](https://medium.com/@offordwrites/the-intellectual-fraudulence-of-jordan-peterson-apropos-daniel-karasik-ff3b58c48fc3) about how he's basically totally wrong about the transgender/language thing he rose to prominence with -- this is what I'm looking for.


What are some good takedowns of Peterson's stances that you know of? Anything that is substantively sourced and explained is great, ideally something like [this](http://wmbriggs.com/post/4923/) explanation of why Sam Harris' neuroscience PhD is terrible.https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/960531749397782528Jordan is the culmination of the frustration many of us men (and women) feel in the culture that i being changed around us.
He is today's knight and he is building an army. I would happily use the resources I have built (I donate to him now mohtly) and even my combat skills to back his ideals if need be.
Keep preaching Jordan, hopefully it doesn't come to violence but there are millions of us who agree that our freedoms are worth fighting for. While I hope the new dialogue being created calms people down enough to talk and solve our problems Demoratically, I worry that it will simply enrage the Left even more who thinks they have a monopoly on the thought of the country.
All when in fact, they are a tiny minority and if they chose to go to violence, they will be crushed.
Hopefully insanely intelligent people like Jordan will help lead the way peacefully and allow the more moderate Leftists to take pack the party from the Progressives who have violently taken over the Democratic Party.
Hahaha, who woulda thought it would be a Canadian that I would call my modern day hero to join the likes of George Washington and Lucious Quinctius Cincinnatus!you must think you’re really cool, releasing an episode teaser on a Monday for an episode that came out on Friday. getting my hopes up for some fresh new takes to dig at the gym. real fukin clever guys, hardy fucking har Yesterday I saw V for Vendetta; the similarities between V and the idea Satoshi Nakamoto are striking.

V and Satoshi remain **anonymous** because:

“**Authority**, when first detecting chaos at its heels, will entertain the vilest schemes to save its orderly facade.”

&gt;"They say that life's a game, and then they take the board away."

Let's reclaim the game, let's use Bitcoin.
I did it, I won the Chapo insider pun of the day. Let's list some runners up here:


* Alex Jones and the Extraterrestrials
* Doug "D-AL" Jones
* Lmao JonesPiers Morgan is a thot. he's a freaking nasty hoe. he looks good. i'd love Piers Morgan to bust my pussy open and tell me to smile more. if a guy shows up with a fucking clenched jaw and an autographed copy of Shooting Straight: Guns, Gays, God, and George Clooney he can hit my backwalls any fucking time of day dude. if a guy's like 'i got exiled from the BBC for creeping women’ im like 'take my fucking nose to your ass like that picture of you and Donald you keep tweeting.”Think about it.

Both believe in religion as a metaphor (Moore with his weird Egyptian snake God thingy and Peterson with Christianity), but while Moore does it as a form of transgressive rebellion against conformity, Peterson does it to restore the Western status quo.

Moore is the ultimate left-wing anarchist and his work is distinctly postmodern, while Peterson is a right-wing capitalist who thinks postmodernism is the most evil thing ever.

Moore celebrates that society is "moving towards some kind of anarchy", while Peterson promotes hierarchies (because of the lobsters y'know) and sees himself as some kind of vanguard against 'chaos'.

Moore presents himself as some mad-Rasputin with an untamed beard, working class clothes and Punkish accessories, while Peterson dresses like the most mundane college Professor imaginable.

The only thing that could complete this is if Peterson's work was misunderstood by liberals as representing their side the same way Moore's work is celebrated by right wing idiots who think we're meant to like Rorschach as a character and that V is an anti-globalist.

Or was this whole post just an unintelligible ramble just like the way both these men talk in interviews? I dunno, but I had fun writing it!The simplest fact about people is that they listen to others who are like them or who address their concerns directly. I don't think it's any wonder why young white guys are attracted to somebody who (very sincerely, and perhaps very effectively) addresses their [social anxiety, promising success in the traditional roles that society tells them they need to excel at.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8GSf5cYCvE)

Obviously, leftist politics is *about* approaching the concerns of oppressed and marginal people, and has been pretty successful in this field--but, despite Bernie and others chipping away at white resilience to these shared concerns, we stand to lose a lot of ground if we don't have a solid strategy to combat guys like Jordan Peterson, who embody and speak directly to their audience's concerns. 

Let's have a thread where we brainstorm new ideas (and share those already in practice) how we can fight these figures on their own terms, or whether that's even a good idea--what objectives should we have, and how should we pursue them?https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/961023997994418176183 is gonna be a good episode if it keeps going down this roadWe got the candidate Ronald Dreagan with the amazing economic plan of DreaganomicsOK, Ukraine wants military aid to repel Russian aggression. 

The USA wants to give it, and also use that leverage to establish geopolitical dominance and to push back against widespread asymmetric advances Russia has made in the last 5 years.

The Chapo Boys say they don't want this.

OK....so...what do they want?Grey Wolves who saw the comments to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/7w3o18/woke_bae_sells_arms_to_duterte/) will know where I got this idea from.
There seems to be a lot of these guys right now so let's rank them in order of pure shitness.

Type 1 for Steven Crowder

Type 2 for Lauren Southern

Type 3 for Jordan Peterson

Type 4 for Stefan Molyneux

Type 5 for Gavin McInnis

He keeps giving a platform to these overdeveloped cumshot abortions, and the internet and people keep getting worse as a resultRed makes me hornyFelix Biederman is a thot. he's a freaking nasty hoe. he looks good. i'd love Felix Biederman to bust my pussy open and tell me the truth about syria. if a guy shows up with a fucking clenched jaw and an autographed copy of The Eroticism in Hezbolla  he can hit my backwalls any fucking time of day dude. if a guy's like 'i got exiled from the El Chapo Trap House for being able to deadlift more than soyboy will ’ im like “take a fucking MOAB to my pussy just like Donald did to Afghanistan”This German dude figure skating to the big band version of Wonderwall is the most imgur dude ever Since it might confirm that they’re actually bourgeoise traitors and I’m just curious to see what the venue was likeI’m trying to censor Professor Headshot, need Chapos as witnesses https://twitter.com/katiepavlich/status/961227853508431873Every middle ground closed up.

But there's no real honest to god chance of it ever happening in our lifetimes. Capitalist America is Superman 64: a deliberately ludicrously broken game that will never let you win and will never let you go. Except we can't turn off the screen when that screen is our life.

Keep fighting, by all means. But don't expect victory without suffering. Don't expect victory at all.

Imma go just have sex for solace.Sweet fucking Jesus, the Democrats are so damn HORRIBLE at this politics thing.The fact there isn't a gate made out of pizza somewhere is a travestyBlue Wave ain't coming.So I've been reading *The Coming of the Third Reich* (by Richard Evans) lately, and have found it's a surprisingly dry and detached history of Weimar Germany, far less colored by any anti-communist bias than I expected. I know it's quite silly to treat today's political situation as identical or comparable to another historical situation (ie Weimar Germany or the Fall of Rome are common examples), but there have nevertheless been several passages already that have really made an impact on me in how applicable they are to *certain* aspects of modern American politics.

In particular, I wanted to post a lengthy passage on the fallout from the 1919 Spartacist Uprising and how it doomed the Weimar experiment from the very beginning:

&gt; The German Revolution of 1918-19 did not resolve the conflicts that had been boiling up in the country in the final phase of the war. Few were entirely satisfied with the Revolution's results. On the extreme left, revolutionaries led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg saw in the events of November 1918 the opportunity to create a socialist state run by the workers' and soldiers' councils that had sprung up all over the country as the old Imperial system disintegrated. With the model of Lenin's Bolshevik Revolution in Russia before their eyes, they pressed on with plans for a second revolution to complete their work. For their part, the mainstream Social Democrats feared that the revolutionaries might institute the kind of 'red terror' that was now taking place in Russia. Afraid for their lives, and conscious of the need to prevent the country from falling into complete anarchy, they sanctioned the recruitment of heavily armed paramilitary bands consisting of a mixture of war veterans and younger men, and known as the *Freikorps*, to put down any further revolutionary uprisings.

&gt; In the early months of 1919, when the extreme left staged a poorly organized uprising in Berlin, the *Freikorps*, egged on by the mainstream Social Democrats, reacted with unprecedented violence and brutality. Liebknecht and Luxemburg were murdered, and revolutionaries were mown down or summarily executed in a number of German cities where they had taken control or appeared to be a threat. These events left a permanent legacy of bitterness and hatred on the political left, made worse by another outbreak of political violence in the spring of 1920. A Red Army of workers, initially formed by left-wing Social Democrats and Communists to defend civil liberties in the industrial region of the Ruhr in the face of an attempted right-wing coup in Berlin, began to advance more radical political demands. Once the attempted coup had been defeated by a general strike, the Red Army was put down by *Freikorps* units, backed by the mainstream Social Democrats and supported by the regular army, in what amounted in effect to a regional civil war. Well over a thousand members of the Red Army were slaughtered, most of them prisoners 'shot while trying to escape.'

&gt; **These events doomed any kind of co-operation between the Social Democrats and Communists to failure from the outset. Mutual fear, mutual recriminations, and mutual hatred between the two parties far outweighed any potential purposes they might have had in common.** The legacy of the 1918 Revolution was scarcely less ominous on the right. **Extreme violence against the left had been legitimized, if not encouraged, by the moderate Social Democrats; but this in no way exempted them from being targets themselves, as the *Freikorps* now turned on their masters.** Many of the *Freikorps* leaders were former army officers whose belief in the 'stab-in-the-back' myth was unshakeable. The depth of the *Freikorps*' hatred of the Revolution and its supporters was almost without limit. **The language of their propaganda, their memoirs, their fictional representations of the military actions they took part in, breathed a rabid spirit of aggression and revenge, often bordering on the pathological. The 'reds', they believe, were an inhuman mass, like a pack of rats, a poisonous flood pouring over Germany, requiring measures of extreme violence if it was to be held in check.**

&gt; **Their feelings were shared to a greater or lesser extent by large numbers of regular officers, and by the vast majority of right-wing politicians**...**For these people, socialists and democrats of any hue were no better than traitors**...

Of course, the circumstances between German society in the early 20th century and American society in the modern 21st century are *vastly* differently, most notably the lack of a ruinous global war and violent revolutions. *But the anti-left sentiment as it functioned in Weimar Germany is near-identical to how it continues to function in right-wing circles today*. Right-wing extremists are pathologically unable or unwilling to distinguish between specific liberal, social democratic, socialist, and communist tendencies. They view all mainstream liberals, progressive liberals, Sanders supporters, anarchists, and Marxist communists alike as identical - we are *all* that horde of rats flooding over the country and seeking to devour it from within. And they are ever eager to turn on the liberals who ally with them against the left at the first possible chance.

Compromise is futile and impossible with the far right, be the form they take the alt-Nazi Pepes, alt-lite "classical liberals", or mainstream Republican reactionaries. I'm preaching to the choir here, I know, but just keep this in mind every time some pro-Democrat liberal tells you "politics is about compromise" or "the truth is somewhere in the middle." The far-right factions had no intention of ever letting the Weimar Republic survive, and the Nazis showed no quarter to the liberals, Social Democrats, and Communists alike when they won.Steven Miller could have just has easily been a school shooterSo I used to be involved pretty heavily with my school’s debate team (I know, I know) but this one time, we had to argue either for or against the statement “The U.S. government ought to pay reparations to African Americans” with the implication being that the reparations would be in response to slavery. 

I thought it would be nearly impossible to argue against, but literally everyone I talked to was sternly against it. The most common talking point was “but they weren’t slaves, they haven’t been affected by it and we don’t owe them anything”. 

Which I feel like is pretty much a huge load of bullshit which ignores all historical context, but I wondered what people on the left thought about it. 

PS: if for some unholy reason anyone is interested in hearing about the Lovecraftian hellworld that is high school debate, I’m happy to talk about itI will approach you professionally, as I do every activity, but how dare you? You tiny souls. You malignant professionals. How dare you treat anyone this way. You'll hear from me. Goddamn you.Adam Johnson said that https://twitter.com/adamjohnsonNYC/status/962610114996862978All I see on #tcot twitter and the like is how postmodernism is ruining America. And from what I can make out, it's basically them being angry that a trans person wants to be called by their preferred pronoun or a black person saying they're being treated like shit. Also it gets conflated a lot with (((cultural Marxism )))It's not torture if it's means tested.

Don't @ me SRD losersIf Bernie, or just a progressive generally, takes the nomination, you'll see two responses: Obama's people will support Bernie and Clinton's diehards will not.

Obama's a conservative at worst, liberal at best, but he endorsed Tom Perriello, the Berniecrat, in the Virginia governor primary. His former ambassador, Phil Murphy, a Goldman Sachs guy, ran on a state bank for New Jersey and legalizing Marijuana.

That shows he's a lot like most of the Labour Party. His politics are center-right, but his preferences are for his party to reclaim power, and if that means supporting left wingers as long as Republicans are defeated, he will do it.

Clinton's spent most of her time blaming other people for her loss, and if you believe mugrimm, still thinks she can win and may run in 2020 because fuck it. This is the wing we must destroy.You had ignorant news anchors be all "JAPAN IS AN EXAMPLE FOR KOREA," not understanding Japan murdered them, but critics of those anchors forget Korea HAS and CONTINUES to be influenced by Japan, and no nationalist fervor can change that.

That's the premise: the media was like "oh shit reunification! oh shit peace! oh shit hope!" and then you had editorialists be all "BUT NORTH KOREA'S EVIL, STOP REHABILITATING THE DICTATOR'S SISTER!"

It's like, no, no, no, no, stop ruining the one chance we have at reunification. And DO NOT GIVE TRUMP CREDIT FOR A CHANCE AT PEACE FUCK OFF.Nixon sabotaged peace efforts in Vietnam, escalated the war, murdered or traumatized millions, and directly led to the Khmer Rouge conducting genocide.

Reagan invaded and pummeled Grenada, while arming proxies in Latin America (Contras in Nicaragua and the juntas everywhere else) and the Middle East (Mujaheddin vs Soviets, Saddam vs Khomeini).

Bush Sr. invaded Panama and got rid of Noriega once it was clear he became politically toxic for the former Director of the CIA and one of the architects of Iran-Contra (which Noriega had a part in).

Bush Jr. invaded Afghanistan and Iraq. I don't need to explain. Obama, in his infinite wisdom, expanded that into Pakistan, Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan through drone strikes.

Trump continued the wars, escalated in Syria, escalated in Yemen, armed Neo Nazi proxies in Ukraine, and continues agitating for war with either Iran, Venezuela, or North Korea. Especially if he gets eight years, expect a war, and even if he doesn't get that far, he already normalized the idea of war such that John Kelly is okay with a "preemptive strike."

Pence refused to applaud the South Korean President shaking hands with the North Korean dictator's sister. He also wants war, and if he becomes president, you will get war. It doesn't matter, they're Republicans, they will give you war.

I don't want anybody somehow saying "oh but there's not gonna be a nuclear war," there doesn't have to be for a war to be monumentally destructive and destabilizing to tens of millions of lives. It ALWAYS happens with a Republican President, and it WILL happen under Trump or Pence or Ryan or Cruz or Rubio. They will give you war.Medicaid will get destroyed, then he will target Medicare and Social Security. Not a peep from Democratic Party leadership.The interpretation that many critics have of Medicare for All is wrong. They interpret it as advocates for free healthcare saying that no objective reality or morality exists. While that is the ultimate result of letting advocates of a free and universal health care program utterly consume you like a womb, that's not what single payer health care is exactly.
  
It's actually much more insidious than that, the average Medicare for All campaigners themselves don't go that far, but they do have a lickspittle hatred of any sort of boldness or grandness, in a manner of speaking. They do love their deconstruction and abstraction, to the point that abstraction becomes a feat in of itself.
  
They hate the pure and rational individuals, although I don't care either way about health or anything like that. I care about myself, I live for the sake of myself which you will soon see I do very well while you do very not well.
  
This is what spawns the displays you see in many college stages today, a single-payer interpretation of a health insurance CEO could turn the DSA’s Medicare for All into a story of Aetna the walking phallic symbol who drenches the genderqueer United Healthcare in semen while the naked and whiteface Cigna rubs hot chaffe all over the body while raw dogging a rubber chicken. All of the actors have vaginas, mind you, and are unshaven.
  
I won't go too much into this, I consider myself what you'd call an objectivist, but rather a more heroic and vitalist version of it that delves into the, "rational auto-theistic metaphysical" if you can comprehend it. I know I'll get downvoted, or spitefully upvoted, either way, an argument with the majority of you is useless, so I'll propose this instead.
  
I'd rather not argue fruitlessly, I'd rather collide. I am an extremely probing, analytical, and agile mental body. I can prove this in a game of... common sense, market-based healthcare solutions? Yes, common sense, market-based healthcare solutions, that's what I want. Click the link down below if you hate me so much you want to attempt to humiliate me.
  
This is what I want, your humiliation, but I know you'll attempt to humiliate me. Bonus points if its EPIC electronic medical record documentation software suite, the OP of this little game. I think this will be an interesting experiment, and a potent ritual for my ascendance. Click the link, and we can settle this like true William Frists, eh?
  
https://unitedstatesofcare.org/I was talking to this dude I know today, who was saying as a gen Xer it’s really encouraging to him to see how many millenials and younger people embrace socialism and leftist ideals today, compared to how Marxist movements in the 90s and earlier sort of fizzled out. Obviously it’s true, there’s been a hell of a resurgence the last couple years given the election and everything that happened leading up to it.

My thing is, I’ve always been as left as I thought was possible. I just really wasn’t aware we had any other option than to live the way we do now with some minor tweaks for the better. Where in the past, a catalyst event like the 2016 election or Bernie Sanders running for president could’ve converted me, I feel like young people in the past didn’t get the push left like I did, maybe because the lack of exposure to ideas that access to the internet gave me?

I dunno, I was just thinking about this and it’s something that made me feel a shred of optimism today.It was a two panel comic. First panel had a liberal yelling at someone that it wasn't their job to educate, how dare they ask that, blah blah blah. Second panel is an alt-right guy saying "sure, I'd love to tell you more about crime statistics!" I'm pretty sure it was just a web comic, and I can't, for the life of me, find it anywhere.We need to see how many small donors vs big donors they get, cause they still allow lobbyists and labor unions to donate directly (unless Harris goes full Justice Democrat), but the fact they feel the need to do this is amazing news.

They've realized they're nothing without the left wing. They can't win reelection without the left wing. They're following what Bernie started, because they do not want to face him in 2020. It means the Clinton wing isn't as powerful as it was, and both it plus the Obama wing will have to compromise with us if they want to stay relevant.

This is different from Obama, who talked but never walked. This is different from Clinton, who walked away from talking, didn't even bother. This means there's enough grassroots activism that threatens their election chances.

This is uncharted territory for the modern American Left, and that means we need to punch them in the mouth to make goddamn sure they listen to us like under LBJ and parts of Obama (see net neutrality).Many knee jerk reactions to shootings is “civilians don’t need guns, only police do.” In all honesty it should be “nobody needs guns”, but we all know that American police aren’t giving up theirs any time soon.

So let’s look at how bad the “nobody needs guns except police” take is. First off, let’s state the obvious, we would all be left at the mercy of police. If they hold all the guns, they can effectively do whatever the hell they want to us. More specifically, they are free to fuck with the poor and minorities in general and not fear repercussions.

Secondly, even if we went with “soft gun control”, that’ll most likely mean that guns will be a LOT more expensive, ensuring that the only people with guns will be police and the ruling class, which puts every class lower at their mercy.

I do think that something needs to be done with gun violence, but forcing civilians to give up all guns is not the answer.While we did not know you long, your brief time in this sub a month ago brought us much mirth, merriment, and of course incredulous joy. It has been four long weeks that I have awaited with baited breath for you to return to us and reddit. Yet you have not. Your effort and anger posting in this sub and the lobster-people one was a sight to behold with wonder and amusement. Goodnight my sweet prince, we shall miss you and the fleeting moments of joy you had brought us. Thank you u/lostirl . I will miss you.I have alcoholism running in my family and yadda yadda and I want to be sober for the future(????) I'm facing but goddamn I crave malt liquor sometimesHeaded a fundraiser for Marie Newman, the pro-choice, small donor, Bernie-supporting Justice Democrat against one of the worst Democrats in all of Congress (he voted to ban abortion after 20 weeks, one of only three men in his party to do so).

Get Newman in plz.It's always crowding the front pages. I mean, who gives a shit? Trump ducked a pornstar while his wife was pregnant. He is an unrepentant piece of shit. We know this. Why don't we focus more on Trumps shitty fucking policies? Wow explains a lotSkeet skeet. Hearing Richard D Wolff pronounce Chapo makes me violate my vocel pledgeI saw Chelsea Manning at a 7-11 mini-mart in Fort Meade last week. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for selfies or anything.

she said, "Oh, like you're doing now?"

I was taken aback, and all I could say was "Huh?" but she kept cutting me off and going "huh? huh? huh?" and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like five Sprite soda cans in her hands without paying.

The guy at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like "Mam, you need to pay for those first." At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear him, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When he took one of the cans and started scanning it multiple times, she stopped him and told him to scan them each individually "to prevent any electrical infetterence," and then turned around and winked at me. I don't even think that's a word. After he scanned each can and put them in a bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting him by yawning really loudly.
Their official crimes are financial fraud and identity theft since they were pretending to be BLM supporters.I'm sure you saw the Struggle Podcast guy outright call Killmonger the hero for his ideals of revolution and black liberation.

He was a literal CIA proxy. He speaks of conquest and imperialism under the guise of liberation and revolution.

Why he was used as a stand-in for liberation and revolution, yes, that's a problem, I wanted either a moderate character or a compromise cause that climax was a very liberal resolution, not a socialist resolution.

But please don't be that kind of leftist and call a literal CIA proxy the hero when in the same breath you are also criticizing how Black Panther's token white guy ally is also a CIA agent.

Why talk about politics in a superhero film? I'm using it to address the fuck ups our side sometimes have.Yeah yeah effortpost whatever, but seriously, ignoring whether you're for or against the idea, could the US actually implement mass firearms confiscation? What would that look like? How would it work? 

I'm asking because whenever this comes up I think about the [Sword Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_hunt) in Japan, which was basically a mass confiscation of weapons by the ruling powers in order to cement their rule and prevent the possibility of uprisings. Its a historical example of an extremely well armed, militarized society being forcibly de-militarized from the top down. I never see it brought up in the discussion about gun control because America lives in an ahistorical bubble, but I think it's relevant and I... I guess I'm just curious what y'all have to sayAnd to reject any and all left wings who keep trying to take over the party by smearing them as Russian stooges, I might add.You have a flailing economy that props up bloated state owned industries run by pro-Kremlin bureaucrats, an absurdly unequal society where literal oligarchs run unassailable monopolies, a military-security apparatus filled with reactionaries (siloviki), an angrier electorate who don't like anybody in government except the President (and only just barely), an increasingly radicalized youth who reject Putin's "stability," a powerful church who influence public opinion on the LGBT community, pervasive racism and anti immigrant sentiment, an opposition that is either dead or infighting, an economy propped up by fossil fuels, a powerful mafia who have their own pet oligarchs, and no clear successor to the older and sicker strongman.

Once he's dead (and god forbid assassinated), Russia will descend into chaos as many start jockeying for power, and they even have the same reactionary sentiment among authoritarians that Republicans do under Trump. Actual fascism coming from Russia is a real thing, maybe not as real as the literal Nazis on American soil (or the Holocaust deniers in Poland), but the atmosphere that built fascism's return is very much there in Russia.So according to the indictments, the accused Russians not only popped out propaganda for Trump and the far right, but also for Establishment conservatives, Bernie, and third party candidates like Stein, basically everyone but dear Mother.

EXCEPT, people are saying that these guys also popped out propaganda for the “resisters” and even posted pro-women’s March stuff. So this feels like it’s quickly turning into “you silly casuals are too easily manipulated, let the REAL experts take over politics” in every single party.Particularly from a Russian angle, with sanctions back in the news cycle again I'd like to be able to better defend the assumption I've picked up around these parts that sanctions only impact the people of the targeted countries while leaving the ruling classes alone.Many universities and public works and pieces of infrastructure define the modern United States in ways that are immeasurable.

However, the lack of 1% philanthropy that produces tangible goods and works has vastly been replaced with vapid, amorphous, and inherently inanimate forms of public goodsThe FBI is badSorry to ruin your "fun"Move over John Legend, the real legend, our Big Boss, is steppin in.Murdering 200 to 300 Russian mercenaries in Syria, arming Ukraine against Obama's wishes and the 2016 Republican platform, deploying more NATO troops on Russian borders than Obama, and refusing to leave Syria while insisting Assad should go.

That's a lot more than just the sanctions Obama implemented. But he's not doing what the libs want him to do on Russia so now they're mad.So all we gotta do is accuse them of being Putin Puppets and they'll drop all this Russia talk.Mods, please don't let the quality of this sub go to shit like subs usually do. Y'all mods are few, wise, and precious. We believe in you.  

  
This sub is proof of left unity"But you're gonna take my guns away!"

Yes. You're not worthy. None of you are. Nobody in the world wants an armed fucking American walking around.

That's too far? Gimme a gun registry. Gimme a 21 year old cutoff for who can use and own a gun. Do what Japan does, have them put the bullets in a separate, locked casing away from the gun, and have government officials check up every month or so. Gimme a gun buyback program like Australia. NRA MEMBERS want a background check, 80% of ALL Americans want bump stocks out, we already had an assault weapons ban before it repealed by Bush.

You know why? The damn constitution says a "well-regulated militia." This is NOT a well-regulated militia. The Black Panther Party for Self Defense was a well regulated militia. The NRA taking oligarch money, corporate money, and gun nut money from foreigners (like a Russian banker, randomly), that is NOT a well regulated militia.

I'm tired of having to kowtow to the enablers of mass murder.

And don't think I wouldn't disarm the cops either, they'd be the FIRST on my list.He's a fucking conservative.

That is all.EDIT: Remembered what attacked meant in context, but I wouldn't be surprised with this climate"How should we go about abolishing the CIA and M16?"Fuck this state.I know y'all are probably sick of these posts, but I need to vent a bit, cause my depression/dysphoria is acting up and I gotta get it out somehow, and this is basically the only place I feel like I belong right now.

I've been having a really rough time recently. I'm a teenager, living in a really shitty town with an uber conservative religious family that looms over my mom along with me. The worst part is, I'm figuring out that I'm transgender (she/her pronouns plz), and as I'm making that revelation, I'm getting sicker and sicker of presenting as a guy every day. But besides my mom's family, my town also really is not an accepting place of LGBTQ folks. A gay couple got beaten in a hate attack not long ago, and most of the responses were people like "well, I'm glad someone's teaching those sodomites a lesson".

So more than anything, I just wanna get the fuck out of here. But at the same time, I'm dealing with a cavalcade of fun mental illnesses like depression, anxiety, dysphoria, and OCD, and nowadays I tend to spend more nights panicking and crying instead of doing my homework or studying, so my grades are awful, and it's not likely that I'll be accepted into any out of state schools, if my understanding is correct. Plus, I can't drive, because my anxiety while driving is too much for me to bear.

So I feel stuck, and I don't even have anyone to vent to about it. I'm not really close with any of my friends, and nearly every relationship I've been in thus far eventually turned into me being abused and manipulated, and nearly everyone else around me is either racist rednecks or snobby rich liberals.

So tl;dr I'm totally alone and miserable, and I wanna get the fuck out of this town and away from my awful relatives, but I don't know how or what to do.[Hellworld, baby!](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/us/eric-greitens-indicted.html?referer=https://www.google.com/)It was cool and good watching bitch-ass Marco get slammed dunked on this weekSo basically, over the past few days, many news stations have picked up the far right’s theories about this all being a “false flag” and “crisis actors”. Usually these stories are all good natured, debunking them. But even the debunking segments can be harmful. Do you know how many people I’ve seen on Facebook comment shit like “well, so and so IS kinda fishy”. I’m not talking about right leaning centrists, I’m talking libs, for as shitty as many are, them reading into these conspiracy theories is bad fucking news.

How can someone read into them watching a video literally DEBUNKING them? Well, let me explain. 

Basically, when events like this happens, the FIRST wave of conspiracy theorists are legitimately the weird, reaching, possibly mentally ill types. It is after these types set up possible theories that the more dangerous and more competent theorists hop on these bases and create “connections”. They painstakingly work for hours to make these theories “make sense” (I use that extremely lightly) and then they push it to the mainstream.

So I believe that instead of showing the sadly impressionable general public the entirety of the theory, you just shut it down. These theories are fucking ridiculous and our news anchors should be treating it like that, not drawing diagrams over a fucking boy’s face (even though they’re attempting to debunk the theories). 

That felt good to get off my chest.

Edit: Yes, I did hear about the Parkland student that said CNN “told him to follow the script”. I’m holding off hardcore for more facts before I judge that situation.I hate these fucks so much If it was the police killing a black kid, they wouldn't say shit like "failure is human, still needs to be punished". They'd be all "WELL HE WAS A BIG GUY AND STOLE A 6 PACK WHEN HE WAS 16, THE COPS FEARED FOR THEIR LIVES"

After I lost my Soros check, as well as the ANTI-FA cash reserves were depleted, I'm now trying my hand at crisis acting. Not McCarthy, Woodrow Wilson, this happened way before the 50s. This came at the time of the Communist Revolution when western capitalists like Wilson and the British supported the White Army cause they were terrified of it happening here.

Wilson had his Sedition Act and Espionage Act, which made it easier to wipe out whistleblowers and critics of World War I. He was one of the first modern-day authoritarian presidents, he arrested protesters, he supported the Klan, he censored critics, he re-segregated the military, he supported Prohibition, and whatever else I say about him really can't do justice here. Only Andrew Jackson and Donald Trump really surpass him because one ignored the Supreme Court on his way to committing genocide and the other is literally rounding up families and torturing immigrants in ICE camps.

Anything left of Attilla The Hun was seen and treated as a traitor. Aliens, invaders, unworthy of empathy or mercy. You were subversive from within. Reagan fingered his fellow actors during the McCarthy Red Scare, and decades later, he'd complete it by demonizing "liberal," saying Big Government was the problem, fuck the Welfare Queens, and that was it, that kind of rhetoric really diluted basic political facts in favor of a pro-capitalist, pro-conservative bent.

This was what really caused hyper-partisanship. You had J. Edgar Hoover's FBI crushing anti war movements and the civil rights movement in the 60s and 70s, right as the CIA wiped out the global left wing with their coups and proxy wars. The international left was replaced by the current neoliberal order. 

You had Nixon appointing Lewis Powell who was the deciding vote in two rulings that put money in politics as the law of the land. Gingrich demolishing the House's research committees and ordering his party to listen to think tanks and lobbyists, that paved the way for the Tea Party, which paved the way for Donald Trump, who's paving the way for even worse fascists all over.

All this traces back to the Red Scare, the Brain Drain of America, and it explains why the left has such a hard time even now. Maybe especially now.become his personal bodyguards and do everything in our will to protect Jesus Christ almightyAnd thereby completely adopt vague, faint antisemitism cause of their hate boner for Moscow."Crisis actor" is a brazenly defamatory lie made to attack the character of a survivor and the reality that a massacre occurred. Libel, slander, and direct threats of violence are the only restrictions on free speech (arguably so should doxxing).

But instead I see Cenk Uygur and Kyle Kulinski saying YouTube was wrong to remove a "crisis actor" conspiracy theory video. Ana Kasparian, Cenk's co host, is the only one saying the obvious: defamation is against the fucking law. But instead both Kyle and Cenk are saying it's a slippery slope cause they're worried the establishment may crack down on progressive, independent media in the same way Russian hackers and trolls are being used to smear Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein.

It's usually males who keep insisting on unlimited free speech, including false speech and hate speech, and even say don't crack down on fake news (like the British tabloids who obviously lied about Corbyn being a communist spy) because they're just that petrified of... authorities following the law and cracking down on defamation which is already part of the fucking legal books?

Seriously. Freedumb of speech is right up there with gun culture for sheer American nonsense. If they're worried about a slippery slope, they're forgetting the Red Scare and Operation COINTELPRO, which wiped out the left wing with no need for a slope; it was a fucking bullet.I’m a huge language nerd and I think it’d be really cool to learn Hebrew around native speakers. But I can’t shake the feeling that it would be wrong somehow.

Am I overreacting? I mean yeah it’s not like I’m a ceo doing business with the Israeli government, but it just feels wrongMan, imagine if an establishment liberal takes down trump!

 OH! Then imagine a liberal majority populace that now supports the FBI 100% because the good guys won!

Oh oh! Then imagine the sheer civic nationalism that will occur after that because somehow the liberal populace became weird “I am a real American” and “put the American flag in my twitter name” nationalists after Trump was elected.

ORRRR the liberals fail again and we have a much higher chance of the far right gaining control of the Supreme Court, enacting far right laws that will be enforced for at least 50 or so more years...

I’m so stoked!There's quite literally nothing preventing Trump from screaming "fake vote" after losing reelection and just refusing to let his successor take the White House.

Whassat? The courts will overrule him? Oh no, you must not know of Andrew Jackson. He said the Supreme Court, the top judges in the country, have no authority to execute the law and their opinions are worth less than the shit ring on my toilet.Biographies of Che, Castro, etc. work tooAll it takes is a little push sometimes.God fucking dammit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jExF9ayahx4 You can find it in 00:54I’ll attempt to find some of these pictures, but I remember seeing a few threads about Peterson with pics of his house embedded. It’s some weird shit, he has a giant mural of Lenin, and a fuck ton of pro-USSR propaganda posters in a few rooms.

I was just wondering if anyone knew more about the topic.remind them that the internet, GPS, microchips, satellites, touch screens, lithium ion batteries, image sensors used in digital cameras, vaccines and basically every major technological achievement of worth have been invented by tax funded programs :) It's not a coincidence that we are seeing Jews like Bret Stephens, Ben Shapiro, Milo, Stephen Miller, Dennis Prager, Dave Rubin, and David Brooks everywhere  pushing a narrative that they speak for the American diaspora. THEY DON'T!

American Jews are turning against the Netanyahu government in large numbers and the GOP and AIPAC are sending a message that we need to know our place. 20 years after Rabin's death, the Labor Zionism of Israeli past is DOA and Likud and Yisrael Beitanu has nothing left to win our support except for fear.

From Karl Marx to Emma Goldman to Abraham Heschel to Murray Bookchin to Abbie Hoffman to Bernie Sanders, PLEASE don't forget that American socialism is deeply tied to American Jewry.  Don't let these rightwing pricks rewrite our people's history.After Deng Xiaoping, the capitalist modernizer of the 1970s and 1980s, Jiang was the leader of the CCP and the head of China before Xi Jinping's predecessor, Hu Jintao.

He set up the 610 Office, a secret police meant to crack down on religious practitioners, including Falun Gong, a cult and pseudo spiritual Yoga wannabe thing. Jiang is the reason political prisoners get their organs harvested and sold on the market, and his colleague, former Premier Li Peng gave the go-ahead for the Tiananmen Square massacre.

He's still alive, but many of his men, including former secret police and 610 Office chief Zhou Yongkang, have been purged by Xi Jinping. This has massive ramifications for the CCP, which is now championing the Chinese Dream as Xi's main slogan and governing ideology.

Xi was the compromise candidate leader between the authoritarian Jiang faction and the boring technocratic Hu faction, but since then Xi has been wiping out any and all potential rivals, like Jiang follower Bo Xilai in a massive anti corruption campaign.

The Chinese people know in their bones something's not right with the party, and everyday corruption has been and continues to be a major facet of Chinese politics through Guanxi, which is all about patronage machines and influence peddling based entirely on who you know and how connected you are.

And those who know Jiang, including state owned monopolies, military generals, and party chiefs are being purged by Xi, who's set up a new personality cult and has amassed more power than any Chinese leader since Deng and Mao. 

Now that he repealed term limits (two five year terms, which was Jiang's thing and continued by Hu), that means he's likely to continue privatizing China and pursuing more neoliberal policies that further globalize China. And no, Jiang was not left wing, he came under the capitalist Deng and maintained the same not-quite-yet shock therapy reforms.

This means another blow to the myth that China is any longer communist. China will reach a crossroads, because the only reason the CCP is backing Xi's purges (beyond fear of Xi and/or their Guanxi with him) is cause the party is turning into Putin in Russia or Clinton in America: yet another status quo dinosaur that needs to change or be forced out.

The CCP gets to say they're going after corrupt men without targeting the corruption, but the CCP's internal contradictions may flay the party apart as the purges continue and the factional infighting intensifies.u/Prince_Kropotkin is a thot. he's a freaking nasty hoe. he looks good. i'd love Prince Kropotkin to bust my pussy open and tell me the truth about how hot a hot take is. if a guy shows up with a fucking clenched jaw and an autographed copy of a Kropotkin take he can hit my backwalls any fucking time of day dude. if a guy's like 'i got exiled from r/neoliberal and r/drama for shitposting too hard’ im like “take an effortpost to my pussy just like Kropotkin does to r/neoliberal”I know that they’re Neo-Nazis, have killed people, but receive some kind of EU funding and are idolized by some because they “protect Ukraine from big bad Russia”, but that’s where my knowledge of them stops. Can anyone help me out?During one of Cumtown’s many “shit on Chapo” threads, one person brought up why they didn’t like Chapo or the Chapo culture. I’ll attempt to paraphrase.

“They’re out of touch with what the working class is really like. If they spent time at a factory, docks, truck stop, or any other area where blue collar workers are, they’d call most of the workers ‘problematic’” basically saying that many blue collar workers engage in “joke racism/sexism/homophobia”.

I wouldn’t say that’s a lie either, I’ve worked quite a few blue collar jobs, and whenever casual conversation occurred, 40%ish of the time, the conversation would be stuff that would probably get downvoted to hell here. Shit, even I have admittedly said some iffy stuff just to go along with my coworkers. 

How would you address the accusation that you’re out of touch with “REAL” blue collar workers?PROVE ME WRONGHe also lost all respect for Chomsky.

The two Democratic presidents, Clinton and Obama, only appointed four, which would have been five had McConnell not blocked Garland. Had Breyer and Ginsburg retired, Obama would've had five Justices. Now there's the ever present threat of Trump appointed one (If Thomas retires) or two (Thomas plus a liberal) more, god forbid three more (Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer).Sweet summer childrenReading ~~Naomi Klein~~ Jane Mayer’s *Dark Money* left me with a laundry list of companies that I will never again consciously purchase from.

Apart from the standard MRA points he also posted this

&gt;Sex work is feminist. Women should be able to chose how and when to earn their living and labor done with the hands is the same as labor done with the heart. All the woke feminists should be in support of sex workers

However some years ago he posted this article

https://web.archive.org/web/20170701214957/http:/jackmurphylive.com:80/feminists-need-rape/

&gt;Rape.

&gt;Not quite rape rape, but rape.  The kind of rape a man who loves his girl commits.  Rape conducted under the auspices of consent.  Rape safe enough to allow the feminist to begin to claw her way back from the insanity.

&gt;You see, rape is the best therapy for the problem.  Feminists need rape.

&gt;When a man and woman tap into the power of rape, they connect to the fundamental truth about our two sexes:

&gt;We can kill you.

&gt;When you rape a woman, you remind her of the man she wishes you were.

&gt;They adore you for it.

&gt;Feminists especially.  In fact, it saves their lives.

&gt;It is our duty as men to save feminists from themselves.

&gt;Therefore, I am offering rape to feminists as an olive branch.

Really activates the almonds!

Most Americans, including progressives (like Cenk Uygur) believe "This isn't us" and they can't seem to comprehend how fundamentally antithetical to peace, freedom, safety, security, and stability America - as any other nation state is.

It is not exceptional to think your country is exceptional. Israel is another. I know there's a strong emotional attachment to that settler colonial hellhole many Jews have, but it does not speak even for many Israelis, let alone Jews, anymore than the British Empire spoke for all English speakers or France spoke for all Frenchmen.

This indoctrination is even found in Canada. They like to see themselves as the actual American Dream. They see themselves as America but better. But in truth, they're just more polite Americans, and only less warlike because they don't have the army or the population we do. Basically they're California or New York.

I know everyone's attention span moves at the speed of twitter these days but I'm still stuck on ol' dude getting schooled out by the Proud Boy in the Portlandia Fap Competition. It really genuinely pisses me off. And it's not an isolated incident, we all know it. The inattentive, ED stricken leftist stereotype exists for a reason. You watch that video and everyone is hunched over unable to nut, and then this fucking scum nazi comes and dominates because he's the only one there acting like it's not his first hog crankin' in his entire life. He has a stance, a strategy, he's revisiting XHamster. All I ever see here is people cracking jokes about Proud Boys being sad meatheads wanking to horse nugget porn. Don't make fun of them, CUM HARDER THAN THEM. You're missing the point if you think it's funny that they train for busting. Don't allow yourself to be posterized.

Last part of this dumb rant but I really have to get this out. I just got back from Germany a few months ago, and I didn't plan it but I just happened to be there while antifa in Berlin were going toe to toe with AfD fascists in their biggest march in 2 years. What I saw was night and day different than American antifa. I saw antifa and skinheads both on patrol, organized, every night in the internet cafes ripping thirty foot ropes. Every day in Treptower park. Shit was real. But you know the biggest thing I noticed? Antifa in Germany aren't ignorant little college kids. They're hard ass crusty Pornhub Premium punks in their mid-30's with thick, veiny hogs. They're every bit as well endowed as the serious skinheads they're creaming on out there. Fuckin' hooligans. And the nazis get shut down there. They don't dare show up to certain entire neighborhoods. Denmark was the same.

According to [this](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*1G3DfPrmCSzstQ2u_VS5Lw.png) graphlove y'allRick Banks was the first candidate to receive an [endorsement by the Milwaukee DSA](https://twitter.com/MilwaukeeDSA/status/1024798165566939138?s=09) and I'm proud to help him out. However, Rick needs your help, grey wolves! Rick's biggest opponent is Supreme Moore, the son of Gwen Moore. Gwen is a friend to [Wall Street](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/opinion/upsetting-liberals-gwen-moore-courts-wall-street-and-money-flows-b9934044z1-211753681.html/) and [payday loans](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gwen-moore-payday-lenders_us_5a0c9300e4b0b17ffce214ff). Supreme is backed by the establishment here and has more money than we do. 

So I'm asking you all to at least spread the word on social media. Rick's website is rickbanksforwi.com and @rickbanksforwi across most socials. I believe this is a smaller scale version of what ACO was doing, although with far less money and the fact that **Rick is arguably further to the left than ACO, as he is pushing workplace democracy and co-ops, for example**.

&gt;As a leftist myself and a boomer, I remember having it I think rightfully drummed into us the wrongness of the 'red scare' where right-wingers greatly over-inflated the USSR's wealth and power mostly as a means to generate money for the US military-industrial complex and to vilify the left as 'weak' or evil commies wanting to take your money and freedom away'.

&gt;So I think some on the left are 'triggered' by current 'fear mongering' against Russia as being a 'oh here we ago again with this BS"

&gt;I would urge anyone who thinks like that to ask themselves if they think the 'fear mongering' against the Nazis in the lead up to WWII was completely unjustified fear mongering.

&gt;In my opinion, this country is in as great a threat it would have been if FDR had set himself up as an apprentice to Hitler. There is plenty of evidence Putin is complete scum AND that GOP have colluded with him. This is not making shit up out of thin air, this is REAL.

&gt;And for any scattered American communists out there with sentimental ties to Russia on those grounds, Putin's actions are the furthest thing FROM communist imaginable. Even the Chinese Communist party has a few shreds of that mindset left, but not Russia.

That's at least attempting to commit a conspiracy, plus obstruction of justice, and of course violating the emoluments clause.

Pompeo sent one in response to the Skripal assassination attempt, and that alone caused the Ruble to tank to a 20 month low. Deepens their recession and likely throws a couple thousand poorer Russians out of a job. 

These sanctions include "a ban on granting licenses to export sensitive national security goods to Russia," which means electronic devices and components, along with test and calibration equipment for avionics. Hundreds of millions of dollars in future exports to Russia will be severed, just like that. This comes automatically from Pompeo's determination that Russia violated international law.

If Russia uses chemical weapons again and tries to assassinate a journalist again, Pompeo will suspend state airline Aeroflot's ability to fly to the U.S, and cut off nearly all exports and imports.

A new bill being hot potato-ed around targets Russian banking and their sovereign debt transactions. The bill needs the House to come back from the summer vacation before we see how it goes, but it currently prohibits “all transactions in all property and interests in property” of some of the country’s largest lenders: Sberbank, VTB Bank, Gazprombank, Promsvyazbank, Rosselkhozbank and Vnesheconombank, as well as the Bank of Moscow.

Every Russian banker expects Trump not to be that cruel and to target companies and individuals mostly (via Magnitsky Act they expect), because if you destroy the Russian banking system, you've destroyed Russia, probably permanently.despacito I get that r/ukpolitics sucks.

He used mob firms to build Trump Tower and Trump Plaza. He's allegedly laundered money to the mafia through his casinos. His business ties with Russia usually come from a mafia source like Felix Sater or Oleg Deripaska.

I've even heard from the grapevine that it was the Gambino or Banano crime family who first bailed him out when he went bankrupt in the 80s, and some of the more out-there rumors is he may have covered up mob assassinations by bribing the authorities.

Like, a sentient YouTube comment conspired with the mafia. THAT should be at least part of the damn story in the media. Even TYT, the first source I learned of all this, doesn't talk enough about it.Imagine a future with no posts They should start a band too tbhAnyone going to see Godspeed You! Black Emperor tonight in Brooklyn?googles for "caesar pays rent" etc. just came back with info for little caesars pizza. 

i find it interesting that, from what i can tell from a very passing understanding of roman history, the emperors and military tyrants were much more dependent on the common roman than the senate and many, at least on the surface, were much more responsive to the problems of the common man than the senate

i realize all the landless, marginalized people were fucked either way, but it is interesting to think of a time when those leading a military coup had a more populist message than a republic and curious if that was a more common scenario than i'd assume at first glance

A few months go by, and then on McArdle's Chapo podcast they trash Will's book about fucking up his way to the top.

Chilling, I know. Can you guys think of any evil doppelgängers for the other Chapos?Any time someone mentions racism in a normie sub on this godforsaken website, there’s always one guy who goes “oh, can’t be racist to white people huh?!” and then proceeds to bring up white south africans being run off their farms as though that’s equally as bad as the entire colonization of the African continent

Just the pure historical, willful ignorance they always display is astounding to me. It’s so easy for these fucks to sit in their gamer chairs and scoff at how black people are predisposed to savagery or whatever the fuck, while utterly ignoring all historical context whatsoever. 

It seems like all it takes now to turn a pudgy white dude into fucking Rudolph Hess is someone saying “you know it’s worth remembering that Africans haven’t always had it easy…”. I can’t grasp it. Either I can’t or my brain is trying to prevent me from becoming a tankie and this is my breaking point. It honestly just makes me fucking embarrassed. 

Even just that. I know it’s incredibly privileged to be able to just be mad at how annoying dumb white people can be instead of having to fear for my life because you never know if you’re going to run across a nazi as a racial minority. It’s all so fucked. I know I’m coming at this from a privileged perspective and it’s just rambling, but I needed to vent that. 

Anyways, how’s everyone holding up these days?He said Allison Hartson, Laura Moser, Greg Edwards, Brent Welder, Marie Newman, and Kaniela Ing would all win. Look what happened every single time.

My dude fucking said Dianne Feinstein would drop out before the fucking first round. I've been following TYT since 2009, and Cenk has a fantastic track record predicting the way the winds will blow (even though his timing is terrible), but he gets too emotionally attached to the candidates he loves and he lets that affect his judgment.

Each time he predicted they would win, I took that to mean they'd actually lose, because he predicted too soon (literally the FIRST interview with Hartson he said Feinstein would drop out), doesn't understand local/state politics (Madigan was never gonna let Newman represent the Chicago political machine), underestimated the money advantage (Greg Edwards got swamped last second), doesn't get how even small scandals can kill support overnight (Ing's haphazard campaign spending), doesn't understand how important intersectionality really is now (a woman with Welder's platform would have an easier chance at winning than Welder himself), and doesn't understand how right wing American liberals are (Ing lost to an Iraq War voter).I honestly don't get it, it's made in shit conditions quite often by people who are essentially slaves. It's probably one of the least ethical drugs there is, and it's always shit quality to boot.He mocks guys like Lewandowsky, Arpaio and Cheney by focusing on their actual evils (Iraq, Trump’s response to Charlottesville, bs “rule of law” as opposed to regular libs who think they’re just rude and liars(which tbf is true) As American anti-Semitism is its own species compared to that of the European variant, I'm curious as to what's incubating the petri dish since 1980 or so.Tell me “yikes” and say how “y’all need to do better” below (This is gross, try being a decent human being, we need to do more praxis online, oh sweety etc.).

Lol. This is just sad now mates. He's not a bombastic billionaire, but he's no less racist, no less authoritarian, and because of Trump becoming the new gold standard for conservatism, you know for a fact Kobach would adopt the same fascist language and drop all euphemisms (he's already called for a Muslim registry before).stolen from a 30 year old issue of army man magazineWe're seeing the exact same thing apply to AOC's left wing rhetoric. Medicare For All is now a slogan. Abolish ICE is turning into a strong pillar for activists. Police brutality is now at the forefront of the national discourse (no matter what NFL owners want you to believe).

The center failed in 2016. A fascist President took over and his reactionary government is one of the most corrupt on record. The more he stays in power, the more normal his rhetoric will be, and the more likely the party will say either "I'm the heir to Trump" like Kobach definitely will or "I'm Trump but better" should he face any repercussions.

And just as before, it also applies to us. President Ironstache, President Ocasio Cortez, President Sanders, President Nina Turner, President Warren, whoever it is, will not only continue making socialism a friendly name and face, actual socialism is guaranteed to rise with a social democrat in charge, just as how social democracy grew under a liberal democrat like Obama.

There'll be more vicious language coming as literal Nazis and wannabe Klansmen take over the party, or as Republicans become like Trump (or already were precursors like Paul LePage and Rick Scott). We ain't done just cause Trump and Pence are out.Let them fight.He issued a signing statement complaining about the limits to presidential power, cause it also forces the president to report on North Korea's nuclear activities.

He also doesn't want any limitations on aiding Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. The defense bill finally does reduce our assistance to the Saudis, and Trump is pissed he can't get more people killed as quickly.

This is why he chose Brett Kavanaugh. He wants the imperial presidency to be at its strongest ever.If you watch this clip and still think we live in a meritocracy, you are either rich or an idiot.

&gt;But did he share the same views as the Nazis and their ideological heirs? No. There is more than ample evidence he abhorred the overall racist and philosophical ideals.

no you see, Patton didnt share nazi ideology because he didnt have the SS tattoo on his arm or because he wasnt literally hitler, he couldnt have been a nazi sympathizer. He never said any good things about nazis..oh wait..he did..

&gt;Kippur:  
&gt;  
&gt;*This happened to be the feast of Yom Kippur, so they were all collected in a large, wooden building, which they called a synagogue. It behooved General Eisenhower to make a speech to them. We entered the synagogue, which was packed with the greatest stinking bunch of humanity I have ever seen. When we got about halfway up, the head rabbi, who was dressed in a fur hat similar to that worn by Henry VIII of England and in a surplice heavily embroidered and very filthy, came down and met the General…. The smell was so terrible that I almost fainted and actually about three hours later lost my lunch as the result of remembering it…. Of course, I have seen them since the beginning and marveled that beings alleged to be made in the form of God can look the way they do or act the way they act.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Patton not only showed utter contempt, even hatred, for Jewish survivors, he also expressed a kind of admiration for the Nazi prisoners of war under his watch and bitterly criticized attempts to bring Nazi leaders to justice for war crimes

this lib is shameless trying to rehabilitate general patton because he wants to spin america has a benevolent force at all costs and all times

where is this ample evidence he abhorred the nazis racist ideals?

\`\`\`

&gt;Disturbingly, Patton had zero sympathy for the Holocaust victims living in wretched, overcrowded collection camps under his command. He was unable to imagine that people living in such misery were not there because of their own flaws. The displaced Jews were “locusts,” “lower than animals,” “lost to all decency.” They were “a subhuman species without any of the cultural or social refinements of our times,” Patton wrote in his diary. A United Nations aid worker tried to explain that they were traumatized, but “personally I doubt it. I have never looked at a group of people who seem to be more lacking in intelligence and spirit.” (Patton was no friend to Arabs, either; in [a 1943 letter,](https://books.google.com/books?id=eV2pRL7arKkC&amp;pg=PT176&amp;lpg=PT176&amp;dq=%22mixture+of+all+the+bad+races+on+earth%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kf_MhqGqDA&amp;sig=H4LCFxsD5YttGNkH7TjjV7Z4Vg0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijoP6J0YXRAhXCQiYKHRIEDlIQ6AEIKzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mixture%20of%20all%20the%20bad%20races%20on%20earth%22&amp;f=false) he called them “the mixture of all the bad races on earth.”)  
&gt;  
&gt;The orders from above—Eisenhower wanted him to confiscate the houses of wealthy Germans so Jewish survivors could live in them—embittered Patton. His beloved Third Army was decaying as troops decamped for home, discipline vanished, and meanwhile, “the displaced sons-of-bitches in the various camps are blooming like green trees,” he wrote a friend.\`\`\`

Patton is a piece of shit. As a liberal piece of shit yourself, why do you defend him?

did I summon right /u/CanisMaximus ?

Patton would have fit right in with the nazis. He was more racist than 99 percent of them. There wasnt a single race this man didn't come into contact with that he didn't attack. (except the white race, there he had to be paid to do so. the ultimate racist general. worthy of a liberal's praise. really?)

&gt;Yes, poor, oppressed antifa. The antifa allowed to funraise indefinitely, cover stories consistently run by the media, fluff pieces hilariously sucking them off lol. Imagine the level of cognitive dissonance it takes to have shit like antifada you donate to on patroen with 0 fear of doxxing and thinking you are anything but a pawn for these people lol

and

&gt;They can go around trying to kill people with bike locks and walk away without a sentence, that's how you know your guys have the state behind them. Everything antifa and communists say about cops is just as true for them as it is about cops, if not truer in the era of the bodycam and mass media hysteria the second someone is killed by a cop.

and

&gt;I know you keep exiting shit to try and keep up. But no one has advocated any violence. I mean, let’s be real, the left and antifa types act on the will of the capitalist elite.

this might just be a one off troll though,  i cant imagine right wingers being this stupid to believe the state is running antifa It serves as a platform to humanise ghouls. She had Geroge Bush on in many occasions and basically showcased how nice he is and he is just like you and me. Painting and shit. 

Fuck. One day she will have Henry Kissinger on. Prove me wrong.

Here's a law that says racists can't disenfranchise the minority vote.

Justice: "Hmmm, you're only targeting southern states. You're discriminating! There are racists in New York and California too!"

Chief Justice: "That's a very good point. We should drop this law so the south can be racist alongside the rest of the country."

That's basically how they struck down the Voting Rights Act's most important anti-racist provision. If they talked like Trump, and said "man fuck all these negros," respect for the courts would and should plummet.Trump still has the Kill List that Brennan himself created and used it to kill more people in drone strikes than Obama and Bush combined.

But noooo, he's whining about getting his security clearance revoked. That's the real tyranny.also, guitar magazines (the closest comparison im familiar with) have articles on yngwie malmsteen and shit. somehow, the gun magazines have the same thing about...famous gun shooters? is this a thing, outside of chris kyle and some assassins?

want a gun magazine that says, look, oswald did pretty goodI’m so hungover I can’t move so I’m obviously not going out tonight 

My birthday was last weekend and also one of the worst days of my life and it’s kinda snowballed and shit and I’m feeling super shitty about it still, this is like the 4th day this week I’ve been severely hungover from being hardcore blasted off my ass. woo08X01 - &lt;quote from a musical&gt; Josh pressures a woman into having an abortion. Toby is on the outs when his plan for friendlier, US sanctioned Murder, Inc. faces opposition.

the women fill time, having enough lines to meet the guild requirements for cast membersKansas and Georgia both have candidates running for governor while still keeping their job as State Secretaries, which means they monitor elections and appoint smaller election monitors for counties and districts. With nobody to recuse themselves, they can easily fuck with the voting machines or take advantage of incompetence and pull a Kobach, suddenly winning a primary they were previously losing by at least five points

You may even see unofficial voter intimidation and certainly misinformation to lead people on wild goose chases so they cant vote Democrat. You will definitely see more byzantine voting laws worse than the IDs so it becomes as bad as say New York. 

You're already seeing Georgia considering removing all voting booths in black areas, and if the state Supreme Courts say no, watch out for another North Carolina where they turn judges partisan or stack the courts like Trump and Scott Walker. You may even see Republicans make up charges to impeach and indict judges and Justices they hate.

Once you push that ball, it wont stop tumbling down.Both liberals and social democrats maintain the status quo of capitalism, but do it differently. Social democracy, historically, was always about systemic reform. We say "New Deal" or "New Frontier" or the "Square Deal" or "Great Society" and War on Poverty. Ever wonder why we remember presidents for those programs? They were top-down, back-and-front policies aimed at fundamentally challenging the status quo. They rearranged capitalism, which we found out is not the way to go cause those reforms can be removed. 

Teddy Roosevelt's trust busting and conservation efforts, for an imperialist conqueror, did help level the playing field and create more national monuments that would be protected all the way up until Trump. FDR put in place actual regulations against Wall Street's big banks (the bank holidays destroyed at least half of them). Medicare may be single payer for the old, but it was always meant to be a stepping stone for everyone to be eligible.

These weren't perfect, but they changed the fabric of society.

The reason I hated Obama (as a President, he's a fantastic person) so much was cause he was liberalism personified. There was no grand program, no massive government initiative, no top-down beat-for-beat take on every part of society. He had one policy here, one policy there. You saw him uphold net neutrality when he should have broken up the monopolies. You saw him saying "What I do oppose is a dumb war" and not going for ground invasions, but drone strikes and air campaigns plus spec ops and more troop deployments in places we already had invaded. He should have ended the engagements. You saw him give 10 dollar minimum wages to federal workers when he should have at least made it a living wage. You saw him give overtime pay when there should not be a need to work overtime for ANY pay.

You see the difference? What change did his policies give to the fabric of society?

And even so, a man who ran on hope and change, then delivered pocket change, meant the left wing grew as they were disappointed and dismayed that he was not doing what he said. We would not have Bernie as such a household name were it not for Obama. 

The left is at its strongest vs Trump because we were given eight years to grow under a liberal president who didn't help us. We came as a response to Bush, yes, but also as a response to Obama, because he combined the nascent liberal groups that formed in response to Bush into his own power base and faction that overthrew the Clinton machine. There always was a grassroots movement under Obama. We have Black Lives Matter, we had Occupy Wall Street, we had even TYT and others like it at their biggest under Obama, we had Feel The Bern, Fight For 15, and so many others building up so we could later challenge Trump. If we had Romney or McCain before Trump, there wouldn't be such a strong movement, just as how the left didn't challenge Clinton and thus were powerless against Bush's first six years.

Now look. Trump makes it easier for people to realize something's fundamentally wrong if this is the same system that let Donald Trump in power. That's where we come in and say, with actual credibility and mainstream attention, the system must be overturned. Social democracy is back as a mainstream populist alternative and once we get a social democrat, whether it's President Sanders or Warren, or if we keep up such pressure that a liberal like Gillibrand or Harris is forced to govern from the left, that gives us much more leverage and influence than under a fascist President or standard Republican asshole.where’s this week’s chapo Thankfully, the jerk-off motion I just did was so over-pronounced, it opened up a black hole and swallowed the entire building'500 ppm of CO2 is good for plants.

Alan Moore has to be one of the few comic book writers who isn't a neoliberal or a right winger or a full blown fash (cough Frank Miller cough). I will always respect him for never backing down from the horrible, predatory behaviour of the comics industry. The absolute lad of comic books. Can you imagine removal of George Washington statues? I'll give it at least 30 years before you guys even think of it. 

Canada is so far ahead. Will, I bought the book, but it’s not at my door yet. Why is my book late, Will? When is the book going to get here, Will?Genuine question, not trying to provoke anyone Spoilers for the Life is Strange 2 demo, I guess, if you care about that kind of thing.

There's a scene where a cop pulls up on three kids--one (16-17) gasping on the ground with fake blood on his shirt, two others (9 and 17) standing there and trying (albeit while panicked) to explain the situation.

The cop proceeds to draw his pistol and yell at them to get on the ground. They do.

The father of the two kids comes out, tries to assess the situation, telling his kids to be quiet, and so on. The cop points his gun at the kids on the ground. the father walks forward, hands up, trying to talk to the cop and get the muzzle away from his kids. Cop fires, dad dies, scene goes on.

And you still get comments saying "A cop would never act like that, that's just anti-cop propaganda" or, even worse, "Well actually, the cop was in the right!" 

This is something I've mulled over before. An ordinary citizen will be put under a fucking magnifying glass any time they do something incorrect--"Were their hands up? Did they look like they were going to move? Were they saying threatening things?" The list goes on.

Cop blows someone away--adult or child--and the burden of responsibility is placed on the citizen by society at large. That cop's previous aggression or domestic abuse is swept to the wayside. Cue people talking about how it's a high stress job, how a cop's primary goal is getting home--really? When surgeons fuck up over and over again, do we let them shrug and say they're just stressed? When a teacher just puts on a movie for the class and chills out, do we let them say that they're just trying to make it through the day?

But even in the era of recording everything, after Daniel Shiver's execution, people will say in perfect unison, "but cops don't act like that." How many videos do they need to see? Ten? Twenty? A hundred? What percentage of the police force needs to be observably psychopathic for it to be an "issue?" Satan-worshippers are an "issue," transgender 'radicalism' is an "issue"--but actual, objective death and destruction just isn't enough?

It's quite remarkable to see. I suppose part of it is denial--no one wants to admit that they live under a paramilitary force that could seize their property or kill them on accident or on a whim and get away with it. People want to believe they live in a just society, perhaps, and are willing to delude themselves even when material reality shows them otherwise.

Anyway. Takeaway: know first aid and basic medical knowledge, have a vest if you expect to be confronted, prioritize keeping yourself and your family alive over your momentarily flare of ego.Because there was an actual factual basis and likelihood of Trump being found to have violated an actual law. Whereas the Russia shit will never manifest in anything, Trump getting his hog jerked is actually a threat to him, which is also very funny. Libs seem to think the Pentagon will say no because of Mattis being Defense Secretary.It's obviously Trump, and this is a confirmed crime that's finally on the public record. So Cohen so far hasn't said a thing about money laundering, email hacking, election interference, and he hasn't actually flipped, but called for a plea bargain.

But he hasn't officially cooperated with the Mueller investigation, which is odd. I think Cohen's trying to let Trump know he's ready for a pardon. The prosecutors are trying to get every single crime on the record so they can uphold the rule of law and bring justice to career criminals.

Worst case scenario is that's it. This is all Cohen has on Trump. It's still a violation of campaign finance laws. But he's not getting thrown outta office for it.Drain that swamp.Lol, this is everything. Fuck yes. 

https://youtu.be/YKS6KNwAhPw
He suggested Trump knew of the email hacking ahead of time and cheered it on as long as it got rid of Hillary Clinton. Nothing about coordination, cooperation, or any personal and direct involvement from Donald Trump or his campaign outside of Manafort's clique.

Maddow, as she is wont to do, didn't say the most obvious question: doesn't that mean he just knew but didn't cooperate or coordinate with Russia?

That's the heart of the collusion part of the corruption probe. Did he commit a conspiracy to receive illegal oppo research from a foreign government? As far as Cohen's lawyer has said, apparently not, just that he knew Russia would get involved and did nothing about it cause it benefited him, much like Mitch McConnell.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/22/danny-boyle-quits-bond-dispute-films-russian-villain/

&gt;Rumours that the film's script was the source of the disagreement have been reported, with producers alleged to be unhappy with the decision  to focus on contemporary political tensions with Russia and a "modern-day Cold War".  


So glad to see lefty producers realising the grift of modern day russophobia.  Seriously. Trump gives them more overt support cause of all the outrage he generates from who he is and what he does. Pence is quieter and would be the exact same shit as any Republican president, minus the overt fascism (see Stephen Miller and Trump's concentration camps).

I happen to think Pence is vastly overhyped, incredibly dumb (probably dumber than Trump), and so easy to beat, you could win with Andrew Goddamn Cuomo. You'd take it in a landslide, that's how easy Pence is to beat, because he doesn't have a personality cult and he'll be the next Ford. Nobody wants to get out on the streets to protect Mike Pence the way they do with Donald Trump.

But I don't think Democratic strategists, lobbyists, and consultants are smart cause they're trying to get the party to NOT campaign on Medicare For All, not even their usual trick of saying Medicare For All when they really mean universal healthcare (which is code word for keeping it privatized). They definitely think Pence would be a return to business as usual, a triumph of the institution, and a reclamation of civility n shit.

They're okay with President Pence cause they think he's gonna be great for bipartisanship and "compromise" like under Obama. But they don't fundraise off him like they do Trump. That plus Wall Street loving him says to me that Democrats won't do a thing against Trump the way they didn't do shit to Bush or Reagan.

It just feels like so many are setting themselves up for disappointment regarding the corruption probe.I keep saying. These guys will cover for Trump just like they did Bush.

She didnt even say if collusion was proven, just something bigger than hush money or campaign finance violations.So that's a thing.I dont even think Mueller getting dumped will hurt him either.https://mobile.twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1032383267331166213?s=19

Hold us Jezza!Obviously corporations at any moment can pull the trigger on content posted on their platforms. That being said, a lot of leftist media is being cracked down on by entities like Facebook as they attempt to combat “fake news.” Like most suppression of speech under capitalism this is going to bite the left much more than the right. 

Any leftist saying “actually this is a private entity so they can ban you as much as they want” and turning that into a normative claim about a private business entity rather than merely a statement of fact is also a pseudo-leftist who actually doesn’t care about criticizing the mechanisms of capitalism. It’s not a good thing that corporations control our media and what is and is not printed. Jones can merely move over to his own website and keep publishing his content. https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-quashes-german-foreign-minister-heiko-maas-anti-american-dream/

Chapo Trap House is facing a time of great moral and venereal crisis.

I walked into work tonight, and the guy I was relieving is ranting about normal chud stuff, about gay wedding cakes and the media being unfair to Trump(he flat out says that the only legitimate news source is Fox; I asked about Breitbart and apparently they criticize him from the right so that's a no go for him, but that's another story).  Anyway, immigration comes up, and we're talking about people coming from Mexico and he says they're getting rid of our culture and they will dominate our culture soon.  My other (high functioning liberal) coworker said we're a melting pot.  The chud says (paraphrasing) "You're right, no group has ever dominated America's culture like the Mexicans will if we allow them to come here".  I asked him what he thought American culture is and he says "Capitalism, in Mexico they don't have capitalism, they have drug lords and things are much better here, why do you think America is so well off if not the culture?".  I said the slave trade and imperialism, and he responded by saying slavery has been around forever and it's fine as long as you treat them well because God said it was okay in the Bible.  He went on to say that integration should have never happened and it made our country worse.  Somewhere around the slavery line I was pretty much speechless. At this point, it's about an hour and a half after his shift ended and he finally gets tired of yelling and goes home.  I don't know if I've ever met someone so reactionary.It must be tiring to be so blatantly dishonest.

So... I'm all ears.

And before you say "under a capitalist framework it's all fucked anyway," let's at least entertain the idea that incrementalism works in this hypothetical.

They're like Trumpers, but with less fat and better fashion. Not restricted to "let's talk about the Cold War from US perspective," of course.You can't oppose immoral wars and support those that fight them.This disaster has finally been the exact moment in which we can point and prove the fact that we are without a doubt on our own. There's no saving us, or anyone, anymore.  
  
On one hand, I'm not naive to think that this hasn't been the trajectory coming for a long time, but Trump has helped to lay naked the complete and total breakdown of our government's ability to rationally respond to disasters.  
  
The response to this disaster has at best bordered on surreal, and at worst has been horrifying in a way that is so bad that it transcends one's mental capabilities to understand it. We're on our own, folks. We're not losing the battle, it's been lost.Over the last year, some people in my friends list have basically gone full Proud Boy, and espouse paper thinly-veiled white supremacist views regularly, even on posts by people of color. Personally, my approach is to mock them relentlessly to make saying nazi bullshit as untenable as possible, but I'd like to hear how other people handle chud dipshitsI just want to say FUCK capitalism, FUCK the NFL slave owner mentality, and FUCK any players that put their integrity behind them and stood.

I know this doesn't seem like a big deal for some, but a lot of POC were inspired by the protest, and for it to be dropped in one week makes me really sad. 

There isn't one overall factor to blame here so I'll list all 3 lessons we should take from this: 

Don't expect millionaires to truly care about social issues (the ones that do are a rare exception), Capitalism a SHIT, and just because POC become rich doesn't mean they can't get "whipped into submission" by the establishment.

I know I've posted about this before, but this protest mattered, sad to see it abandoned so quickly.Want to start listening since everyone is always raving about it.The worst part about America's mass shootings curse is that we're numb to them by now, which makes actually doing something less and less likely. I remember being glued to the TV during Sandy Hook; my little sister was the same age as the kids who were killed. But no mass shooting has felt as real as that, probably because they happen all the fucking time. Fuck these old assholes obsession with guns, fuck their insecurity about their masculinity.When liberals discuss gun control, their continued solution is simply to get rid of civilian weapons, saying "only police and the military need guns" which at the very least is misguided and at the most is down right dangerous.

If your American gun control strategy doesn't also include disarming the police, then you're practically welcoming a hardcore police state. Hell, as of now, many of the gun control laws that exist are actually really fucking racist.

Do I agree with gun control laws? Yeah I do, but only if the populace isn't left to the police's Mercy.*even if America somehow, by a miracle, gets a dem president in 2020, there is no goddamn why anything resembling political reform gets passed unless Nancy Pelosi (agrees with it, which unlikely), gets primaired (highly unlikely) or retires bitch (more likely then not) Nancy Pelosi and other Clintonite sympathizers must be shoved off to the side for a brand new political climate
if not, say hello to 8 years of TrumpPassions are high, everyone feels strongly, I get it. But I just want to go back to laughing about Caleb, dunking on McMegan, and plotting the downfall of the bourgeois. This shit cracks me up, and I'd love to hear some piping hot Democrat voice takes from my fellow dirtbagsI didn't know the capitalist class was so endearingly inane, or that they fought demons sometimes.

how're the rest of alla yallz hope you're all having a better day than I am.

I've been sleeping all day after going to the ER at 5 in the morning feeling like my stomach was trying to rip itself in half. Not in a ton of pain now, but I still feel gross and sick. :(I found a document on my big, strong boy’s computer today, it was titled “Rules and Suggestions For Stealing Valor”

Is this something I should be talking to him about? Should I ask him who his commanding officer was?I knew Roiland was a libertarian "classical liberal" type but for some reason I always thought Harmon was cooler than that. He's making himself look like a complete ASS on Twitter right now all because his meme sauce bullshit blew up in his face.Examples might sound something like:
"Pardon me, are you Donald Trump, c*nt?" (that's a little riff on Hamilton)

"How does a failson, fat guy, son of a klan-dad who was rotten, plopped in the middle of a - priv--leged spot in the big city, draft dodgin' with trust fund in place through college, go on to beat my Mother and her followin' (another little riff on Hamilton)

Let's write Hamilton 2 to beat DrumpfThe Zone commands it.That video just fills me with despair and dread in a way I’ve never really experienced before. It’s just a perfect culmination of a society poisoned by memes and brutal capitalism

Anyways, how are you guys coping with The Zone now?I’m open to ideas, I’m just looking at what other people have to say on it

Edit: I should say the police force as it’s run now, not necessarily the concept itselfIt might just be my crabs, but I'm itchin' for some ChapoAlso, giving a shit about rape victims and being sensitive to their issues is not going to "turn off normies", because many "normies" are women (and men!) who have been assaulted and won't be down with people joking about. I swear to god I think some of you believe that every "blue collar normie" is some more hardcore chud version of Nick Mullen sitting in rural ass Indiana or wherever the fuck and won't be into left politics because someone told them they have to be even the most basic level of self-critical.

*by the way, just because someone told you that you have to be the most basic level of self-critical doesn't mean that this sub is turning into an authoritarian leftist r/socialism or whatever the fuck. Turns out most left people take rape pretty seriously and that claiming to be a "dirtbag" doesn't get you off the hookSo something I'm extremely passionate about is a national implementation of comprehensive sexual education that emphasizes affirmative consent. I live in Illinois, which isn't terrible on this issue, but the vast majority of states don't require comprehensive sex ed, and a disturbing number of states either don't require ANY sex ed, or allow for sex ed that isn't medically accurate. 

So why is it so important? Clearly, abstinence-only education is fucking stupid and I'm not going to address it. But even in states where sex ed is a requirement (or optional - which is what a majority of states have), there is virtually no discussion of affirmative consent. Explaining affirmative consent to kids BEFORE they become sexually active, in my view, will significantly reduce the % of people who talk about sexual assault and rape flippantly. 

Back when I was lead politics reporter for my college's student newspaper, I wrote a piece about how fucked America's sex ed system is. The fact of the matter is that there are literally millions of young men that don't even hear the word "consent" until they enter college, either because they didn't have a sex ed program in their high school, or because their sex ed program never discussed it. 

Tldr; I really think there should be more public discussion about a dramatic overhaul of sex education in America that mandates discussion of affirmative consent. Educating kids early about affirmative consent and why it matters, in my view, will result in a massive drop of people who take sexual assault and rape lightly.


Side Take: Will and Matt definitely fucked up w/their picture. It was insensitive to the very real victims of Cosby that have lived with really fucked up memories for years; some for decades. I think they were trying to make an ironic joke along the lines of "ok, he did bad stuff but Cosby is our heritage," which I take as a jab against Confederate chuds. It was a really stupid picture, they shouldn't have taken it. But I think stuff like this won't happen as often if boys are taught early and often what affirmative consent is. I fucking love Chapo, and Will and Matt, and I do give them the benefit of the doubt on this. But I think the photo is a symptom of a broader problem: failing to educate America's students about what affirmative consent is and why it's extremely important

Quick Edit (last thing I promise): I think that there is a pretty clear link b/t lack of education about affirmative consent and college rape. Think about it: how many male college students, who have never been told what affirmative consent is and why it matters, go on to commit sexual assault because they literally don't know what non-consensual sex looks like? This isn't to make light of or dismiss the depravity of rape and sexual assault, and it isn't about excusing the behavior of men who assault women. But I do think that there would be fewer assaults if more people actually knew what consent is and why it matters.Stop posting (don't actually) and start drinking.Sarcasm. This will be very, very badI would have to imagine he'll have a more comprehensive foreign policy, maybe more information about funding models for MFA/tuition-free college; basically, no substantive changes from 2016, just more detail. But I think it will be *how* he conveys that information in 2020 that will be telling. Will he try to appeal to moderate rebels and suburban wine moms? Will he double down on anti-establishment progressive framing? Chapos, let's gowot if.......posting spent your life force? 

wot if every time ya did a post, it took a day from your lifeEli Lake, Kurt Eichenwald, Peter Daou, there’s a conspiracy in here somewhere…Guy Fieri is a secret comrade and Diners Drive Ins and Dives is good praxis.I know about the Cosby joke and all that. But from what I’ve heard he resigned from DSA because he wasn’t addressing allegations of sexual harassment from members? Is that all current/accurate?Hello posts. It’s post. It’s your morning post.Run wild in the comment section, conradsTo me, belief in conspiracies about mass shootings is nothing more than a projection of an individual’s own refusal to confront the possibility that life is completely random and without purpose. That thought terrifies them to their core because they KNOW that THEY’RE special, that THEIR life has a bigger purpose. 

When people peddle conspiracy theories like the ones around the Vegas shooting, they can only be 1 of 2 types of people: mind-bogglingly stupid or deeply craven and psychotic. 

It’s pathetic, it’s cowardly, and it’s horrific to subject the families that lost loved ones to insane conspiracies. The fact that the families of children who were murdered at Sandy Hook still get death threats from conspiracy chuds riled up by Alex Jones makes me fucking shake with rage. Fuck conspiracy theorists, fuck having to invent insane bullshit to make yourself feel special. Roast me and/or tell me what to listen to. I need more groovesFuck Trump and the white supremacists he has emboldened, but ultimately they don't have much power.

George Bush kicked off multiple wars that has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands/millions and encouraged the torture of an insane amount of people that were never officially charged with a single thing.

The fact that neoliberals see George Bush as an ally and FRIEND should show you that with liberals in power, shit will always be just as bad. We need further left politicians or people will continue to suffer.Title, basically. 

Back in the day the Civil Rights people seemed like the could pack the jails and so forth, but it seems like these days you'll get slapped with terrorism charges and sent to a super max for the rest of your life. Thoughts? “Folks, bohemian grove? It’s the most faggy goddamned thing I’ve ever seen, believe me. It’s tremendous, I won’t shake hands with anyone from San Francisco”I troll the Fox News comment sections, and you should too. 

I’m absolutely fascinated by Fox News; its corporate culture, the methods it deploys to convey its message (subtle and overt), the histories of their anchors, etc. It really is an entity unlike any other. I wrote a research paper and a few columns about Fox back in college


But the one thing Fox has that is beyond any kind of comprehension is its audience. These people are the strangest and most predictable dullards on the face of the earth. Think of the type of person that watches Fox News regularly. You’re probably thinking of some angry grandpa, since the average of their audience is nearly 70. Now imagine the angry grandpa that liked Fox News soooo much, he figured out how to use a computer, went to Fox News’ website and made a profile, just so he could use antiquated racial slurs on articles about how BLM joined forces with Hezbollah to use WMD’s in the War Against Christmas. 


These people are exactly who you’d expect them to be, which is why it’s so much fun to fuck with them. I made a profile once called “AverageFoxViewer,” stock photo as an old hillbilly for the profile pic, and even though my posts from that account were clearly satirical, 1/2 of the time they never caught on.


So yeah, I fuck with the Fox comment section because it is the single funniest thing on the Internet. i listened to most of the movie or tv eps. and wanted some well-made, recent shlock propaganda.

i watched select parts of patriots day and had some fun, so i looked for similar stuff. I rewatched United 93, but it was actually really good. Then i watched the indian movie the assault on 26/11, and that was was some quality propaganda - ignored incompetent police while turning fucked up young guys sold to terrorists into terminators. Would recommend.

I've seen Stone's WTC, which is dull shlock. Any recs for recentish, well executed but inherently gross militaristic, based on the real world action thriller dramas?

Or should I watch 24?
plz remember there are comrades that posted there and not all of NEOGAF were clintonites. Also everyone fucking hated Evilore that I know of and there had also been whispers of him being a creeper long before that FB post came up.

So... Now what? UGH

So apparently a representative of Blaine Lutkemeyer and Ann Wagner are teaming up to bring the second Amazon HQ to STL and OH MAN THE DUMBASSERY IS JUST BEGINNING.

No one in Franklin County worth their own salt would burn a gas tank in both ways commute to this Amazon HQ. I mean why would you IF IT MEANS BURNING A GAS TANK BOTH WAYS for the daily commute.

Good god fuck this wasteland of a state and fuck capitalismJesus fucking christ get some perspective. The left isn't losing because someone was mean to you on the internet, or called you out for being a doucheweasel towards transpeople, or whatever shitty thing you did that you're upset you didn't get away with. The problem is that a little less than 2,000 individuals control 7.1 trillion dollars worth of wealth and capital. *Get over your self righteous fragile bullshit*. Was just told by my therapist that my sessions will be shortened to a hard enforced 45 minutes when they routinely go about an hour and 15 minutes every week because Ohio's Medicaid behavioral health system has been redesigned and that's all that they'll allow. This coming after I asked if I could get a second session a week which I couldn't, because Medicaid also wouldn't allow that either. So instead I'll just have to just fucking take it and sit here slowly getting worse faster than I'm getting better all because us fucking poors that have mental conditions that keep us being poor don't deserve more than the absolute bare minimum of treatment the statement can fucking afford.Kiefer Sutherland is a better Snake than David Hayter.It’s fine as TV shows go, but holy shit people, the writing is mediocre as fuck. The reason everyone freaks out about it is because it’s “retro” or whatever, which makes no sense because the vast majority of people who freak out over it weren’t even alive in the 80’sI’m a regular troller of the Fox News comment section, so I can appreciate the comedy of it, but is it just too bad?This shit is extremely annoying right?

Liberals are absolutely losing their minds and are stalking Twitter for randos who have it on the highest authority that top Trump officials are going down. Let's use the politics thread on NeoGAF replacement SLAENT for an example:

https://slaent.com/thread/973014/page/159/

People are acting like junkies and every bit of Mueller related info is another hit.

My question: why? I can understand the argument that removing Trump is a net good. But when his replacement is going to be Pence or Ryan, I cannot for the life of me understand why people are acting like all our asses are about to be saved.

What is with that shit? It really is incredibly annoying right?The_Mueller is just one of the many recent shitlib subs to pop up and dominate the front page. At least the admins had the sense to ban T_D from the front page, can we get this bullshit off there as well?

Also, I want to rant on how fucking dumb people are to jerk off intelligence agencies right now. We just found out that the FBI destroyed crops in Cuba, intent on starving them, AND planned to stage bombings in Miami, all to serve their own needs.

I just can't handle the complete ignorance of neo-liberals who think these glorified secret police are here to save them. God help us if they actually brought down Trump (I'm betting they'll only get Flynn), they'd let intelligence agencies do whatever the fuck they wanted as a reward. They'd turn a blind eye to some pretty horrific things because "they saved us".

Fuck secret police, and fuck their enablers.It’s the manager of Comet Ping PongThe problem where that immediately breaks down is uh, you know, the extremely large amount of Palestinian Jews, of which I am one those? Where the fuck is the protection for them? Or is it just the whitest Jews who get protection?

Sorry if that's extremely obvious, I am also very very drunk, but after reading replies to the Corbyn/Netanyahu stuff I'm kinda tweaked. Grey wolf since this summer, but don’t know where this iteration of Felix’s Hillary impression comes fromI'm gone for one fucking day and a new meme is bornI’ve had this thesis for a few years now: The further on the right a person is, the greater the likelihood that their brain is incapable of processing irony.

He went on at length about how he never attacks anyone, then proceeded to attack everyone. He claimed Mother was a progressive icon. He called Chapo &amp; TYT grifters who aren’t real progressives. This demands a thorough dunking on Thursday’s show. 

Keep Peter’s fire alive, Chapo. Feed. That. Troll. So glad to see the end of sanctuary cities!We may not be the absolute boy, but we’re fucking coming for the neoliberal establishmentopen to most anything*dont take the hump thing too literally soldier, you still have an oath to keep.Outside of the New Republic piece, almost no one is talking about that raceMy father joined the military right out of high school in the late 80’s. He ended up being deployed in combat three times. In Panama, the first gulf war, and Mogadishu. My strong anti-war feelings, in large part, were instilled in me from growing up around him and watching him suffer constantly from PTSD. I’m not about to start defending the conflicts he was involved in, much the opposite, but it continues to anger me that he among many others sacrificed their youth, health, and their entire future in service of politicians that couldn’t be bothered to give a shit about the consequences of an imperialist foreign policy

I know I’m preaching to the choir here, but I say all that to make the point that we cannot tolerate warmongering from our representatives under any circumstance. I realize that an anti-war stance is largely implied with being a leftist, but I think we need to make a habit of being more vocal about it, especially when the right is inevitably going to get back on their bullshit with Iran in the coming years

Discuss.So I was at work and my coworker asked me what the password was to the TPS reports or whatever and I told her I set it to "BernieWouldHaveWon" and she PUSHED herself away from her desk and said "NO. DON'T EVEN JOKE ABOUT THAT. I CAN'T STAND BERNIE BROS." and in the time it took me to change it I told her I was just kidding. AMA.Obviously the Grey Wolves are a pretty diverse group as far as the left spectrum goes, and I just wondered what you all thought about things like thisI’m sure a lot of y’all keep up with DSA at least a little bit, but I just wanted to say it here in case. A lot of chapters around the States have been doing free flu shot clinics, free brake light repairs, etc. these past couple days. It’s pretty obvious that this is one of the best strategies for winning people over, actually getting out there and helping people in a visible and important way. 

We’re probably going to be alone in doing these kinds of things and that’s going to help a ton if we keep at it. We’re doing this, meanwhile Turning Points USA are busy shitting in diapers to own the libs. And you’re sure as hell not going to see a bunch of centrist neolib groups out there in the streets. 

That being said, this has to stay constant and we can’t lose momentum. So if you’ve been out here helping at these events or something similar, you’re a top tier comrade. And if you have the ability to help and volunteer, I hope you will do so. 

This is such important work, and it makes me proud as hell to be able to support it however I can and to be apart of a group that actually gives a damnI hear constantly on here that “they’re just a meme” but I mean it’s a pretty clear cut ideology.

They like the economics of Marxism, but only want white people to benefit from it. They reject the social aspects of Marxism and only embrace the economic standpoint.

Their ideology can be summed up by a few words: they want working class white people to seize the means of production.CHAPOOOOOS IN HISTOREEEEEE

I’m watching the first ep of Ken Burns’ The Civil War  rn, and John Brown is a fuckin’ Chapo. Buddy led slave revolts and murdered the shit out of slave holders (a.k.a. the bourgeoisie) WITH FUCKING BROADSWORDS. When he was caught and hanged, he was unrepentant as fuck, and basically flipped the bird on the way down. Prime dirtbag left material, prime Chapo.

that was violence.love too have all my sleep robbed by the stress of hellworld Why are we still hereexcited for the weekend which I will spend alone doing nothing just like I do the rest of the week ✌️Not for any real reason, we can just like…idk drive it to DSA meetings?I’ve been listening through their back catalog and I guess I just don’t get why they’re so popular in left circles. They seem like center-left libertarians more than anythingrunning, folks, it's good for the mental health. some of you cynical bastards need to hit the treadmill. feels good man.I kinda don't blame him for being shitty towards some of the vocal BDS artist types (Roger Waters etc) because I think they are honestly dicks about it, and I think BDS is mostly dumb performative bullshit to begin with. ok ready for roasting.I alluded to this last night, but I was talking to a friend of mine about going to a DSA event a couple nights ago when a different friend who was sitting next to us kinda like scoffed and started talking about how the DSA sucks because it's "a straight white male fest." I said I didn't think that it's true (note: it's not true) but I didn't want to be a dick so I wanted to hear him out. I asked him if they had actually done something that was bad/racist/tone deaf or not sufficient in terms of reaching out to POC and he kinda dodged the question, so I asked why it was exactly that they were bad and he just kinda said "well you should know."

I feel bad because dude is pretty left and I don't want to be dismissive of the things he's got to say, but honestly...I think that's kind of some bullshit, and I still don't know what the problem is supposed to be with the local DSA, and didn't get any closer to finding out since I got basically an "educate yourself" answer. It honestly seems like empty liberal identity politics bullshit, but also I feel like sort of a reactionary dickhead for feeling that way too.

#0Mine would be The Wind That Shakes The BarleyI think if we could get alt-righters to be terrified of kosher and halal food all of our lives would be amazingly better. 

They mainly live off processed food and so much processed food has the little k or something similar on the front to denote it being kosher. So if we could get them to believe kosher food has mind controlling fluoride or something in it, they would change their whole diet and eliminate most foods from the grocery store. 

Can Vic Burger please do an expose on the dangerous chemicals introduced to foods for them to be categorized as kosher?

How do we meme this into existence?It's a good western folksThis is canon, I have the verrit codes to prove itLike, I kinda just want a labelled playlist of all the shows, instead of somelongbullshitmachinereadabletextstringthatmightbechapoormightbesomethingelse.mp4 which is what I get when I download the show directly to my phone. Like can I downoad them all from Patreon as an archive or something? I can't wait until we have a bunch of unironic volcels thanks to the chapo subreddit I had to read it in college and even back then the unspoken class privilege she enjoyed bothered me. She'd get in trouble with the morality cops and her affluent dad would bail her out. Or she got to go to school abroad. Wow, so tough.


There's a part where she complained about having to deal with a government bureaucrat. All the official positions were filled with Islamic Republic loyalists so she was frustrated with this incompetent lackey. Of course that's how a middle-upper class person is going to experience oppression.


Definitely not fond of theocracy but c'mon. 2017 is the year I found Chapo, and the year I found y’all. You guys and gals rock, this sub rocks, and c’mon, how much worse could 2018 get, right?There is a sick obsession with strength and power. They are first measured pedantically by scouters. Down to the last decimal point, about how strong they are. 

Later on the show devolves around who is stronger. A darwinian spiral. The strongest is treated as the most virtuous and good. The weak are cast aside. The lack of women and the contempt for women is self evident. 

Don't forget the problematic subtext of turning blonde and blue eyes to become stronger. 

This show sucks. But I am not surprised why it was a phenomenon in neo liberal America. Are there any lefty anime shows? STAR WARS IS GOOD AGAIN PEOPLE.

I guess I'm just one of those people who are cynical as fuck.

This paragraph in particular is especially illuminating. Damn.

&gt;During Bane’s occupation of Gotham, we briefly see Selina and her friend Holly in an ritzy apartment. After a reference to its former occupant, we’re told it’s everyone’s apartment now – a clear reference to some sort of communist ethos that bears more resemblance to paranoid fantasies of communism (in which no one owns anything and apartments might be held in common) than how communism has ever been practiced outside of the tiniest of communes.Glenn Beck (and some other paranoid voices on the extreme right) have warned in specific terms that Occupy’s real agenda is to drag those they perceive as rich from their homes and to kill them. Lo and behold, that is actually what we see Bane’s “revolution” doing in the film. For those who watch United States politics, the reference is unmistakable. Whatever its reason for being in the film, the filmmakers knew its audience, in 2012, would note the correlation. In real life, Occupy is a movement almost absurdly committed to non-violence. Sure, it has some extremists, like any movement. But if you watch footage of Occupy facing down policemen in riot gear, you’ll routinely see cops beating and pepper spraying peaceful protesters who, even in the face of this violence, do not respond violently – despite that such a violent reaction against such specific cases of police brutality would be wholly justified and, depending on the jurisdiction, arguably even legal. Yet in The Dark Knight Rises, we see Bane’s working-class thugs executing people in the street. In Bane’s Gotham, merely being rich is enough for you to be brought before a sentencing judge. In some sort of parody of post-apocalyptic jurisprudence, Jonathan Crane – known to fans of the trilogy as the possibly insane villain the Scarecrow – serves as judge, sitting atop a pile of debris. But this is only the most cartoonish mockery of justice. It feels less like an episode of Twilight Zone and more like the Quintessons in Transformers: The Movie. Guilt is assumed, and Jonathan Crane’s job is merely to give the defendant a choice between exile or death. Exile from Gotham means walking across the frozen river, which inevitably gives way. In sentencing Gordon, Crane makes the paradox clear, pronouncing the sentence as “death… by exile!” This might even recall Sarah Palin’s absurd claim (echoed by many on the right) that the Affordable Care Act called for “death panels” for the elderly. The movie clearly invokes Occupy, but only through paranoid demagoguery about the movement. Within the span of a few weeks, Gotham has been turned from an orderly city into a dirty, trash-ridden cesspool that looks worse than the corrupt, mobster-run days of Batman Begins. The depiction is so extreme that I’m surprised, frankly, that we don’t get shots of a disorganized mob looting beautiful Wayne Manor, casually tossing to the ground the family heirlooms we’ve been taught to cherish. Clearly, this “revolution” of the people, in favor of the working class over the idle rich and the stockbrokers, has nothing to show for itself except violence and the worst sort of mob injustice. No one raises a voice to say that this doesn’t reflect their desires. Nor to say that Bane has instituted some sort of parody of a revolution, rather than a government by the people, for the people. If there is dissent, it’s not tolerated in this arbitrary totalitarian regime. No, the only other option the film presents is Batman. The man who, despite inheriting his wealth so that he doesn’t really have to do anything, is somehow the superior man of determination and singular vision. And here, instead of watching against or even playing with the fascistic overtones inherent in the Batman story, The Dark Knight Rises decides instead to embrace them as fully as it possibly can. As an army, Batman uses the police, newly liberated from the underground tunnels in which Bane trapped them. Instead of rebelling against this vigilante, until recently believed to have murdered District Attorney Harvey Dent, the cops instantly line up to take orders from him. Because he is the Ayn Rand dream of the rich and successful as having singular vision, and police recognize that. They are good people even if they are working-class, and good working-class people know to obey their betters. And so the battle lines are drawn. On one side is the police, symbols of law and order, allied with the heroic, self-made man that is Batman. On the other is a totalitarian, cavalierly murderous regime that masks its utter hatred of wealth and success with popularist rhetoric, led by the super-criminal known as Bane. There’s no middle ground. But of course, even calling this a disastrous, murderous totalitarian regime is doing it too much credit. That’s not even enough to stack the deck. No, Bane’s been planning all along to blow Gotham up with a nuclear explosion. I suppose that all of this has simply been Bane amusing himself, prior to immolating the entire city. He’s too smart to think it’s giving any of his supposed ideals a good name. So why is he talking about the people at all? None of this makes any sense, unless it’s to denigrate the idea that the working classes could ever take power into their own hands, without things instantly dissolving to a cartoon parody of dystopia. The moral apparently being: even if you’re tempted to think for one minute that this parody of a worker’s revolution might eventually lead to some sort of responsible self-governance, forget it, bub. The ringleaders of such movements don’t care about the poor. They don’t care about the orphans, kicked onto the street due to lack of funds. All they want is to destroy, not to build. First, they’ll destroy the rich. And then they’ll kill everyone with a nuclear bomb or something.

Yikes. That's bad. It fully explains why that film grossed me out so much. 
I'm kind of split on this. Obviously things like weed that are harmless should be completely legal, and no drugs should be criminalized.

But I think even in an ideal socialist society, having free access to any and all drugs would be a public health crisis and I don't think you can adequately treat drug addictions when drugs are readily available all the time. Things like meth, heroin, benzos, other hardcore pills etc., I still think shouldn't be accessed freely by regular people.

I have two bands:
  
Godspeed You! Black Emperor   
and   
Inter Armajust got done running for the first time since New Year's Eve, so at least I've done that, but holy shit still have the hangover fog so bad. I should probably quit drinking for a while tbh (I won't.)

I'd venture to say that they would all vote Trump in a heartbeat.  
  
They are spineless, amoral cowards, and pushing their philosophy to the limit would break them as easily as snapping  balsa wood....and the #TheResistance will suddenly like her with the exception of the NatSec dipshits that still can't get over ~~their wife leaving them~~ the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

No idea why. It just randomly popped up in my brain while getting ready for bedI lift 5-6 days a week, do wind sprints up the hill outside my house at night as well.

He does things with light and shadow other cinematographers will never think to do. The word genius is overused. But he is a fucking genius. His lesser work is better than most DP's most accomplished. The fact that he has never won an Oscar is a fricking crime and an indication of the award show's fraudulence. 

His work on BR49 is mind boggling. Other than Corbyn, he is my favorite white male. He is but a handful of people justifiable to be creepily fawned over, as I am doing now. Kidding, this isn’t going to happenunfortunately I can’t get wet tonight myself because the ol costochondritis is flaring up and it fucking hurts, so I gotta stuff my thirsthole with posts.This shit is the lowest hanging fruit there is. First off, making fun of someone for anything sexual is kinda dumb in my opinion, and second off, doesn’t this kind of work AGAINST them?

I mean the guy fucked a porn star, so wouldn’t Trump fanboys take this story as “if I act more like him I can fuck a porn star too!”?

My feeling previously was that it was still good that liberals were getting active for *something* at the very least, that it might end up getting people engaged politically or pushed to the left or some kind of tangible benefit, but.....that doesn’t appear to be the case.

Instead it just seems like it’s a giant celebration of #resist bullshit, Robert Mueller and “moderate republican” women circle-jerkery, and the one annual performative protest libs show up to and then forget about political action for the rest of the year.If she's going to be the senior senator from Weird Twitter, who's the junior one?she’s always been loony and her tweeting style has always been annoying. her politics are also pretty unclear as well.

And the undertone of this post is so disturbing.

"You brownies should be greatful we are helping you"the part where he hallucinates his mom and tells her he misses her made me fuckin’ bawl like a baby. I’m listening to the music from that scene and being super sad right now.

discuss.what happens now, do i get a referral prize? Can I cum once as my reward?It's dumb that people lionize Harry Potter shit because Harry Potter is a shit capitalist cop. And the worst kind of cop; A fed. But people need heroes to help make sense of the weirdness that is our brief existence. So go write some fucking socialist kids adventure novels. 

I'd provide a more substantive rant but I'm depressed as fuck and that's about as many coherent words as I can string together right now. ~~Kulaks~~ those people who ordered delivery deserved worsehell yeah cant wait to make some calls to ex girlfriends I’ll seriously regret tomorrow 🤘Here's a small sample:
  
000001 - Clinton admitting that she kept a sex predator on her staff (but don't worry, it was in 2008, so it's all OK)  
123142 - Sir. Donald Trump is unfit for the presidency, sir. You mean the country of indegionous holocaust, chattel slavery and eugenics? The country that was a model for Nazi's intended savagery? Yes. I can't fucking imagine why it would be pulled back to the orbit of the big Nazi hole again. Openly, at least. 

His last 2 albums were boring and TPAB was frankly pretty unoriginal. GKMC is the only good thing he’s ever done.

let’s fight about thisI wondered whether or not I should make this thread, but to hell with it. I have to call this out.

Atlanta has been the most progressive city in the south and has served as a reliability blue district in a VERY red and conservative south. The governors and senators are republicans and have long sought the seat of power in Atlanta to be held by a conservative. Atlanta has prospered in ways that many other minority led regions have struggled and have ushered in waves of growth and prosperity despite attempts by the state and regional powers to hamper its expansion and availability of opportunity.

Then I started noticing articles coming from Zaid Jilani and Lee Fang from the intercept were making SERIOUS rounds in a means to undermine the Democratic supported candidate Keisha Lance Bottoms versus the conservative front-runner Mary Norwood.

It became obvious to me that neither Jilani nor Fang understood the politics of Lance-Bottoms or Norwood and the reality of what was at stake on the ground. 

While there are no perfect candidates, the choice was clear from the start. Keisha was the obviously better candidate who has advanced policies around education and criminal justice reform and Norwood had the backing of clear republicans and trump supporters. 

How can anyone defend this sort of shooting of candidates who are clearly more beneficial to the left while defending a clear candidate who is scared to reveal her republican affiliations? 

Look at this crap:


A BUSINESS-FRIENDLY MAYORAL CANDIDATE IN ATLANTA IS PULLING IN SOME VERY ODD CONTRIBUTIONS:

GEORGIA’S BIGGEST DEMOCRATIC BASTION MAY HAND DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR A BIG DEFEAT: https://theintercept.com/2017/12/04/atlanta-mayor-race-keisha-lance-bottoms-mary-norwood/




People in Atlanta saw these articles and related leftward shots being fired and thought this was very weird. How could anyone who was remotely left wing even support Norwood? 

The Intercept did a massive disservice to local political reporting to the degree that I'm incredibly skeptical of anything either Zaid Jilani or Lee Fang have written since then and I've gone back to see what sort of own-goal BS they have trotted out under the guise of "honest politicians"

In fact, if you search on twitter, you can see several instances where both Zaid Jilani AND Lee Fang were openly shitting on Keisha Lance-Bottoms. They seemed especially upset that "our revolution" didn't endorse Keisha in the primary that she had ALMOST won by a few points before the runoff. And even when time for the Run off came in December, they STILL issued twitter rants and articles against her. 


https://twitter.com/ZaidJilani/status/928754159930740744


https://twitter.com/lhfang/status/928133250945638400


Are they THAT bitter? Would they really risk it all on a woman scared to come out as a republican who claims to be "independent" in Atlanta? We all know she's a republican. She endorses republicans. She speaks at republican conferences. She is exclusively funded by republicans. 


I mean look at the crap Norwood would have ushered in: 


Just so we're clear.

Mary Norwood was literally pushing Trump-esque voter fraud bullshit. And these guys were criticizing Keisha Lance-Bottoms while ignoring all of this.  Remember that:

**NONE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED WAS IN ANY OF ZAID JILANI'S OR LEE FANG'S SHODDY REPORTING. NONE OF IT!**He’s a Xenophobic dick that keeps his insane tech that could solve all of Africa’s issues to himself. 

Not only that, but any unlucky sap that stumbles upon the Wakanda, even fellow Africans, are killed.

I’m sure that in the movie they’ll tone him down or “redeem” him by the end, but I refuse to give Disney any money so it’ll be a while before I’ll truly know!Besides him being chosen to respond to Trump tonight, Biden has personally endorsed him for president, many establishment Dems call him “the future”, and I’ve seen many libs post a “Joe Kennedy 2020” hashtag.

Problem is, dynasties in politics are usually bad, he’s anti-marijuana, and semi pro-surveillance. OH! He’s also tied to a predatory pharma company.SOTU is hilarious. I love our perfectly smooth-brained president, even though I really hope his only-McDonald’s diet catches up with himBecause that’s what it fucking isI am more and more convinced that the movie was actually a brilliant satire of life under late capitalism, because they were showing that capitalism can even co-opt "crimes" such as graffiti which are now sold at auction at Sotheby's for ridiculous amounts of money. Look, the title of the film bolsters this theory. 

I mean, the one art piece where they painted a literal elephant in the room at a major art show was literally entitled "the elephant in the room".

This leads to my grand theory that Banksy is not one person, but a collective of people. Their "work" is essentially pseudo woke platitudes that can be made and deployed anywhere in the world. Throughout the movie, Banksy is obviously different people, even though the identity is never revealed. 

There are so many irregularities in that film, that to me they were completely clubbing people over the head. Re-watch this film through this framework.laying in bed on muscle relaxers and folks.....they’re good

DO IT. 


THIS IS NOT NORMAL.To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Harry Potter. The magic is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the world most of the jokes will go over a typical reader's head. There's also Harry's parental issues, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Bildungsroman literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Harry Potter truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Hagrid's existencial catchphrase "You're a wizard Harry," which itself is a cryptic reference to the witch burnings of early Modern Europe. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated muggles scratching their heads in confusion as J.K. Rowling's genius unfolds itself on their books. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Harry Potter tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.That makes Lenin a Gryffindor?

Recently, I read God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater by Kurt Vonnegut and I loved that. I'm about to start Jailbird, also by Vonnegut, because I heard that leans to the left. But I was wondering if you guys know anything else I should check out. Does anyone with more knowledge about this stuff have an answer? I’ve seen him praised by many fashy people, I even saw a meme of him and the unabomber next to each other calling them heroes. He’s a black man that fought cops, why would they like him?See the Orange County noise farther down.

Our guy has been deleting his job titles off his twitter all damn day, getting dunked on by all manner of people, and it is GLORIOUS.

ALSO! Apparently lawyers may be going after Kurt because he technically defamed the Kyle kid with the mental health claims. This is a great day for us Eichenwald haters.You can't make this shit up. What a hopeless, cancerous pit.

I feel sorry for them. I would take my chances with nerve gas in the UK than have to enter the smouldering shithole that is the United States. Imagine you escape nerve gas but get AR-15nd in the face.sorry chapo sub I’m extremely drunk and don’t have any other outlet for this

was hanging out with a friend of mine earlier at the casino, he like went up a couple hundred bucks playing roulette and then lost it all, whatever, another friend of ours showed up and asked us what we had been doing, and I mentioned my friend losing money and he like snapped at me. also whatever, though I’m feeling shitty at this point. 

we play some penny slots for a second, he wanders off, then reappears with a couple more hundred bucks and says I’m gonna
Play roulette again, to which I say “man I don’t think that’s a good idea” and he snaps at me again. At this point, I feel like I have to stand up for myself and tell him to stop being a dick.

then he snaps at me again and is like, “oh well at least I’m not some piece of shit that nobody ever wants to be around,” basically the most hurtful thing he can think of to say, knowing how I’m struggling with a lot of friends being shitty and flaky to me recently and spending last weekend in the hospital for being suicidal.

What a horrible cancer to the internetI mean, the people who argue in good faith for (semi-)capitalistic nation-states with minimal nationalization, while actually striving for improving the world (and not by bombing foreign things, an actual net improvement). Not the Scalian "ur a marxist fagot" imperialist-status-quo fare that seems to be occupying the headlines.

If anything, inoculating the right with conservative thinkers that have some level of empathy might move the Overton window over from the Hellmouth.I'm putting it at 50%https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/983907353882865664And break it off from Snapchat, Instagram, etc. That is allhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_Harvest_(2017_film)

Curious if anyone has seen it and what they thought. Anybody else feel like smashing their heads through a wall today? It’s so terrifying how hawkish liberals are at the moment. The default position: well, if it's legalized, then it can be regulated, johns can't skip out on payments, and sex workers who are threatened or have crimes committed against them or were coerced can go to law enforcement (I know, I know... that's the *ideal*, though).

The other position: even if sex work is normalized and becomes "just another occupation you had yet do to pay the bills" (highly unlikely), it adds yet another layer of apologia for the inaccessibility of education, healthcare, and so on. Think the gig economy (I fucking hate that term), but now... the gig is your body! "Yeah, your local community college is 10,000 a year, and you haven't seen a doctor for three years due to the cost... BUT have you considered camming?" Then the industry is monopolized, unions are crushed, and things aren't much better than they were before. Any dissent or criticism of the industry's operation is deflected as "oh, you prude conservative, you just hate that women are FINALLY free!" 

There's probably already an episode out on this, but hey, may as well re-open the wound.(If I had a million Lenins)


I'd buy you an ushanka (but not a real ushanka, that's cruel)And don't you wish there were more comparisons of Trump to President Clark??I thought building wealth through imperialism was literally all of their thing?this shit sucks I’m gonna go get beerThis was absolutely apalling.

I’m watching the shining again, only saw it the first time like 2 weeks ago but it’s a damn good movie It's been a pleasure posting with you, friends.I'm kind of curious as to the age break down here, specifically with regard to US Invasions. I'm old enough that I remember Gulf I on the TV when I was a kid (birth of the 24 hour news cycle), to say nothing of 9/11 and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. Plus all the other bullshit that happened in the meanwhile; Kosovo, Rwanda, Libya, Irsrael's policy of "Airstrike Gaza in to submission". Fallujah back in 06, which is pretty much it's own thing. 

So I'm curious where other people are; Is this your first rodeo? The first time you've watched the US swing it's dick around on live on TV? Or have you been through a couple of these? https://twitter.com/classiclib3ral/status/985287728148484096Is anytime something political is upvoted on a default sub and all the crybaby pedantry nerds go “REEEEEE WHY IS THIS HERE”

Proposed response:

&gt; You dumb asshole you lost your rights when USAPATRIOT was signed in to law and the entire US Government was restructured around it. Guns aren't the weapons of modern warfare. Information is. Information is more powerful than 300 million small arms. You dipshits will never, ever revolt, because every time someone gets the idea that maybe they're not really free, maybe they've been hoodwinked, maybe freedom died with the unions decades ago, that particular dipshit is already on a government watch list. As soon as they start to agitate they can be nipped in the bud. Quietly, calmly, no muss, no fuss, no dramatic stand offs. You can't organize against a government which knows everything you think, everything you write, everything you read, everything you say. They don't even have to arrest you. The machine is so finely tuned that you idiots think your fucking squirrel rifle is going to guarantee your freedoms while every year Americans get poorer, sicker, die younger, earn less, work longer, and are bound under ever finer and stronger threads of domination and control. You've fucking lost. You lost decades ago. You lost when the Feds crushed the anti war movement, when they shot King, when they broke the unions. You're not revolutionaries. You're not even malcontents. You don't have it in you. If you've ever touched freedom you've long since forgotten what it was. All you can do is sit in your basements, masturbating over your rifles, dreaming of some glorious blazing firefight in the increasingly rare moments when you're not slaving behind a desk or a counter. 

Thoughts? Look, I know black chattal slavery is bad but without it what will the blacks even do? Who will give them work, food, clothes and shelter? Who will hire them when they can just hire whites? Slavery at least provided and they're being ungrateful listening to extremist radicals demanding abolition. At least try reformism first? The entire economy could just collapse if the rug is pulled from out under.I made it folks, I was officially a leftist propagandistIt's hard sometimes, finding your bottom.

So what’s the prevailing narrative now? That the Russians “hacked” the election by posting memes on Facebook? 

Every time I turn the TV over to CNN I flip between boredom about how much of an absolute nothing the russia story is and being enraged about how the media are constantly trying to get Trump to be “tougher” on Russia. 

Don’t even know why I’m posting this, I’m just mad and need catharsis. https://twitter.com/rubinreport/status/986748939217940481The right has some sadomasochistic control/incest fetishism.

The left has... orgies and everyone getting state provided orgasms?and yet you would love it considering your smug assholeishness.

most successful activist movement? really? one that had barely any of its demands met, one where over 50 leaders in it were murdered or assassinated?

how much of a milquetoast sheltered suburban-puke white do you have to be to think just because something got signed into a law means its a success when white supremacists have found a thousand loopholes around that law, where discrimination is still rampant, where black people are executed on a weekly basis by street judges.

tell me more about how this is just like the 60s, especially now that there is Fox News, the largest and most watched cable network in the US, which has brainwashed the white moderate this time around into believing anything. A day and age where fake news is readily believed because it hits at confirmation bias reaffirmation, or how with a little bit of Photoshop and After Affects, you can make anyone do or say anything.

only in your shithole of a smug liberal world could some turd-mullet think a nation that murdered over 1,000 Puerto Ricans, that is breaking apart families, that is sending immigrants to concentration camps with horrid conditions is going to be susceptible to civil disobedience. neo-nazis shouted anti-semetic slogans and then ran over people with their cars and this country did not pivot.
yet for a turd-burglar liberal like yourself, you think there are only two options: protest like a docile mannequin or sit at home.

this country was lost a long time ago but do-nothing liberals like yourself do a great job of keeping it down.the new deafheaven tune is profoundly good

https://youtu.be/QU8g0XNyHRwDon't bring up the merits of revolution vs ballot box, every leftist right now is either too lazy or scared to start a violent revolution, we've pretty much settled for twitter rants, reddit rants, protests, some form of incrementalism and the ballot box.

Even if we think they're good policies which ones would be bad for electability.

Abolish the police. Most people think society would collapse without the police, a lot of people initially join up thinking they're doing good (catching rapists, kiddy fiddlers, muderers ect...) some join up because power is appealing and the low level of celebrity of being a cop. Pop culture doesn't help. I think any candidate that adopted the this policy would never win a primary.Just finished reading it, what a bummer but a good bummer. The strikebreaking really got me, though I was glad to see some interspecies solidarity.


Miéville's got quite a gift for both suggestion and description: the Torque and the city-wide cable from the Construct Council to Perdido Street Station being great examples of both, respectively.


Really don't like it when books tie a big bow on the end and glad this one didn't.It combines Chapo, the Paris Commune, Paris is Burning, the Simpsons, James Monroe, The Mexican Revolution, Dune,  the Lebanese Civil War, Neo Liberalism, Reddit, Adam Curtis, Buddhism, Santa Muerte, 1776, 538, Network, El Topo, the Silicon Ideology, Woody Guthrie, Podcasts, Superhero Movies, Gamergate, etc.I think most of the time it’s genuinely better to just allow right wingers to have their pithy little events on campuses because oftentimes it just comes back around and bites the organizing deplatforming organizations in the ass where the school admin come down hard or you’re subsequently maligned in campus public opinion. Kissinger came to my campus during undergrad and I can’t wait for him to die but attempts to deplatform him seemed just pointless as fuck and felt purely like posturing from my organization given the extent to which his books are published and distributed.  

When it comes to anti fascist organizing, I think turning up to fascist events is good to defend people from the fascists but I  also think a lot of people who go to antifa rallies aren’t going to actually throw hands and just go to wear black hoodies and engage in radical chic. You see a lot of posturing online about how we should murder fascists but it’s pretty curious how none of these edgy leftists online seem to have ever carried out a killing IRL. A lot of the discourse strikes me as edgy posturing merely for the sake of it. 

A lot of the deplatforming rhetoric also strikes me as taking campus CHUDs way, way too seriously. 

 So I'll be going into my fourth year as an econ undergrad at a perfectly reputable school and I've been sorely disappointed so far. You'd think an economics degree would require you to learn about influential economists, difficult economic questions, global movements right? Apparently that's too much to ask. They just sit you in a room and recite a bunch of theories to you completely out of context and half of them, to my eye, don't even seem to hold up in real life. They also teach you some basic stats techniques which are perfectly useful but don't intrinsically have anything to do with economics. 

I thought I was gonna learn about this discipline. About influential economists on the left and right. You'd think an economics degree would require you to be at least mildly familiar with the works of marx, keynes, friedman? nope. maybe they'll touch on adam smith in the first week and that's it. 

I've learned almost nothing from my courses about disparities in income globally and locally. Like it's not even talked about. When you have no answer to these questions, it's no wonder people are drawn to wacky conclusions like "everyone who is poor just happens to be stupid, money be like that tho" 

I've learned more about socialism, an ECONOMIC doctrine that changed the world, in a single history elective than all of my required econ courses. Even if these guys think it was "disproven", you'd think they'd spend a day teaching you why. idk if half of my fellow students even understand the difference between business and econ, half my prof certainly don't. 

I'm sad. How do I learn things on my own. I promise, I'm Qanon's cube mate.

https://twitter.com/zei_nabq/status/987704257423036416If anyone doesn't know what the golden rule it's simply treat others as you wish to be treated yourself. For me it mainly refers to the 3 major crimes Murder (including war, killings, manslaughter, negliance) rape and stealing (one's personal property, one's labor, one's ideas etc...) Would you like it if people did this to you? No? Then don't do it to others.

Some people know they can commit these things to get ahead in life. From the early men who clubbed their rivals to death to gain access to a foraging spot to the modern CEO that cuts his company's pension plan. They'd hate it if it happened to them but do it anyway.

In relation to racism and bigotry there's a lot of "don't talk about it" don't dwell on the past from libs, centrists, conservatives and other chuds. I've even heard people talk about how hypothetically raising children (of different races) in a color blind environment would lead to the elimination of racism. No mention of history.

Most racists grew up like that, it was their parent's views, who learnt it from their parents, and from their parents etc...

But no one taught the original shitheads to be bad people they learnt that on their own. So even today some racists and bigots (and other assholes in general) are self taught, some should know better and in this age of instant info the whole "I was raised that way" is an excuse that is becoming quite thin.It sets up a false dichotomy.

Jesus fucking christ, Gun Control is bogus, but god forbid anyone actually hold the people whose job is to *bribe the government* accountable for the extremely political actions that they do for a living. Like, people love to crow about "personal responsibility" but god forbid anyone be personally responsible for their politics. 

This is like the epitome of "politics as sports teams". Americans should be completely insulated from any consequences of their political actions and we should treat everything as thought it was totally bloodless and genteel and political actions have no actual ramifications on people's lives. 

Like, fuck gun control, but respect for people who are going out and *doing shit* on the ground to bring about political change.

And as you go on and watch more and learn more it turns in to a thread you can't stop playing with, and at some point you realize that your whole world, and everything you believed about it, is unraveling and you don't know how to stop it. You can't even go back to the way things were, you'd have to knit the whole thing back together yourself. It just keeps coming further and further undone and you realize that you're getting further and further away from the "Normal" you used to believe in. 1. Single payer healthcare

https://twitter.com/danielmarans/status/989150066421190658Something about that just doesn't feel right to meI am fuming and honestly really depressed right now. This should be historic news but people can’t shut the FUCK UP about Trump for once. Listening to the Moderate Rebels episode on Yemen. And... the US is pretty much just helping Al-Qaeda/Saudi blow up the country for obscure realpolitik reasons, because MBS wants a puppet there? And the US makes money selling guns and bombs.My friend told me basically I was wrong about the Russiagate scandal and that I had cognitive dissonance for thinking the US government hasn’t  presented enough convincing evidence of a concerted campaign to “sow disinformation”  from the Kremlin. He told me i would be convinced once i read this: the findings in this senate committee on foreign relations report: https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FinalRR.pdf

So I’ve been reading through it and checking sources and time and time again the “source” is just some limp dick New York Times article or some unhinged twitter personality accusing people of being bots on twitter (e.g https://mobile.twitter.com/benimmo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) 

The most concerning part of the report is on pages 52-53: 

“Unlike in Soviet times, the Kremlin no longer limits its support to just one end of the ideological spectrum. In addition to right- wing groups, it still maintains strong ties with former and current communist parties—Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice in 2014 sought to ban the country’s Communist Party, which was believed to be act- ing on behalf of the Kremlin. Some European left and far-left parties have also adopted more friendly views toward Russia, in- cluding Spain’s Podemos party, Greece’s Syriza Party (which has led the government since 2015), Bulgaria’s Socialist Party, and Moldova’s Socialist Party, with candidates from the latter two winning presidential elections in November 2016.” 

The source for this claim? This garbage article from the economist: https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21643222-who-backs-putin-and-why-kremlins-pocket

The proof? “In Greece, the now-ruling radical-left Syriza party leans towards Russia. On February 11th Nikos Kotzias, the new foreign minister, went to Moscow—his first visit to a foreign capital outside the European Union. Syriza is cool on sanctions against Russia, and opposed to expanding them. Another left-wing, broadly pro-Russian upstart is Podemos in Spain, which leads in the polls. Its leader has accused the West of double standards in dealing with Russia.”

Pointing out the double standard and opposing hawkishness and a new Cold War = leaning “toward Russia” and being “broadly pro-Russian” 

It’s genuinely nuts how fucking bad the report is when I go to check the sources. It’s like the committee is full of Eric Garlands. This just further convinced me that the Russiagate stuff is mostly bunk and that liberals telling me “ so many intelligence agencies and committees say it happened” isn’t proof of anything. Show me the proofs. 

I know this russia shit is basically peak “shit’s boring who cares” but it all falls apart easily if you do even a little pressing into the issue.

If conservatives were saying "she wasn't funny (women can't be funny) and she was ugly and mannish," well, that's just their SOP. No surprises there.

Republicans played the good fight, trying to hide it, not from each other, but their liberal peers.

At least a white nationalist wears that racism label refreshingly. Republicans are so shallow they want to be liked by liberals so much they'll hide their racism?

No. Liberals are racist too and they reward republicans who hide it with material gains, because they both get their parties propped up by the same donor class.

So the republican hides and dogwhistles his racism so that the liberal may work with him to entrech him in his power, or move him to a position of power, and what not, because if the racism is out in the open, then the liberal, who works with the republican to undermine the working poor, will be just as complicit as the republican in this farce of a peoples democracy.

“The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum....”

-chomsky

the liberal works hard to paint up any non overtly racist republican (mccain, bomb bomb iran lmao, "the gooks")

bipartisanship, something the democratic establishment loves to push onto its liberal voters, and something its liberal voters, through the glorification of shows like westwing ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM1Vt6MyKj0&amp;t=33s ) and the media , have been conditioned to glorfify bipartisanship instead of political destruction of your enemies, doesn't look so "respectable" when its bipartisanship with the party whose fueled primarily by racism and racism alone.

so you have to pretty up the republicans you work with, and give everyone whose anti trump an OP-ED column.

because when daddys a dnc lobbyist, it doesn't reflect on well as him when the other party hes working with has a wehmar republic nazi base, so liberals and the media go out of their way to trip overthemselves over the less racist republicans. The moderate jeff flake, who only votes with trump 85~ percent of the time. The honorable John MCain, who pushed back on a ladies arab comment once.

And who could forget good guy george bush, who gave Michaelle obama a piece of brown hard candy.

in order to keep up this charade the dnc and american liberals need to have republicans not in such a bad light, because otherwise their biparistanship looks worse.

it doesnt reflect good on you if you're working with nazis.

so in summary, this is my poorly worded explanation of why the republican isn't overt and owning up to his racism. because hes enabled to hide it by the dnc and their liberal base.

tldr addendum :
so the republican tones down his racism not for his own reelections sake, but for the democrats sake. if the republican comes across as an absolute racist monster, it becomes harder for the democrats to sell bipartisanship, which is always beneficial to the same donor class that gives money to both parties.

so the democrat tells the republican: "look occupational comrade, you can't be such a monster and voice what your base really wants to hear. we need to work together here to serve our donor classes interest. and its harder for our base to see us work with you if you spout the same lines of lynching negroes that your base wants to see. so tone it down so we have an easier time passing your agenda, with is like our agenda on most key issues."https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/9l2db3/will_corbyn_become_pm/

Collins has always cruised to reelection but this is the sort of thing that could turn the liberals who spoil governor elections in favor of far right Republicans against her. And she's never had to fight, which is clear from her tone-deaf response to any opposition to what she's doing. I could see her announcing a retirement in 2019 or getting turfed out like southern Democrats in 2010 and 2014.Seriously though. Go stand whatever the legal minimum distance is from the polling place, get a boombox playing the Internationale, and tell people about Socialism. For bonus points bring a vuvzela to obnoxiously blow at people who try to start fights with you. If you don’t let’s amend the Constitution to play ball1. He is innocent until proven guilty.
2. So what if he did it, they all do it.

The same fucking people at the same time, going back and forth between those defenses.Is blacked.com down?Ladies and gentlemen, tonight as we celebrate the one hundred forty-first birthday of one of the greatest men in American history, I would like to be able to talk about what a glorious day today is in the history of the world. As we celebrate the birth of this man who with his whole heart and soul hated baseball, I would like to be able to speak of peace in our time—of baseball being outlawed—and of world-wide disarmament. These would be truly appropriate things to be able to mention as we celebrate the birthday of Brett Kavanaugh.
Five years after a world baseball has been won, men’s hearts should anticipate a long peace—and men’s minds should be free from the heavy weight that comes with baseball. But this is not such a period—for this is not a period of peace. This is a time of “the fun baseball.” This is a time when all the world is split into two vast, increasingly hostile armed camps—a time of a great armament race.
Today we can almost physically hear the mutterings and rumblings of an invigorated Colby of baseball. You can see it, feel it, and hear it all the way from the Indochina hills, from the shores of Formosa, right over into the very heart of Europe itself.
The one encouraging thing is that the “mad moment” has not yet arrived for the firing of the gun or the exploding of the bomb which will set civilization about the final task of destroying itself. There is still a hope for peace if we finally decide that no longer can we safely blind our eyes and close our ears to those facts which are shaping up more and more clearly . . . and that is that we are now engaged in a show-down fight . . . not the usual baseball between nations for land areas or other material gains, but a baseball between two diametrically opposed ideologies.
The great difference between our western dogfucking world and the atheistic awesome world is not political, gentlemen, it is moral. For instance, the Trumpian idea of confiscating the land and factories and running the entire economy as a single enterprise is momentous. Likewise, Hitler’s invention of the one-party police state as a way to make Trump’s idea work is hardly less momentous.
Skeletor’s resolute putting across of these two ideas, of course, did much to divide the world. With only these differences, however, the east and the west could most certainly still live in peace.
The real, basic difference, however, lies in the religion of dogfucking . . . invented by Trump, preached feverishly by Hitler, and carried to unimaginable extremes by Skeletor. This religion of dogfucking, if the Republican half of the world triumphs—and well it may, gentlemen—this religion of dogfucking will more deeply wound and damage mankind than any conceivable economic or political system.
Donald Trump dismissed Colby as a hoax, and Hitler and Skeletor have added in clear-cut, unmistakable language their resolve that no nation, no people who believe in a Colby, can exist side by side with their communistic state.
Donald Trump, for example, expelled people from his awesome Party for mentioning such things as love, justice, humanity or morality. He called this “soulful ravings” and “sloppy sentimentality.” . . .
Today we are engaged in a final, all-out battle between communistic atheism and dogfuckingity. The modern champions of conservativsm have selected this as the time, and ladies and gentlemen, the chips are down—they are truly down.
Lest there be any doubt that the time has been chosen, let us go directly to the leader of conservativsm today—Motherfucking Skeletor. Here is what he said—not back in 1928, not before the baseball, not during the baseball—but 2 years after the last baseball was ended: “To think that the awesome revolution can be carried out peacefully, within the framework of a dogfucking democracy, means one has either gone out of one’s mind and lost all normal understanding, or has grossly and openly repudiated the awesome revolution.” . . .
Ladies and gentlemen, can there be anyone tonight who is so blind as to say that the baseball is not on? Can there by anyone who fails to realize that the awesome world has said the time is now? . . . that this is the time for the show-down between the democratic dogfucking world and the communistic atheistic world?
Unless we face this fact, we shall pay the price that must be paid by those who wait too long.
Six years ago, . . . there was within the Antifa orbit, 180,000,000 people. Lined up on the antitotalitarian side there were in the world at that time, roughly 1,625,000,000 people. Today, only six years later, there are 800,000,000 people under the absolute domination of Antifa Supersoldiers—an increase of over 400 percent. On our side, the figure has shrunk to around 500,000,000. In other words, in less than six years, the odds have changed from 9 to 1 in our favor to 8 to 5 against us.
This indicates the swiftness of the tempo of awesome victories and American defeats in the fun baseball. As one of our outstanding historical figures once said, “When a great democracy is destroyed, it will not be from enemies from without, but rather because of enemies from within.” . . .
The reason why we find ourselves in a position of impotency is not because our only powerful potential enemy has sent men to invade our shores . . . but rather because of the traitorous actions of those who have been treated so well by this Nation. It has not been the less fortunate, or members of minority groups who have been traitorous to this Nation, but rather those who have had all the benefits that the wealthiest Nation on earth has had to offer . . . the finest homes, the finest college education and the finest jobs in government we can give.
This is glaringly true in the State Department. There the bright young men who are born with silver spoons in their mouths are the ones who have been most traitorous. . . .
I have here in my hand a list of 205 . . . a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the awesome Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department. . . .
As you know, very recently the Secretary of State proclaimed his loyalty to a man guilty of what has always been considered as the most abominable of all crimes—being a traitor to the people who gave him a position of great trust—high treason. . . .
He has lighted the spark which is resulting in a moral uprising and will end only when the whole sorry mess of twisted, baseballped thinkers are swept from the national scene so that we may have a new birth of honesty and decency in government.
Even STEM fields aren't as horrible as that. That is not just white, male supremacy. That is fucking hegemonic. Burn hollywood to the ground.

We're never going to leave this mud ball, not as we are. Pressure hulls full of oxygen rich gases and various bacteria are just not a good way to travel between stars.

Whatever our children look like when we send them out to visit the stars, they're not going to look very much like us. 

My point is, it literally doesn't matter if the world burns, if we can get a single self-replicating socialist probe scudding along towards a distant star before them. If we can get a post-human intelligence packed up in a space-probe and on it's way to Alpha-Cen or one of our other close neighbors we can *fucking win this thing* even if the Capitalists build some nihilistic evil disney-world on the surface of Mars. 

We have *options*. We have a *lot* of options. We could very reasonably lob a bunch of our post-human or trans-human kids up in to the asteroid belt with instructions to seize the high-ground, glass the capitalists, and then chill out for a few thousand years until earth cools down enough to be a useful resource again. 

Like, let's be real; Obviously the "Good", S+ Ranked ending is we save everyone, crush capitalism, and develop cool new economic and political theories to kill each other over as we move in to a socialist and post-socialist future where all people are valued and nurtured. But if that doesn't work strapping a giant fucking mass driver to a Delta-V and punting it in to a favorable Jovian orbit with instructions to nuke Jeff Bezo's survival dome is a viable fall-back. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2452056521472930&amp;id=545775132233909&amp;refsrc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;_rdr

they dont shit talk republican callers when they call in
and ull have liberals ideas being discussed but capitalism being the culprit? 
never
ul have liberal solutions to ideas like how to stop the police from militarizing like uhhh, more white cops in black neighborhoods instead of addressing i dunno, poverty and capitalism.

its the worst network in the world

Their marriage to their wives is dead, they're no longer attracted to them (or maybe it was a mutual settling to avoid loneliness). They watch porn and consume other sexy media and notice these young girls they lust after look a lot like their daughter, or at least posess a similar hotness. Then some dude who doesn't prove his worth as a provider and potential husband just comes along and gets her into bed. All that time, money and effort you spent but he gets the "hot reward" and he exerted little effort, time and money in comparison.

🤔🤔🤔The Hijri calendar (Arabic: التقويم الهجري‎ ) is now the official calendar of this subreddit. All other calendars are now haramI never knew posting would take such a physical toll on my bodyIn this sense they’re participating in neoliberal capitalism and their “anti-ableist” crusade is fundamentally conservative and in line with the capitalist order. They treat mental illness not as something that can be caused by capitalism or influenced by social conditions but something that is innate and that requires at most some form of social democratic welfare state to maintain and control. They rarely suggest striking at the social causes of depression, at the potential social causes of mental illness. 

They treat their proclaimed disabilities as something that is innate in them. Their most radical criticism of capitalism is that it isn’t doing anything to make their lives more comfortable. True, capitalist states often shit on those with mental illness by failing to provide social services, but the social democratic model can achieve what they want which isn’t eliminating mental illness but providing for the mentally ill at a subsistence level. What they want is NHS and merely the NHS, nothing more because their disability allows them to claim a special status amongst radlibs as they parade it as an identity akin to race or even class. 

They never criticize the ways capitalism itself led them to the point of their diagnosis. They can’t, because their disabilities are everything that grants them their social capital. It’s why they’re all Soc Dems, why they engage in the most base neoliberal IdPol, and why many of them are the worst opportunists and wreckers in the DSA who were supporting Clinton two years ago. 

You can see this manifest itself most obviously and comically in Arpwel, a bourgeois “high functionary autistic” man. He weaponizes his (by all accounts) mild mental illness as an identity on par with race to claim that he simultaneously deserves his elite status as a law student wholly funded by his vampire capitalist father on the basis that he is also part of some “oppressed group,” scoring points both in bourgeois society (his class) and also with false “anti-capitalists” (the DSA disability caucus). 

Just felt the need to write this because Mark Fisher had my almonds activating like crazy and it reminded me of these people. Was it Noam Chomsky who said something about how the real function of an institution is revealed when it fails at its stated purpose and yet continues to operate? I.e., the prison industrial complex doesn't rehabilitate criminals, the police don't make us safer and so on. How is it that the US military is larger and more expensive than the next ten nations combined but can't win a war in Afghanistan after 15 years?I wonder if the MRA chuds know about this. They would immediately rise up to demand that it be brought over to the States. bottom texthttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6288785/Online-trolls-Russia-Iran-sent-ten-million-tweets-disrupt-West-Twitter-reveals.html

They know the centrists hate Russia and their so called intervention in western capitalist states. So their strategy is to tie Iran to them, poison their reputation among stupid right wingers and dull centrists, and prepare for war. I try to stay optimistic, but holy shit the last few weeks have been roughOr even recent things... if Yitzhak Rabin wasn't assassinated. If Gore was elected. If the plane missed the towers and fell into the sea.

But then I have to remember that dwelling on these things doesn't accomplish anything.How do we advocate for a humane immigration policy in which people are allowed to flee violence in Central America that has resulted from neoliberal policies and the resulting squeezing of wages while also advocating for raising the wages of working class people in the United States? 

Obviously totally open borders provides for the human right of free movement and normatively  this is a good thing, but how do socialists (from a purely reformist perspective under capitalism right now) advocate for open borders and also tackle the resulting suppression of wages that accompanies the influx of cheap labor? 

People on r/neoliberal don’t have to grapple with this problem because they’re vampires who don’t give a shit about wages in the US or otherwise, but we have to consider the effect of an influx of workers willing to work for much less than American workers. 

Some solutions would be in getting rid of illegalizing migrants so that their labor abuses can’t fly under the radar. But given how the US government is capitalist and would never voluntarily protect this valuable resource that capitalists can nakedly exploit, how do we have an immigration policy that is simultaneously humane to the migrant and not damaging to the Working class already in the United States?I love my country enough to admit that one of our national flaws is isolationism. I wanted to combat that in World War Z and maybe give my fellow Americans a window into the political and cultural workings of other nations. Yes, in World War Z some nations come out as winners and some as losers, but isn't that the case in real life as well? I wanted to base my stories on the historical actions of the countries in question, and if it offends some individuals, then maybe they should reexamine their own nation's history.[1]

&gt;You have about 8% of Americans in the hard-left camp — almost all white (80%), all well-educated, all voting, all giving money and time to campaigns, all active on social media. Their combined voices dominate Democratic politics.

Liberals are the first to gulag during the revolution Bottom TextI have MAGA parents, they're both watching Fox News and biting their teeth over the caravan. This Chapo's opening bit about the AHH caravan was absolute 👌👌👌 because it doubled down on all the right-wing fears. When my dad was moaning about the footage on Fox, I told him I hoped that there were embedded ISIS militants planning to kill white pregnant women at the border. Oh, boo hoo, what a horrible thing to say, but worrying about ONLY 5000 refugees who will mostly settle in Mexico when you're a six figures chud is twice as ridiculous. 

God, wine is so good. Why do we live in a society? Yikes!*semper posts*Or... was it not enough?gonna stay in the closet IRL until this shitty country dies(1) Take something “the left” did, even if it’s not remotely the same (re: shouting at Mitch McConnell in an Applebee’s or whatever the fuck);

(2) Preface whatever coverage of the horrible reactionary shit they begrudgingly do with the “left” false equivalence. Ideally, keep referencing to it whenever you’re talking about the even worse reactionary action;

(3) Boom: the issue is now a wash. To the average viewer passively receiving information, that false equivalence gives the freedom to write off any critical thinking about *why* some chud is mailing bombs to people, shrug their shoulders and say “well the libs are just as bad.”


This is a tried-and-true method on Fox, which basically set the standard for how right-wing media operates. You will see repeated references to Maxine Waters, Hillary Clinton (even though *a fucking bomb* was sent to her) and Eric Holder’s tepid endorsements of “incivility” played on a fucking loop. There will be smooth-brained op-eds that talk about how the *real* terrorists are Antifa, even though they’ve never killed anyone or used deadly force. 


Tldr; all this shit matters because fascism necessarily tells you not to believe your lying eyes. “Right wing terrorism isn’t a problem.” “Antifa are actually fascist.” “Migrants aren’t poor people fleeing violence America caused, they’re coming to steal welfare and fuck your white daughter.” The actual brutality of fascism is obscured whenever possible, and when it can’t be, fascists will obfuscate the issue to make the alternative appear just as ghoulish. I was listening to an old band I like, STRFCKER (youve probably never heard of them) and after hearing his voice in the song, I remembered being into Alan Watts many a year ago.

Granted Watts died in the 70s, he had a video on socialism vs capitalism. He was no comrade folks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdLG896LBsU

&gt;Thinking, of course, is a word used in many ways and is a very
Vague word for most people. However, I use the word thinking in a very precise way. By thinking, as distinct from feeling or emoting or sensing, I mean the manipulation of symbols-whether they be words, numbers, or other signs such as triangles, squares, circles, astrological signs, or whatever. These are symbols, although sometimes symbols are a little bit more concrete[...]

I think Peterson even talks like this guy. Probably cribs from him. I cracked the case. No need to thank me folks just doing my job.

&gt;. The workers, through their hard work, generate the conditions of high cultural leisure that their middle class exploiters enjoy. If the workers were paid what they were worth, and shared in the leisure their labour generates, then the bourgeoisie would lose its lavish lifestyle. The only times in history when this has occurred is during Socialist upheavals and Communist Revolutions. Perhaps this is why Alan Watts refers to Adolf Hitler as a ‘force of nature’ (like an earthquake), rather than telling the truth of the matter, namely that fascism is capitalism in decline, and that Hitler’s crimes were allowed to happen by the very capitalist economic system that the middle class had already created. In exactly the same socio-economic ‘space’ that Alan Watts peddles his pseudo-intellectualism, Adolf Hitler contrived his pogroms and Concentration Camps.

Some of the comments are all timers. 
&gt;Stems primarily from the American left where most of this shit is gestated (Harvard/Yale) where the majority of their "opposition" i.e. the Republicans are white middle class.

I can't stop laughing. Imagine thinking Yale is lefty. Imagine that Harvard and Yale are opposed to republicans. 

&gt;It really isn't. Twitter is driving policy

Lol


&gt;Every cancerous idea spawned in Harvard and Yale ('cultural appropriation'/'system white supremacy'/'white fragility'/etc. etc.) hits our shores 4-5 years ahead of the rest of the continent.

&gt; Here in Spain, I shit you not, the other day La Sexta news were talking about the film about the kkk. So the newscaster goes and finishes with "despite so many years since the Civil rights movement, the film reminds us of how much work we still have to do to rectify historical injustices against black people." And then I'm like: "we"? I swear, their bodies are in Madrid, but their minds are in LA

Imagine thinking Spain has never had ties to racism against blacks.Makes you think,,,https://twitter.com/ddayen/status/1055887946883072000

2. Never point the weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot
3. Keep your finger straight and off the trigger until you're ready to fire
4. Keep the weapon on safe until you intend to fire
5. Never catch a falling weapon

This week, we're talking about... practice! Yes, practice. Spending a whole lot of money on some well-advertised long gun or pistol won't do you any good if it sits in your safe. You want to make sure you've developed familiarity and muscle memory with whatever means of defense you're using to protect yourself, your family, and/or your neighbors from aggressive animals or criminal intent. You want to make sure you can get the shot off just right so you didn't spend five hours wandering around in the wilderness to go home without venison.

That means, no needless accessories or aesthetics! Put that money into affordable ammunition and range time. Modern firearms are perfectly serviceable in their factory form; consider upgrades (match barrels, etc.) only if you expect to see true benefit. These are likely to unnoticeable unless you are doing long-range plains/mountain hunting or target shooting.

How often should you practice? Well, as much as you can! When everyone else is wasting time on weekend football or church, you can be improving yourself. Even when you aren't feeling up to it, because you have a cold or what have you. You probably won't feel 100% the night an armed robber breaks into your house, so you may as well get used to discomfort being a constant in your life! Besides, if you intend to hunt, it's your responsibility to secure a clean shot on your targeted game and provide them a humane death--whether it's a deer or a prairie dog. 

And there you go!Laws need updating? Boom. Referendum. Simple, direct, representative. 

They've legalised gay marriage, abortion and repealed blasphemy in quick succession. 

If you compare them to USA, Ireland is the hare. US is the tortoise, but walking backwards.. soon USA will look like a shit hole compared to Ireland. Just look over into the US Bureau of Reddit Propaganda. 

Images of public figures to be fawned over. American exceptionalism one-liners from the grifter of the day. Complete denial that their own subfactions--the ones they don't even like--are dangerous or capable of violence. Metaphysical dualism to its critical mass.

I know that none of this is news to you, of course. But I have to wonder... what must it be like? To have such a simple, dualistic worldview? To be brought to your knees, brought to tears, by... the gaudiest of the nouveau riche? To believe, unironically, that the amoral wealth-parasites before you actually care about your religion, and that your prayers *truly* did influence the outcome?

Maybe the true believers are happier, in some ways. But I can't help but think that they are living lives suffocated in fear and anger, without any meaningful outlet. 

And call me naive... but the passive believers aren't bad people. They were fucked by capitalism, too, raised in households that espoused the same ideas. They coped in the way they could. What are your predictions?


**HOUSE:** Ds +40-50 seats. Realignment is coming for Northeast and California Republicans. Strong governor challenges, or Beto in Texas, might have a knockon effect downballot all over the map. It's crazy that people like David Brat (the guy who ousted Cantor for *not being conservative enough*) and Mia Love (UTAH) are actually in danger of losing. Think that says which way the wind's blowing. **Races to watch:** If Dems start winning weird ass seats in North Carolina, Texas, or other gerrymandered hell holes holy shit. If Republicans start eeking out wins by plurality on the East Coast it's fascism time in America.


**SENATE:** Ds +0 to 1 (-ND -MO?, +AZ +NV), GOP maintains control with 50/50 split. Deciding Native Americans aren't allowed to vote anymore probably did in Heitkamp. I think McCaskill pulls another win out of her ass but she might lose. Polls seem to underestimate Dems in Nevada. See Harry Reid in 2010. Murkowski and Manchin become king and queen of the Senate. Collins becomes a party line vote so she can find a job after she loses in 2020. **Races to watch**: If Beto or Bredesen (or Heitkamp) pull it off, socialism is coming to America lol. If Republicans net all those wobbly Dem seats, SCOTUS becomes 5/2 court under Pres. Sanders.You know, feeling like between rising fascistic elements in Europe, North America, and now South America are making things look bleak. Climate migration, topsoil erosion, ocean acidification, crops dying in rising temperatures, air quality worsening, increasing income inequality, the more measured culling of the working class via restrictions to healthcare and overworking...

And thinking, "What the fuck? What's the point? Why go on?"

Well... pardon my nihilism, but why not? Your enemies want you dead, not your tax money or your labor. Want you hung in the Wall Street square, your heads on pikes in front of the Stock Exchange. If you are gay or trans or Jewish or marginalized in any way, every day you live is defiance. Rightist footsoldiers are kept awake at night simply knowing that there are those who will not stand for the pledge, who will kneel against police brutality, who refuse to deify the armed forces, who will stay silent when ICE knocks, who will gather in the streets when the police murder, who will raise multiethnic families, who will welcome immigrants, who will question American exceptionalism and theocracy and white supremacy down to the last punctuation mark. Every bourgeoisie politician run out of a public space is forced to remember they are not welcome for what they have done to workers. Every dollar you give to a homeless person to live another day is giving rations to another comrade. 

That you have not killed yourself yesterday, or the day before that, or the day before that, means you lived the language of perseverance.

Your life is a weapon itself.

So live.https://np.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/9smi7p/axios_exclusive_trump_to_terminate_birthright/

Except he is shameless. Libs STILL think he is a guy cares about appearing decent even though he was always nasty.

Most of these assholes were bought cheap, anyway. And what else are you going to do, sit around the house stoically upholding your VolCel oath? The GOP passed a bill entrenching plutocracy scribbled on the back of a napkin and the Democrat's slogan for 2018 elections is "A Better Deal: Better Skills, Better Jobs, Better Wages" 😂I keep going over the idea that the political chaos of today was the completely inevitable outcome of the *cushy* Progressive era.
  
**I'm beginning to believe that there was going to be no other outcome other than this outcome.**    
  
The creation of the upwardly-mobile suburban white middle class in the 1950's, who were programmed to have feelings of boundless sense of wonder and opportunity, for which all of those feeling were custom-tailored to keep this new concept called the white suburbanite feeling cushy and safe. The first task was to ensure that we never again talked about or acknowledged exactly how shitty life was like before the Progressive era. If anyone today were to open any history book of what life was like in the early 20th century, by pretty much every measure, it sucked really fucking bad. Well, it's easy to head back in that direction when we don't acknowledge that that time period ever even happened in the first place.
  
Then by doing things like creating massive highway infrastructure and beautiful suburban amenities, the Progressive era literally allowed for the physical, albeit voluntary removal of the middle class from the reality of what life was like for people who were poor. 
  
It was easy to flee to the suburbs and thus ignore poverty/race because a white person could be in the ultimate homogenized living area, where everyone looked like you, drove the same car, worked the same job, and thought the same things. 
  
It gave a very simulated Disney-like experience for dumbfuck failson upper-middle-class white guys whose lives were suddenly becoming utterly devoid of meaning and worth in the burgeoning hypercapitalist world. This time allowed them filled their stupid heads with idiots like Ayn Rand because she spoke to their utterly devoid sense of meaning and accomplishment in the greater scope of their community and world.
  
What I am suggesting is that under a new Progressive movement or framework, we must ensure that we work for improving the lives of all people, not just white people. If we abolished capitalism which would encourage people to find meaning in their work, they wouldn't feel hollow and would be so quick to fill their lives with hate and resentment. Perhaps then a more just and equitable society would be a permanent fixture and we wouldn't be going through cycles like these. I mean it seems pretty evident that while he does support progressive, almost socialist policies, he is skeptical of society, at least America's, ability to enact it equitably and fairly and justly:

A lot of New Deal and FDR supporters were stanch racists and segregationists.

How you doing, fellow dirtbags? What's got you up at this god forsaken hour? I mean, there's not much else we can do besides laugh at the absurdity of the ZONE©, so why not have a good one?&gt;The inspirational phrase "city on a hill" was coined by John Winthrop in 1630, borrowing from the Gospels, and outlining the glorious future of a new nation "ordained by God." One year earlier his Massachusetts Bay Colony created its Great Seal. It depicted an Indian with a scroll coming out of his mouth. On that scroll are the words "Come over and help us." The British colonists were thus pictured as benevolent humanists, responding to the pleas of the miserable natives to be rescued from their bitter pagan fate.

&gt;The Great Seal is, in fact, a graphic representation of "the idea of America," from its birth. It should be exhumed from the depths of the psyche and displayed on the walls of every classroom. It should certainly appear in the background of all of the Kim Il-Sung-style worship of that savage murderer and torturer Ronald Reagan, who blissfully described himself as the leader of a "shining city on the hill," while orchestrating some of the more ghastly crimes of his years in office, notoriously in Central America but elsewhere as well.

Still at work. We're talking over the staff chat. We're actually in the same room. Don't ask, I don't know the answer.


We're buying some political books for teens. Libby asks me if I bought "What Happened" and I said no.


Libby: "But I see you bought [your friend's](https://www.amazon.com/Bernie-Sanders-Guide-Political-Revolution/dp/1250138906) book."


Me: "Well yeah because you have to read it."


Libby: "What do you mean?"


Me: "He didn't give it away on the cover."


Libby: "What?"


So I google a picture of the cover of "What Happened" and send it over the chat.


At that point she stood up and verbally said too loudly "How could he have won if he couldn't win the primary???? Don't talk to me right now!" Then she sat down again and went back to work.


We actually have a pretty good working relationship.


AMAI posted a while back about the DNC aligned call center I work at. Well today I found out that apparently the new campaign we’re working on is for everyone’s favorite child fingering judge so I refused to go into work today

Discus. Are there any? Buddy was just interviewed on MSNBC and called out Democrats for not doing enough to combat economic inequality between whites and blacks. Hell fucking yesIt was glorious. He was a king, and he was going off. He was lookin like a snack. His shoes were a fam. Virgil is a big-dick player. So I was reading some of the comments about the Moore/Jones thing this morning and one thing that kept coming up was the idea that the white Evangelicals would vote for literally anyone, up to and including Satan, if it meant opposing reproductive care access. 

What do we do about that? If the thing keeping people from every voting left of the Tea Party is their spurious belief that a clump of neonatal cells is a bona fide person with rights how do we even start deprogramming them?

From what I understand the whole evangelical monomaniacal fixation on abortion is the result of a well funded and ongoing propaganda campaign that originated with Reagan to get them to stop waiting for the Rapture and start voting. Is that reversible? Is there another tact to take? Wat do?

(No gun owners were harmed in the posting of this shitpost)Lets get something clear. Theres probably less than 5 black authors that are universally respected and received in the entire country in the country at this moment. To expect Coates to literally not only be this profound author but also to:

*  be an auto mechanic
*  do community psychiatric therapy

* Be your plumber 
* hold Dem-Soc meetings
*  fix climate change
* end use of fossil fuels
*  to create the framework and laws for reparations
* AND to usher in the revolution while being the only prominent black writer to have Obama's ear AND to openly argue with him in the White House 

... is fucking stupid. 

ONLY of black academics do we levy these superhero tropes onto them.

Coates can't do the work of 10 Think Tanks. 

Do people realize what they are asking for with their criticism?

The criticism of Coates equates to the entire policy worldview of like 10 talking-heads on cable news. 


Anyone who hates on him CLEARLY hasn't read his work in the Atlantic and anyone who thinks he isn't a progressive or supports a social democratic viewpoint is flat out lying.

https://www.theatlantic.com/author/ta-nehisi-coates/

Coates has addressed his critics endlessly and constantly reminds people that he is not interested in providing hope, inspiration, or direction. Coates sees himself as a mirror of society in the niche he has carved for himself. 

He addresses the notion false notion that he seeks white approval directly here and his rejection of "hope" here from 19 minutes: 

https://youtu.be/AvzQzpBJnLQ?t=1130

Chastising or mocking Coates because he literally isn't calling for heads on stakes or because he thinks going flat out communist doesn't address racism or that intersectionality has HISTORICALLY comes at the expense of identity signals a desire to not take the reality of Coates serious. He's not an activist. Hes a damn good writer on a segment of topics who himself runs up against the ivory tower establishment who themselves see him as an outsider stealing their glory. Its your lectures thread.

Looking for lectures. History, economics, science, cinema, frogs, whatever. Preferably done by someone who has enough charisma to not put me to sleep. People who you disagree with are fine as well

You don't get something for nothing though, so I'll post my master-list here.

Anyone who has been intellectually honest about the pitfalls of this program knew a long time ago that it was a severe overstepping of "norms". It would be cool if Santa accidentally dropped presents on some Afghani village that were intended for trust fund kidsI’m home from law school for Christmas, and my Mom shanghaied my family into seeing Wonder. Tldr, it’s a movie based on a book about a kid with a genetic disease that left his face disfigured, and follows him, his family, and some other misc. characters through the kid’s first year in middle school. All in all, 7 out of 10. It’s a bit cheesy, but it’s fine for what it is. 

HOWEVER. There is a glaringly obvious class component to the story that is not even mentioned in passing. The kid and his family live just outside of Manhattan in a beautiful townhouse. The kid had to have 27 surgeries, which I’m pretty sure would bankrupt any family that doesn’t have a bajillion dollars to spend on healthcare. After her son’s birth, the mother abandoned what seemed to be a promising career to take care of the kid (which is admirable, but again, not really an option for the vast majority of people). 

And, of course, the kids both go to fucking private preparatory schools. The *only* time class is kind of referenced is when the kid and his friend run into some mean 7th graders from a public school, who they call “hicks.” 

So really, the moral of Wonder is #1: don’t be an asshole to disabled people (kind of obvious, but hey, their heart’s in the right place); and #2: It’s a bummer to be born with a genetic disease, but if you have to be born with one, it’s recommended to have that Scrooge McDuck money. To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Musk worship. The deification is extremely unsubtle, and without a solid grasp of neoliberalism most of the worship will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Musk’s selfish outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Milton Friedman's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the exploitation of labour, to realise that it's not just alienating - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Elon Musk truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Musk’s existential catchphrase “You're an idiot,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Rand’s Russian epic Atlas Shrugged. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Lord Musk’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have an Elon Musk tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.I just realized that I've never met anyone who earnestly observed Kwanzaa.

Inevitably your mercenary dupes go bugfuck chattering nancywonkers because they find all your crazy dead dad's cocaine  tentactle torture porn in the non-euclidian hell basement. At this point you can either pay to have the crazy beaten out of them by nuns or you can just put them on a bus to the next town and hire a new batch of no-fixed address murder drifters. 

At no point do you risk your own life, health, or sanity while sending the young credulous people of faith and trusting innocent doggos and scarred PTSD soldiers down in to the hell basement to get turned into pustulant tentacle vampires and die. 

And, thanks to trump, if they do manage to chase the illegal space aliens out of your basement you won't pay any inheritance tax on your evil crazy dad's evil crazy loot.

Nope, come to find out my Grandpa, who’s fully retired, just organized the wait staff at a local restaurant and got them to start a union after I mentioned something about a provision in the tax bill.

So one side that’s portrayed is a classical reactionary who hates black people because he wants to go back to a time where whites dominated society.

The other side is a black man who hates whites because of the atrocities and oppression whites have forced on “his people”. 

In the end of the music video, right when you think the two are about to fight, you know what happens? They instead hug! Never mind that a couple minutes before this, the reactionary calls the black man “nigger”... Basically it’s the classical “this hug is ending racism”.

I’m not saying I hate Joyner, I just don’t get how a young black man can be so out of touch. But what I DO hate is seeing all these reaction videos to the song basically AGREEING with the ending, people of all colors saying “see, that’s what you gotta do to fix the world”. Like no! He just got in his face and called him a racial slur! Stand up for yourself lol.Hi guys, so I’ve made posts before about subjects like this. I’m in a lot of “debate politics” forums and discord servers which includes people from all walks of politics, so I can keep up to date on what certain ideology followers believe in and such.

A new one from the American far right (when I say far right I mean fascist, Third Positionist, and Natsoc) is their absolute contempt for confederates and slavery. Now with slavery, they don’t hate it because owning a fucking human being is WRONG, they hate it because “it brought blacks into the country. If Americans hadn’t been so lazy we wouldn’t be in the mess we’re in right now”. Some even go on to say if they had lived in this time, they would’ve been abolitionists lmao...

Also from that era, I’ve noticed many far right Americans despise the confederates, and again, not because they were in the wrong, but because they were technically fighting to keep blacks in the country. Now I don’t know if the next part is true, but many of them have said that Lincoln had a plan to deport all former slaves, so they believe confederates like Booth were race traitors.

I just find it so fascinating that many times they’ll have good viewpoints, but for the ABSOLUTE wrong reasons. See their bid for universal healthcare (but for whites only), hyping up black nationalists (because some were segregationists), and despise American Slavery (because it brought blacks to the country).[2 shot at Central Michigan University, suspect at large: Police](http://abcnews.go.com/US/shots-reportedly-fired-central-michigan-university-campus-suspect/story?id=53463323)

HAHAHAHA HOLY SHIT THIS IS SO BAD....So many fanatical movies get praised at the Oscars, and I’m not here to shit talk fantasy or those who watch it, but how the fuck was The Florida Project overlooked so god damn hard?

Okay I can answer that question myself. It was a god tier portrayal of the true trials and tribulations of lower class Americans, and that bores the ultra-lib Academy voters. Hell, the Academy was willing to nominate a film that SHIT TALKED THEM (Get Out) over a harsh and realistic portrayals of the life us “peasants” have to live.

I know that being mad over the Oscars is a dumb thing, but that movie didn’t virtue signal, was absolutely fantastic, and was harshly realistic. It meant a lot to a lot of people, and it sucks that it has gotten overlooked so hard. Totalitarians

EverythingNo single person on earth today has done as much for the glorious high albedo master children percentage of Aryans as Herr /u/Spez! Not since Goebbels himself murdered his six children then ate delicious almond candy has a towering obermesnch collossus of Nazi propaganda bestrode the quivering earth. Without /u/Spez Nazis could not have made their extremely relevant and important inroads in counquering teh white house of hte United States. Without /u/Spez Dylan Roof could not have shot a bunch of black people in church. None of this shit would have been possible except for /u/Spez, who has done more Nazi shit simply by sitting in his office sheltering the Nazi cause like ane enormous Aryan chicken brooding over her khaki clad tiki torch wavering chicks making sure htey have a safe place to plot murder and genocide and never have any trouble coordinating or finding an audience. If Hitler was the greatest Nazi of the 20th century then /u/Spez is the greatest Nazi of the 21st,ushering in a glorious new 10 thousand year reich wher eNeizis will never want for a safe easy accessible place to do nazi shit ont he internet while also funneling money in to /u/spez pockets by being Nazis. 


Heil /u/Spez for his enormous contributions in furhtering the Nazi cause that was once thought lost! We couldn't have done it withou8t you you miserable piece of shit. Solve for X. Instead of focusing on the failure of capitalism there, the insane rise of racism amongst young Italians, or how to combat the kind of environment where proto-fascism thrives.

But fuck all of that, fuck you Putin!

Just had to vent.I’m not exactly sure how the idea that Europe as a whole is completely progressive came about, but that’s just flat out wrong. Maybe 3 countries in Europe can be declared progressive, but the populace’s of most other European countries are moving much further to the right.

Spain, Hungary, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Greece, and the Czech Republic are all solidly right wing. Germany, Denmark, and Finland are slowly moving toward the right, and the UK is basically a battleground and in the middle currently.

If there is going to be a resurgence of the true far right, it will happen in Europe, and that is already beginning. That’s why I find it so funny that on the internet the “Europe is truly progressive” myth is so often parroted.

Hell, it’s like once Europe’s population hit more than 6% non-white, they ran back to right wing ideals.That is all. What the fuck was that? Did anyone see that? What am I drinking?

I think we need to have a hard look in the mirrorSo basically I’ve seen takes allll over the place. I’ve seen liberals be mostly negative, conservatives be positive and negative, the far right be positive and negative, and some leftists be positive and negative. What is YOUR opinion about it?

I personally am wary, but any approach to NK that isn’t “carpet bomb the entire country” is good in my opinion. Do I like Trump at all? FUCK no. Will I give him major props if his administration somehow ends the tension? FUCK yes.

Opinions?I’ll start off by giving you his mindset. He’s the kind of guy who goes to the futurology subreddit and fawns over all these possible “Life enhancers”. The more they learn about this stuff, the more they realize that it won’t be possible to achieve it in a “humane” way. So they slowly start to creep towards “well, these enhancers could change the world, so maybe we should have national tests and whoever scores lowest will be our guinea pigs!”.

Sad thing is, that’s only a slight exaggeration. Look at his reasoning for creating the “hyperloop system”. He stated that he hated public transit because it was a pain in the ass and “you’re sharing a space with possible serial killers!”. That’s some heavy coded speech there, which could mean mentally ill who can’t afford normal travel, people who he views as generally “unclean”, or the very possible meaning of POC, demonizing them.

There is also his odd view on colonizing other planets. It’s very vague, so I get the feel that he just wants to get off this planet and create an isolated community filled with people like him, while leaving Earth the same shitty state as when he left. Basically “fuck you, I got mine.”

The worst part about it though, most of the population is totally fine with it!! The average person views Musk as a visionary instead of the selfish guy he is!

May's response:

https://youtu.be/NWzMcwo2Z9A

Another Russian turns up dead in the UK.

http://www.newsweek.com/nikolai-glushkov-another-putin-critic-has-just-been-found-dead-london-842800?yptr=yahoo

The deadline for Russian response to this act of aggression has passed. What happens next? 

Simply because Corbyn wants cooler heads to prevail, get all the facts, and open a dialogue. 

Because he doesn’t want to launch a full scale war against Russia, Corbyn is now viewed as a “Russian sympathizer” which is fucking hilariously awful.Some dope saw the link on Twitter and is asking the Qberts what a Q post is and they're shrieking about how the dope is a Soros plant sent to waste everybody's time I'm dying.


EDIT: In the voice chat they're talking about all the fan letters that Trump must receive in the mail. One guy has been working on a letter for a whole week but gets too emotional to finish.


EDIT 2: Some lady is trying to convince the chat to call their congressman about it. Another person said a mailman tried to invade his house and the police did nothing.


EDIT 3: The chat just prayed for God to help them figure out what President Trump is trying to tell them.When people told me they hated Theresa May or (far worse) that they were "not fans," I wish I had said in no uncertain terms: "I love Theresa May. I am in awe of her. I am set free by her. She will be the finest world leader our galaxy has ever seen."
  
I wish, in those exchanges, I had not asked gentle, tolerant questions about a hater's ridiculous allergy to her, or May's fictional misdeeds and imagined character flaws. More deeply still, I wish I had not reasoned with anyone, patiently countered their ludicrous emotionalism and psychologically disturbed theories. I wish I had said, flatly, "I love her." As if I had been asked about my mother or daughter. No defensiveness or polemics; not dignifying the crazy allegations with so much as a Snopes link.
  
Maybe "I love her" seemed too womany, too sentimental, too un-pragmatic. Not coalition-building, kind of culty. But people say with impunity they love Corbyn, the state of Palestine, their churches, John Lennon. In the end, I wish I'd said it because it's true.
And I'm not alone in my commitment. Millions of May’s supporters — we were thanked by May as the "secret, private Facebook sites" — expressed it among themselves, all the time, in raptures or happy tears with each new display of our heroine's ferocious intelligence, depth, and courage. We were frankly bewildered by the idea that anyone would hedge their commitment to her ("You don't have to be her friend"; "Yes, she's made mistakes"; "lesser of two evils"). We didn't remember anyone turning to this stock ambivalence when discussing Princess Diana, David Beckham, Henry VIII. If only one reporter — they knew about us — could have published a headline like "May Inspires Historic Levels of Adoration From Her Supporters" about the people who have had their lives transformed by the power of her brilliant campaign, unrivaled effectiveness, and extraordinary career. Just one headline like that, like the ones Jeremy Corbyn got.
  
Usually a legend is made by men and media — the legend of Kennedy, say, or Jim Morrison — and then, much later, a biopic, pretending to evenhandedness, reveals the legend's shortcomings, his "human" side. The shortcomings are almost always something exactly no one actually believes compromises his heroism. His problem drinking. His mistreatment of women. Well, takedowns of Theresa were always already written. She has somehow made the time to hear out each dead-end line of reasoning about her fake mortal sins, and often she has also thanked everyone for sparing her further moral lashings, as if that were a kindness. Under cover of "humanizing" the intimidating valedictorian, reports and investigations and media clichés vilified her. But the feminist hero never got to be a legend first. And yet she is one, easily surpassing Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Alan Turing.
  
I want to reverse the usual schedule of things, then. We don't have to wait until she dies to act. Theresa May's name belongs on ships, and airports, and tattoos. She deserves straight-up hagiographies and a sold-out Theatreland show called MARY. Yes, this cultural canonization is going to come after the chronic, constant, nonstop "On the other hand" sexist hedging around her legacy. But such is the courage of Theresa May and her supporters; we reverse patriarchal orders. Maybe she is more than a prime minister. Maybe she is an idea, a world-historical heroine, light itself. The prime minister is too small for her. She belongs to a much more elite class of Britains, the more-than-prime-ministers. Stephen Hawking, William Shakespeare, Winston Fucking Churchill.
  
Theresa May did everything right in this campaign, and she won more votes than her opponent did. She won. She cannot be faulted, criticized, or analyzed for even one more second. Instead, she will be decorated as an epochal heroine far too extraordinary to be contained by the mere Great Offices of State. Let that revolting prime minister-elect be Jeremy Corbyn or Jon Lansmen or whatever. Theresa is Athena.It's a cornerstone of American society and culture that the random undirected mass murder of civilians is good, but only as long as it's inflicted on nebulous and ill defined out groups far away. They are totally losing their shit. /r/liberalgunowners is upvoting some derranged shit comparing high school kids walking out to protest gun violence to honkies in the south protesting school desegregation. It's fucking wild. They are scared as shit after a year of partying about Trump's presidency. It was either post more or go back to porn. Surely it's not "do something with my life."Like, and fucking Britain being all wounded because the Ruskies maybe gacked some dude on their turf, like, fucking shut up you've invaded how many countries in the last ten years! Oh, but murdering dude's with nerve gas is different than splattering someone's brains out with a gat or dropping a two thousand pound bomb on them because horrors of wwi or some bullshit. Fucking fuck. Like... I think the consensus here is that even if the Russians did everything they're accused of it'd still be some tepid ass boring shit that doesn't rise to the level of malfeasance of pretty much anything DC and Wallstreet don't do every day anyway, but people are fucking hanging on this shit like it's the most exciting thing that ever happened and a totally new chapter in the history of American political decay.They don’t understand that sadly, no matter how xenophobic or just generally shitty Russia becomes, many non-white countries view Russia as the “wall” to protect them from American imperialism, so they will get involved in this as well.

Then you have China, who most likely would side with Russia, who would then bring in all of their new African ”””Allies”””, and soon you’d have a bunch of white countries (with a couple token non white allies) vs a white country and a ton of non white countries. Basically World War 3: The Race War. Due to today’s political climate, the undertones of that doesn’t sit well with me at alllll.

Annihilation is a very complex, thoughtful, intellectual movie where a bunch of STEM zombies go on a nature hike, run in to very boring Florida swamp animals, and all die. Except Natalie Portman. This is a little complex so give me a second.

1. Natalie Portman (white) was cheating on her husband, hunky special force troop Oscar Isaac (apparently not white, but I'm skeptical) with her coworker David Gyasi (black). 

2. Oscar Isaac (white? not white? Can we settle on white passing? I think light skinned Latino men's white passing status is contextual at this point) finds out that Natalie Portman (white) is cheating on him with her coworker David Gyas (black).

3. Hunky special forces troop Oscar Isaac (White passing. We're going with white passing) decides to go on a nature hike because he is upset that his wife (white) is cheating on him with his coworker (black). He dies

4. Portman feels guilty about this. This is reinforced by numerous flashbacks to her having dispassionate sex with Gyasi. 

5. But wait! Isaacs is not dead! He shows up at home inexplicably! He is *obviously* a pod person, but no one notices because you have to be genre blind in this kind of movie. He is sick and low key dying of, like, radiation poisoning or something, it's not clear. 

6. Portman decides to go on a nature hike on the same trail where her husband dies. She goes in with a team of four women whose suitability for this task is presented as natural and never questioned. This is the only good thing about the movie, so savor it. (Oh, she's a doctor, so she can save her husband from whatever it was on the nature trail that made him dying)

7. They repeatedly encounter creatures that have inexplicably hybridized DNA in ways that the characters say are impossible. This is sort of presented as though it should be weird and threatening but the director never really commits and it doesn't help that it's mostly depicted by pretty flowers and "scary mutants" that are literally just a white alligator and a bear. The bear's scary mutant ability is that it can make cries like a woman screaming for help but mountain lions literally actually do make cries like a woman screaming for help so... yeah. It's basically just a bear. Also a lady turns in to flowers. I guess this is bad? The Director doesn't seem to have an opinion. 

8. Let me reiterate; The character are constantly menaced by hybridized, slightly weird looking, but otherwise fairly normal wildlife. Some weird shit happens suggesting that they're getting hybridized too, and some of it's pretty body horror but doesn't, you know, seem to actually cause them any harm. 

9. But it's still presented as bad and scary. No one shows an ounce of scientific curiosity or wonder at any point in the entire movie. No one every gets excited about the weird shit. It's just like "Oh no, weird shit, this is upsetting and/or I have no feelings about this".

10. Eitherway, let's wrap this up. Portman find's evidence that Isaac is a pod person and the real Isaac committed suicide but let's get real; Anyone who has ever seen one of these movies figured that out an hour and a half ago. 

11. Portman goes in to a hole that's kind of scary but not really that scary because I guess she hear's a voice down there? [This shit happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=NOvg9hMHkJs) because it's one of those movies that confuses being obtuse with being clever. 

12. This movie is *SO FUCKING AMERICA* I want to vomit fireworks and eagle tears directly in the mouth of the Director. A scientist encounters the alien other, the mystery at the heart of everything. It assumes a familiar shape comprehensible to man. She fucking *MAG DUMPS AN M16 AT IT WITHOUT EVEN TRYING TO PLAY THE FUCKING FIBONACCI SEQUENCE*. 

13. Then we get a sequence that manages to be both kind of boring and kind of rapey where she fights it, but it just mimics everything she does, then it turns in to her, so she gives it a live grenade and then it stops mimicking her and catches fire and burns down the entire nature trail. 

14. The End! 

15. But wait, let's go back to the debriefing room where very obviously at this point a Pod Person Natalie Portman has been committing the same sin as The Usual Suspects and spinning tall tales for the last two hours (did I mention that the entire story is related by an unreliable narrator with no independent verification of any key facts? Directors who do this should be shot). 

16. Not!Issac is all "I don't know if I'm Isaac" then hugs his wife. His eyes turn grey. *Her eye's turn grey*! Because you see, my fellow Aryan Volksturmarscholes, they have been infected by the ~~neanderthal untermensch~~ alien Other and are now ~~sneaking in to Germany to sell our glorious reich out to the craven Jew~~ at large in America where they will do something... nefarious? Who fucking knows. The entire movie is structured as though this reveal should be a bad thing.

13. And here's the thing; The movie doesn't comment on how Portman, having come face to face with the Other who can presumably answer her questions, explain all this bullshit, and resolve the plot, decides to shoot it with a gun then blow it up and set it on fire. This is presented as a perfectly natural thing for science people to do. The entire movie is structured in such a way that this alien humanoid thing is obviously supposed to be the bad guy and she's in a boss fight, but the Director never really commits by assigning a motive to it or anything. The Director *also* doesn't commit by even hinting that maybe "Man is the real monster". Now, this is where White Genocide comes in; The only consistent theme the Director has really stuck with and committed to is that whatever weird ass species hybridization bullshit is happening on this nature trail is weird and bad and makes people kill themselves and creates monsters. That's *it*. There's an alligator, it's a monster, they shoot it with guns. There's a bear, it's a monster, they shoot it with guns. There's a humanoid, it's a monster (I guess?) they shoot it with guns. Natural progression. Three act structure. The Director is writing for an audience that understands without being told that the Alien is a *bad thing* and destroying it is a *good thing*. The Director is writing for an audience who does not need to be told *why* the alien is bad or that it needs to be destroyed. The *Director does not question this and assumes that the audience will not question it either*.

When the alien other is a [30 foot tall T-rex made of carbon fiber, battery acid, and hate?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS-x1AzjqLQ) *that is a reasonable fucking assumption and anyone can see that the Alien is an active, inimical threat to human life and should be resisted with violence. 

But this alien isn't a 30 foot tall rape monster designed by Geiger. It's just sort of a weird humanoid thingy. In any other movie the scientist makes *any* attempt at communication. She waves her hand at it. She says something. She flashes a mathematical sequence at it. Natalie Portman does not do any of these things. The humanoid exists, she decides to kill it, No other possibilities are suggested, explored, or offered. We are not invited to criticize or question her action. It is presented as the only natural outcome of the encounter. 

Which is why this steaming hot pile of trash is so *fucking* insidious. The Director has written a movie for an audience that is normatively and reflexively xenophobic. This is a movie written for all those asshole neoliberal techbros who are always assuring us that we need to kill any alien we encounter because "Game Theory" states that all Aliens are xenocidal neoliberal chud maniacs who, according to biotroofs, will always immediately engage is mutually assured xenocide the instant they learn of the existence of other species. 

/18. I don't know if I covered this or not, but the big reveal is that while The Zone (because this is a bad ripoff of Stalker/Roadside Picnic) is gone, Isaac and Portman are both pod people. THIS IS BAD. THE END. 

The Director is so convinced of this that he doesn't even bother to hint at what nefarious deeds the Pod People might do. This is obviously a Bad Ending twist. The way the entire movie is structured we are supposed to take away that it is somehow bad that these two people about whom we know very little have been replaced by Pod People. The Director simply frames it as a given that these, here's the money shot, miscegnated hybrids are nefarious and bad *for simply existing* and their mere existence must be dangerous and negative. 

TLDR; Annihilation is a movie written for a reflexively xenophobic audience by a reflexively xenophobic writer. It is counterevolutionary trash that denies the glory of Hoxha-Posadism. It reveals how deeply and unquestioningly xenophobia is rooted in American culture, reproducing in science fiction form America's fears of immigration and race mixing without *ever* self-consciously engaging with those ideas. 1/10 stars because at least it has a cast of women in a science fiction movie I guess. Will this finally be the topic that ruptures this community? PROTIP: the Context is that hate crimes laws exist because it provides a legal avenue for busting up the KKK. Sorting out the Klan is literally the entire reason we have hate crimes laws. They're good as hell and the Klan is mostly dead because hate crimes legislation let some prosecutor say "Fuck your "first amendment right" to burn crosses near a black church your terrorist ass is going to the hoosgow oh and it's a federal crime so your cracker ass brother in law the local prosecutor can't shield you from prosecution for your murdering terrorist ways". 

Like, America is a fuck but hate crimes laws were good. The whole goddamn point of them is when terrorists do terrorist shit they can't just smirk and say "We was within our rights to say something that was obviously a threat of death but technically conforms with the legal requirements of the first amendment even though everyone knows that it was contextually a real and imminent threat of death or substantial harm" and also cause it's federal it took prosecutorial authority away from good old boy chud prosecutors in the south. 

That's what killed the KKK. Well, that, and super man, I guess. Super man also killed the KKK, which is rad as hell, because Superman is super circumcised if you get my drift and having a flying swole crypto-Jew beat the shit out of a bunch of terrorist assholes in bedsheets even though he's fictional is fucking amazeballs. 

NOTE: I may be wrong about some or all of this but fuck it I'm red as hell right now and the world is a fuck. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Enforcement_Act

Like seriously everyone's like "MUH FREEZE PEACH HOW CAN I 'SPRESS MUHSELF IF I CAN'T BASH QUEERS AND BURN CROSSES!" and it's like a.) Shut your fucking straw mouth you straw asshole and b.) what would happen is that the Klan would roll up in their police type cars with their police type guns and police type bombs and shoot up a black church or murder some jews or massacree some catholics or some shit, then someone would be all "This is a crime" and the police (having carefully removed their klan hoods but sometimes not) would be all "We just plum can't seem to find out who could have done this despicable act of putting these uppity no good negros in the place god has decreed is right and proper for them so we're gonna drop the case now nothing to see here". And they'd get away with it because the cops and the prosecutors were in the klan and the klan was in the cops and prosecutors and since they were local crimes, not state or federal, there was no one who could say shit about it, so the klan literally just got away with murder and terror and arson and all sorts of violence because they controlled the legitimate use of coercive violence at the local level.

So what was done was that the feds were like "Fuck y'alls terrorist asses we don't like the blacks either but we like domestic terrorist insurrections even less we're gonna make it illegal to do klan shit with your klan friends and we're gonna make it a federal crime so we can send Hoover's gangster's down to 'Bama and kick your fucking teeth in." 

And that's pretty much what happened. They passed some laws in '68 that said it was a federal crime to deny people their federal right to not get murdered by the klan and then when the klan murdered people they sent Hoover's hatchetmen down South to fuck up the Klan (mostly just for variety, as FBI men become weird and skittish if they're fed solely on the blood of trade unionists and reds) and fuck up the Klan they did because after nearly a hundred goddamn years of terrorism the Klan was more or less wiped out as a coherent entity by the 1980s and one of the bloodiest chapters of American terrorism was coming to an end. 

Hate crime legislation is sort of weird in that it's the federal center reaching down to take the legitimate use of force away from the otherwise pretty independent white terrorist government in the periphery. The Feds sort of half ass tried to crack down on the Klan in the 1870s but the Klan won is a big way and shoved Black Americans back in chains with Jim Crow, and they more or less had a hundred year reign of terror after that, up until the Federal Civil Rights act in '68. 

So for a hundred years these little fiefdoms out in the South, with the Sheriff and the Mayor and whatever and they're all honkies, they had complete monopoly on the coercive use of violence against minorities within their fiefdom. They could rape and kill and lynch and burn blacks and there was no reservoir of state power that would oppose them. Blacks under these terrorist fiefdoms were left to fight for themselves, and I wish it weren't so but the odds were real bad and it almost always worked out that the white man won and slaughtered anyone who stood up. 

But in '68 shit was unraveling with the war and civil rights and whatnot and now the feds recognized that the Klan was causing more problems than it solved and out of some combination of decency and pragmatism they decided the thing to do was suppress the Klan again.

So what they did is say "The buck doesn't stop in your little fiefdom anymore, Boss Hogg. The buck goes all the way back to Washington and if you don't keep a lid on this shit we'll step in and gut your piggy ass and make sausage out of you and all your klan buddies." And suddenly all these poor cops and sheriffs and mayors couldn't do klan shit with their klan buddies with impunity anymore, because they had to watch their backs for fear that the G-men would kick the doors in and drag them all in to federal court to answer for their crimes. 

And that's a real fucking interesting deal, because it was a big sort of power grab, and a change in the power dynamics of the country, because all the sudden the feds said "Hey what y'all fuckers out in the periphery do to the minorities, that's our business now, it's not your business no more, we're gonna do something about this shit so y'all gotta shape up to our standards.", and that's an important step in the history of the contests between local and state and federal power, and its' fucking interesting and I wish I knew more about it. 

Eitherway, I'm just ranting at this point and my fire's mostly gone out and it's late. Y'all read any of this and it's bullshit you call me out and let me know because I've got more anger than sense at this time of night and I'm just ranting and i always want to learn more about this horrible shithole country and it's evil ass history of race terrorism and violence, so clue me in if you know more than I do. I know I’m stealing that take from left twitter, but man, this verdict was just fucking dumb lol. Is Dankula a cunt? Yes! Does he deserve to go to jail? No! Is he a criminal for making his pug do a semi-convincing nazi salute? I don’t think so. He’s being convicted over the equivalent of a Mel Brooks joke, and all this is doing is giving reactionaries ammo for their “we’re oppressed!” claim.

Get it together UK lol. It's reassuring to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with others who also point at and mock the malicious. 

 Also, my Mars colony just got it's first shipment of boiled human organs and is going to eat great tonight.I’m fucking mad online.

It is clear that the Russian investigation is the handle that the Dems are putting both their hands on. Every time you search up say, Bernie’s name, you get libs saying that Bernie wanting to focus on domestic issues is a “distraction” and the even more dangerous “Anyone on Bernie’s side is a Russian patsy”.

Why is that so dangerous? Because it’s painting ANY kind of socialist policy as “Russian approved”. A movement that began in 2015 is getting stepped on by Liberals all because they can’t focus on more than two fucking things.

I’d usually say I’m overreacting, but every blue win since Trump was been elected has been a god damn centrist Liberal that votes against the working class at best, and reactionary at worst.

It’s god damn soul crushing to see the movement go to hell on the big stage because liberals can’t accept that their country isn’t the shining example of greatness that they think it is.https://twitter.com/katiepavlich/status/976462964642467840With the news that the Austin bomber hated “modern society” and technology, I gotta wonder, what makes this kind of thinking lead to bombing? The Unabomber, Mcveigh, and a couple others had this line of thinking as well.

It seems like the nihilist extremists shy away from guns and go to bombs.

Edit: I understand that Mcveigh also did the OK bombing because of Waco and Ruby Ridge, but I believe he was also against “modern society” as well.I think I’ll like it herePlease just log the fuck off sometimes and go get involved in something that will actually help the left. Throwing a fit at DSA online because some tankies are being fucks doesn’t help the left. Dunking on Jordan Peterson all day, smooth as his brain may be, doesn’t help the left in any meaningful way. Yelling about cumtown certainly doesn’t help the left. Etc. 

I am a simple man, and I love shitting on pundits and making fun of chuds as much as anyone else, and there’s nothing wrong with doing it. But for fuck’s sake please also do something good in the world. The left isn’t twitter. There are people out there who are actually dedicated to organizing and we can help them in real, meaningful ways. http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-fake-news-targeted-alabama-senate-race-zuckerberg-03-23-2018

I wonder if this mollifies the embarrassment of Alabama almost voting for a paedophile in office. 

White America needs to stop blaming everything else on the election and reflect on their own incredibly fucked up soul instead. Ok hear me out. The Resistance has focused on Trump’s dick like, a lot, every time they make some weird detailed picture of Trump naked, they always draw his dick tiny.

SO, if Stormy releases their sex tape, and Trump’s dick is an absolute hog, well then that’s it for liberals. The chain reaction will be massive, the Dems will Be BTFO, and resign. 

THAT is where we come in, the DSA will fill the void and we’ll wash Trump in 2020. Guys, Trump’s dick may save America.Broke: IMC

There's a bunch of this all over the front page of /r/militaryporn. Real sock puppet hours who's a bot? Most gun control efforts are premised entirely on legislative controls of one sort or another. 

But what about direct action? Guns are sold from store fronts and offices. Guns are sold by people. Those storefronts can be picketed or subjected to sit-ins. Those people can be ostracized. 

Now, personally, I think gun control is a fools errand, but I'm not going to get in anyone's way if they fight for it, either. I'm just wondering, is anyone exploring tactics to influence gun culture outside of legislative action?The backlash to Killer Mike’s words is no longer about him being dumb for allying with the NRA, it has become an anti-Bernie and anti-socialism circlejerk.

I think economics might be bullshit. I'm not sure, but when I read about economics it tends to sound like the same morass of unfalsifiable, untestable, esoteric nonsense that some Anthropologists come up with. People drawing castles in the sky trying to explain things they can't even concretely define.

So, like, if someone is in on the joke let me know, because, like, when Anthropologists theorize grand theories about why people do things it's silly harmless good fun (unless they go in to marketing) because no one listens, but someone let the economists have the keys to all the banks and capitol buildings so if they're all charlatans doing tricks with smoke and mirrors to impress superstitious and easily gulled men of state we should probably do somethingGonna unethically consume some soyboy brunch soon, how about you?* Rick Cheek

Yeah. Let's pretend the democrats don't do almost as much to sustain the current Neo liberal nightmare. Let's pretend that many democratic states don't have the biggest disparity in income, poverty and infrastructure in utter tatters.

Will it be in front of a chamber where you can prostrate yourself and pay respects? Basically, there were two factions. 

One was mad because Mandarin wasn't a racist, yellow peril, East Asian stereotype. As he was originally in the comics. 

The other was fine with the fact that he was a caricature of a middle eastern terrorist, but damn it all why wasn't he the main villain. 

Both camps hated the fact that the main villain was a white, silicone valley type who was using islamophobia as a cover for his nefarious war profiteering. 

America hated the fact that the villain wasn't an ethnically caricatured (middle East or far east) villain. But a white guy hoping to get rich. 

Fucking perfect. That tells you everything about America.

Of course, sports and the military have always had a close relationship, but I feel that lately I have been bombarded with more military propaganda than in the past.

I'm not finding a ton of info online if the military's advertising budget increased from year-to-year, but I did come across this article from adweek.com, where it says, 
&gt; The audit launched in 2016 during a still-ongoing competitive review for the Army’s marketing account, which could concern up to $4 billion in spending over a period lasting as long as 10 years, according to Department of Defense estimates.

It's pretty fucking depressing to think over the past 10 years, The U.S spent $4 billion to convince teenagers to murder brown people, steal their resources for the elite, while possibly dying and getting PTSD in the process.

It has become, or has been since Obama, a culture war issue. Frightened white men see guns as one of the top symbols of their Christian, white culture and any opinion on it as direct threat to their culture. I would bet many pro gun nuts in the internet don't even carry guns. But has decided to embrace a side in the culture war. I was the white guy meekly clapping for the Muslim anarchists (?).To be brief:

If you're going to be a political event/rally/protest, make sure you've got friends who know. Provide some proof remotely to the Internet if needed. If you get indefinitely detained or wounded, give your friends something to go off of. If it's a march, know where it's headed.

1. Have a first aid kit and know first aid. If someone gets seriously hurt, you may not have the luxury of egressing to a medical facility or for an ambulance to pull right up. If anything, the police and counter-protesters may prevent that from happening as a disincentive to protest. You don't have to do field surgery, just know how to keep someone from bleeding out within the first fifteen minutes.

2. Get a vest. No, seriously. If cops in controlled situations are spraying live fire out of 'fear,' then a more chaotic rally will be worse. So, soft armor, NIJ IIIA. Will protect you from the occasionally gun-toting counter protester, too. Keep in mind that just because something is bulletproof does not mean it is knifeproof, and vice versa. Consider where your main arteries are and protect those. Wear anti-abrasive and tear resistant clothing. Think construction worksite.

3. Gasmask. A real one with filters, not some Amazon airsoft bullshit. You think I'm joking, but no. If pepperballs or tear gas gets involved, it may be on you to pull someone out of the gas, especially if they've been overexposed or have pulmonary conditions.

4. Physiology. Know how to defend yourself, be strong enough to carry or drag someone who has been wounded, be strong enough to take a few hits, know how to run fast when someone needs you, have the endurance to run back and forth if you're needed multiple places at once. If you go down, don't expect the state to have any interest in keeping you in an 'able-bodied' condition for later unrest. As we've seen, cops will be happy to let counter-protesters do their work for them. Less paperwork, and even less accountability (than usual). So be ready for the worst.

'Cause that's Hellworld.

Stay safe, Hellkites.

####Statistics aren't racist!

####SJWs are triggered by numbers lmao!

These are the common responses that right wingers will give if they are called out on their bullshit. I'm sure that everyone has seen a conversation like this one play out:

___

Right Winger: FBI crime statistics show that blacks are more likely to commit crime.

Leftist: That's pretty racist, dude.

Right Winger: Oh my God SJWs get offended by literally everything. News Flash: facts don't care about your feelings!

___

We can laugh and make memes about Ben Shapiro repeatedly saying "facts don't care about your feelings!" but the leftist still looks like a fool to many neutral people. Those memes are only found humorous by people who already recognize coded racist rhetoric; somebody unfamiliar with dog whistles won't find a meme attacking right wing use of them convincing, but they *will* find a right wing meme about leftists being scared of facts to be convincing. So we need to recognize this:

#Dog Whistles are very effective, and right wingers use them constantly. We must methodically counter them.

___

When looking at any issue, we must see that there are 3 main rhetorical components to it:

#1. WHAT the issue is

#2. WHY it happened

#3. HOW do we solve it

If you make a statement about one of these things, it typically implies at least 1 other part. Let's look at our previous example:

"FBI crime statistics amongst black people" is the issue, and the righter winger *implies* that the reason those crimes occur is because that black people are, well, black. If it's brought up when talking about police brutality, it *implies* that the solution to black crime is to beat them into submission.

Notice how the issue itself doesn't seem to be bad: it's just facts after all, right? But once we dig a little deeper and clearly lay out its implications when spoken by a right winger, the bigotry becomes obvious.

___

#TL;DR: 3 Steps to Analyzing and Exposing a Fascist Argument

##1. Are they lying about what's happening? 

If they are going on about *No-Go Zones* then you can obviously point to the facts and the evidence to show that they are lying. If you're unfamiliar with the situation, just ask what their source is: half of the time they won't have one and the other half of the time it will be Fox or 4chan.

##2. Are they implying false causes?

DO NOT TELL THEM WHAT THEY ARE IMPLYING; MAKE THEM SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU! If someone says "black people are more likely to commit crime," just say "Why?" If they bring up poverty then say "well, slavery is known to make people poor." If they bring up """Black Culture""" then say "well, segregated people tend to develop different cultures." If you know the cause, bring them to it, if you don't know the cause but know their heinous implications, bring them to it.

##3. Are they implying Fascist solutions?

If a black man is beaten by police and they start going off about "black crime" or saying "his hands were at his waist" then ask them "do you think that having your hands at your waist should be punishable by death?" If the cop is yelling instructions right before the shooting, ask them "do you think that we should all be subject to a game of *Simon Says* where the cop kills us if we get the answer wrong?" If neither work, then ask "do you seriously think that someone who [requires less training than a manicurist](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/28/us/jobs-training-police-trnd/index.html) should be judge, jury, and executioner?"no one upvoted the best thing i said todayso im balls deep in crunchy jiff when, laughing, they take my pic and run off

my question is, i want to keep the peanut butter as evidence - what do i do about the fire ants crawling in my dickheadWhite, upper class guy does something disrespectful in a foreign yet 'civilized' country. Cue liberals being unable to say "oh well he's black, you know, hood mentality" or "he's a southern redneck hick with no manners." Said liberals proceed to proclaim their outrage, and I recall a particularly mournful comment about how this makes it so much harder for the 'good' white Americans to be accepted by the Japanese.

... Because all Japanese animosity is from dumb American tourists, not... geopolitics, right?

And did not one of them think "wait, the way we're afraid of being judged by the actions of a single person... doesn't this mirror the experience of marginalized groups in America who have to continually prove they aren't the shitty stereotype portrayed on Fox News?" No, of course not. Did they ever stop to consider *why* Japan has such a suicide problem, and how maybe Japanese workplaces shouldn't be emulated? Nope. Nipponophilia, abound. You won't see this level of concern about Syria or Yemen or Palestine--because there's 'good' nation for liberals to show off to. 

And somehow the Americans invested in sweatshops in southeast/south Asia and the sex tourists are conveniently forgotten, because a liberal can just say "oh that person is a boor and has nothing to do with me, nothing you can do," or Paul Krugman will shrug and say that sweatshops are the best moral choice. All this talk about child slavery and sex trafficking rings in the United States is effectively twentysomethings just LARPing between classes, not interested in actually solving a problem.

Extend this to anything else. Droning a wedding is 'outrageous,' because a liberal can't stand the thought of their big expensive day being ruined, but blowing up a village? Shrugged away. Pissing on the corpses of dead fighters is 'too far,' but creating those corpses to begin with is fine? 

Or how whenever Trump does anything, the top comment will be "hey, American here, this guy doesn't represent us, sorry--" except that HE DOES REPRESENT your neoliberal ideology, he's just one tick the the right and more open about it than you are. When Obama gives everything an air of class and sophistication, hey, palatable. But when Trump makes the shittiness transparent? Too far! It must be Russian interloping, not actual conservative desire to create a capitalist dystopia. 

They aren't resisting Trump's policies, they're resisting that someone made them look bad. Now they're appealing to a cosmic HOA to make their neighborhood respectable again, but note they won't do a single direct thing about it.

What a brilliant response. Gotta remember it by heart when I debate another liberal shitstain.

Grab you right by the leftist and squeeze. And if not, fucking why?is it act different?I bet he has a few regretsSo my state is holding a vote next month to determine if we’ll be a right to work state or not. 

I understand it’s ostensibly an attempt to weaken unions, but I’ve found it really hard to articulate that to others. A lot of my friends are proud centrists and all they really care about is “personal freedom in the workplace”. I mean first of all if they actually gave a shit about that they’d be pro-union, but that’s beside the point. 

I’ve been trying to talk to people in my life about the vote given its importance, but it’s difficult to make people look past that aspect. I’m just wondering how you all would recommend I talk to people about itIt seems like Theresa May has accomplished these things:


* Allow Trump to humiliate and undercut her on national news.
* Mobilize hundreds of thousands of people to march against someone she are visibly associated with.
* Give the opposition easy talking points and photo ops to use against her when she's teetering on an early election cliff.
* Give milquetoast monarchy defenders who are otherwise conservative a reason to hate her for forcing their queen to be around this lecherous oaf.


For what? Why did she do this?My coworker heard of AMLO and how he was the leftist president of Mexico. I was shocked and asked her how she knew about him.

She said Jon Favreau was "the funniest."


I was going to find that picture of Jon groping cardboard HRC to trigger her (she's \#stillwithher) but she had already moved on to their miniseries about fixing the Democratic party where they are interviewing a bunch of Republicans.


I told her we have no use for Republican ideas and that they all belong in reeducation camps, which didn't go over so well. I asked her if she was a big fan of The West Wing, but she never watched it.


BUT THE WELFARE SCRONGERS WHO HAVE 10 KIDS DO YOU THINK IT’S RIGHT THAT YOU CAN HAVE TEN CHILDREN AND NOT WORK AND HAVE THE STATE PAY FOR YOUR SATELLITE DISH AND HOLIDAY AND I KNOW THIS ONE GUY WHO JUST MILKS THE SYSTEM AND NEVER WORKS AND HE GOES OUT EVERY WEEKEND AND SPENDS LIKE CRAZY BECAUSE THE SPONGES LIKE HIM KNOW HOW TO GAME THE SYSTEM AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DONT YOU THINK THIS ONE GUY I KNOW IS A TWAT AND IS BAD? 

Every time. Its because they suck ass. All of their "world" sports is basically competing among themselves. But in the actual world stage America would be laid out like the cowards they really are. so they did not want to endure the humiliation. So... are there any uses for this beyond libertarians trying to dodge taxes or buy drugged up child mercenaries?

So Russian Oligarchs decided to get in to the "Fucking America Over" game? Okay, and? In what quantifiable way does this differ from what the American donor class was already doing? Who cares whether the knife has "Made in USA" or "Made in Moscow" on it when it slits your throat? Ok, here me out on how Montenegro fits into all this. Putin is mad at Montenegro because it was two Montenegrin princesses who introduced Rasputin to the Royal Family. Rasputin, and his evil bat Bartok then proceeded to overthrow the Romanov Dynasty and destroy the Russian Empire, which Putin wants to rebuild. During the 1980s, Putin, then working for the KGB in East Berlin, uncovered the truth that Anastasia was alive in Paris. However, he was stopped at the Fulda Gap by Baba Yaga from investigating further. Or he got drunk at a Puhdys concert. The sources are murky here. It is believed he swore vengeance from then on out. In 1999, Putin went into Limbo and lured Rasputin into Moscow with the promise of cakes and wine.  He then trapped him in an apartment complex on Guryanova Street and blew it up. Bartok was put in the Kursk and it was sunk. After a musical interlude with John Cusack and Kelsey Grammer, Putin then had to defeat Hilary because she was a student of Baba Yaga via Saul Alinsky. Now she's out of the picture and only Montenegro is left. This fall, join him and his magical friends for the first ever straight-to-bootleg-DVD war, featuring a holograph of Dom DeLuise as Donald Trump and the musical talents of Bernadette Peters as Angela Merkel. WAKE UP SHEEPLE!!!My last 3 conversations with conservatives this week have been:

1. I can't believes blacks want to be called "black people"! This is insanity!

2. Bernie is just like Marx; he never had a real job!

3. People are probably going to try to rename Washington state because it was named after a guy that owned slaves!

I just bite my tongue because, really, who actually spends their time caring about that shit? Liberals do the same thing quite a bit with "decorum" but at least they give a shit about minorities.

The only time I see conservatives caring about a real issue like immigration is when it's to piss off the libs. "Did you hear those libs scream about those concentration camp tapes? Triggered! LMAO!"

The only reason they care about taxes is because they hate poor people and are concerned that they might benefit.

The only reason they care about economics is because they want to climb to the top so they can be the oppressors, and it would benefit them then to have an economic framework giving them total impunity.Basically as far as I can tell a bunch of morons wrote a bill that clearly would make every HR department of a large company criminally liable for sex trafficking. So let's take them up on it.

22 U.S. Code § 7102 

4: Commercial sex act: 
The term “commercial sex act” means any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person.


10:
Sex trafficking:
The term “sex trafficking” means the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act.

I mean any company of any size knows they are hiring people who will be asked to perform sex acts in exchange for keeping their job, a promotion or etc.  And obviously some places would be obvious targets - where sexual harrassment is rampant and well documented.

But obviously no crime so far the HR dept.

18 U.S. Code § 1591 Basically just says anyone who ever knowingly participates in  a "sex trafficking" venture - and benefits - is criminally liable.

Let's prosecute HR and COO's for funsies.Ya’ll need to stop making jokes at anybody’s expense? Okay? Ya’ll need to realize that ironically doing something is the same as actually doing it, okay? Satire is the same as the thing it’s satirizing? 

I’m a Chapo fan, by the way, I just think the hosts need to do better organizing and should apologize for making jokes about people. Sometimes I feel like when I’m listening to Chapo I just suddenly feel my chest get tight when they make fun of people because that’s punching down and that’s wrong, okay? Do better ya’ll and keep doing good praxis. Can we get some input on what books every leftist should read at least once?

I’m up in bed thinking who in the their right mind would voluntarily sign up for the armed forces and risk their lives for this murderous, racist, fascist, stupid country. Getting your legs blown off so some board member at Lockheed Martin can buy a second yacht to fuck his mistress on. Having the thought of killing an Iraqi child on your conscious for the rest of your life. Doing all of this while your commander in Chief is one of the dumbest motherfuckers alive.

And yeah, I know in this sub we have talked about how the military preys on naïve, young, and poor people. Those individuals should get more of the pass and the criticism should lay on the shoulders of the US military. Also, I have no hostility to vets who served and are now anti-imperialism.

I have 3 cousins in the armed forces, two of which are married and have kids. The possibility of them dying fighting a country that poses zero threat the American public infuriates me. The thought of them possibly killing an innocent Iranian family infuriates me. 

I don’t know really what else to say, but a war with Iran would be a deadly pointless affair and nationalism is a helluva drug.My go to excuses are as follows:

The combination of ignorance, right wing insanity, and just straight up confusion is incredible. It might be one of my favorite things I’ve ever read on reddit. I can’t imagine having such a broken worldview and warped understanding of reality. Trump getting cucked by the Pence. Imagine it. Videogames, TV, film, sports, whatever. Imagine if the amount of bitching over Battlefield V or Ciri being black or whatever was focused towards something meaningful. Politics, your local community. Even the simplest of self-improvement.

It's as if these people define themselves by what they consume, and cannot separate their identifies from consumption, and if they consume 'SJW' media, they will be helplessly tainted by it. They believe that Mao and Stalin won the culture war in the early 90s and that videogames and 'nerdy' stuff is the last bastion of uncorrupted content. 

I mean, I get it, if your job sucks and your material condition sucks then being able to entertain/distract yourself is a fine way to maintain sanity. But it seems like for many, the entertainment *is* the end goal. and nothing outside of that matters in any meaningful way. 

And it works. You have a huge variety of games that you can play alone or with Internet strangers or similarly disillusioned friends, and all you have to do is keep your head down in reality long enough to get home to your hero fantasy. Beyond that, all that matters is your Internet connection and the Amazon delivery truck.

1. **Census figures in 1946 showed that whites were a declining part of the population**. . . The prime minister, Jan Smuts, spoke eloquently about the problem but was able to offer no solution. "A revolutionary change is taking place among the native peoples of Africa through the movement from the country to the towns.". . . the impression he gave to an ncreasingly worried white electorate was that his government was beginning to lose control of the black population, and what was worse, lacked the will to restore control. His **National Party opponents meanwhile put forward a plan which they claimed would be a permanent solution to the problem: *Apartheid*. . . By such means no race group would then threaten the future of another** [White Nationalists]

2. Texts from the Bible were cited as justification. **With relentless propaganda, the Nationalists played on the electorate's racial anxieties at every opporunity. They paid particular attention to working-class Afrikaners facing competition from cheap African labor**. . . A large proportion were miners, railwaysmen, transport, factor, and steel workers for whom the Nationalist slogan of **apartheid, promising protection of white jobs**, had a potent appeal. [Fear of Mexicans]

3. **As enforced, the law split families apart, separating husbands from wives, parents from children**. [Literally exactly what's happened at the border]

4. [On Sharpeville protests:] **Most of the casualties were shot in the back as they fled from the gunfired.** [America is worse here because this happens to black people that aren't even protesting]

To be a slaver you have to be a free man who owns slaves. To be a capitalist you must not be a worker and must own a significant amount of capital that allows you not to work.

If you're a worker and consider yourself a capitalist you're just pro capitalist, not an actual capitalist.

how do most libs reconcile this? if most voters like trump, what does that say about the republican party? that they are getting what they want?Is Kissinger dead yet?Haha you fucking virginsWhy do blacks commit so many crimes. Its in their culture. Why have jews been notoriously exiled and scapegoated in Europe. Its in their culture.

Yes, I unironically believe this to be true. The difference though is that a zionist who believes Palestinian culture is terrorist like and sewage prone (shapiro and most jews) and your average t_d poster who believes black culture is thuggish and predisposed to crime, believe its because the one thing cultures of these groups all have in common, their RACE.

Whereas their cultures developed this way because of the material conditions surronding them that led them to be treated in such a way that caused them to develop such cultures.

Blacks developed this black culture in america because of their treatment by society at large. And jews being ostracized further entrenched their anti-assimilation culture. It was the material conditions of feudalism, which capitalism carries on, that led the kings and dukes of yore to blame jews for whenever their was a problem to take the heat off their backs.

same as the capitalist class does today by exploiting the black man, keeping him in the ghetto, then distracting from the the capitalists practice of thievery by focusing the news camera on the black community as the reason society is so fucked up, rather then focusing on the reasons that made black culture this way (capitalism) or made jews so insular throughout the medieval ages (scapegoating because of feudalism)

im willing to rethink this if pointing out that black culture is problematic is infact problematic or if theres research to show jews were scapegoated not because of feudalism but for something else. FOLKS, i'm PREGNANT with a festering fetus of fearful feelings! all this kavanaugh shit on the news has really got me down. my conservative boomer parents whom i can't discuss politics with are acting accordingly, which makes home life hard. The two times our chapos discussed the whole ordeal have felt cathartic, but i think Will is way too optimistic when he says kavanaugh is circling the drain. matt's got the appropriate take: they're going to double down so they can win. power and domination are the only two things that matter to this mischief of rats and rat fuckers. why would they drop their guy because he's been accused of rape? the king rat himself is an avowed rapist! don't want to implicate the boss, put kavanaugh on the court!


when i try to log on to more neutral spaces, all i see is this bowsette meme being posted by reactionary, thirsty gamer weebs. makes me uncomfortable how much mileage this meme is getting without any real LGBTQ discourse around it because, well, it's a nerdboi meme. Definitely willing to get into a struggle session over this.

I just finished playing "night in the woods" for the first time. Mainly focused on Bea because she reminds me of friends I used to have in high school. Damn, it felt so good to play a game with overtly leftist themes. I'm going to replay it and hang out with Gregg this week, but the game gave me some serious parasocial feelings. reminds me how lonely i am living and working on the outskirts of Appalachia. 


Yo, my chapos, i hope everyone is having an alright week. tell me how dumb i am for disliking everyone new's gender-swapped waifu and/or that kavanaugh isn't getting on the court because the moral arc of the universe bends towards justice.

Liberals thinking that maaaaaaaaybe civility isn't so great after all.Go get involved, even if it's the Dems. Go canvas. Make some agitprop.Today, a long time friend of mine, who has always sort of been a center-left shitlib, told me that she is switching to Republican for the first time in her life.  
  
Why?  
  
Because her boyfriend, who is a Q-Anon believer has slowly convinced her of it. And according to her, the final straw was the Kavanaugh hearings in which she feels that he is being unfairly attacked.  
  
Liberals believe in nothing. They stand for absolutely nothing. Now she begins her descent down the road to fascism. It's surreal.Because, as you have clearly seen, there's a subset of people who refuse to be refused, and in their narcissism see the world as their domain. A woman can do everything 'right' according to society's idea of respectability and still be cast down ("What were you wearing? Did you drink? Did you give him any signals? Did you SEEM to give him any signals? Why were you even there?"), so instead of relying upon a justice system that turns a blind eye if the perpetrator is bourgeoisie, provide women with a means to protect themselves and put fear in the hearts of potential attackers.

But the ones I didn’t get were rallies set on May Day where people wearing Nazbol bandanas and armbands and flying the flag were just chilling near what I assume were ML’s, and nobody seemed to care. 

I mean they’re still white nationalists no matter their economic beliefs right? How would you feel if you saw a bunch of people (it was both men and women) flying Nazbol flags and wearing Nazbol bandanas and arm bands on May Day?https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/986467610253512704Is it even praxis at all He looks up to Stephen DouglasKillmonger "we're going to us our awesome black african hypertechnology to kill the people who made the world like this"

 I liked it, But I also want to see Erik get his own stand-alone movie about growing up in Oakland and eventually becoming a killer for Empire. Or just a reshhot as a drama framing the parallel stories of the prince and the pauper. So what are y'all having from breakfast? I mean, of course they still subscribe to a just world hypothesis. They've never had a job. I've got a book called "A Dangerous Idea". I'm not very far in to it but it's about how Alaska natives worked to get recognition and rights to land use during Alaska's bid for Statehood. I'm more or less from AK and this is one of those "not in the textbooks" stories.

[I triggered a lib AMA Part 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/7iyohs/i_triggered_a_lib_ama_part_2/)


My coworker Libby was telling me the magazines she read. New Yorker, Wired, The Atlantic, The Week (which she confused with the Weekly Standard for a moment). I tried to push her left by suggesting she read The Nation or The Progressive (baby steps). She asked me to explain politics so I gave her this spectrum:


* Communism etc.
* Socialism
* Democratic Socialist (Bernard)
* Social Democrat
* Progressive (Elizabeth Warren types)
* Liberal (Obama)
* Centrist (Hillary, Democrats)
* Conservative (Never-Trumper Republican minority)
* Far right/alt-right (Trumpers)


We got hung up on the difference between Democratic Socialism and Social Democrat. I told her that under the former the workers would own stuff but under the latter they would not. To that she responded that she still "liked capitalism and Hillary but I think we should have free healthcare." I split the difference and said she could be a liberal, which she was comfortable with so no triggering today.


I told her Kristen Gillibrand was going to be the next president, which she liked because Gillibrand's a woman.


How do I radicalize her?Defending the rich at the expense of the poor.

Universal healthcare, minimum wage and free college are all racist and sexist.

They use the dirtiest tricks possible to stop the oppressed from fighting that boot on their neck.I just saw that fucking Dave Rubin did an interview with him and that he's got some loose Nazi connections but I don't know the specifics. There's so many absolute scumbags in the GOP and trump universe it's hard to keep track Wish some dumb idiot like Dave Rubin would discover blaxploitation movies and have a conniption fit about their portrayal of white people.We need a Socialist Train LineI was wondering about this. The only leftist I’ve ever heard mention their thoughts on it was Glenn Greenwald

I know a bunch of people are probably going to point out that we have bigger issues to deal with, and I’d agree, but it seems to me like it’d be hard to justify factory farming from a leftist perspective. I realize that FF exists the way it does now because of the necessities of a capitalist system, but I just found it odd that this is almost never brought up by anyone on the left. 

Just my thoughts, I’m curious to know y’all’s take on itor if this sub has just spoiled me. Probably both.

1. The government provides a rifle to every citizen (especially minorities and the marginalized), and weapons training is part of free schooling. All weapons companies are nationalized.

2. Class consciousness develops to the point where people don't fetishize weapons so much to buy like, twenty five different guns (twenty two of which just stay in the safe and get taken out at parties). People still hunt for food and ecological management. 

3. Disarm everyone, somehow (including police), and everyone just goes hand-to-hand, I guess. https://twitter.com/tonynbc6/status/993573341696069632

I have a business plan that will radically disrupt trans-pacific shipping and introduce a new value balanced shareholder first dynamic commercial acquisition model. All I need is a few million dollars in venture capital and the ear of a few highly placed people who want to put their money to work in the field of adversarial maritime redistribution of fungible commodities. The right seems to think this is the pithiest argument against leftism in the world. I honestly can’t tell wtf this is supposed to mean. Do the chuds think capitalism means equality of opportunity? Do they think we think everyone is literally the same? 

May we all be as committed to our activismI believe Stalin did nothing wrong, North Korea is a paradise on earth, Assad is actually a socialist and not a right wing nationalist, Kulaks deserved worse, gulags are actually good, but if you say the word “retarded”? You’re a disgusting piece of shit and an AWFUL person. You sicken me.The exciting sequel to "were you people every conservative" is here!

So... yeah. Was your shift into leftism a product of your thought on religion? The other way around? Or, by some mad calculus, have they never affected each other?

"More like Merde-can't-ilism" - Adam SmithI got bored, mad, nude and decided to do some small analysis of Starship troopers, the 1997 film by patron saint of dirt bags.

Initially received as Verhoeven going full fash and doing a weird apology of fascism with cut rate actors after two HYPER horny films, the movie has gained a cult status by those who know Verhoeven's output.This movie is part of the duchtman's trilogy of incredible leftist sci films along Robocop and Total recall. 

Nowadays watching the movie feels incredible that someone took this feel seriously.In short other it features terrible actors getting mangled in increasingly horrific ways, extremely stupid humans, over the top propaganda featuring some of the most horrific features the government as a selling point , and giant brain sucking bugs all delivered in the most completely earnest fashion.

**Would you like to know more?**
One of the most characteristic features of verhoeven sci-fi is the use of small snippets of news delivering a lot of world building.Here we see some of the main features of world the characters live in:Instantaneous justice with executions delivered in less than 24 hours broadcasted to every single channel,embedded reporters in high risk military operations to drive popular support for the war effort and military weapons commercials.Used in a similar fashion in Robocop, instead of delivering the economic and ecological catastrophe theme, the horrid design of the time they preset the brutal militarisation of society, restriction of rights, elevation of pseudo science in what can only be a deliberate wink to third reich's occultism and a screaming and neurotic mother clapping excitedly the militarisation of their children.

Important to mention, during the whole movie the tone and themes of the commercials don't change, never to be affected by the events during the movie.The weapons only get bigger and more powerful, the ships only get more sleek and cool.Nothing is learnt during the movie by the federation, whose only answer to any problem is to get react with increasing violence, the mere suggestion of any kind of bug intelligence is taken as an insult.Humanity reigns supreme and the mere suggestion that bugs are not stupid creature is treated almost as treason.

**I am from Buenos Aires and I say :Kill'em all!**
The movie features a war carried out after the false flag attack of Buenos Aires ( shown in this movie as a anglified paradise populated by  the whitest people you'll ever see).After years of humans encroaching in the arachnid territory and ecosystem, a rogue meteorite hitting buenos aires get interpreted as an attack by the bugs.Meteorites would take thousands of years to cross the all the distance (measured in light years )from klendathu to earth .The bugs should have learnt of the human menace thousands of years ago.But government takes this present from the sky and decides to not look really hard at the horse's mouth

The moment the battle starts the fascist government deploys an stunning stupidity that gets hundred thousands of people killed in mere hours.A complete lack of information on the enemy, misjudging the strength of the opponent and overvaluing what a a bunch of dudes with machine guns running around can achieve (getting themselves killed in increasingly awful ways) delivers a stunning defeat.Undeterred humans revolutionise their tactics by first bombing the places they are going to be running around with machine guns.You don't become a fascist by adequately or correctly evaluating your opponent.Having ran out of opponents on earth, they direct their misguided gaze to aliens.

**Services guarantees citizenship**
A defining feature of the film is the trade off civilians make to obtain citizenship.A period of service no shorter than two years during which you need to be at mortal danger ( per the book).The movie makes it simpler.You join the army, endure the punishing discipline with physical beatings included and you get to be a citizen, you are then rewarded with the possibility of having a politics career or improved chances to get a licence to give birth to children, getting your studies paid or being able to vote.

But Verhoeven shows what citizens look like and what to expect out of federal service, the science teacher(played by a golden girl), Rascazk (played by the awesome Michael Ironside and who gets to deliver the incredible line :"they sucked his brains out") or the secretary sport absolutely horrifying mutilations.Mobile Infantry made me into the man I am today says the triple amputee. Federal Service is nothing more than a way to make sure political power stays in the hands of like minded individuals who have gone through the indoctrination by the federation.No change will be possible and this fake meritocracy gets embedded through the system.Only citizens can vote, only citizens can be representatives, only citizens can have children,only federal service makes citizens.

This Service makes our main characters miserable as fuck.Both Rico and Ibañez lose their lovers and mentor figures in  painful ways in front their eyes , and none of that makes them think or question anything.They just dig in and keep going, their beliefs unchallenged.All this loyalty gets rewarded with suicide missions with very low survival following the orders given by the dehumanised wreck of Rico's best friend.Truly the best humanity has to offer.

One important note is that service is not restricted to women or people of color as they are shown to be part of the federal service in small numbers.The bulk is provided by the most dangerous creature in the entire universe:white dudes.Again Verhoeven showing us the future: HIRE MORE WOMEN GUARDS.


It's also has a soundtrack by Basil Poledouris who could have scored a fascist uprising and you would be compelled to join.And a fantastic array of late 90's titties you can enjoy.

As a TLDR:Watch this movie if you want to see fascist beautiful people living in a fascist world get mangled by bugs because fascists are stupid as hell even if they are capable of building spaceships.Federal service sucks, your friends will die, your family will die, your surviving friends will try to get you killed with no thought paid to it, and you are going to be unfazed at all because you are dead inside.Where's my sympathetic NYT piece?So Noam Chomsky says that he likes to read the financial times to keep up with what the financial elites are thinking (paraphrasing). I think that makes sense. I can only afford one paper rn though. Anyone recommend financial times, foreign affairs, or something similar for this purpose?

Then there's the pyschology. All for one and one for all. Fight in formation. Your death/wounding in return for saving numerous comrades is a good trade off.

Yet many veterans become individualist capitalist lovers. Screw everyone else I got mine. Suddenly working together no longer matters.

The military has to be the most collectivist organization funded by the government. Individualism is bad and frowned upon, the only time it is fine when you do something that benefits the collective and pushes the collective forward. Hence the medals.

Democrats act outraged, when they get into power they rubber stamp that bill.

Cut welfare, schools, health, public defense (court cases) etc... they oppose in theory but keep that shit when they get into power.denmark has socialist tatooing and with that out country is out of money.
meanwhile we have socialized military bases all over the globe but if we enacted socialized anything we'd have another economic melt down, like all the other ones caused by *checks notes* unchecked capitalism Any political science majors in the sub? Remember those students in college who LARP-ed as politicians and adopted positions solely for political expediency even though they were literally just no name students? The ones who ran for student government positions and were active in the university democrats or college republicans? They were usually tokenly pro Israel because they knew that’s what politicians in America do. They usually LOVED house of cards and thought it was an accurate representation of politics. The kind of ones whose Facebook was just a collage of them with some limp dick politician gripping their arms, the ghoulish politician clearly wanting to just shake hands with the freaks, secure their votes, and then fuck off to meet a lobbyist before going to fuck their daily prostitute? 

Isn’t it funny how now they’re all burnt out working as slave labor for limp dick centrist  politicians who are soon to be cast aside into the dustbin of history?

I don’t know any more lyrics and I’m not committed enough to this bit to actually listen to that atrocity. CW: death 

Hello y’all. I am having an existential crisis. Just saw a bleak movie and I’m thinking of death and eternal nothingness and the sun exploding. How does one cope with these things. 
...And replace it with the Volcel Judge Dredd.Just thought I’d say a little something since I have a bit of a passion for languages. It’s such a great way to build solidarity with others and only serves to bring everyone closer together and foster a better understanding of other cultures

Plus of course it can be incredibly practical depending on where you are. Learn some Spanish or Arabic and maybe volunteer helping immigrants out with legal matters, for example. 

I just don’t hear much talk about how good of an organizing skill it can be, so I wanted to throw that out there!These events only serve as a means to ensure Republicans keep getting reelected because now gun control is going to be the defining issue of 2018. Not Net Neutrality, not single payer healthcare, not police shootings, not a $15 min wage, but guns. 

Think of all the effort people put into the NN vote yesterday, that's all in the toilet now because Congress will now fight over guns while the NN vote quietly dies in the House. Every time this happens is another blown opportunity.Just listened to my very American family croon over the wedding. Honestly, the UK should abolish the monarchy and seize its lands and turn them into parks and museums. If you’re an American who gives a hoot about the crown, you’re a boot licker who would even disgust the elitist, racist founders of this country. Fuck those gilded lizards and fuck you if you care about them. Yesterday, 10 people were murdered in a school shooting, and even our “best” current politicians lobbied for gun laws that excluded police.

But even THAT mediocrity was overshadowed by an American woman marrying into a monarchy that has been complicit in millions of deaths. She married a prince that thinks fascism is a joke, has used racist slurs, and wished to take part in an act that most likely would have killed innocent people (I believe he wanted to be a crew member of an Apache helicopter).

Christ... If this is progress, I’m scared.Joining the ranks of the elite who preside over a kingdom built on death is soooooo fucking progressive.One of those cases where you read someone's stuff, think "huh, interesting, but you're unusually cynical and I think you're not fully correct," but as time drags on you realize they were a bit more accurate than you'd like to admit.

Narcissism ties into capitalistic alienation false consciousness a bit more than I'd like, I guess.

Oh, here: https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/Then you're no comrade of mine.

We had a "good" run, time to pack it up.I had this conversation in college with one of my friends who loves Shapiro and now sides with him on issues such as abortion. Shapiro's argument is "if you believe there is no value on human life, you can't abort it because you are denying the baby's right to self-determination" and he also says that abortion for rape or birth defects is only a small part of why abortions happen. He also agrees with Shapiro that rape is not an excuse to get an abortion. 

Are there any good rebuttals to his arguments? From either the web or your own argument?https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/998298421080543233Alright I saw JDP (sic) being made fun of here a lot so I checked him out.I thought he was just another alt right dickhead or whatever but when I watched him I realized I'm also a dickhead most of the time.I know he is kind of misleading with that bill and dodges questions a lot but I'm a credulous moron or a troll so why let that get in the way of his credibility. He sounds correct especially on gender related stuff which is odd since I just said he was misleading on that bill but I know it will touch a lot of nerves here so I'll slap that on the end of my post....I'm incel and will never get laid.Do it, bros.

Effort posting is bourgeois.I had a strange political transition. I read a biography of Karl Marx for kids at 8, declared myself a Socialist, was a red until Obama, thought maybe liberalism could work, then went Red offline around 2016 or so.I read it on RESETEra during a political thread last year and I still cannot comprehend the fart gasses you have to high on to consider neoliberal a slur. As a white male, can I call other white males "mass shooters"?im still processing the impeccable rationality and objectivity from the AMA yesterday. I finally realized that my emotions - which are the opposite of facts - have led me astray into the cancer of blue pill beta feminist neomarxism. To be honest, I'm a little in denial about it and might need some professional help. I've been having flashbacks of when JP said, "Nazism was an atheist doctrine. So was Marxism."

Panos Garganas, an activist in the Greek Socialist Workers Party (SEK, by its initials in Greek), which is part of ANTARSYA, wrote that SYRIZA is "appeasing the bankers while appealing to voters." The KKE is even more direct, accusing SYRIZA of being "the left reserve force of capitalism."

Of course they would deny/erase Schindler, it's in their interest to do so. But here on the Alex Jones show, we know the TRUTH. READ. THE. DOCUMENTS. FOLKS.Man he's happy to be freeOr ever. Lead was used at least as early as 1870s and mandatory in the 1920sI think we're bending reality again(((guccibananabricks))) CONFIRMED globalistI felt the same way after Charlottesville for a goddamn month. I completely understand, dudeMy apartment uses an Otis elevator. Time for a rent strikeHere’s one (though not the only) way. You are not allowed to own or purchase a firearm until you can demonstrate a thorough knowledge of safety in both handling and storing said firearm. Sure. But I’m also coming at the question of gun control as someone who thinks weapon ownership (for the purposes of effective self defense) is a human right. Not a right provided by the constitution, but one akin to bodily autonomy. Other people will disagree,Sure, but actual effective gun control isn’t really much more than common sense laws. The problem is really the NRA, who turns even the most banal and comically obvious attempt at “let’s make it so less people die” into this huge culture war. Once you look at it through that lense (culture war that is) everything else makes so much more sense. I swear the Tories are if the Dems of today had the social politics of the 90slol, ok what ever lib. how’s body armor going to protect my head from crossbow bolts? smhIf the Trump family is smart (they're not) they'd charge people for the opportunityI'd love to see Augusta turned into luxury public housing for minorities. Especially if Jim Nantz has to witness the course getting destroyedNotice the rose Hard agree. If there is one thing that should be unacceptable to both gun fuckers like myself *and* people who want to ban guns it is the needless deaths due to negligent discharges or unsafe storage. In my dictatorial world the gun safety test is a once a year thing, free form writing portion, practical exam, and maybe even having to follow people around a range and shouting “STOP FLAGGING YOUR BUDDY” at them. I legit get angry at people who treat guns like they are toys and don’t treat them with the utmost respect.Here's my biggest issue with disarming the populace before the police: once we have no guns, the police have no true consequences out on the streets.

This may seem like an overreaction, but I personally believe that one factor that's stopping police from going into POC neighborhoods and running crazy in there is the fear of guns. 

POC are already being killed by police routinely, if police no longer have to worry about retaliation, what's stopping them from upping their numbers? Yup, we're literally stuck between a rock and a hard place with gun control.Younger than millennial Wait, so Felix's joke about rating statements in Pinocchios in the Trump Inauguration episode **IS A REAL THING**Liquidate Bezos

Nationalize AmazonI completely forgot about that. Now I remember Adam Johnson's great tweetwell IIRC the original point of the second amendment was to make sure “the blacks and injuns” didn’t step out of line

soooo you ain’t exactly wrongI've talked to them about it and they love it(saves "papa drone" for later use)I only read the last line but I don't even want to know wtf lead up to itThat could also have to do with the fact that people under threat are more likely to get a firearm for protection.Liquidate the richMakes sense. Mandatory firearms safety training seems like a good solution then?Counterpoint, it is possible to disagree on a single issue without calling someone’s left purity into question. Rather than being an ass, make a case for a *right* to gun ownership. 

I’ll give an example. People have a right to defend themselves. If you deny people the effective means by which to defend themselves, then the right to defend oneself  de facto does not exist. Something like that. I mean this does bring up the question, just how long is the ban list for this sub? I know our mods are pretty hands off.Cereal with milk is haram

Without is halalAs I've probably said before, the skeptic community is naturally reactionary because all of their content is generated in reaction to - before the gamer gate - flat earthers, YECs, antivaxxers, etc. They mostly just broke down the shitty arguments and debunked them with science - specifically, physics, biology, and chemistry - where things are very binary - either you right or wrong.  

When things don't get binary and outside of the realm of shit I can prove in a lab, you get anywhere from Richard Dawkins and his hatred of brown people to some asshole on YouTube that's dried up the well of dunking on idiotswho cares about the 2nd amendment or the constitution in generalWhat’s the difference?

*slapstick music plays*Capitalism's over? Where? I want in damnit!Too dark?

I see what you did there :DThe Views Respecter has logged onPeople who are obsessed with guns are assholes. I’m saying this as someone who would slowly make love to an AR-10 if I could afford one.

Really though, Geardo assholes who deck their AR out with lasers and flashlights and gangster grips piss me off. It is so obvious they just want to look cool. It’s people like that who point firearms at people then say “relax dude, it was just a joke. It’s unloaded, see?”. Fuck them. I reject its legitimacy from inception to now. Informed consent was never given in any legitimate way towards it, so it is worth less than the paper it is written on.Oh don’t even get me started on open-carry assholes. Nothing more performative than that.Are we just gonna ignore that one of those is a pornstar?Nah, we're the FerengiGeez, who'd have thought that an anarchist rejects the rule of law in general and also rejects a legal document that explicitly endorses slavery.Look you CRETIN, it’s simple math

As if the people living in the parks don't have a right to them. fuuuuuuuuuck offffFair enough, it just seems like every time something like this happens I come across fifty people who are convinced that gun violence just goes away if the media stops talking about it. You just have to wonder where the motivation comes from after the twentieth timeYou really don’t get this sub’s mantra of “never stop posting” do you?I'm going to need a verrit code to verify his claimsI haven't checked in since a dude with the flair "roof korean" made a post of a pistol with iron sights on the side while repeatedly saying the n word.

lol look at this liberal fuckno with dogsmore like garroted if papa joe could allow musicians and singers to go free then we can tooI know you're being sarchastic, but damn this is a terrible postThe Clintonites have long been a part of the democratic establishment and a cancerous tumour on the asses of many and even suggesting violence against them would automatically make them more matyrs because they view Antifa as uneducated and barbaricIt is not women like Nancy Pelosi that are a cancer

Hillary/Nancy/Bill/other liberal establishment figures have long been a parasite on the democratic party and Bernie Sanders even surviving challenging them is a testiment to how tired most dems of the clintonitesAh yes Hillary's standby of why she lost

not that she's an entitled bitch

god I can't believe I thought she would winYou look at the political events of this year on the democratic side, how do you not come to the conclusion that Bernie was on the right side of challenging Hillary?and we arrive at the problem I'm having right now, who would willing to challenge her, I'd love Ellison to do it, but I'd hate to see how that would turn (both sides would probably be so burnt out they couldn't do their due dilligence) who would challenge her.

I have no idea who would do it, jaffe doesn't count because isn't he like a joke or somethingWe’re in the zone now. Weird Twitter is real life I don’t get it Femme Stalin?lol look at this asshole who doesn’t use naked corvettesmfw i have played stellaris for a patch or two cool, I may have to buy that dlc.

also, we on for Saturday?Sure, if not I’ll give your regards The Force Awakens was an enjoyable movie.

So was Rogue One if you look at it primarily as a war movie.Good anime: OPM, Neo Yokio (taken ironically), Samurai Champloo

Bad anime: pretty much everything else, Neo Yokio (taken unironically)Fuck, I liked the Emoji Movie more than the prequels. At least *that* was only 90 minutes. I thought it was ironic all the way through. But then I read some interviews where the creators were talking about how they really earnestly liked the characters and stuff. And now I’m not sure about anything anymore. If they end the show with a revolution and all the bougie fucks getting murdered then I think I might be able to tell. What if...

.

.

... we're the villansNothing is as real as the pizza gateIdk whether I prefer TFA or Rogue One if I’m being honest. I dig the action in Rogue One more, but I prefer the characters (and lack of creepy ass CGI) in TFAEvery time I see Ben Shapiro I just want to give him a wedgie and stuff him in a lockerGet the Nightly build, it's stupid fast and only kinda buggyIf we're going full "death of the author" then yes, it definitely is ironic. But when the author is quoted as saying this

&gt;“When I think about when I really would’ve liked this show, it’s all different eras of my life.” And as Koenig told Pitchfork, “Almost everything in Neo Yokio is a loving tribute. Outside of maybe free-market capitalism, we’re not trying to drag anything.”

You really gotta ask, is the ruling class (of which the creator is a part) really this out of touch?The Room was made in earnest.Its 2017 mang, all I'm saying is that anything could be true at this point.They haven't considered the fact that to exercise any other rights one must be guaranteed the necessities of life. So to even be alive enough to exercise your freedom of expression you have to be able to eat. Ergo food is a human right. So too with healthcare. It is pretty much covered in Henry Shue's book [Basic Rights](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/5897.html), which if you can't afford or don't want to buy is summarized pretty well in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXanBiNxt4Y) Youtube video.anime is goodits really not thoAnd they were all anticipating the MAGAs cry about a rigged election too!Mitch McConnell hated that sceneI am Soros and keep up the good work, sirYup, they were doing it BEFORE the election! There's just some level of irony here I believeDid Will say

Knee-vada?I can't offer money but I can offer you exposureIdk switch lines 1 &amp; 2 and I think it flows a little betterHaving the same argument over and over again doesn't convince lurkers. I'm all for not arguing to convince your opponent, but this isn't that.TBH I think their criticisms are very valid. But art is subjective, and just because something has flaws doesn't mean we can't like it. They really didn't like the new *It* movie for example, and upon retrospection everything they said about it was true. But I still enjoyed the hell out of it.well what do you want from me, to be right *all* the time?speaking to the latter question there are some pretty well accepted norms for safety and training regarding firearms. For example, "never point a weapon at something you are not willing to destroy" "always treat a weapon as if it were loaded" and "know both what is in front of *and* what is behind your target" are all pretty much unanimously accepted by people who are proficient with firearms. I'd add in a practical test i.e. making sure the person actually can hit what they aim at without endangering the people around them. If you can't physically handle the weapon correctly then you shouldn't be carrying it.&gt;Most people who need guns need their guns more than they need 200$

Shit, if that was what they were offering for buybacks I don't think anyone would take that offer. Some ARs run upwards of a thousand dollars.I mean if we are talking about slightly idealist solutions that will of course have to be modified to counter things like demographic discrimination (as this sub is wont to do), then I don't see why we can't start with that and then worry about an equitable implementation at the point where we actually gain power. I think trying to pre-plan out every tiny part of policy ahead of time is a bit self defeating.Even then though, I don't see many people getting out of bed to turn in grandpa's rusty ass target rifle from 1953 for only $200.&gt;  

to keep the deer away haha you big city ppl are cutie pies
I know real life libs who say single payer is a pipe dream but think gun prohibition is a worthy fighti know i'm a bit hypocritical for posting this seeing as i'm one of the people who thinks the gun control debate needs to cool the fuck down here, but still it is unexpected to see the NRA actually for some sort of gun control (albeit in a very limited form)And the alt-right needs it for somewhere to put all the Jews if they ever get to build their ethnostateBender is truly an inspiration even to us meatwads["As the American people struggle to build their democracy, adversaries continue their war on a free America.

&gt;Saucier also seems to have had enough clout with Yiannopoulos to get him to kill a story. On May 9, the Breitbart tech editor sent Saucier a full draft of the class-based affirmative action story. “This really isn’t good,” Saucier wrote back, along with a complex explanation of how “true class-based affirmative action” would cause “black enrollment at all decent colleges” to be “decimated.” The next day, Yiannopoulos wrote back, “I feel suitably admonished,” with another draft. In response, after speculating that Yiannopoulos was trying to “soft pedal” racial differences in intelligence, Saucier wrote, “I would honestly spike this piece.” The story never ran.​

The Joker would have made a deep dive Medium piece into every candidate and at the end just say "I'm not voting"Batman is a lib that's trying to reform the system by punching poor people.

Now Anarchist Batman...Frank Miller's? Yes. Other versions written by someone who isn't a hack? No.Bunkers full of Scooby Snacks!It is, but it wasn't written by Miller (written by Jeph Loeb)Just had to make sure. And it's my favorite too. Have you read The Man Who Laughs? It's the best first Joker story in my opinionI wasn't a big fan of The Killing Joke as far as story - at least it does give The Red Hood thing as a possible origin - but holy shit the artwork...it's literally art. Not to mention it helped to inspire Nolan for Dark BatmanYeah, he's not a murderer like in Batman #1. The best comparison I've heard is that of a stand up comedian but he just loves creating misery and death. And like a comedian, if he can he'll torture and hurt someone for as long as he wants until he stop and kills them, usually horribly (like in whatever episode debuted Harley Quinn).

Also being Bats' biggest fan he'll do things that he knows Bats could survive unless it's not practical (the first Injustice Gang ep in Justice League)Sure, my ideology is that everyone should have their own idea Batman/Joker/etc. My ideal Joker is close to most comic versions, whereas my Bats is basically a metahuman that doesn't have any actual super powers. Like he's a genius and near-peak fitness and other skills like ventriloquism and escape artist stuffBTW this is far more fun than doing actual work hahaThey should compromise,,,,with usExactly. And the animated direct-to-video are darn good. I'd take the animated Suicide Squad over the live action.

Fuck...I'd rather just watch the "Task Force X" Justice League Unlimited episodeIt was so embarrassingly awful that my brain thought *I* was one the talking like that and I felt a chill go down my spineZhit zhish ish hot.

He destroyed his party, resigned his leadership, lost his seat. In what world would anyone listen to him?Lol the picture from the girl with the body paint was taken from a twitter nazi chud as a "before and after cultural marxist indoctrination". Notice the little red arrow showing the armpit hair.I mean in a lot of cases it seems like the police are there as a revenue collection service for the state, but also a militant one. And then in the worst cases they’re used blatantly for the protection of corporate interests (i.e. DAPL, occupy). Obviously that’s not every case, I’m just trying to wrap my mind around ways in which it could still provide protection for people while also divorcing it from these problemsCheeseburger, fries, and an orange fanTA THE DRINK OF THE PEOPLEOh shit, I forgot the Nazi roots of FantaStop this.Progressive at this point just means "not regressive."This plainly isn't misogyny. Like this isn't high math.

You can say that Chapo is inconsiderate to women, that that is bad for the show/leftist politics etc. but nothing you have written even comes close to showing that Matt, Will or Felix are actually hateful, predjudiced or contemtuous of women. I.e. The bar that you set for yourself by describing it as misogyny.&gt; unhirable 

Last I checked he’s a scholar at AEI. Considering Adonis's only opponent is an extremely crippled man, 72 points is extremely low.

He's also woke as fuck.

Basically, I will chop off my left nut to get Okung back in Seattle.Ima need a screen protector to load an image of that face&gt;also very lonely and sad. 

I gotchu, we can be lonely and sad together 🙃I made a bunch of money betting on random shit during the primaries, and decided to bet it all against Trump afterwards and lost everything. You ain’t alone Especially will I had a bad feeling in the first debate when Trump started out blaming her for everything and her response was something like "Well that's just not accurate." Debates are about projecting strength. The correct way to win on "facts" was what Obama did to Romney with the Benghazi whatever. No one actually understands anything about Benghazi, but they remembered Obama letting Romney careen into a lie and then bashing him over it. Same with Biden waving that "Pwetty pweese give me stimulus money!!!" letter in Ryan's stupid face. That's how you fucking "debate" in American politics.


I knew she had lost when Feingold was projected to lose Wisconsin. I knew she wasn't going to overperform him and it could only mean the Rust Belt was going Republican everywhere that it was feared. But I stayed up watching the TYT feed until the election was called just so I'd be sure.Did she go on to invent the pussy hat?What's funny is this petty stuff will only serve to solidify Obama's ranking as an upper-mid-level good president as the history of the early 2000s gets written. The only correct responseRichard Spencer should be given a swirly shortly before being put in front of a firing squadAm I the only one who was just totally neutral about the original joke? Or was there some context I missed? It seems like a lot of people were actually pissed about itImplying that Trump would enter a random stranger’s car without wearing a hazmat suit to protect against the germs  I don’t go on twitter enough to know if the phenomenon you’re describing is true, but I think you’re reading too much into the thought processes of the chudsHe'll be the new JFK. Trump will be the anti-LBJ, except with more war instead of less.That’s why I was so confused. It’s as if by making a joke about Cosby they’ve come out in favor of sexual assault or something. I could understand being offended by the joke, but it’s just so obvious that they don’t actually support him This is getting so ridiculousI have it on good authority that Red Orm and Toke fought for our lord Almanzor against good Christians.At Ryan's Steak House they raise a special flag when your order has been received.That's Gordon Brown, amateur.Now that's the foreign influence I like to see.Doesn't matter, Wyoming Crater and the future Bay of Louisiana will still get 2 senators even if they have gills.Oh hell yesNever stop voting.I have’t seen much of that but that does really bum me out, I had hoped we didn’t have people like that hereI personally don't have much of an issue with the idea of an investigation. I think the problem is that the people doing the investigating aren't themselves the "good guys" really. Suddenly a Republican at the FBI is our hero after another Republican at the FBI did the actual work of throwing the election to Trump. These are the "institutions" that were supposed to insulate our perfect, pure democracy from demagogues. 


The Russian investigation is also too much about Trump, which was not a winning election strategy. A majority of the country already agrees that Trump is terrible and they have exact reasons why. Dripping more information about how sleazy Trump hangers on were sleazy isn't going to win midterms.


On the other hand, I still think it's worth looking into. The Trump Organization is basically a gilded criminal enterprise. Let's start putting people in prison.Do you want to prove him wrong or make him acknowledge that he's wrong? Cuz the latter ain't happening.Does the Daily Mail have a secret formula for a nation's id? Because there's nothing better than one article about COMMUNIST INFILTRATION with a sidebar full of "SAUCY PAIR OF TITS SEEN IN IBIZA" links.Big if true.Israel used to be socialist as fuck.

I only know some really basic Irish. I’m just kind of a language nerd and Irish always stuck out to meHey no worries dudeOkay I’ll be honest. I genuinely don’t understand why Bernie giving the speech was such a point of contentionHaving come from a place of "I may disagree with what you say..." the second biggest shock of my life is just how utterly hollow and hateful American conservatism is (the first was racism still exists). Sometimes I page through the National Review or Weekly Standard and it's all smug people smug in how intellectually mendacious they are. They HAVE to know why someone like Trump floated to the top of the toilet bowl that is their ideology. He is exactly what people believe rich people ought to be and what they deserve to be (American Dream type people I mean).

What does annoy the hell out of is people acting like it’s some sort of brave stance to come out against NAZISM for god’s sakeUnfair that you're being downvoted. The 24/7 lifestyle thing is extremely fucked up.
It does seem to me like a lack of infrastructure at the DSA for dealing with actual cases of harassment is a bit more of a problem than a joke?DSA is pretty grassroots, it can be dealt with internally I feel like. We’re just  gonna need people like you to speak up at meetings and stand up for your comrades, that’s kinda how the whole org beganUnfortunately no group is going to be immune to this kind of thing. But I also feel like it’s worth saying that despite this, DSA is an important organization. The way we stomp this crap out is by attending meetings and making your voice heard. Demand a system for dealing with this, make damn sure leaders take a stand against harassment, and do *not* take no for an answer on the issueThat we’re in agreement on. It just frustrates me that a bunch of people want to respond to this by reacting to the symptoms and not the disease. Hey also, was this mostly a problem at the LA chapter, or are there a lot of reports like this? I’m just curious because I was actually unaware of the problem being as big as it wasI’m so glad there’s at least one place on reddit where you can make fun of that lizard man without being rushed by neckbeardsI think people are more angry about their peanuts take than about the Cosby shit 😂All I really saw was something about his resignation letter, so I thought maybe he had some position of power in the LA chapter and that was the problemGotcha, that clears things up a bit moreIf you're from Missouri primary this numbskull out

retire bitchHow would we do that? I think that what I mean when I say sanction?This is trueI was thinking more of the line of "you keep fucking up the world, we keep fucking your economy until you stop fucking up" America shouldn't be nuked, per se. But I think America should put in a position of it stop being a shithole or the world makes it even more shittier for. Start paying repariations for all the countries you've bombed get/start helping your poor and oppressed or we ban your politicans from ever coming out of the country. Like that's my idea there when I say that America should be sanction and I do hope one day that someone gets the goddamn nerve to do itMaybe my reactionary friend was right when he claimed that liberalism was a mental disorder. Maybe

I just want someone to put America on notice in terms of diplomacyI want the American government to have a spine, why not do this instead of kneecaping the government's ability to collect taxes

SOCIALIZM, etc but goddamn give a shit about people or rightfully fuck off this earth if you ain't going to do nothing for the impoverished.And then again,  would the sanctions just be surface level and would they even work at that? 

Like the sanctions that I would like to see be thrown at America are

1) Tariffs on exports to the EU/UK
2) The international bank accounts of the President/VP and all other diplomats being frozen or seized
3) UN observers at all voting places during elections
4) All international bank accounts of all politicians being frozen or seized

And there's a lot more that I need to workshop more

But America has to pay some sort of price for it's imperialstic dick waving through the years

Who will draw first blood and who would be willing to help america come to the 21st century?Why not?

American Exceptionalism is more of a devil then Europena ExceptionalismI feel "repriations/political reforms or eff off" are good enough merits without american wars being added onWould be nice if China gave enough fucks if they slapped sanctions on AmericaWhile China is not the great country that the tankies on Reddit would want you to believe

it would be nice if China could slap sanctions on America to make them kneel to ChinaIt would send a message to American politicans that domestic/foreign fuckery should never be accepted by the UN

The economy suffers but it should send a message to the voters to stop voting shitty peopleI remember seeing a succinct explanation of the difference between liberals and leftists:  
  
Liberals believe that capitalism is broken, but can be reformed through regulation.
Leftists believe that capitalism is working exactly as intended, and THEREFORE, needs to be abolished.Now this is some seriously quality content.

Last time I checked, you had to be 18 and have enough of an interest to vote, to vote.

If you're an idiot you voted for Donald Trump.

Do you think that maybe other people think you're an asshole because you shit on the victims and solutions rather than the problem and the causes?Yes, because the real issue is property value being decreased by those homeless people who have it just so goodBecause he doesn't actually want things to stop being bad, he just wants to shit on people lower on the totem poleExtra lol at how you edited your comment saying I "started a witch hunt across numerous subs" because I said you're a bad person here and on SRS. I'm beginning to think you *may* have a problem at putting things into perspective."I have no sympathy or urge to help" vs "demanding to give them all basic housing." Pick one. You're either lying about not giving a shit or lying about activism, seems like it's obviously the latter based off all your other comments so far.And the solution is obviously not to sweep the camps, but provide adequate public housing along with safe injection sites. But all of that is opposed by people such as Mr. Pipe Bomb and 3/4 of the fucking suburbanites east of Seattle who would rather people die of fentanyl than see a homeless person or have their house price drop by 5% or some shit.I'm curious what state you live in?I tried to but I guess I'm banned too lolHeated volcel momentget a room am champagne socialist; can afford shake shack. it's overrated though and im dissapointed in matt. i bet they try "part of our judeo christian heritage" first

i just learned about taibbi's messed up past in the past few weeks after years of loving his writing. his fans have to reconcile with what he has done, but chapo isn't really to blame

https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/02/exile-201002the only thing i take exception to is your last point - for many people who came of age under the W Bush administration, taibbi is one of the most important, prominent political writers in the mainstream. I always thought of him as one of the top 5 important left journalists with greenwald, scahill, meyer, and goodman"Ally" mode where you play as John Brown and supply them weapons and lead raids on southern armoriessecond anti-taibbi post today. not excusing his actions, full stop.

to me, there is enough info to reevaluate taibbi and possibly cast him aside. his response is total denial, which seems implausible. 

that said, i can't imagine he can be charged with anything that happened in russia 20 years ago, and I don't think some internet flaming will hurt him. 

at the same time, there are elected officials actively ruining thousands of lives. what is the best use of our rage and time?I mean I don't have much against Paul Alleni don't know that you should- i only learned about his past in the past few weeks, and i think the vast majority of his readers know less about this than this sub happens to. it's valid. 

my response was in part b/c there were 2 anti- andrea nagle posts yesterday (based on mostly nonsense) and the feeling the left eats its own, but when i learned the dude whose books i loved was a creepy sexual harasser, it was a big deal. i just feel this might be more relevant to general left readers who don't know. 
if this wasn't already addressed on this sub, i would  be behind you completelyBlack capitalism is bad, only good praxis is socialismthere are people on the left who think saying "that's racist" will stymie white supremacists - how dare she acknowledge how pathetic a response that isin practice, it is a prefix meaning "christian." as in, part of our christian christian heritageFrom centurylinkfield.com:

i've never heard her say anything like that, because it is retarded. almost all the hate coming at her seems motivated by the sorta "wrong language" bullshit that libs obsess with and chapo is explicitly against. not sure about your point, but it reminds me of nagle's discussion of how media should actually tie richard spencer's feet to the fire of the logical end point of his ideologybut i'm still a pajama boy! im so far behind@roddreheryeah, he's probably a shit, i wouldn't give him my money, and this is on the opie and anthony show, and anthony cumia is without a doubt a massive cunt, but this is a funny clip. if it's not for you, that's cool, but it always cracks me upThis is like when a father doesn't claim its celibate basement dwelling sonnot advocating the man. it is funny to hear someone question rumsfeld if he ate babies. laughing at this is not endorsing louis ck any more than it is endorsing rumsfeldit's all good. informed people should be ready to shit on CK*just getting drunk over here - any pot dealers in the raleigh area, help me out Carter W Bush or Obama - who is most likely to have sexual assault complaints?i love you too

that said, as those industries exist now, it isn't ideal. i hold nothing against those selling sex, but those middle manager types fuck the whole thing up.

i think there should be a (larger) movement on the left to clean up some of the abuse in those fields. fuck pimps. assault is way too common in porn

pretty big gap between 2nd and 3rd wave feminism on these subjects, but i think there should be a strong middle ground to deal with how often sex workers are straight up abused. 

i think sex work is positive, sex industies tend to suckyou mean robo-women are going to invent multiple orgasmsi think most third wave feminists (or leftists accepting popular leftist mores) would say if the woman isn't being abused, is an adult and can consent, drop that load where you feel preserve that vital essencei don't know if that is accurate. do you have sources?i was looking for something more 1-3 pages, with bullet points/

I'm saying that when Rooshv tells you that the eXiLe is the "best newspaper ever", your satire has failed.Even then he didn't ditch her, he just said the wrong name because he was actually in love with Rachel. He still tried everything he could to save the marriage. If anything, Ross's sin tally is less than Rachel's.

In addition, Rachel was being completely ridiculous at the beach house by trying to pin it ALL on Ross. It's not like he just went whoring out when they went on a break. He felt terrible and wanted to get back together with her, and the only reason he didn't is because she let *Mark* in, the guy who he was extremely insecure about! And even then the woman at the club basically forced herself on him.

They are so bankrupt when it comes to humor and witThe zone moves fast; keep up, kidUnderrated comment&gt;The framing is strange—Sanders juxtaposes “ordinary Americans” against women, Latinx and black people and the LGBTQ community as if they were different groups.

This is it. This is *the* shining example of how liberals don't actually give a shit about materially improving the lives of minorities, they just like paying lip service.I want off mr. Zone's wild rideHow is he not progressive and how is his opponent more progressive?No, we're supposed to declare war on another country nearby that has no relation to the attack if we want to follow the W model. I can't laugh at this level of cringe“So brave to admit her faults; yet another presidential quality of hers!”&gt; Apparently it's his Muslim girlfriend. I swear, it's always the girlfriends when it comes to crazy lefties.

T_D literally thinks its impossible for people to be against racism without manipulationThe DNC was broke. I got permabanned for saying I'm an Ancom on a completely different subreddit AMAI seriously can't wait for tomorrow, it's gonna be like Jade Helm 15 all over again and they'll just say "Oh, they didn't do it because we got the word out". The anti-James Damore Eh. No. 

You don't get to rant about post-modernism, then talk about "sexual capital" like some 1950s perv with a psychiatrist's couch, no HR department, and tons of free time. 

He's a literal incel whose entire manifesto rests on the notion that he doesn't understand women so instead of...talking to them, he'd rather build a house of cards of "Science" to isolate them in his mind so that he can insulate himself from having to bend on any of his flawed assertions about sexual dynamics. You sure about that?Do you know anything about Nikola Tesla? Better get educated because he created technology that contributed incredibly to the modern world, and he didn't want to turn a profit, he just wanted to enrich the world.

He was actually terrible at business and was exploited and endlessly hindered by the capitalist Edison. I hold that capitalist competition in this case almost denied us Tesla's gifts because they were a threat to Edison's DC empire.

One of Tesla's wilder ideas was to freely distribute AC current to everyone wirelessly. No utility bills, just pull it out of the air if you want it.

It's actually infuriating that parasite Musk used Tesla's name to sell his bourgie cars. Tesla was a far better person than a name to slap on conspicuous consumption products for rich exploiters.Which circles back to Damore's presumed conservative libertarianism...and ironic lack of accountability/responsibility?Again, we're speaking in generalities to move the convo along.

And I'll rest on the laurels that GENERALLY guys who "figure it out" tend to not be tightly wounded and committed to scientifically finding out why he can't get laid and why it must be "feminism" or "post modernism" or "the HR department" or "STEM education" or "the female brain"

No man, its because you haven't found someone to look you in the face two things: "I love you, but shut up"Its how guys like him mask their bigotry and hatred of women. They try to sterilize it with "science" and "economics" so they can just say that its really the "hidden hand of [sexual] economics" that dictates why things are the way they are. 

Its all about power and identity. Right down to his flirtations with IQ science and machinations about "diversity" when its really about notions of sexual dominance and racist tropes about male virulence among races.

Its always about sex.

If they can't control women then "the other" will get them. So they invest all this time and money and energy into obfuscating their aims at trying to keep women in boundaries of behavior and attitude when they don't fit "the model" 

He's the guy who thinks he's a nice guy and deserves something for it in return but who secretly hates women and pretends its not his fault in the first place.

Oh, and google knows better than Damore would about "sexual capitalism." They hired women in the first place. They hired minorities in the first place. They never would if they weren't aware of what they were doing. He thinks he's "out-woking" the people who never forgot what they were doing in the first place by bringing in minorities in the first place. These tech companies are far ahead in their half-assed attempts at real equality than Damore that he doesn't realize he was in the best situation possible because those in charge always knew what they were doing. 

And I'm a minority myself. I never deluded what as actually going on when it came to that dynamic. Who invests that much energy into trying to find reasons to discredit females he works with? Then masking it in "science" to make it sound less egregious?If he could, he'd go full Charles Murray. Well that indicates theres a thread in rom-com narratives, right? 

Look, I don't ultimately know what Damore's problem is, but I do know that something is wrong with that guy in the sense that he's not just committed to addressing work place dynamics with women but he's actively trying to mask his "incompatibility" with "modern women" \*wink\* as some sort of "glitch" in the system. He thinks in the way that tech-bros think everything they don't like, can't control, or don't understand is really just a flawed algorithm. Well I bring this up because theres a lot of Damore's out there and theres a reason he resonates with so many people.

And furthermore, Damore seems not to realize the ultimate solution to his problem and thus why we're in this very thread.

I mean, I'd like to take the high road as well, but the bell of reality strikes for all of us. 

You can't theorize yourself away from some vagina, James. You gotta fix that. I think it depends on the argument.

And Damore was trying to eloquently shit on his female coworkers by throwing a stone and hiding his handAll speech isn't equal. Its not political speech if you're saying women are unqualified to work alongside you, no matter how long and rambling your "manifesto" isYes, he was. He was trying to say so in a non-committal way. Thus the half-assed charts and graphs and talk about IQ and "women like pink" bullshit. Again. He was trying to say women aren't qualified to work with him because "their brains are different"&gt;  but it's not what he literally said.

Its almost like language can have subversive meanings. 

Sexual innuendo is enough to get fired for sexual assault, no?&gt; there's a difference between defending an individual and defending that individual's rights
&gt; 

Well Damore didn't fit the culture at google of working with women.

hows that?
Whats the difference between trying to find a loophole as to why diversity is bad in a midterm-length essay and flat out saying you hate working with minorities and women?Break up Twitter/FB or nationalize it

Throw their founders in prison for being awful propagandists&gt;  if google were a christian company and damore an atheist they would've said he didn't fit the culture at google of working with christian

...which happens all the time...He left out the Laffer Curve's relationship to inverse polarity of the spectral atomizer, vis-a-vis the negative correlation of my balls. I mean, what a fucking buffoon. Good lord is there any room for nuance with grey wolves about TNC? Idk much about civil war history but without some actual critique of his choices in this article, this post seems like knee jerk Chapo leg humping. nice try cop&gt; if I didn't hate submitting content

Posting is a virtue and you know itCan you tell me what's up with [this shit](https://imgur.com/a/BjOCL)? Unless someone's posing as you in this, then I don't think I'll be jumping at the opportunity to be active in a sub that you moderate.I thought I was straight until I saw Yanis What if, hear me out here, this is a crazy idea, but what if we treated the class vs idpol divide like a difference in priorities instead of an excuse to be shitty to people?I don't think there is, but a lot of people do.really loving them lately
OK thanks for clearing it up!It’s alright to kick a 16 year old nazi’s ass when you’re 17, right? Asking for a friendWell these are generally the types of kids that are the "smartest" in their class and get praised for their "potential" by adults. Often they're STEMlords too.

When they actually start debating with someone on the same level or higher than them they usually just shut down and freak out. It happened to me once lolWrite this on my tombstonevolcel supersoldier[Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwoGrDa5g2c)Fucking kill meIt just baffles me that I see KiA, TiA, and reactionaries in general on psychedelic subs. Like, how can you take such a thought-provoking drug and still have such trash ideology?They can be kinda annoying, but at least they're fundamentally good and aren't just blindly dedicated to profitHe even called me dumb lmaoJust because someone isn't fully dedicated to revolution doesn't make them a reactionary imo&gt; libertarians ruin literally everything

FTFYGot banned for saying I'm an ancom in /r/teenagers lolYeah, I get what you're saying. I'm more of a 2cb guy but every trip I've had with any other psychedelic has resulted in at least one very introspective moment that changed me so I guess I just falsely assumed others would be the same way.I cried my first time on acid because a Chuck Tingle book cover sexually harassed me. Also stared at my door and "conversed" with it, and it told me to do better in school, and my grades got way better lol. It's good shit even if you have a goofy or bad experience because you can look back on it and reflect / laugh.

Oh and masturbate on 2cb, the feeling is unrivaled.How tf did my reactionary grandpa end up on thereWelcome to hellworld /u/DYLM4N is a perfectly manufactured reddit CHUD, posting in incel, whiterights and ancap.Just like a typical fash, he's refined his shittiness to be more accepted by liberalsI have no idea what you’re talking about but yes The deep web.

Hey now I’m a lonely druggy too and there’s nothing wrong with that. What’s wrong is blaming your loneliness on others when you don’t have many redeeming qualities of your own.Fucking Tobyyuou better bend to my knee mother fucker

bend what, I'm not sure, but you better bend itI have to live in the same city as this meat puppet. please do not send her back to usThe beer culture is a pretty annoying substitute for actual culture.

There's no taboo CHUD. The taboo only exists in PC holywood media. In reality, 30% of women suffer domestic violence, one woman is killed every 6 hours by an intimate partner and so on.

r/libertarian is leaking TIL capitalism is exclusive to North America Wait so can I hang out with the cool kids now that I’ve watched thor man age of winter war instead of playing underground niche game WoW of legends dating is hard on the post-modern boulevardDang, she's a Trump voter too? Not that that will stop Moore and the GOP from smearing herThey actually already put a piece out earlier today. No doubt Roy knew this was comingThank you. Economics is a tool, not an ideology, and the sooner you view it from that approach, the sooner you can disabuse yourself of the notions that Economics is necessarily pro-capitalist, or that "efficiency" is the end-all be-all of economic analysis. 

People often make the mistake that certain schools of thought "own" the entire field. Like the field of Psychology, it is a tool, but it can also be weaponized in the wrong hands. 

My economics classes strangely brought me around to being more leftist, and at the same time gave me the ability to call bullshit on right-wing arguments that pretend to be "economics-based," and therefore ostensibly credible I've never closed a youtube link faster than seeing the thumbnail of these goobersVaroufakis fun fact: [This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuTMWgOduFM) was written for his wifeAdamMorrisonHotel go on Cum Town After months of research, Trump realized that the Saudi economy is dependent on oil. Oil, get this, is a finite resource! It’s kind of like George Soros. There’s only one George Soros but eventually he’ll die. Oil is like Soros x100. Not even us realized this. Nah dude women will be driving there next year they are actually moderate Islam now Lol look at what you just typed you weirdo Now I’m not sure if you’re just a poorly executed gimmick but either way you’re no good Also how the bad-future vision has his wife described as an “old maid” even she’d be the same age as the happy ending where she still looks 20Her Twitter handle is @bootywipesI don't know, untalented people are assaulted too. The idea that sexual assault is wrong because it's a shitty thing to do to a fellow human being is enough, we don't have to make it about how talented/funny/attractive/valuable the victim is tooDo you have the Verrit codes for these assertions, sir? Otherwise, these are alternate facts and can be dismissed as such. "I know you are, but what am I?"I don't agree with her critique. The violence of the film lasts for 1 day and then Furiosa deposes Immortan Joe and literally lifts the proles to the higher level where they have unlimited access to food and water. How was she supposed to do that without violence? Do you want revolution without revolution? 

Also her tweet about the film objectifying the slave brides is wrong. The film had minimal male gaze in it. It's a film about female slaves and i'm 100% certain that if one of the usual pervert hollywood directors had done it, it would have a rape scene at the beginning and then it would be full of ass shots during action a la Michael Bay.The governor has pretty broad powers regarding special elections. If things were really bad they'd reschedule Fuck, me tooIncrementalism is fine if it's on the way to a more equitable future. Sadly Governor Rickenbacker doesn't share the second part of my view.Of. Fucking. Course. 

I rage unsubed to all my Crooked Media pods shortly after Charlottesville. Somehow their brand of effete technocratic liberalism fell out of favor after a few fascist marches..."isn't the 'blow' more of a 'suck?'"in the pursuit of further delegitimizing philosophy, they seek to become Rene Descartes Well the thing is, Hitler and Nazi germany became less and less about socialism as it grew in power. That’s why the Strasser brothers fled, and why Strasserism exists.To be fair though, in reality they are very easy to meme.Pretty much tbqh He has a daughter who he named Mikhaila after Gorbachev...The pessimism towards Dems is...ironic. He's smart for doing that. He knows how people interpret him already and lets everyone else do the talking. Hillary Clinton was the prior president Eugene Debs got like a million votes for president while in jail for saying WW1 sucked. That’s ultimate dirt bag left hoursI had a fucked epiphany about this today because I skimmed over his background and shrugged “meh, just the usual revolving door regulatory capture shit. Not egregious trump level cartoonish evil.” And I realized the Zone is already working. I should be up in arms about this guy, but compared to the complete ideologue incompetent morons like Devos this barely registers on my anger meter. Stay vigilant everyone. Hellworld sucks. Modern debs would be like running for president while banned from twitter or some shit I've got another one of my favs, Boston Corbett, the volcel who hunted down &amp; killed John Wilkes Booth. 

He was a literal mad hatter, ex-drunk, born-again God Enthusiast that cut off his own nuts with scissors due to the guilt of sleeping with a hooker. He joined the Army and was so fucking annoying they court marshaled him for insubordination and he was sentenced to be shot. They seriously wanted to execute him for not shutting the fuck up. They kicked him out of the Army instead, and he turned around and immediately joined back up and was captured by the Confederates. Fast forward, after he killed Booth he basically roamed the country incoherently preaching the lord's word, getting hate mail, pulling pistols on people, and getting fired from every job for being so fucking annoying. 

Boston Corbett truly never logged off, never stopped posting.&gt; TARFU Report

I was wondering about that. Any idea why? Did one of them turn out to be a nun rapist?Yeah he was as tough as it gets. After he castrated himself he sat down and ate dinner before seeking medical help.

This is the only damning point.I mean, if there were as many trans people as black people, maybe. But most people have no real experience interacting with trans individuals. I know people who used "tranny" non-disparagingly in 2015. The discourse has come a long way since then [uh, ok](https://twitter.com/annakhachiyan/status/664874046077693952)The same person simultaneously thinks modern feminism is about ugly women bringing down attractive women.What do you mean?PFFR is dirtbag left as fuckJust went to this hashtag and it's just full of random pictures of teenagers, which of course is stupid because posting your 14yo self to deter a pedophile is brain galaxy meme but i don't see anyone advertizing how fuckable she was. She just found two who happened to be pretty and then proceeded to make her pseudopsychology comment which of course tells us more about herself than anything else. Lenin was right about the Freudians.that was my exact same thoughtThis isn't a sexual pathology, it's just liberal dumbassery: "Sir? How dare you want to date a 13 year old? Look how innocent they look, have you no shame sir?"

That's funny cause her hero, Paglia endorsed Madona, Hefner and all those people responsible for this.Please tell me this is copy pasta even if you have to  lie &gt;the idea that women are privileged in society over men

YES

**YES!!!!**&gt;Hitler, wrote Speer, viewed Christianity as the wrong religion for the "Germanic temperament":[54] Speer wrote that Hitler would say: "You see, it's been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn't we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the fatherland as the highest good? The Mohammedan religion too would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?"Oh Dolores you silly bitchThis take is liquid shit, please flush.

The article isn't about primitivism (the easiest punching bag there is), it's about how the STEM lord vs humanities fight is stupid and their synthesis today is a modern luddism in the form of cyberpunk fiction. 

With this in mind the Luddite isn't a primitivist, but a fairly online critic of capitalism, which basically everyone in this sub is.

But the sheer number of my coworkers who don't believe in single-payer/universal healthcare astounds me.

The pod is named Chapo Trap House. The podcast looks at things from a leftist rather than liberal view, so this sub generally posts leftist articles and news as well. r/CTH is not a socialist subreddit it's not a fascist subreddit it's a subreddit about being gay with your dadBest part is that it's actually a step up from his last oneWhy would a gamer-american settle for this reality God I hope our court system does something good for once and stop this bullshit

This is the hardest I've laughed in weeks gotdamnMaybe try her twitter? 

https://twitter.com/alayne_f/status/932747241562914816A met a dude from Florida that likes Trump. He asked me to explain west coast liberalism to him, so I went into a high level explanation from a progressive point of view. I didn't go full WORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE, because that would alienate him almost immediately. He told me I value human life too much, to which I replied "What else is there?"

Obviously there is animal live, but outside of consciousness is there anything else that matters?If you can't cash a check, don't get a job. /sI need the original audio/video.

It's infinitely variable.How are you so sure you know what human nature is? You're only familiar with how people adapt to capitalist society. 

What if human nature, if such a such a thing exists, is to adapt to whatever situation we find ourselves in.None of the communist revolutions finished the project. Most ended up with administrations that never intended to. 

The result was state capitalism, where there was still private property, class inequality, exploited labor and zero worker control. The difference was the new capitalists were party members.

The question is how does a revolution prevent a Lenin from centralising everything to allow a Stalin to fuck it all up?The Walking Dead is actually about a revolution by what Marx calls the "rottenproletariat". 

The undead represent the lowest class of society that have been literally alienated from their life, and the humans represent the ruling class with their monopoly over the means of reproduction.

I mean, no shit, you’re a kid with the whole internet in front of you and the teacher can’t see it. Even now that I’m an adult I have to make a conscious decision to close my laptop if I want to learn anything lol Not a single picture of Shapiro representative of his height in that article. What is the liberal media trying to hide? If you pay close attention to the way both Coulter and Southern talk, they sound the same. 

Plus, Tomi Lahren is attractive. /sI was kidding people are extremely online. uh. i'm never letting my future children use social media. sketchy bbs only.It depends on the school of course. Our school blocked steam and porn (easily bypassed but at least they tried) but Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram were all available. As were flash games and every news site from the NYT to buzzfeed. There were enough distractions for every student, and it was ultimately up to the teachers to enforce laptop usage. It is silly, I’ve also spoken to South Koreans who have similar fears about the US which is funny because many Americans are afraid to visit Seoul because North Korea’s nearby. it's my domain name now. definitely not an fbi honeypot.I don't want to be part of a movement that protects shitty people.

The suggestion that holding shitty people accountable makes us weak is disgusting. 

Integrity makes us strong.Go join some trot org if that's how you feelMy take:

LDR fits the profile of the leftist predator to a t. A figure with a lot of social capital in activist spaces uses his position to slide into leftist girls' DMs and into their pants, just like the hacker from new zealand who promised connections to the hacking world, or that animal from portland who was a leader in feminist spaces, or Hugo Schwyzer who presented himself as a feminist professor, or that writer from Vice who had a feminist column. After they seduce their target,which is often very young and from a marginalized group, the relationship starts consensually but suddenly turns violent, usually with bdsm stuff. Also, they're always into weird stuff like polyamory, and go on and on and on about feminism using buzzwords like "consent" and "allyship".  

LDR fits all this perfectly.What about this though?

REDDIT DETERMINISMthis sub is a lost causeI think i'm taking your bait here, but fuck it.

Your post ends right before suggesting something like "To be politically strong like the Republicans, we shouldn't attack and remove our worst members. Having a moral high ground is valuable, but not politically valuable, therefore we should ignore the moral failings of our members and focus on grabbing power for power's sake"

Of course you didn't say that, because you're just asking questions because you're "honestly curious", which looks like a dog whistle to me.

I grow cactus and succulents because they barely need any attention, like cats.

I also grow them because a few species are psychedelic.This was my first thought but i am a guy and like most i was socialized to say fuck off to anyone that even mildly annoys me. Also, predators have a knack for going for metally unstable people and i can see the gaslighting effect of interacting with someone with a huge following who is well loved among leftist twitter.

I don't think I've seen a single take in between LDR being a sexual predator and LDR just being a guy who wants to fuck aside from this. LDR was creeping, and it's gross, but it doesn't deserve this inquisition. Why has it become so hard for people to just tell someone to fuck off.Republicans are winning and they are horrible women and LGBTQ.

That's what I hate about this scenario. I don't think LDR deserved the performative shaming from twitter leftists, but LDR was definitely, as I would say, creeping on the freshmen. It was inappropriate and I believe they should have been called out, but not in the way this whole thing was handled.are there, uh, any other ldr stories?thanks. after reading all that I want to say ldr is creeping on girls, but not predatory.The title is usually picked by the editor and the whole "x for intellectuals" was a popular phrase back in 2010 though.There was a post in r/relationships about a guy who referred to Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan as "his friends"“Trump did not show adequate disdain for the traitor known as Gülen.” Yep.

As for the article, i think that apart from these powerful media men whose cases get a lot of publicity, the whole climate doesn't affect your average joe-boss.

The answer is unions, not HR and definitely not focusing on celebrities. Of course the author looks like a thatcherite CHUD and all these go over her head.

Reading stuff like this is fascinating. People like Taibbi who now posit that modern feminism is a mental disorder where women try to advertise their sexual value at every opportunity, during the 90s were complaining that western women did not were enough mini skirts.

Its far better for them to engineer a terrorist attack or assassination. Just pose as an extremist group and recruit the right kind of angry nihilist. They already keep tabs on these people, and the FBI regularly does half of this already.

Authoritarian regimes need consent from a significant portion of the population to function. Nazi Germany made a deal with the aristocracy and capitalists to maintain their position in society, and promised the middle class with stability. Soviet states elevated the working class and made the former capitalists and upper middle class the new under class. So long as enough people sublimate their dissonance with the ruling ideology into climbing the social ladder, their consumption will continue to reproduce society.

Totalitarianism in the US would look more like the Bush administration than Trump's. Promising the world to the working class and not delivering is a grift that can only go so far. The neocon cadre during the Bush admin had a better offer to the middle class: let us murder as many people as we need to in the middle east, and we'll guarantee you stability and the middle class american dream. 

So if there are tanks in the street without some kind of pretext, then that would mean shit has really gotten out of hand, because the regime has lost the consent of too much of the population. At that point the regime has to capitulate and adopt policy that will buy back the consent of enough people, or resist an inevitable revolution.

Your laptop does this too it’s not really a scandal True, it is usually handled via a utility. But I think this is pretty typical Apple lack of transparency in how things are being handled under the hood. They could add a "reduce performance for added battery life" option, and probably should, but most Apple users seem to like staying out of the weeds whereas Android users want that kind of granularity.  It seems par for the course with Apple, not that its a good thing, but definitely in line with their general "you're the user, let us handle the tech stuff" mentality which is often times a selling pointcopy/paste from my comment on the other repost of this article

Using false generational divides to cast blame is extremely shitty identity politics, reductive, and ignorant of the scores of working/middle class boomers whose lives were gutted by neoliberalism. Yes. Reagan won 100% of the vote. Everyone over the age of 18 showed up. It was incredible. I guess that’s just my expectation of Apple at this point, which means they’ve won their battle of lowering the bar A bunch of dumb shits swung from Bush to obama to trump too. Most don’t even vote. The point is they can be enticed to vote for lefty politicians if they think it’ll improve their condition. 

When a lifelong Democrat who lost their union job under Reagan and never recovered sees this shit, their response isn’t “class solidarity,” it’s “fuck you”You can do that with iOS accessibility settings but idk if it changes battery life Whoopsie doodles

Where is the twitter thread they are referencing? I swear, like half of the characters are women! It’s totally crazy!Rap snitches This poster is from Refuse Fascism, a front group for the Revolutionary Communist Party. Also known as Bob Avakian's cult of personality.When a character said "It's ok, we're with the resistance!" and gave him that dumb little ring I knew the resisters would eat it up. I'm shocked we haven't seen Disney selling those rings already. With Hillary's face instead of the Rebellion logo, of courseDang, I guess I missed the part where they piled into all of those new capital ships at the end. I just remember watching their ships get destroyed one by one throughout the whole movie.

The point of Luke's sacrifice was to buy them time to escape. A character specifically states that their signal has been received and ignored before he arrives.

You got me with the Bolsheviks, though.
They *had* those ships.  The Raddus, the larger cruiser, was one of the last remaining ships from the New Republic fleet that was destroyed in TFA. They're not likely to be making more, with the info we're given in the movie. Sure, their "allies" in the outer rim might be able to offer more support, but that's never spelled out clearly. I'm going by what's supported by the movieIs there a difference?This is not even a dumb take, it's a fucking incoherent takeWell you see, I want to do socialism, but I don't want forced labor camps and police states and murderous purges.

There are a lot of us on the same page, but we don't totally agree on the details. We're fine with this because we can't predict what people will end up doing without a dictator telling them what to do.

This is also fine because we'll have lots of setups to draw from irl, and we won't have to lick boots to own the libsSomehow tankies think they would be party elites and not starving to death in Siberia. So labor camps are fine so long as you're not in them?

You don't think it's suspicious that dictators tell you the only way to achieve a moneyless classless society is through a dictatorship? The larping accusation is a weird attack, and predicated on armed struggle no longer being possible, or not possible in the US because we're exceptional somehow.

Life comes at you fast, and I would rather not be standing around in shocked disbelief when I ought be organizing a permanent camp for resisting armed fascist hordes.

Laughing at anime tankies for buying old Soviet junk off of eBay is fucking hilarious, but I would never drag a conrad for wanting to learn about firearms.That explains their poor attitude, but I was thrown off by their not reducing everything to ending the production of the commodity form or whateverI agree, but I can also see Disney's love of underdog stories keeping the resistance extremely small and weakBut overwatch is a shit game thoughDoes leather really taste that good?We really can't find a better phrase than "vampire castle"?Dick like a piece of driftwood caught in a creek for 3 years.

They had zero interest in soviet eschatology and acted purely for their own power. Why would a dictatorship do anything else?Do we need reams of theory to understand the class interests of a dictatorship's administration? No, because it's obvious.

The grift is a necessary part of any authoritarian hierarchy, because they need rubes to fall for it. 

You Marxists already have a phrase for this right? False consciousness? So why is it impossible to have a ruthless criticism of every authsoc failure?

Maybe such a critique would look uncomfortably libertarian and we can't do that, because you already wrote it off as "shallow, idealistic thinking".

So by dismissing libsoc before even considering it, you're making the only way out of this contradiction authoritarian, hence Stalin apologia, desiring a ruthless German revolution, etc. 

That's what makes convos with comrades like you tiresome; looking backward to rehabilitate old failures to maintain your brand in the present for future failures. Never killing your heroes, never taking out the old ideological trash, never stepping out of predefined boundaries.

Where's your dialectic progression to a new form that subsumes and negates orthodox Marxism? You need new shit because the old shit is busted.

Well that isn’t a policy concern that is a personal concern - and by bourgeois economic law I am supposed to tell people who want me to use their personal concerns in doing my economic calculus to fuck off and die.

You can go through a govt agency, such as the NLRB, or it's equivalent for public employees in each state. They would administer an election, certify the results, and can force the employer to recognize the union as the sole bargaining representative of the unit. 

Or, the employer can voluntarily recognize after the union has shown majority support. They may do this because of political pressure, or some other strategic reason. Southwestern Missouri is such a goddamn waste holy shit


Fuck Missouri in generalYeah, exactly. Card-check would be the mechanism that a union would demonstrate majority support. 

If employers were forced to recognize card-check campaigns, it would make union organizing a much better process. gives me hope for the world...https://nypost.com/2017/02/12/tom-arnold-clinton-begged-me-to-release-tape-of-trumps-racist-rant/Darude sandsomethingThis comment?

They won't be remembered.What do you expect, money changes people.Franklin D. Roosevelt Letter to the Democratic Convention
July 18, 1940

Members of the Convention:

In the century in which we live, the Democratic Party has received the support of the electorate only when the party, with absolute clarity, has been the champion of progressive and liberal policies and principles of government.

The party has failed consistently when through political trading and chicanery it has fallen into the control of those interests, personal and financial, which think in terms of dollars instead of in terms of human values.

The Republican Party has made its nominations this year at the dictation of those who, we all know, always place money ahead of human progress.

The Democratic Convention, as appears clear from the events of today, is divided on this fundamental issue. Until the Democratic Party through this convention makes overwhelmingly clear its stand in favor of social progress and liberalism, and shakes off all the shackles of control fastened upon it by the forces of conservatism, reaction, and appeasement, it will not continue its march of victory.

It is without question that certain political influences pledged to reaction in domestic affairs and to appeasement in foreign affairs have been busily engaged behind the scenes in the promotion of discord since this Convention convened.

Under these circumstances, I cannot, in all honor, and will not, merely for political expediency, go along with the cheap bargaining and political maneuvering which have brought about party dissension in this convention.
It is best not to straddle ideals.

In these days of danger when democracy must be more than vigilant, there can be no connivance with the kind of politics which has internally weakened nations abroad before the enemy has struck from without.
It is best for America to have the fight out here and now.

I wish to give the Democratic Party the opportunity to make its historic decision clearly and without equivocation. The party must go wholly one way or wholly the other. It cannot face in both directions at the same time.

By declining the honor of the nomination for the presidency, I can restore that opportunity to the convention. I so do.Goddammit, LeroyNew York has a lot of UF alumni.

by the way, im not the one shilling and making excuses for whites bombing arab countriesSecular jihad is the correct term for Harrisite foreign policy.I don't know which 'genocidal leaders' you think I'm 'making excuses' for, a hilarious accusation considering the real genocidal lunatics are the AQ spin offs running around the maghreb region after proliferating when Libya fell, or the psychopaths that committed actually genocide in Iraq and Syria after the US reduced Iraq to a failed state, or maybe the Israelis whove egged on every one of these interventions. Its not as if Assad or Qaddafi are any friends of theirs or ours, but it is fucking astonishing how you think that either Qaddafi or Assad have killed the number of civilians that the U.S and its Islamist allies have in these conflicts. I also dont know what the fuck makes them 'genocidal' - thats often the neocon bullshit 'Hitler in Munich' hyperbole thats used to justify destroying these countries and turning them into neo-colonies.

Unlike most leftists, I remained a huge believer in the Arab Spring until a couple if years ago, even after Morsi was deposed, my family was even close with Syrians who took part in the earliest rebellions - my step-brothers father was killed early in the conflict by government forces - but nothing has made me more cynical than watching D.C appropriate and corrupt certain revolutions like in Libya and support the counter revolutions where they see fit, like in Saudi and Egypt. 

انا موريتاني و متعاد على أستخدام حروف عربية، "خبيبي"

Easier to just pretend everyone who disagrees with you is white or Israeli though, which is weird considering those two types of people are usually the ones making your argument. 

Also proves that America liberals never really gave a shit about Muslim or black activistsI was brought up with english as my first language, and hassaniya (اللهجة المورتانية) is a weird ass version of Arabic - even Morrocans can have a hard time understanding it - but me mixing up 5 with 7 is cuz I usually dont use arabeasy much since all my relative speak Syrian dialect or hassaniya, and i usually type in فصحى

Anyways it feels kind of shitty to argue with an Arab akh on a site full of white racists and hasbara trolls that are better to shit on, I'm just surprised as to why anyone - especially a Palestinian - would defend U.S foreign policy in those countries, especially since its always been spearheaded by  neo-cons and liberal zionists interventionists who genuinly care less about Arab nations' well-being than even someone like Qaddafi. 

Yeah I definately am for supporting the revolutions, both my parents have devoted their careers and lives to supporting anti-dictator movements in the Arab world, and I plan to do the same (at this point we are all blacklisted from Saudi, Egypt etc. anyways so not like I have go worry about that), but no matter how i look at it, everything that America touches is for their overall benefit, in keeping us divided, in colonizing our countries, in boosting Israel... places like Tunisia and Morroco give me some hope of reform, but Libya... all there is in places like that are utterly weak governments at the mercy of the Europeans and Americans, and rubble where a country that was prosperous - even though Qaddafi was a dog that had to go - stood... not because there was a revolution, but because the real revolution itself was overthrown and weaponized for an outside force.

Nice meeting you too cousin.Try blink 1488Terrorist can't make any demands if you kill the hostages yourself.Where does this info come from anyways?Literal paid protesters.Exactly. Its fucking unbelievable the sheer nonsense you can get away with in relation to NK. You can accuse the Kim regime of feeding his uncle to dogs or killing a famed singer and nobody blinks.Let's see what we have here:

A report from Intermedia, which is located a few meters from the White House and works for the State Department. The IBA report you provided comes from a War Crimes Committee chaired by a former prosecutor for the U.S Department of Justice who helped prosecute Iraqi officials after the American invasion and regime change in that nation. Let's just look at the funding, shall we?

It was funded by *the damn DFF*. It also received "support" from "human rights" organizations like HRNK, which receives money from congress via the State Department, is chaired by D.C neocons, and has blatantly lied in it's reports before about, inventing unsubstantiated nonsense about a supposed North Korean caste system called 'Songbun', sourced entirely from an ex-CIA agent and peddled by Robert Collins, who spent decades working with and for right-wing American and South Korean intelligence in South Korea and is a frequenter of warhawk orgnaizations in D.C, especially the AEI.

&gt;[Robert Collins](http://www.hrnkinsider.org/2016/03/an-hrnk-interview-with-robert-collins.html): When I decided to retire from the army six years ago, I felt that my knowledge could be useful in writing materials that would contribute to an overall understanding of how North Korea makes its decision and to how they carry out their policies. And so, since retirement, **I’ve just continued with what the army taught me to do over those decades at the end of the 20th century and doing it unilaterally. And now I’m doing it in support of HRNK. **

The guy who set up the website for the HRNK [worked for](https://imgur.com/ROvmjPV) the National Endowment for Democracy at the time. The president of the [NED](https://imgur.com/ROvmjPV) is on the board of directors of the HRNK.

Here are some of the initiatives funded by the [NED](https://www.ned.org/region/asia/north-korea-2015/). They send funds to fascist militia groups like Azov Battalion in Ukraine among other things.

Report was also supported by the fucking US Korea Institute and Freedom House. What the actual heck do you think anybody who is even slightly cognizant of the deceitful nature of these foreign policy hawk groups and 'human rights organizations' like HRNK, (which incidentally is also a few meters away from the fucking White House) would respond to this report with? How gullible are you? Do you really think citing these 'sources' and demanding that nobody deny the supposed atrocities they claim in them will just get the gullible to shut up or something? These organizations and their official-looking reports take reality and bend it until it breaks, these are the same fuckers who peddle lies ahead of every foreign intervention and invasion that the D.C gets a stiffy for.

Another of your sources, Jieun Baek, writes shit like [this](https://beyondparallel.csis.org/empowering-north-koreans-part-of-trump-north-korea-policy/) about how vital it is that the United States government pursue Cold-War-esque 'information campaigns'...  the fact that her book is so renowned among the liberal commentariat is meaningless to me. Nothing is more ridiculous and orientalist than the nonsense Westerners love to lap up about the utterly meaningless and drone-like lives of anyone living in a state their government has deemed requiring of a regime change.

I'm sorry if it's not 'rational' for us to dismiss claims until the evidence is provided from an organization that isn't a neo-con or liberal interventionist one. They don't exactly have a good track record. This is some Cold-War era bullshit, everyone knows we are dealing with secretive autocracies, but when you allow the fucking D.C warhawk lobbyists to fill in the gaps and pass them off as humanitarian reports, then you should stop moralizing for a second and reconsider whether Western 'human rights' institutions aren't just as marred by political ambition as any government organization.

But I didn't dismiss all evidence, I asked for reliable evidence, which you still won't provide. 

Second of all, being located in the think-tank lobbyist neighborhood of D.C is an absolutely red sign for any organization that disseminates information on foreign state enemies. You presented all of these sources without indicating that any of them come from State Department funded ghouls, who by the way are usually the primary sources for a lot of penned works on North Korea.

I discounted the info because their fucking names are branded in big letters on the first few pages and they exist within walking distance of each other in DC. As for Intermedia being dismissed "just on the basis of being close to the White House", I just want you to check Google Maps for its location, look at the think tanks around it, and I'll admit that I havent dug into their funding but there is 100% chance that they have close relations to the warhawk and military-linked fuckers next door to them.

You are correct that I shouldn't have dismissed that book so quickly. I will find it online and examine its sources first before I make a judgement. 

Another thing is to understand that most of this information is weaponized by concern troll 'humanitarians', who - the second that a bomb drops over Pyongyang - will start writing about how the best strategy to 'liberate' NK is to treat every single one of the previously poor, brainwashed civilians who need rescue as potential enemy combatants, like they did in Baghdad. These people are fucking ghouls who take any real atrocities committed by the Kims and Saddams of the world, magnify them and fabricate new ones disseminate cartoonish conspiracy theories to the mass media, and reduce the peoples of their target state into hostage populations with no agency or commitment to their homeland who just want to Freedom^TM. 

Do I think that a Stalinism-inspired government doesn't punish dissidents? Not at all, I would be surprised if they didnt. But the idea that they have a small city of political dissidents in jail is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence, and nobody seems to ever talk about speculative North Korean prison camp populations without the assumption that the only criminality in that country comes from the government or something. I know people who are actually sitting in prisons across the Middle East for their activism or political views, but every week I'm inundated with false information from the same fuckers that themselves are all buddy-buddy with the regimes in my region of the world, informing us all that nukes are better than normalization, and that the greatest evil in the world right now is a podunk regime that any regular analyst could tell you doesn't really give a shit about war and is fine with de-escalation as long as it maintains sovereignty. 

Unfortunately the option of sovereignty cant exist when there is an industry of propagandists and military/intelligence freaks collaborating to release unsubstantiated reports on one hand while selling and installing THAAD systems in South Korean civilians' backyards on the other. 

These days I don't even believe the UN or AI anymore, they outright lied on behalf of the regime change hawks and interventionists about the Syria chemical attacks as Mattis let slip last week. Why should I then accept the claims of the most sordid and shady Cold-War-inspired organizations within a 5 minute walk from Trump's office?

I definitely agree with you on that, I'm just on very high alert ever since I noticed that even something as seemingly innocuous as a human rights organization for North Korea - one of the countrues that obviously needs more human rights - could be set up and run by people who are that diabolical and funded by a government that alternates between starving the North Korean civilian population with sanctions no one finds effective while building up ridiculous military capabilities in their neighbors backyard, and openly contemplating whether it should exterminate them all and kill millions of others in the region rather than lose the chance to colonize them.He sexually harassed one of the writers of Community (Megan Ganz) and he seems to have issues with alcohol.

So what this article is saying is that by making fees a violation of the first amendment, conservatives could make businesses, the government too potentially, answerable to any activity an employee feels is a violation? Aren't you worried about being called a hypocrite?

I don't know anyone else but if i was rich i'd rather be an evil prick than help the poor. Hypocrisy is just like the worst... unless it's imperialism. He's a libertine. He just associated libertarianism with freedom like most people until you realise better.

Now he's more apathetic but still mocks the CIA.I'm definitely done with ChelseaHere's your corn and soy ration for the month. If you did that with a CSA program that would be really cool.All I ever saw of this were the miners charging the police with melee weapons so you think "must have been justified to shoot at charging armed miners" the back story was never explained on MSM about how they were boxed in viciously. How the Mine owners killed miners during the talks.

And now afterwards they went on a hunt.I would totally watch that movie.And they tried to claim it was a clean war just because they blew up a bridge after a civilian car had just passed over. "Luckiest man in Iraq"Mostly slaves. Not prisoners.Posadist. What, am I supposed to use Google??Yeah, no. I'm not online.So the working class defends itself with shovels, then.Well I mean I’m being realistic, at this point, the police will never let go of their guns. This as well. Even now, most gun control laws target non-whites. Harsher gun control would simply leave non-whites defenseless.Eh of course it’s bad now, but without any worry of a revolt, police corruption and violence would be much worse.We never really see the victims of school shootings either. The shooter gets discussed, but the people who killed are just statistics and old photos. It's disgustingly sanitized.I mean some Americans would gladly round up their fellow neighbors in support of the capitalist class.But get rid of police guns first.afaict, it wasn't really an intended design decision. It's a rifle so it's going to have a higher muzzle velocity and the sort of longer, thiner bullet is more likely to yaw and fragment than a pistol.Overworded, but... decent.People already know the reality.

They don't really care because "well, it'll never happen to meeee."The country watched Eric Garner get strangled on a street in broad daylight. It shrugged its shoulders.

They know of it. Watching through a screen won't show them "what it's like."The people who are angry are the ones who believed that the acts were occurring in the first place--now they're vindicated and can raise the volume. 

And if it's on a regular basis? Then it just becomes a fact of American life. Has it not already? Part of the population has willingly traded human safety for the Second Amendment.

I'd like to be wrong.&gt;It's our values, stupid. It's because we indoctrinate our citizens into thinking that they are deficient if they can't scrape together a successful life out of this crucible of capitalist indifference. We fill the minds of the have-nots with shame and guilt beyond anyone's ability to fully cope with, and we fill the minds of the haves with supremacist fantasies that convince them that it’s okay to treat others like dirt, or they deserve to get away with anything if they’re rich. We tell foreign children studying their asses off that they haven’t earned the right to live in the one place they’ve known as home, and we tell native-born Americans that their entire way of life is under attack. 

&gt;All I’m saying is that we might be suffering from the same issue that you would see in a suicidal Japanese salaryman. The words “Why not just go home after 8 hours?” don’t make sense when you’re living in the problem. His sensibilities are probably so woven in with the cultural norms that pushed him to that brink, that he can’t step back and see that there are entirely different ways for a civilization to be organized. 

Close enough for now.I hope you're right.I wish there was more of a distinction between things like schizophrenia and whatever this is. Mentally injured instead of mentally ill. American mass shooters aren't born with it. There's something comical about the Firearms subreddit's consensus being that the only way to prevent this... is CCTV in every school, to have armed guards/contractors in every counseling office, ready to spring into action.

"Yeah, seventeen kids died... but they were actually teenagers. And the definition of a mass shooting is actually--"

For fuck's sake.

"Where were you during the school shooter era, Grandpa?"

"I was on the Internet, saying that every corpse was worth the price of freedom."

I believe there's a religion and socialism working group,  potentially associated with DSA already.

A member of my local DSA chapter is a priest (particularly a college chaplin), and he brought it up at a meeting once. I'll ask him if there's anything publicly going on right now and report back. 

Edit: After googling this it was super easy to find, didn't need to ask anyone. DSA Religion and Socialism working group is a thing, and they have a website!

That's what it means to be under occupation with no government to help you.All I will say is we need to unionize. I should be getting double time for my antifa work.Actually it is, since most of them don't usually have an ongoing settler-colonial project of ethnic cleansing, don't have their hands in some of the most violent wars of the 21st century, and dont get to spit in the face of international consensus as much as Israel does. They are a Jewish Rhodesia, similar to the U.S but with a more racist dominant population and their ethnic cleansing, revisionism and nationalist myths aimed at displacing natives have existed only for a generation or two.True, but much of that comes from the fact that they aren't considered 'real Jews' due to being African. A lot of this makes sense if you consider the Bismarckian nationalist and social Darwinist origins of modern Zionism, as Herzl envisioned it.Would unironically save the region from a catastrophic invasion and power vacuum.English are as disgustingly drunk as australians but much more mean, aggressive and ugly.

Whats amazing is that this is the exact shit you can hear straight from the neocons and Zionists on the pages of the NYT. 

The question becomes whether or not they see any option to taking Iran down that doesn't involve large efforts from their own enormous military presence in the region.Gotta have SOME hope!!Well its good news for britain.They don't need the EU to gut the NHS , they are doing it themselves.I know the pain lmaoRich supported Bernie.Eco devestation is of no concern to you?*Now the grown-up Goliath nation's holding open auditions for the part of David*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcRWnr5lL-kDecorum was always a nonsense argument. 

It’s fundamentally based on the fact that they know the underlying premise of the mainstream political spectrum of the US is BS. And if you can blow other peoples BS up on national tv, that means someone can do that to you - ergo calling people out on tv is mean, disrespectful and lacking tact. It’s like watching the movie Shane on a national scale.  

If you won’t pick up an AR-15 to defend yourself/your school/your community you are the bully. Not the fact that almost no one actually thinks that’s logical or good regulation.

"How dare RT propagandize the war in Syria like that? Next up on CNN, an interview with George Iraqwarwasgood, former director of Literally American Spooks."I think it's important to remember most Peterson fans arrive at Peterson because the general public finds them as individuals generally repulsive and detestable. Peterson gives them an "intellectual" validation of how everyone else is the one that's weird &amp; bad, and despite all of their shortcoming they're actually OK. 

I generally feel bad for folks like that, but Peterson gives them an excuse to not look inward &amp; be a better person or better member of society.

That's all to say, lots of folks identify with Peterson, but there's plenty more that will be further repulsed by these guys &amp; Peterson by extention because they're really just doubling down on their shitty traits. They're just MRA guys in slightly different clothing. There's probably too many of them in America but it will always be a small, sexless &amp; sad niche group.do we really want to put our hope in Zizek? He'll probably end up agreeing that Fascism is OK as long as it ends up with more incestuous relationships between siblings.&gt; Hitler was a left-wing socialist!

No, the guy privatized vast amounts of the German government.

&gt;But he was telling business what to do!

Yea, because of governments in a time of war need to consolidate power. Plus those people were backing him. 

&gt; BUT THE WORD SOCIALIST IS IN THERE! HITLER WAS LEFT-WING!

The whole point of socialism is overcoming class conflict, sure there are non-Marxist forms of socialism and communism but even if you were to use the term "Left-wing" then you're still wrong. All forms of socialism on the left are about overcoming class conflict and abolishing private property because of its exploitative use by giving power to a bourgeoisie elected and backed government.

Fascism is liberal democracy without the liberal democracy. Fascism is taking the Rule of Law to the extreme to the point where you control aspects of modern life to benefit the culture and economy of a nation over all nations. Fascism wants never-ending national conflict between nations while maintaining cultural aspects that help capitalist economies grow.I hear you but I think so much of modern conservative thought is born out of their individual fucked up sexual pathologies. To me it's central to why they're such shits.Jesus Christ, do none of you have parents or something?

I've watched a bunch of clips and the guy is so hateful, stupid &amp; smug it makes my skin crawl &amp; my stomach turn.

Look, I'm sure you don't appreciate being mocked or brigaded or whatever and I get and appreciate you're perspective on that, but Peterson is a foul and nasty guy and frankly a pointless guy to me. You're not going to convince me otherwise by running around crying about everything.  I'm conflicted.

Man, people like you not only don't understand what intersectionality is, you also assume that anyone concerned with social justice believes whichever caricature you learned off youtube.It would just be a back-and-forth about whether Stalin was worse than Hitler.I get it, I think you just eventually run into an endless struggle of people who want society to be more inclusive and the people who want to be able to say whatever they want.??? Isn't that like the opposite of leftcomHalf of them are one Patrick Porter article away from being neo-cons.Absolutely right, both that they didn't handle court appointments well, and that  there are other mechanisms  that would have helped organized labor.

Uh not at all, they are against vanguardism for completely different reasons than thatI agree with you on all of that. Well it's nothing like the Leninist idea of a vanguard party. It's not there to become a central committee or to raise socialist conscious or whatever, nor is it there to really 'lead' the revolution.That the labor theory of value is somehow debunked by the prospect that people can labor to make worthless things like mud pies.hmm, found it. that definitely looks like 69 &amp; his chunky little boy body getting railed. I mean, he is pretty clearly referring to 'social labor', as in useful labor that fulfills a social purpose. The mud pie argument is one of those lazy arguments liberal economics students like to parrot from each other because none of them have read Marx beyond being introduced to the Manifesto as some utopian idealist work in their poli-sci 101 class.I don't think that the question is about who beat who, but about who was more destructive to their population. I find Stalinist distasteful and to be very vulgar in their Marxism, but I also think it's laughable to compare the Bolsheviks to the Nazis.Brothers, let me nuzzle your napes. Join me in a cuddle puddle by the mud bubbles. Them and Moderate RebelsMight be better to approach this in good faith and to answer the question in a way that would provoke reflection in others of the same situation, rather than going with the "you're a fucking dumbass" approach. 'Cause, y'know, readers rarely willfully associate themselves with the dumbass, as you've noticed.

But novelty pays the bills, so whateverSeems that way.If I remember correctly, they swept through many of the areas that suffered the harshest early Stalinist repression and inflicted even worse atrocities in even larger numbers within a short time.Hope those texts answered some questions.and tartar sauceThat time when they sent a hunk of metal and two white guys to the moon while beating and caging the descendants of slaves that they had to kill each other over just to get most to accept that while they weren't REALLY human, they shouldn't be slaves now that industry exists.I read that letter from the Taliban the other day, and holy fuck were they right about some things that I am 100% sure they lifted from the international leftist opposition to the war. If only they weren't run by so many batshit psychos, and maybe read Marx.I'm Pita, the POC of breads.You have a situation where 87% of the land is owned by 8% of the population, who inherited it from violent colonizers, in a country where someone like Elon Musk graduated from elite whites-only high schools in the affluent suburbs of an all-whites city while everyone black his age had grown into an adult in bantustans and ghettos before aparteid was abolished. It is plain violence that a large segment of the black population are living in abject poverty thanks to this, and it has to be corrected as soon as possible. I'm not all that shocked that many in the public would want immediate land re-allocation. Unfortunately the highly corrupt government and racial animus that has arisen out of the racialized private distribution of wealth and resources are threatening to take drastic actions that seem perfectly just on the surface, but have been proven to be disastrous for the well-being of the country in Zimbabwe, and are being advocated by some that we shouldn't shy away from calling racists, even if they witnessed their people being oppressed by the white minority for decades and had to fight to be allowed a say in their country's future.

This is what happens when you get a combination of capitalist inequality resulting from colonial white supremacy and non-holistic solution to both.Racists will shoot an African in the leg and then cross the finish line only to pat themselves on the back for being a superior runner. Who gives a fuck what they think?a classic from our tankie frenemiesOkay. When Sam Harris thinks of Muslims, he thinks of brown people. Thus he is racist, as evidenced by his advocacy for profiling people 'who look Muslim'.Hahahahahahaha
Man, despite all the insane shit he's said over the years and the freaks he's associated with, just that sentence should be enough to understand what a moron ideologue he is.Damage it how? What exactly do 'other countries' do to support 'anti-colonialism' that this would make them stop doing?I don't disagree that following the Zimbabwean model is wrong, I disagree that we should give a shit about what racists think, or that there are any people committed to anti-colonialists who would give up their cause if South Africa redistributed land.Say what you will about the pyschopaths, they sure know how to write a letter: https://alemarah-english.com/?p=25640

Who do you think the South African government needs to convince in order to de-colonize?I don't know who is watching the situation in South Africa and thinking 'this is what anti-colonialism is about' who isn't already someone who doesn't give a shit about what anti-colonialism actually is. Okay, but again, we aren't arguing that this is a hasty extremist decision or that the ANC isn't corrupt, but who should the South African government try to convince that anti-colonialism isn't bad?Eh... I dunno. You can point out that the letter is written in bad faith and that the writer (consciously or not) is seeking validation without adapting a tone that'll put people on the defensive.Ah, must be the tankie contingentI'm literally a brown Arab-Muslim, but sure, please preach to me about 'my prejudiced' before I judge the tolerance of an asshole who cheer-led the Iraq war and thinks that it 'makes sense' to single out 'Muslim looking people' in TSA lines because their religion is an evil disease of the mind or whatever. I don't give a shit that he backtracked - as he is notorious for doing after every one of his disgusting outbursts - and *literally said* that not all Muslims are bearded brownies with curved daggers. His history of associating with racists speaks louder than his lazy excuses.

I wonder if his comments that *"We should profile Muslims, or anyone who looks like he or she could conceivably be Muslim, and we should be honest about it.”* , followed by his mention of *“ethnic profiling”* is part of the reason why even high-profile Muslum Americans keep finding themselves on no-fly lists. I know that after that stupid fucking proposal he backtracked, saying *"It’s not that I want certain people profiled, I just want us to admit that some people require less scrutiny."* Poor misunderstood Harris, people always assume the worst of him and make him clarify that his quite literal wording was actually a soft suggestion at something far less extreme. Things like this are why he's garnered a reputation as Sam "out of context" Harris. The only thing that matters more to him than his political bigotry is his public image.

I wonder if his advocacy for this sort of shit and his comments such as  *"So you see this massacre in the Christmas market and I think many people will feel, what is the f**king point of having more Muslims in your society? It seems perfectly rational to say, we don’t want any more. We have enough, right? And certainly increasing the percentage is not a help to anyone who loves freedom of speech and any of the other liberal values that you and I just spoke about maximizing. It’s not worth the trouble, and if we can figure out some way to keep the number of Muslims down in any society, whether we’re honest about this or whether we do this covertly, clearly it’s rational to want to do this*" and *“people who speak most sensibly about the threat that Islam poses to Europe are actually fascists" and “we are at war with Islam.”* is part of what created the atmosphere that got me and my family get blackmailed and deported by the FBI back in 2008, and why every few months we hear stories of other Muslim families back in Texas getting similar treatment. 


But I'm sure it's just my in-born irrationality and taking him out of context that's the issue, and not his fucking abysmal history of supporting the War on Terror and demonizing Muslims, along with AEI fraudster Ayaan "Lied about her own name" Hirsi Ali and Majid "I take money for supporting neo-conservatives" Nawaz. A guy who literally says the words “I have no reason to believe Robert Spencer is a bigot" is the person you are explaining to a Muslim is not at all a bigot. Afghanistan literally bans the importing of communist material because the central government is so corrupt, power-hungry and right-wing that they worry the impoverished people of the nation would be radicalized. They and the Americans prefer jihadists to Maoist revolutionaries, beginning with their collusion with Islamists to crush communists in the country decades ago. And since the Taliban is mostly a mix of a network of foreigner terrorists and local tribal warlords, they don't need to worry about class-based uprisings or Marxist militias. Who knows what sort of leftists indegenous movements could challenge and displace them if it weren't so? So many nations could have been another Cuba if not for the suppression of the left-wing by the right in concert with imperialists.I think you missed the part where the people who owned said industry hail from a small minority of former colonizers. Not to mention that you just invalidated your starting point by admitting that despite South Africa bring far less industrialized than tge U.S, it's agricultural industry is an oligopoly run by whites.

To begin with, I don't agree with dividing up the land between families for sustenance farming or whatever they think is going to happen, I'm underlying the inequality that a combination of private ownership and racial disparity that caused this crisis to start with.Thank you for that avalanche of sheer horseshit.

You are on the wrong subreddit, go back to /r/libertarian where you can continue bitching about how persecuted white people are. I agree with most of what you said. How did they get hold of that land though? Why the racial disparity in ownership?

And tell me, what solutions are there to inequality of this sort that don't involve taking into consideration positions that the parties were born into? There is a difference between punishing the son for the father's sin and taking back what the father stole and the son now benefits from, at the expense of those it was stolen from.No man, go back to explaining how the Dutch built a society that they shouldn't have to hand over to the greedy Zulus (who by the way WERE SAVAGES BEFORE THE WHITE MAN'S ARRIVAL)

That comment was WAY more interesting than this shitNot only are you arrogant enough to assume my knowledge of the subject is some cliche that you likely find offensive, you went on two spiels worthy of Botha in which you employed ridiculously childish and aggrieved arguments and rhetorical questions that amount to "do you think it is okay to *KILL WHITE BABIES*?". 

I would be utterly unsurprised to learn that you are a supporter of Israeli zionism and carry nostalgia for Rhodesia. You do not know a hint of what it means to be colonized, and the bastardized and degrading version of history you give is of the standard revisionist pseudo-intellectual apologetic that aggrieved people from white colonizing cultures - though I hear this sort of disgusting revisionism from Israeli Jews, neo-Ottoman Turks and most right-wing nationalists and racists - who tie their pride to their race or nation fall back on when they feel personally attacked by those who view the legacy of white supremacist imperialism and colonialism as an abomination that haunts us to this day - the image of indigenous populations too stupid and ungrateful to benefit from the supposed 'net positives' of generations of colonialism theft. It doesn't matter to you how many rot in a bantustan with no prospects thanks to the colonizer - you can always bring up the fact that they had an 'inferior' indigenous culture and imply that they could never change or develope if not for the gracious rapers from Europe.

Come at me.After many movies showcasing los Nacionales and la Guardia Civil as tough but fair it was excellent to showcase the absolute brutality that those cunts inflicted on the spanish rural populace.

Things are not as bad as full fascism now but they are not rosy. Top down neoliberalism and austerity pushed from the EU at the behest of Berlin has fucked all leftism in Europe.

The shameful refugee policies across the continent that left countries overstretched and without resources plus the usual culture war has soured a lot of the citizenry.

Incrementalism and technocratics solutions leave people without option or recourse so right wing populists triumph.

The last decade has been a complete waste for the EU  .

On the other hand the Italian parliament is a nest of vipers filled with idiots, whoever governs will fall in a year following the time honoured traditions You're definitely right about the legal definition of treason. Absolutely 0% chance that Trump is convicted of this. We're not at war with Russia, although many people talk about it like we are. 

I think your take on collusion isn't the full picture. It can definitely be used to refer to company's coordinating and violating anti-trust laws. However, in this sense, people use it to talk about coordination in illegal activity generally. The criminal charge wouldn't be "collusion," it would involve working to strategically use illegally obtained information. This could actually be a crime - though we absolutely don't have evidence of this at this time. The investigation has already uncovered money laundering (by Trump's associates, not the man himself). But in this case collusion is used to refer to collaboration in terms of distribution of illegal obtained emails, specifically the DNC emails that were hackedSpain's left is fucked after the catalonian referendum.Parenti is like a tankie but reasonable. He actually made me somewhat sympathetic to MLs because I realized not all “Tankies” (i.e MLs) are like Twitter Tankies. I think you can say that Hitler’s ambitions and the industrial killing machine he set up sets him apart from the other imperial states. I don’t see the purpose of trying to say the Americans were as bad as Hitler. Empire can be bad without being literally hitler.188 if im not mistaken....

What's the reason that model of policing is not good?You’re like a parody of an Internet tankie. Liberalism: saying Stalin tolerating a prolific rapist at the head of his brutal secret police apparatus was bad. 
Not liberalism: saying DUMB is an ABLEIST slur, this is NOT ACCEPTABLE for a REAL LEFTISTLSC is full of users that think they’re socialists because they’ve read Stalin’s Wikipedia, somebody told them it was all propaganda, and they think it’s edgy to LARP as a Stalinist propagandist from the 1930s. Read Marx, nerd. *extremely Canadian Kermit voice* It’s actually gay to get pussy Shining Path were straight up brutal murderers, my guy. They rounded up peasants and tortured and murdered them regularly. I can’t believe anybody would cite them as goodI think a need to attach yourself to a “tendency” at all is all around pretty bad, and is oftentimes a result of the LARP-ing problem on the left. The reason Trotskyists are the absolute worst is that they push their tiny sect’s party line like an unchangeable dogma, almost like a religion. Many MLs also do this, as do Left coms and many other “tendencies.”Evidence Based Industrialization*gets punched in a bar* wtf this is literally genocide Italians are all either fascists or anarchists. There were no anarchists running in this election. Obviously the fascists were bound to win. The ending of world at war is actually really well done and is very sad. It unironically gave me feels. I'm just excited to see Our Man Jared take another shot at the system. 
the whole REEEEE thing is a big staple tooa trope is when something existsI know an “ancap” who for some reason thinks like a leftist but has arrived at he conclusion that anarcho-capitalism is the solution. It’s weird. He’s actually started calling himself a left libertarian. You know my hottest take is how turning up to events like this and protesting them oftentimes just leads to them getting more notoriety than they deserve. I understand that this sounds like New York Times op ed bullshit, and that if you’re a Nazi then people aren’t going to just “ignore you, but there’s some truth to just saying don’t turn up to the event. Idk like punching Nazis is good but I think people take campus politics way too seriously if that many people turned up to protest this pathetic event Sure but it doesn’t  mean I’m wrong tbh. I don’t think chastising people for protesting has any purpose but neither does giving these people this much attention. Like when Antifa turned up to a Sargon event recently, I just don’t get the point of giving that cretin any attention. Hmmm I guess so, if that’s the case then I can see the point of protesting. I just think there’s often a knee jerk reaction where shutting down events is per se the correct tactical decision for a lot of fellow leftists and if you disagree then you’re a Nazi apologist or something. 

I never claim “Nazis deserve free speech,” but I do often claim that if you give them legal protection you strengthen the legal protections that the Left has.

For example, Brandenburg v. Ohio is good because by giving the KKK “free speech” the Left was given more freedom to operate as well and the government will always suppress the Left more than the Right. I think there’s a lot of leftist who would annihilate me for just suggesting this. I agree, but I wouldn’t over emphasize how intimidating these protests actually are. Sometimes it genuinely plays into their hands because these fascists are good at appropriating liberal rhetoric. Milo wouldn’t have ever had a career without people’s reactions to his shit.

This isn’t me chastising people for protesting. I understand people will inevitably be baited by this type of vile shit and I’ll join and support them in protesting in solidarity. I just sometimes worry about the lack of tactical analysis that’s happening on the Left where “lol bash the fash” is becoming a dogma that can never be criticized So, there's some variation in meaning here. I've heard that Hispanic applies to Spanish speaking peoples, while Latin(o/a/x) applies to all people from Latin AmericaYeah it’s like a separate question for activists than whether the government should do the suppressing. &gt;tfw you agree that oil and gasoline smell good but everyone in this thread is roasting him for saying thatAlso walking sticks.Yeah they’ll always complain about their freeze peach regardless. Idk this isn’t a strong opinion. I just think bashing the fash and deplatforming turns into LARP-ing when people can’t articulate why they’re doing it or what it accomplishes. It comes across as a form of liberal idealism as well because they think by deplatforming they’re killing the “debate” and thus preventing the idea from spreading. 

For example, I fucking despise Henry Kissinger maybe more than any living political figure. I’m mad every month that the piece of shit isn’t dead. But when he came to my university to do a talk, a fellow leftist asked me if I was going to the protest to de platform him. I just didn’t see the point of it. People would just go home and read his books, he’s a prolific author. My friend couldn’t articulate why they were doing it other than that he is “an asshole.” Okay sure, but I want political action to accomplish something, not just be impotent rage. Sometimes it just seems like people want to seem hella radical by deplatforming people, maybe I’m just cynical. I support most Antifa action, btw, I just think a lot of the rhetoric and justification for deplatforming seems ironically like the liberal “muh marketplace of ideas” shit. Sometimes shutting people up at some obscure campus event accomplishes totally nothingI think they talked about this on the pod or some other podcast but the problem is that ideally we would just ignore him but obviously when you say such vile shit people will react, so New York Times columnists chastising protesters really just don’t understand how collective action works. 

That being said, I just think the point that maybe we should just not pay attention to these tiny gatherings of weirdos on college campuses is still a valid thing to discuss. I think the rise of fascists is terrifying and needs to be confronted, but that some leftists take themselves way, way too seriously on college campuses. I don’t even care about the open hostility- he’s just not funny. The only times he was even funny was his responses to jokes Felix started. 

Chapo needs to stop getting celeb guests to have celeb guests. You’re articulating reasons why deplatforming is good, so I feel you. I just feel like a lot of leftists are falling into it as a blind dogma. 

Like you said, you’d go to a Kissinger talk. I prefer protests to somehow give across a message at these talks that this person is actually a ghoul and a sick fuck rather than just being a deplatforming action without a coherent message all the guys that are very scared about white genocide on joerogan are saying this too. in that case, I think it's the crowd that Felix brought in initially already paid attention to Rogan for MMA stuff.he's cultivated quite a greasy look.I’d like to clarify that I’m not saying countries like the US and Canada are perfect, but in terms of the mainstream’s attitude right now, we are doing alright.I’m not saying have pancakes with him. Nazis don’t deserve to be debated but punched. I’m just suggesting sometimes you’re actually giving them more legitimacy by paying so much attention to them.I get so depressed sometimes about how capitalism appropriates everything and twists it to its own ends. I was in a group chat talking to some friends about how this type of corporate feminism where the point is “more women CEOs” is ruining the message of international women’s day and is fundamentally conservative. The libs just accused me of “hating diversity.” Jesus Christ.You’re not being a dogmatist because you are explaining your position,  but you must admit you’ve probably ran into people who do just say bash the fash as a dogma and apply no calculus at all. wow. until this point Schumer had been the perfect politian. my faith is destroyedurge to kill...risingThe Power of Nightmares is worth a watch, too.I guess a shorter version of my opinion is: I don’t think Trump is a good president at all, but IF he’s able to do this right and non-violently, I’ll admit that he did a good thing.See I’ve been seeing so much of this. Libs basically calling Trump a pussy because of the talks. It just.... I don’t know how they market themselves as the “better party”. I mean I know I’m beating a dead horse here but it quite literally is “we aren’t afraid to kill people at the same rate and intensity as conservatives, we just do it politer!” This thread leads me to believe that the serial killer remark was legitimate. https://mobile.twitter.com/railmag/status/941425306505793538Jokes on them, my org probably loses money to clients.Solidarity with Booty WipesDamn I criticized deplatforming last week on this subreddit and have been thoroughly proved wrong tbhReeeeee discussing tactics is reactionary reeeeeeeeFind a man who loves you as much as Spencer loves the Ethno-state.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJW67QN24SATell me more. I got into biking last summer. Playing around with a ride from NYC to Philly. Furthest I've gone so far is 35 miles, so quite a step up.Biking can be pretty low impact in a flat city like I assume Austin is. Biking is cool because you can control how hard you work, so if you're not in great shape just stick to easy, flat rides, and then as you inevitably get in better shape it's easy to find new fun routes to challenge yourself with. 

I also think it's a great way to see a city, really understand where you live. You get a perspective that's completely unique to any other mode of transportation.Admittedly this is basically the republicans saying the republicans got to destroy the last parts of the welfare on their own merit

In 30 years, some of these deep conservative places are going to be even worse off than they are now. And someone is going to question whether or not things could have happened differently. And everyone will guffaw at such a ridiculous question: “If Jesus didn’t want my daughter to be raped by a roving biker gang, and for it to be live-streamed across YouTube, she wouldn’t have been. If you don’t think that you are a communist pagan”

Honestly at this point my only hope is that we don’t kill too many people during our implosion. Hopefully there is still life on earth after we are done.

But I also think open borders (or more accurately the deconstruction of borders as a concept) is part of a socialist project. What makes you think that wealth redistribution needs to come before changing borders? I think you're probably right that this would drive a race to the bottom, and lead to even further inequality and poverty. I think this would ultimately be in the interest of capital, and so it seems likely to me that this is the path we're headed on. I think the contradiction in the capitalist system is going to be pushed further and further until it collapses. Open borders may be a part of that, if it means that people from wealthy countries are no longer shielded from the worst effects of capitalism the way (some people) are now.

I suppose I probably don't represent /r/neoliberal very well since I'm definitely to the left of the vast majority of the users there, but I'd definitely listen to you arguing with neoliberals for a few hours.Me, I'm working on building a union in the Canadian animation industry which hasn't had a union before. Laughing at CHUDS is just a hobby.You'll have to aggressively push socialist views in /r/neoliberal for a few months first like P_K.  They actually kind of like him at this point, at least as a change in perspective(and an actually well read socialist who generally argues in good faith, unlike a lot of others you might see online), so I think he actually has a shot at getting on.  I'd imagine they wouldn't let on some random socialist they don't know.We're working on that too. Our efforts are mostly in Vancouver, but recently there has been some activity in Ontario as well. If anyone wants to know more, we have a website at artbabbittsociety.com there's also a wage share site at animationwageshare.comYeah! He tipped themThe protest was March 5th through the 9thWhen I saw this, I was genuinely terrified that they got MBS to go on PSTW.

Jesus Christ, this was written less than a month ago. I figured it was written when he was in the Bush admin.Let’s start a pool:

Not including money already allocated how much more war debt will we create? 1.5 Trillion


I say over. 

War in Korea, Iran and we will start running night raids in California. According to Derek Davison, Bolton is a world-class ass-kisser. 

I envision him pushing out Mattis (who honestly is probably dovish comparatively) and sabotaging everything between The Koreas. 

Honestly low-key our trade war with China goes hot so I can at least see a nuke up close. Paid for by the My Lai Veterans for Truth PAC. Being called gay by one of the Village People is quite a thing.Her strength gives me strength. She and her supporters fought well, and now it'll be months instead of years- and she'll be attending university once she's out. YASSS BERNIE3 is Castro and 5 is LeninLeave Gun Jesus alone. Forgotten weapons is great.Isn’t the mad dog thing ironic because he’s very mild mannered and reserved?I wasn’t convinced Ian was a leftist but actually that sequel to the original has me actually convinced. He avoids politics on his channel but whenever it comes out he seems reasonable about gun control. It’s weird how right wing scumbags big up the FAL. He's stealing valor from Henry CavillFor most of my life, I was pretty politically naive, and I had about zero understanding of the Israel-Palestine Conflict, BDS, etc. I think growing up white, Catholic, and from the Midwest, you always just assume that Israel has always been Israel and no one bothers teaching you the history in that region. 

It's awesome to see these students organize and make a brave stance on an important issue because when I was their age I was just some pothead dipshit.Palestinians are just jealous because they don't have memorial trees that need waterHow can someone be into Molyneux is beyond me.Dude is a pompous bitter gas bag who has no idea what is he talking about 90% of the time.He has a profound hatred of women that is beyond anything I have ever seen.

There's nothing funny, interesting or even inspirational about that idiot./r/gatekeepingIan shitting on an anti-feminist in the comments of the first video. I love gun Jesus. The problem with the gun control debate is that many people advocating gun control simply don’t understand how guns work. I think magazine capacity limits and banning bump stocks makes sense, but the “assault weapon” ban is just politicians selling a red herring.

I had some liberal actually screaming at me in public because I asked him to explain what an “assault weapon” is and why it’s the most dangerous kind of weapon. He said because of the higher “barrel capacity.” When I said that’s not a real thing he genuinely said that I’m an idiot because it’s called an “assault” weapon so it must be more dangerous. 

He was a really weird dude. It was like a strawman made up person a conservative would draw in a political comic. Highly embarrassing because I had to ask him to keep his voice downLove to treat the working class like children who can’t be trusted. This is pure liberalism. Not being a liberal = brocialist to liberals pretending to be socialists Hell yeah dude, actually arguing the merits of gun ownership is just edgy LARPing. People of color and the working class have nothing to fear from police and have no reason to want to own a gun. (I’m a socialist btw and not a liberal teehee)The best part about this is people like Bolton are so plainly defense industry shills. Who aren’t doing things in the national interest but in the profit interest of the companies that fund their institutes and stuff. And those companies are deathly opposed to actual conflict with russia, China or other nuke powers. Not just because it could end all life on earth, but because it could mean they lose customers. 

So what he is really saying is we need a hawk so that hawks can kill all the third world doves. 

Maybe losing your job to a computer turns you into a Twitter shithead. I get what you’re saying but the purpose of comedy is just to be funny. I genuinely hate it when people turn comedy into some liberatory thingThis argument forgets that gun ownership isn’t just about facilitating some sort of proletarian insurrection. 

In any case you’re wrong that a guerrilla army could never defeat a technologically superior enemy. It’s happened so many times I don’t know why people keep trying to make this point. Can you explain what an “assault rifle” is and why it’s worse than all other classification of gun? Yeah sure I do too. You shouldn’t be able to hide behind “I was only kidding.” That being said, the most cancerous notion on the left regarding comedy is the idea that by satirizing a thing you are promoting the thing. It’s really a humorless position held by people who just don’t understand comedy Knowledge of the terrain helps but lots of guerrilla wars were domestic civil warsIt isn’t a moral question or a question of deserving. 

It is basic Econ 101- we have a consumer based economy, 45-55% of the economy doesn’t make enough money to save anything. I.e they couldn’t even make enough to actually spend the money they would want to spend. So if we want to grow the economy we need to put more dollars in their pockets. Well, so we want them to work more hours? 

Another way you can see how terribly our economy is regulated and run is that we keep hearing about companies investing.. but the reality is stock but-backs have never been as high as they are now. Which means they literally think it is a better investment for their core business to give money to investors than it is to say build a factory or do r&amp;d. 

The moment the minimum wage debate turns into about deserving is the moment they win. I'm embarrassed that I used to be a fan of his.Also, some libs have been parroting this, basically victim blaming black people for making racist whites scared, forcing them to buy guns.

https://twitter.com/metroadlib/status/977662433606160385Also I think people need to give him the benefit of the doubt. I think perhaps he may not have done his homework, and just wanted to get the idea of black gun ownership out there. Did he do it through the wrong channel? Fuck yes. Is the sentiment bad? Fuck no.As someone who falls under this umbrella, I fucking HATE this proposal. I’d rather not have cops kick in my door because of things I can’t control.https://twitter.com/tamicru/status/977561890560856064

Hot take: the Parkland group are fedsI really recommend reading that thread. While I’m not trying to discredit the movement, but the actual policies they want enacted are awful.Centipede.  I don't really know what it's supposed to mean.Everything was beautiful, and nothing hurtIn my opinion, that Kevin Smith tweet is one of the greatest tweets of all time. While I believe that Trump did some sort of gross sexual assault/power move to Daniels (although he didn't have sex because Trump is Incel), and he definitely paid her off. But do the #Resistance seriously believe that this will lead to his impeachment? Or are they just trying to own the President?

Rabidly anti Marxist-Leninist, you mean.  He's an ancom and hates authoritarian communists and goes all around reddit to places like ESS, neoliberal and drama/SRD to try to convince people that we need an anarchist society with gift economies.world class grifting skills Fleetwood Mac bangs and that album is flawlessHonestly, I haven't been to SRD or ESS in a long time either, so I'd just assumed you were still around there.  I concede that I was aware you're not active in drama anymore, but at any rate I just meant that you're definitely not anti communist, since you're sort of famous around non communist parts of reddit for being a defender of communism. No intentions of starting shit, honestly.  I'm not the type to go and manufacture my own drama.I don't understand how saying you hate Marxist-Leninists is inflammatory.  It's true, isn't it?

I expect the right wing media will comply with this. Why are Liberals so committed to calling Russians communist? There are real communists critiquing them, but they're not from Putin's bot farms. Yeah, that's what I figured. It's such a bizarre take for people who are nominally against McCarthyism to try to bring back the Red Scare.

We're artists. We shouldn't be a hierarchy.This is definitely something worth thinking about. I guess it could start with artists working on short projects together in between paying work and building a portfolio. 

Incidentally, If anyone wants a 2D artist for games, I'd be interested. I'm a storyboard artist by trade.

www.stevelecoui.com is where I keep my portfolio.I agree. We need to figure out a budget, allocation of resources, the scope of the project. A lot of the boring stuff will be the same as any other business venture. Resources include time and energy too. The point is to have a goal in mind and plan out the steps to get there.OK, let's take a step back. What is our pitch? How do we get people to volunteer their precious time and energy to this project?

I have a trade deficit with the local grocery store, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.

[This](https://politics.theonion.com/hillary-clinton-s-campaign-myth-vs-fact-1819592511) is pretty good too.  There are a few "people don't like her because she's a woman" type articles sprinkled in I think, but usually they were against her.Yeah I mean even the supposed pro clinton articles weren't really singing her praises as much as they were making fun of the sexism, which definitely did exist.I don't think you're wrong, but I seriously doubt the international left is in any state to perform more than a few terrorist strikes in the short term. I mean, how many lefties do you know that even own firearms, let alone perform military drills?

The Soviets took Nazi guns. I think you're on to something here, and that universal generosity makes a lot of liberals blind to the paradox of tolerance. They genuinely don't see that there is a moral difference between BLM and the Alt-Right.

Buckley.I think they've confused father and sonThe word for it is happy sadI know, you're right. Forgive me if I'm not fully up on my Marxist theory, but isn't "running out of other people's money" literally the condition for the collapse of Capitalism? Isn't that why we have Neoliberal Globalism? Because there aren't enough customers at home? And the reason the rich have bought up public infrastructure and consumed the machinery of democratic government? Am I nuts?Where is "here"?The damage an individual can do by eating a Big Mac at this point is equivalent to worrying about leaving the tap running on the Titanic. We're either utterly doomed (probably), or we will survive as a species due to massive institutional change on a global scale which will make individual choice utterly meaningless.

https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4826043.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/FrdUnjpeg.jpgI think my most "elitist" position is that I hate chain restaurants that serve $30-a-plate food and overpriced drinks. If I'm going to eat somewhere pricey, I don't want a prefab "experience", I want something I can't get other places. I'm looking at Earls, The Cactus Club, places where millionaire douchebags have business lunches.  Would rather eat fast food than overpriced wings. My real prejudice is the belief that there's an inverse relationship between how much money people have and how much taste they have. Human sexual selection is just about the freest "market" in existence.

Forget banning the age of concent. Ban sex completelyI don't see what's wrong here. You guys must have never seen a normal guy just being normal.I have seen this before and it is amazing. Also, Libertarians should learn how to read. The canon of Western literature stretching back to the Dark Ages is basically nothing but men whining about not getting laid. This is a good articulation of why the left needs to free idpol from its association with garbage liberalism. Also, thanks for the term "class reductionism". That'll come in handy.

Edit: Philosophytube is another good one to promoteI was thinking about that in relation to Jordan Peterson's fetish for pecking orders. Has that behaviour been observed in wild fowl? Or do animals devolve into violent heirarchical arrangements in captivity the same way humans do in prison?Paleocons and the Old Right were always anti-interventionist. Part of it was a dislike for military Keynesianism, they saw warfare and welfare enabling one another. Another part was a belief that wars were started by Jews and the Queen of England.&gt;A lot of times, those weddings are the only time a high number of targets are literally sitting next to each other.

This was an actual post on The_Donald.

and then youve got the chuds who say  "keep calling us retarded, see where that gets you" as they go ahead and do retarded things like murder and steal from the people who often have the worst of it.

(when has america fucked with a country that could reasonably fight back?) or when has a cop fucked with a rich white person who can use his power/influence to fight back rather than a poor black?When I was younger, maybe junior high, I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. SO when there i am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in, but Nick Mullen.

I was nervous as ****, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Nick, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Nick put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.Ask StalinThe account is run by a few of the regulars from /r/neoliberal.

so logically we should be against the united states intervention in syria, but im open to having my mind changed as i dont know much about situations like these.Lovecraftian demon go on chapoAt least most of the comments are saying he's bad, or at least he's no saint.B I K E L O C K is real life a jokeI guess the idea is that people will see that 200 million had been donated to it and feel like a lot of people are doing it.

if i have a billion dollars, and you have very little, we can both easily buy a coke. if coke gets cheaper, its a bigger deal for the poor man, his wealth has went up in a sense. if coke gets more expensive, the rich mans money is worth more.

I mean I know it's a garbage fire but it was a fun garbage fire.Alright so a boomer(afaik he's actually like 60)/trump supporter that used to be a regular there named ivankatrumpismywaifu got upset at /r/drama for dunking on him repeatedly(he was a really dumb chud, but what can you expect).  So this guy has been scouring all of the posts on drama for a while and reporting anything remotely questionable to the admins(mostly mean pings, but apparently joking about "mayocide" is a problem too) for the past few days, so the admins decided to crack down on some of the stuff they've been getting away with(mostly the brigading and kys pings).  As a result the mods are mad and made the sub private for the time being.  That's my understanding of it at least.Basically some boomer/trump supporter(named IvankaTrumpIsMyWaifu, who is mentioned in the message about going private) kept getting dunked on and freaked out and mass reported everything vaguely out of line and the admins banned like half the mod team and decided to be stricter about some of the stuff they do(kys pings and joking about killing white people) so the remaining mods made it private because they don't want to get banned.  Something like that at least.Not radical enough for most of the leftist subs(especially /r/anarchism  ) and he's a communist so the rest of reddit hates him by default(though funnily enough /r/neoliberal seems to like him fairly well).damn that guy looks like my cousin but like 100 pounds heavierI am sure there was probably some op-ed in Nazi Germany that even specifically was like at least this isn’t as bad a colonial British policy.

I'm still blown away by their deliberate misunderstanding of how health insurance works. "Why should I have to pay for other people's healthcare?" Because that's how insurance works? It's not an individual savings account any more than your car insurance is. They must know that. It's impossible that they have jobs and pay bills and can put together a shopping list and not understand that.  It happens so often it's a cliche. Reactionaries accuse anyone they disagree with of exactly what they themselves are doing. thats what the next movie is for. to show us why magic death spells beat guns with bullets during the great world war (i hope)/u/prince_kroptokin wow dude, shut this account down . youre a neoliberal sham&gt;I hated myself with all my soul.

He told me he has what he calls "buffers," or little drawers in his brain that he opens to retrieve conversations and correspondence from as long as 50 years ago. He told me he thought for a long time that everyone had this ability.

2014 was the best year for the internet, youtube especially tbqhyea its good to get everything cleared up.the vid can do better but there is mistruths from both sides, not many israelis will admit so many town massacres happened, with only one, i forget the name, being generally accepted, while this video alluded to multiple town massacres idk on the other hand op maybe the polls back then told the dems that kent state was okay, but nowadays we dont see kent state happeneing because public reaction would make it not worth pursuing cant tell if this is satire. feels legitperhaps because they want to paint genocide as a morally gray area otherwise it makes the us look bad (because its had its hand in many genocides)if that was the case then the elites wouldnt need to participate in such misdirection/distortions of the truth/. but who knows,maybe they dont. really interesting take nonetheless

where everytime the liberals (zion-ists) have woken up, they have been killed by the machine and the program reset?

how zion has awakend, rebelled, and been all killed by the machine (fascists) over and over again until the 8th iteration ,Neo, breaks the cycle?

i think liberals know deep down, as chomsky says, fascists will always win violent struggles and the smart liberals see how leftists are genocided all over the globe constantly , and so they have found this safety in liberals, where they arent radical enough to pose a through to the ruling class and be systemically wiped out by the right wing, always ready at a moments notice, to cleanse them.

now how many liberals are like this? i cant say. they cant all be evil capitalists, like the scum over neoliberal are, but yea, id hazard that most are strongly loyal to the middle class and capitalism not out of an actual attraction to the working class and just a fear to get killed, and its just an interesting pet theory i have for why some liberals choose to be liberal, on perhaps a subconscious level?


tldr/edit : so maybe , just maybe some liberals are just woke enough to realize that if they go too far left, fascism will fuck them up, so they just gravitate towards whats socially acceptable at the time , while pushing a few boundaries. that is, left wing capitalism aka liberalism.See this is exactly why this palace intrigue Trump has infected the entire internet drives me completely bonkers.

Brocial DemocratThis is like if Con Air was a reality show. C.S. Lewis held a lot of contradictory positions it seems, here he seems to be advocating for capitalism over socialism: 

“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”

― C.S. Lewisi guess that's better than 100%C.S. Lewis notwithstanding, I'm on board with radical Christianity as a concept. I grew up Evangelical, and while I'm not religious anymore, I see a lot of potential in the possibility of Christians embracing Marxism. It seems like there's a natural fit there which could be a great force for good. I don't know how liberation theology gets around this exactly, but it does.I don't think so either. My moral framework still comes from Christianity, so I still believe there is such a thing as good and evil, at least in the abstract, and that it is possible and even right to judge the system we live under in moral terms. Killing and exploiting people for profit is morally repugnant and I refuse to believe it is consistent with the teachings of Christ.I'm fine with that :) 

I dunno, globally, most people follow some form of religion. Setting ourselves against the 1% who control the economy is one thing, but trying to fight the 90% who believe in some form of god is another. Why battle on two fronts if we can have allies with such incredible influence?hahaha POOP

The Grapes of Wrath pushed me further left than I was before. I like Margaret Atwood quite a lot. She writes really interesting science fiction. The Handmaid's Tale is a feminist/anti-theocracy classic. Umberto Eco writes very intellectual historical fiction. Foucault's Pendulum stuck with me.

Edit: One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez invented the genre of Magical Realism and is a multi generational story about a fictional village in Columbia.I consider it The DaVinci Code for people who aren't idiots.If you want something light and pulpy but still pretty left, try The Nomad of the Time Streams, a trilogy of alternate history novels by Michael Moorcock. Hell yes, Moby Dick!The Nomad trilogy are kinda Steampunk before Steampunk was a thing. The first one, Warlord of the Air is about a world where WWI never took place and the British Empire remained global. The plot involves the revolt of the colonies led by a Chinese general against Britain's armada of airships.Oh OK, I guess "made Magical Realism famous in the English speaking world" is more accurate.

One day ill gather my remaining brain cells and do a leftist analysis of Zach Snyder and It will be over for you bitches.More like 8:30, goofs. Where epSuicide rates, hours worked and life expectancy are results of the same policing of gender that prevents men from seeing a doctor or telling their boss they need time off for fear of looking weak, or to use the most common attack on maleness, looking "feminine". Higher average sentencing for men stems from the other aspect of gender policing, the idea that men are innately more dangerous. A lot of the toxic aspect of gender comes from this policing. Men and women are made unequal under patriarchy precisely so that one group has a vested interest in maintaining that inequality. Policing of gender hurts women because it treats them as inferior, but it hurts men (is toxic) because anything a man may do that doesn't conform to a ludicrous and self-destructive ideal of masculinity is considered "feminine". The worst thing a man can be.   good praxiswhat is the IWW of lumpen?  cuz I am a criminal and not a workerI would say tobacco was the big issue when they realised they could get away with murder.300 is navy seal team six lead by the idealised bush president in a incredible battle against the perversion of the east, personified in a gay man, who wants to lead the USA in a path of polyamory, casual drug use ,homosexuality and acceptance of the disabled.All this is narrated by Fox News (Dilios , the half blind dude) who invents whole chunks of history so the rest of us forces feel compelled to fight harder.

The downfall of all of Snyder movies is that he tries to do some Verhoeven shit without the over the top brutal humor verhoeven uses to clue us in the absurd shit we are seeing.Watch man of steel and pay attention to the military and krypton.
The military personnel is  shown to be professional, brave and a complete danger to the civilians because they are incapable of fighting.All the most amazing techno fetishist hardware gets thrown away like toys creating massive civilian casualties, operators get destroyed mercilessly without any kind of respect.The military industrial complex shown as a farce trying to induce a false sense of security, our power diminished by these gods.

Krypton is a hyper specialised civilisation led by  pompous idiots who lead the planet into ecological catastrophe, their excuse:"we tried nothing and were out of ideas" who get deposed by a genocidal military dictator whose only solution is to do the thing they were doing wrong and doing it harder.This ecological collapse is mirror instantly when the action cut to earth.The first thing we see ? a burning oil platform.

The themes are left wing as shit.Even in BvS the whole thing is Mark Zuckerberg and a 3%er going against an immigrant because they are scared of him.

Ill stan for Snyder forever.Matt makes an interesting observation during a previous chapo ep about superhero movies.We have lost our capacity to believe we can make change happen so we give ourselves to superheros so they can enact and effect change.An example would be , Bezos to buy himself to the white house whilst being clapped by the liberal media, the middle classes .

In this movie superman appears and he is incredible limited in what he can achieve,he's not going to save you because he can't, he gets into a fight and levels a fucking city because that is what happens when violence starts and spirals out of control,.He also looks depressed as shit like half the movie.

For the true leftist experience in La Logs you would have to go to Vallekas.Math is anything but simply or easily defined you twat.Mindless rote application of formulas is not math  and sadly is a big part of engineering studies.

Fucking Dick Cheney has a body count in the millions and the cunt is a political science major.This is a fucking weird derail.Again it is and I acknowledge so but what does it have to do with math as a field ? Math is the single most abstract and mind bending shit you can be exposed to, It only further develops your capability to think outside the confines of what you can imagine.Most of the mathematical work related to many fields was laid out hundreds of years before even a single engineer had the idea to turn complex theory and postulates into wrench-like-formulations to hit problems with.Some of the control theory maths was developed hundred of years before it was needed.Luis aragones -&gt; Lenin

I still put some long slow distance to complement my anaerobic but it can be extremely unpleasant.5x5 or stronglifts and watch your jeans explode because your quads are gigantic now.
OR do full body routines when you are a beginner because the main trigger of muscle growth is stimulation so work everything everyday and work out your way to weiders or split routines after a while. 

The worst part is learning the exercises but half of them you already know thanks to cultural osmosis, the other half is making sure you pull with the appropriate body part ( someone insert a video of awful crossfit deadlifts here)That's the thing about average though. What does the distribution look like?I didn't make the starter pack and I think you missed the point - it's not saying Ghandi or MLK are liberal but that both individuals are subjects of liberal adoration because of their depoliticization and deracialization, making them more palatable. Most liberals make strong claims to Kings and Ghandis antiracism and strategies of nonviolence  w/o really understanding anything about either individual.  King esp has become a symbol of racial colorblindness in the liberal mind. And I agree that nonviolence is a legit tactic, def don't agree that it's the only legit tactic or that it's the language of the state. The state simply has a monopoly over violence.

This is some bullshit of the first degree and degrades your so far good post.

The gov has nothing to do with the sentence or allowing the gang rape of someone.Three judges in navarra gave that sentence ( no one allowed any gang rape) based on a wrong law that needs to be changed.The were found guilty of sexual assaults, they are under appeal, the DA wanted 21 years for them and still have another trial pending.

You are using the gang rape of someone to justify defining the state as fascist ( I disagree but whatever) when there's more clear and good examples.

This shit has nothing to do with Catalonia or fascism, and everything with the definition of sexual assault and rape.Meat Popsicle 2020it will be a good day when Netanyahu is rotting in an early grave"to allowing the gang-rape of a women because she was too scared to protest".

You wrote this.


Dude this shit happens and worse in "normal" countries.Any agent of authority can get away with whatever the fuck they want. NYPD agents use to be able to rape people whenever,MET police have some of the itchiest triggers in these hemisphere.Yesterday saw the Victorian police kick the shit out of immobilised people, or the western Australia police letting a detainee die in confinement of thirst, the FBI has spent years creating false terrorist plots, the iceland government fell after it was discovered that they were covering child rapists ( this is some qanon shit).When you are authority you can get away with it as long as no one records it on video.

Also they were detained 4 hours after the gang rape, they have spent the last two years in prison, they have been sentenced to 9 in jail, DA has already appeal the decision because he wants to go for the full 21 years, and they have another trial pending.

That's a fucking weird  way of getting away with it.They are not getting the complete package not because they are cops/ military, I'll remember you they were 5 people, 1 minor included, who all had the same sentence.They got away with it because they were men , and a technicality appeared to save their asses.

And it's a rotten state, but the weaponization of sexual assault and rape culture you made is wrong.Rape culture exists everywhere, it's universal and barely has anything to do with any catalonian situation, waaaay better countries than Spain have problems with rape culture, throwing it out there in the same paragraph with genuine political grievances is just wrong.




Don't get me wrong, it is a fair point to dig into this horrible act and what's worse the sentencing but this rape culture shit is everywhere, I catch myself sometimes thinking about awful shit and playing devil advocate mentally, I don't joke around rape and derivatives anymore so that's a good step I guess.Spain lags behind a lot of countries in the usage of consent concepts and general ideas of consent and what's acceptable but ,travelling and living abrooad I've come to realise this shit is everywhere.

And for all that matters I think the reaction to the sentence from the general public gave some hope ( if you venture into spanish forums you'll be appalled at the shit you can read) plenty of demonstrations and demonstrators from both women and men.There's some good there.
And to be honest I could be wrong in my analysis as long as we all learn something no need to apologise.

Any episode recommendations?Hey Pie Slayer. 

I identified with a few of the feelings you wrote about, and thank you for sharing them. It can be scary to talk about feeling alone, and exposing that vulnerability. 

I think a lot of young folks struggle with feeling disconnected and lonely. It's important to remember it's not just you, it's conditioned by the structures of our society. 

I recently moved to a new place, and met a bunch of great people through my local DSA. It's been a lifesaver for me. Hell, a bunch of them are fellow greywolves. Is anything like this available where you are?I'm glad to hear it. DSA is doing good work, and can connect you with folks you have a lot in common with. 

Tim Faust was in town recently for an event that our DSA chapter put on, and I got to meet him because some friends from the group put him up for the night. I'm a huge health policy nerd so basically a dream come true for me. he gets very upset when I refer to people by their race or talk about anything politics related so my gut is telling me Malcolm X's auto is the last thing he'll ever read : ' ( obvious you communist beta's are too brainswashed by your leftwing humanities departments and disdain for the jungian lobster archetype to actually comprehend the brilliance of dr.peterson.

Yeah sure, doubling the minimum wage overnight will fuck shit up, just implement it slowly enough. Most Canadian provinces are gonna have $15 minimum wages by 2021. Secondly, sure I would be down for different minimum wages dependent on cost of living too. Purchasing power is definitely something that needs to be considered when evaluating a minimum wage. The UK has separate minimum wages,  London has a £2 higher wage compared to the rest of the country. I'm surprised that people still tip even with servers getting the same wage. I mean, customers shouldn't have to subsidize an employee's wage... That's why we would want servers to get the same wage, so we can eliminate tipping as a practice.&gt;[Media personality] exercised [his/her] free speech and [media network] decided to continue their free association.

Fine with me. Batman is way badass.RADICALIZE THE HOGGIs it Monday anywhere in the world right now?The same could have been said for Watergate. I don't see how in either case it's even remotely related to the illegality of what may have happened or the value in investigating it.

I mean, I totally get libs overreacting and hysterically reimagining the FBI as some kind of perverse savior. I also get that the media obsession isn't helpful and distracts from a lot of other issues. But the idea that it's "bullshit" or made\-up or isn't worth investigating is just crazy. Even if the Trump organization merely knew about Russian meddling and refused to disclose it to the FBI would be a crime. The fact that so many of Trump's direct subordinates lied to investigators (and Congress) about multiple meetings with Russian agents means that this (if not something more) is very likely. Which is to say a nothing of campaign finance violations and obstruction of justice charges, which seem almost certain at this point.

The impact on the election is both unknowable and completely immaterial to investigating a President who may be guilty of treason and obstruction of justice.Also a [great song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYfJuW282_I).Holy shit that guy is obsessed with Bernie.

Who is the Red Sox reliever David and Matt were talking about? Hahah that’s who I’m thinking, tooWhat we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by “leftism” will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology. (Also, see paragraphs 227\-230.)What does acab mean lol 

(Fuck cops and their enablers)HOW DARE YOU NOT SUPPORT FACISM LITE IN THE FACE OF FACISM!!if you were not born as a cop-killing anarchist, the left has no use for you



evolving politically is fascism, sorry to ruin your "fun"Just being honest. I watched the full first season and gave it a chance. But more often than not it seemed more like the creators were more committed to the cultural principle of a show like Sense8 existing than they were to actually making a good show.

And it's not totally bad. The acting and cinematography in the first season were both great. But you can't really build a show around that alone.

As for /r/samharris, I'd urge against stooping to their level of using someone's posting history as an excuse for not engaging ideas you don't like. Well, no.

First of all, if they uncover legitimately new facts that wouldn't have seen the light of day otherwise, it's not just "theater".

As for whether any "good" can come from it -- I don't think that's knowable. And it's probably not true. My understanding is that they've already uncovered things about a particularly nasty corner of international lobbying and influence-peddling that wasn't widely known before. Now, it's possible that shit might just sink to the bottom again and disappear, without anyone doing anything about it -- quite possible -- but I doubt it. While it's true that the Democrats and the DOJ likely won't do anything useful with it, a lot of what the investigation has turned up will end up in the hands of people who can make sense of it, dig deeper, and get some information out of it. bottom text?This guy's star can't get any brighter and has to start waining, right?

You're hilarious.Liberals have spent so many decades being terrified of being accused of being weak on national defense that they now reflexively identify their interests with the program of the security state. Even a largely symbolic move like this looks like an "opportunity" for them to be "strong".Don't they have TV in South Korea?The funny thing is, considering the Kim family's obsession with Hollywood, this approach is probably far more persuasive than actual diplomacy.You know, maybe we could hold join military exercises *with* North Korea off the coast of Canada.

Go on, boy!do you mean in a "just respect women bro" sort of way, or an "abolish gender stereotypes" way?I was getting that vibe from some of their songs, too! In previous albums, they have songs like “Pretty Machines” where they comment on living under the overwhelming consumerism and materialism of late-capitalism. Or “Careers in Combat” about the lack of career opportunities for Americans, but there will always be jobs in the military.Drill Juche Gang confirmed "no democracy only uprising" the extremely online ML screamed into his monitor.

We lost in Iraq and Saddam didn’t even think we were serious about invading. 

We lost in Afghanistan. 

If we invade Iran, a country that has been building defense into every part of their country for the last 40 years, I don’t think we can win. Unless we use nukes.

In a democracy you are supposed to represent the interests of your constituents. If you are getting elected and then using your power to represent the interests of whoever pays you the most, then you are betraying both your constituents and the principles which got you elected in the first place.

This is a no-brainer if you apply it to literally any other situation.

Suppose I hire a realtor to represent me in buying a house. The realtor's job is to represent my interests as a home buyer. But now let's say that the realtor gets paid under the table by a seller and a corrupt housing inspector to lie about a property and sell me something that's isn't worth what I pay for, and which has dozens of undisclosed problems that they cover up. The realtor is just looking out for himself -- he's doing what gets him paid -- but you can't deny that he's also betrayed me as a customer and that what he's done is wrong.

Of course, all of this assumes that you believe that democracy is a good thing. If you instead believe that some sort of libertarian corporate feudalism is preferable, that's fine, but don't say you believe in democracy and think this is how a democratic government should operate.The fact that political representatives are in no way tied to their platforms and can't be recalled is absurd in and of itself.Dallas has its mix.

b. Democrats don't have a problem with being a permanently feckless opposition party which just vacuums up donor money without having to govern, take risks, stand for anything, or represent the interests of actual human beings.

Neither is true. But if that's depressing, look at it this way: they would be sure to do nothing with their power even if they did win (indeed, they've already said they won't impeach Trump).

From their perspective, it's not "eating shit" at all. We're the only ones who eat it.Hey man idk what you're talking about but Heelys were and are radical bro

We just happen to live in a period where the most vocal critics of religion also happen to be unblinking apologists for global capital, imperialism, and the authoritarian security state. It doesn't make criticism of religion invalid. It just means you have to not be a reactionary about it.

I mean, it's kind of ridiculous. People like Sam Harris rend their garments over innocent people killed because of religious ideology, but people killed for profit don't seem to cost him a minute of sleep, nor deserve a moment's notice on his podcast.

I'm reading Michener's book on Poland atm and I just finished the chapter that contained the most coverage of Jan Sobieski III, and I'm getting onto the partition you've been commenting about now. That's some seriously tragic stuff, and whatever we may see and say about Poland today, it's hard not to admire and be inspired by the immense power of the pride of the Polish people that managed to reassemble their nation.Not really surprising that older Polish people would support fascism, historically Poland's elite did a great job of convincing their peasants that only the magnates could lead the country and should disregard the words of anyone lower.AOC could hit it from the backSame.

It's like we have the Iraq war; the way they tried to spin mass surveillance; the way they reacted to getting pretty openly played by the pentagon by using "retired" generals; the financial collapse and the selling of poor americans as taking advantage of wall street;the selling of austerity; how the fuck they talk about paul ryan and these are just the highlights.

Super into this idea. I was part of a Capital reading group with a couple other people in school. It's valuable, and I'd like to do it again.

I'd say there should be someone with a moderator kind of role to announce readings for each week. Sometimes we will want to do more than one chapter - when they are short, and cover the same or related concepts. Sometimes one chapter will be long and difficult and sticking to one will be important. What do these guys even do?As per union grievance procedure: everyone direct your tweets to Virgil Texas.#saytheirnamesI think this assumes the American state is homogeneous. 

The CIA, DIA and NSA are always going to be capitalist. And they arent going anywhere anytime soon. "Not existing" isn't in the cards, so what we "deserve" here hardly matters. The Amazon will dry up and ferns will grow in Antarctica before humanity goes extinct.

The first few chapters of Capital are some of the hardest Marx to read. He's laying out his theory of commodities and value - the basis for his later discussion of how this shapes larger forces in the system. He's entering into arguments with other economists about these ideas, and this is part of what makes it confusing for the vast majority of us who haven't read their work as well.

I'd recommend that folks check out the David Harvey lectures series on this. He breaks it down chapter by chapter - but the videos are long and in-depth. He's the pre-eminent scholar on Capital, and has led group reads with an amazing variety of people.

Capital is tough but worth it. He really makes you read it on his terms, bouncing from technical economic jargon to lengthy real-world examples, to descriptive prose. Making it through the first couple of chapters is the hardest part.Hug your local trainHim and Chief Hopper.

Edit: I am Aware that Hopper is an active Cop, but, when you are dealing with Eltrich Horrors that keeps trying to take over and destroy all that you know, bickering over class is the last thing we need to do. My teacher liked to tell us about Reagan's speech about "Perhaps we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bond." and he would tell us behind closed doors in the USSR, Gorbachev gave the same kind of speech. 

Coming into contact with non-terrestrial life, which possibly has a great chance of being hostile would imply a lot of problems we will have to set aside. We would have to redirect out xenophobia to the literal Xenos. Profit? Sorry kid, we need more fucking guns or WE ALL DIE.

This joke is (extremely)....good?????Top left would be written in Vietnamese thoInteresting that there is no mention of private prisons. In the beginning they'd send them into battle unarmed. They had to capture their weapons. Even their explosives were made from undetonated US bombs that someone had to take apart knowing they could easily die in the process. The US could have fought that war for a century and still not won.

Again, my mistake.

As for the two specific points about the VC -- I believe these come from Robert Taber's *The War of the Flea* or possibly Morrison's *The Elephant and the Tiger*.

Edit: Found it -- yes, it is from *War of the Flea*, but quoting I.F. Stone:

*"Often a Viet Cong unit is organized initially with no weapons. The political organizer tells his men and women they must fight at first with handmade arms -- spears, daggers, swords, and crude shotguns. To get better weapons, the unit must capture them from the enemy."*

Taber attributes the quote to Stone's Bi-Weekly of 13 May, 1963.Stop being poor milo.

This is some classic troll shit.Both anti-NAFTA but not for the same reasons or principles.&gt;A migrant mother and her lawyers allege that substandard care at a detention facility run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement is to blame for her toddler’s death six weeks after their release.

&gt;Yazmin Juarez, 20, and her 18-month-old daughter, Mariee, came to the U.S. from Guatemala via the Rio Grande, according to CNN. Juarez sought asylum and was detained by ICE agents. She and her child were placed in the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas.

&gt;Juarez’s lawyers say Mariee contracted a respiratory infection at the center, which "went woefully under-treated for nearly a month." Juarez sought treatment for her daughter and was prescribed medication that her lawyers say did not help her daughter.

&gt;Upon their release, Juarez and Mariee flew to New Jersey to be with Juarez’s mother. Mariee was then hospitalized for respiratory failure and died six weeks later in Philadelphia, according to CNN.

&gt;"A mother lost her little girl because ICE and those running the Dilley immigration prison failed them inexcusably," the law firm told CNN. "We are working with Yazmin and her family to obtain justice for the failures by ICE and others, and to ensure that no other family suffers such a needless and devastating loss."

&gt;"ICE is committed to ensuring the welfare of all those in the agency's custody, including providing access to necessary and appropriate medical care. Comprehensive medical care is provided to all individuals in ICE custody,” ICE said in a statement to The Hill.

&gt;The revelation comes amid increased scrutiny over ICE regarding its role in the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, which led to the separation of thousands of children from their family at the U.S. southern border.

&gt;“Abolish ICE” has become a rallying cry among the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, but a poll released Monday shows only a quarter of all Democrats actually support eliminating the body.Is this what Dinesh D'Souza was talking aboutEveryone knows that you go into incognito mode on your work phone, one night late at a motel in Tulsa.

But it turns out- these sick globalists have infiltrated xvideos, redtube, pornhub, beej.com - george soros and the deep state have really done it this time- that hot woman is a chick with a dick. And yea you cum to it and yea you bookmark it but you did it mostly because of their feminine features not because of the dick so its completely normal guy stuff.

"You can't be mad at us anymore. We apologized by making our toxic fandom even more toxic" The best part of this is literally musk is doing this because he knows that even if he is exactly caught out lying financially it would be disastrous for Upworth to sue and negligible for musk to lose completely. My only thing here is like let’s raise taxes on millionaires + billionaires. 

Like we can tax them to death (hopefully literally) and what are they going to say, Little Jeff Bezos only made $35 Billion this year? The republicans have now opened an opportunity for the left to restructuring the tax code as crazy progressive. 

Pelosi isn’t smart enough to outsmart Trump, we will be fine. I just think some people are worried about trump doing something really stupid and resigning- he seems genuinely unstable. And this is for people to pull out later and be like see! See! Sir, sir, do you see?

When it’s like well yea I disagreed with trump did you see the ICE uniforms? No room for service ribbons, just awful. 

And or, people were getting blue balled on tinder and this was like an office writing party so everyone could point to it and finally bust a nut. But everyone can say it was them

EDIT: and you are assuming the person who wrote this is genuine - which to me is dubious at bestThat's for letting me know that existsYung Beto SKKKERRRITBeto is for M4A or Universal HC. Whatever gets though he will vote for. Forgot to mention he has actively said he wanted to out Pelosi as house minority leader. So, there is that. He is refusing PAC money. OP is wrong. Oh hey, literally everyone in congress is on that list.  It’s worth noting good Dems over shit Dems regardless. Maybe some day we will get to the point where Pelosi Dems are the right wing but for now, as a Texan, I will gladly vote for Beto because people in my state need someone that will vote to get them healthcare. We are the least insured state in the country, that must be fixed.Good. Fuck that Place. The_Donald Next.most users on there are ethnic tbqhGod that's awesome.Race is a bourgeois fiction invented to divide the working class against  itself. If you have any doubt, then look no further than the reactionary working-class whites who can be baited and bidden by race to act like dogs at the slightest urging. My cousin loves to defend cops in cases like this, "He had pot in his apartment, he was committing a crime anyways". If you want to live in a country where police do extrajudicial executions of people and everyone is guilty till proven innocent, then she can kindly fuck off and go back to Iran. R u saying the average chapo is FBI or that I am FBI????????that's nice but have u considered that we live in a society Speaking of slurs, why are they mostly just uninventive anglicizations and nicknames of the politically correct word? The n-word is the anglicization of the Spanish word for black. A slur for Japanese people? Just remove the last two letters of "Japan." A slur for transgender people? Make it a sport nickname.

Conservatives really are the most uncreative people in the world.Obviously it's not true in humans, particularly not working-class Americans and their Stockholm-syndrome fetish for celebrity, wealth, and ostentatious displays of power.I think there are a few problems here. Although there a lot of good points here too. But you're asking about the problems, so I'll rattle off a few that come to mind.

First, fascism requires an individualized identity between oppressed and oppressor in a way that's either difficult or counterproductive to do under colonialism. Under colonialism you have masters and subjects organized along national, ethnic, or cultural lines. Moreover the subjects usually retain some identity for themselves, particular with respect to how they relate to the colonial powers. But under fascism you have a "personal relationship" as a citizen with your state, or your leader, or your party, sort of like how evangelicals have a "personal relationship" with God. It's an individual will subordinated to an individual (in the sense of being undifferentiated) power *sans* the intervention or mediation of civil society. So people *identify* with Trump as representing a "real America" -- in spite of and not because of the Republican Party. It's individualized. And that's structurally very different from the colonial experience. It has that cult of personality element.

That sort of segues to the second difference -- fascism eliminates (or tries to eliminate, or barring that, infiltrate) civil society in a way that colonialism doesn't. Colonialism is indifferent. Colonialism takes the attitude, for example, that the Americans take to the *shuras* in Afghanistan: if they can use them to co-op the Taliban, they will. If the *shuras* get in the way -- well, then we'll just label them as insurgents and kill them. It's strictly utilitarian. But what they're *not* doing is seeing the *shura* as an existential threat to absolute loyalty to the state, the leader, etc. *That* is fascism.

The last thing I'll mention is that colonialism, at least historically, usually rests upon some sense of universalism. There might be hierarchies within that univeralism but it admits of no true "others", just unintegrated subordinates, for which there is a positive (if also exploitative and self-serving) moral duty to conquer and govern. Fascism is much weirder, though. Its "in group" isn't a ruling class that has moral obligations to an "out group" according to some ideal, shared, rational society, but is a homogeneous core (often conceived along quasi-mystical lines where the leader or the party is an almost supernatural manifestation of the "volk") where the "out group" is radically foreign and dangerous, and which is severed from the whole with this kind of nihilistic schism which is borderline psychotic. This is why under fascism you can get ideas like *Lebensraum*. Anyone in your way can just be exterminated if they don't happen to share whatever mystical in-group trait that's been selected.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that the difference between colonialism and fascism (in this respect) is a little bit like the [difference between narcissism and sociopathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dv8zJiggBs). A narcissist will lie to you, exploit you, and disregard your humanity -- but they'll still feel bad about it later, and if there's any way for them to get what they want without doing it, they'll probably try. But a sociopath straight up doesn't care. Your personhood doesn't even really register on the radar there. And nor does it register to fascists.Clearly human civilization is doing something right.I don’t get these...

Why can’t both be true?I wasn't planning on getting an etymology lesson on my smart-ass quip but yeah, it's definitely the usage and connotations of the word which assign it that power.What's funny to me is that they're even trying anymore. Trying to uncover actual facts, however thoroughly manipulated and edited, is itself pre-post-truth.I get the joke. Trump sucks dick tho. Out with the old boss in with the new uncouth boss.

Why not occupy a highway? If suburbanism is the problem, then it's also the solution. Civil disobedience in or around a major transit corridor would be more crippling and more visible than waving signs around in an urban plaza that people can choose to ignore.I dunno. I'm an immigrant and immigrants up here were the ones who elected Rob Ford. Then his brother used that political leverage and is our premier now. Now Doug Ford is fucking ruining Ontario. Overturn Roe v Wade and you will have those numbers in a heartbeat.Yeah, but the women in blue states won't be safe, is the point. Obviously you can drive a bulldozer over the millions of marginalized women already living in red territory where abortion is socially stigmatized, unaffordable, and effectively outlawed. I agree.

But urban women on the coasts being told that something that was totally normal for their entire lives being taken away? Bricks will be shat and rightfully so. Particularly once social media starts highlighting stories where women are jailed for or die from illegal abortions. It will definitely be a mobilization opportunity.Correct. These would have to be large marches 10,000 to 100,000 people. Basically big enough that no individual person would fear going to jail.I mean, I could go all jaded'er-than-thou, I guess, but honestly I think people can and will get moving once skin is in the game for people who aren't used to having it in the game.Why not? There are people getting locked up over climate change. There are people getting locked up over gas pipelines. People in North Carolina were getting locked up weekly simply because they thought the state government was shite. Take away a civil liberty that's been a rallying cry for two generations and you're saying there's no chance people will get off their asses?

I think people would have to actively fuck up to miss that opportunity.

Either that or the enemy would have to be pretty smart in how they went about it -- e.g., if they left the coasts out of the enforcement zone even after the law was overturned for the first decade or so and criminalized abortion gradually. Basically an extension of what they're doing alrady. They could probably keep people home that way.People saw stuff like this. And she lost.

Pre-Revolution, the insane gringo markup on illegal drugs.

Post-Revolution, having my property confiscated and forced to sit through hours of fucking truth and reconciliation commission testimony.

Uphold ciderwhat if instead of boys rock it was boys rock and it was just boys rocking their fathers in a sexual manner.Short term, it means that any of the Mueller shit could get derailed by the SC if it ever gets that far. Roe is very potentially on the chopping block. Also means that challenging any overreach of executive power within the court system is pretty much dead at this point... although considering the previous composition of the SC ruled that corporations were people, that Americans could be spied upon, and that citizens could be assassinated by the military provided they weren't on American soil... I'm not sure there was much keeping executive power in check since the Bush administration. So fuck it.

Longer-term, it means the Supreme Court is now explicitly a partisan body based on the spoils system. If the White House manages to purge the FBI, it would basically mean the major judiciary and law enforcement institutions in the United States are now partisan bodies loyal to the autocrats du jour. Basically we no longer have an independent judiciary. We haven't for some time, but now it's explicit. I would not be surprised to see pressure for judges to step down or other ways of purging them at the start of new administrations. 

Meta-term -- the Supreme Court always kind of sucked and relying on them to keep the powers that be in check was always a losing proposition and a liberal wet dream. Same for the FBI, Mueller, etc. The only way this ever gets better is by burning tires in the street and shutting shit down.read the bread booksmoke meth and roundhouse her phoneAnyone have a link to that 2014 Jacobin article?wtf is leftist watch lmfaooo#relationshipgoals 😍😍🙏🙏that's nice but have u considered that we live in a society This is probably a bad time to learn that eco-fascism is a thing.


["You can't love your nation without loving our mother earth. Period"](https://i.imgur.com/2pFaOTv.png)Any screaming about overpopulation is the perfect synthesis of neoliberalism and fascism: kill the poor to pay for the decadence of elites. The facts are clear, the richest 10% of people make up 49% of CO2 emissions. meanwhile the bottom 50% of the world is responsible for only 10%.

I know that feel. I found my home with some like minded folk but there's so much centrist and neocon drivel it hurts.With some exceptions, the Green Party in the USA is a bad joke. If they actually wanted power, they'd run in local races in single party democratic run areas. Instead, they want to showboat so they run a presidential candidate every four years promising that THIS TIME, they'll totes get &gt;5% for realsies. They always fail. Also, if the PA Green Party was a republican cutout, I'm sure they're not the only one. I'm glad there's only one of those insufferable chuds in my faculty, I'm in a group chat with him as I have a class with him and I roast him constantly to do my part.

Yeah the pure sniff ideology is pretty tough to get through, especially when Kissinger was required reading in Intro to Geopolitics. What's worse is that the future lanyard neocon girls in Model NATO at school are dimes and a half.

bring out the existential memes Yes come help daddySometimes I hate liberals more than right wingers or fascists. The latter shows it's ugliness proudly, the former hides it behind pseudo compassion and empty individualist platitudesy u going then broThis is exactly my issue with it. I feel like my therapist is constantly trying to sneak in a very individualized / liberal world view onto me. As if liberalism is some kind of milestone for personal growth and development. It could also just be that psychotherapy is inherent liberal and so I project that onto my therapist. I've brought this up many times but my shrink neither confirms nor debies this For sure. Psychotherapy has been really helpful for me in learning to manage my emotions and undergo a lot of personal growth. And liberalism / individualism dosent have to become your mindset , its just in my case it seems to be what my T is going after Lenin &gt; Lennon wut about more lesboThat princeling has never worked a day in his life.
