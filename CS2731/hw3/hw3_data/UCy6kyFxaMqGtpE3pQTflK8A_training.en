alright Jim Carrey is nearly here at
took me 25 years I've been a fan of Jim
Carrey since I first saw him in the club
to see is that a legendary career he's
got a new series on Showtime called KITT
Wow we don't usually get to plug
Showtime that shows what an icon you are
it's called kidding it starts Sunday Jim

it's great to see you in front of a
microphone oh man happy to be here
really I love you so much oh thank you
to this show forever
oh absolutely admire what you do well it
took me forever to get you here but I
know what would happen if I had to start
reading yeah waiting from your pretty
eye I would always wait for you I've
been a fan of yours I tell you since I
saw you the first time I ever saw you
you didn't act and you didn't even speak
you just did impressions with your face
that's right yeah that's right and I
said this guy yeah it started early when
I saw a Golden Pond when I was a kid I
was the theater and I was like I didn't
know I was doing it I saw myself in a
shop in a shop window and I went wow
that's his face it came from the inside
I by the way I have to tell you the
story but we auditioned the same night
at the Comedy Store for Mitzi oh come on
years ago years ago well you audition
certainly it was years ago Jim
that's the new school of thought all
time happens to okay well yeah I never
was you were enacted to cover that is my
Hilde and I suck right yeah I didn't
make it past so tight you got rich you
were regular and stuff I got up there
and the microphone fell apart in my
hands the first thing that happened you
know it's gonna be one of those nights
right even I ran past me it's C back to
Canada for two years I you know I've
noticed you know we're both around the
same age and you're a little younger but
as time goes by I noticed your mind
really moves the furniture I don't think
that was me I think you're transferring
them oh really
yeah I don't I never I never you're
thinking of Greg Kinnear no you're a
young Lamar I don't remember ever doing
one of the confident or I'm glad your
memories of my life are better than my
own beautiful you know I've seen you in
so many movies and one way I judge
actors is by like I look at a pardon ago
yeah he did great in that part could
anybody else do it and usually the
answer is yes sure
would you a lot of times Ace Ventura no
secret is making the wrong choices but
committing completely no I don't think
you have my favorite movie and I love
many of them is cable guy oh thank you
Mabel guy and Truman Show and I feel
like they should be on a film festival
together there's something about them
that is very prescient about the way the
world came to be absolutely you think
they are we are parentless we are
babysat by the television we're taught
how to think by the television that's
the dangerous time I think about what's
going on right now there's an there are
there are generations growing up right
now who are learning to lie the lying is
okay yeah that this kids a fake news
that you're supposed to hate half the
country well and if anything if anything
we've got to get back to a place where
we realize that a vote is not who you
are you know and and because you voted
looking you're not stupid you're not
different you're not worthless you know
I could break bread with anybody who
voted for Trump we could find some
common ground to love each other true
just stop doing stupid we expect
all right so get it together so let's
plug your show yes why this character
this hitting shot called kidding well
you know these sly like mr. Rogers yeah
guy who I think the show is really
interesting because first of all I get
to work with Michel Gondry again which
is a you know who did was a dream the
first time and a dream come true again
what movie was a China okay but yeah it
was a beautiful experience and it's
about a guy in it's about it's about
love being hit by lightning I mean this
this is about a gentleman whose heart is
so big and and his his approach is so
authentic
that it's undeniable when you come in
contact with them when he that sounds
like you I always thought well I was
thought of you as a seeker yeah you were
like you are always seeking something
right yeah you're not always happy no
I'm not always happy that's for sure
happy is the weather and sunny place
seeker let the flowers grow bro you know
because it's hard to find what you're
looking when it's deep yeah and and
basically I've learned how to and I am
as angry and caught up in this stuff as
anybody out rage it's like a carpet
bombing of outrage that's happening I
see it in your art absolutely you know I
first serious I didn't realize until I
saw you on Jerry Seinfeld's coffee show
yeah when you what he was at your studio
what a great artist you are and now I
see it all the time on social media
because it took me only show you a few
of these okay show they like this I love
this one of trunk
know that that's Ryan and Nunez are the
flying monkeys okay
perhaps I wasn't detailed enough to and
then Lincoln is then there's my Lincoln
curry didn't Lincoln symbolize I love
that because Trump is always the
president that actually you know had the
worst tribulations our country has ever
faced and brought us together now the
opposite is happening right now we have
a president who started out when the
country was together and it had a
wonderful leader and he is tearing us
limb from limb
well destroying every institution let's
let's talk about this Donald Trump you
know we don't want to let's bringing on
the panel he's a car salesman he's a
user Congress absolute and he's you know
he didn't he didn't make America great
again but he did turn back the odometer
[Applause]
where the backseat right right as I
watched this week what I kept thinking
was it all comes down to this case of
narcissistic personality disorder we've
all talked about it since you've been on
the public scene but we see it in real
time somebody really unravelling
spiraling toward madness so I know there
was a tape of him talking to Bob
Woodward right we heard that this week
at the end of it he gets a little
frustrated and he says well accurate is
that nobody's ever done a better job
than I'm doing as president he says how
can you what travel what demolition man
is clean a couple of its enclosure
couple of weeks ago he gave himself an
A+
you saw that even if you thought these
things you to say them out loud as often
as he does his trick right I mean he
kind of says these things that are so
outrageous over and over and over again
until eventually people think that there
must be something there right that even
if it's not you know even if he's not
worth 10 billion dollars he must be
worth like 1 billion dollars as opposed
to you know a few million or it was
supposed to being in debt a few million
right everybody ordered a hundred and it
was worth five right so that's the ratio
of truth to is 20 to 1 okay
it's 20 to 1 man when you have the
disorder you know like when his like I
was saying before his whole his personal
cabinet now has turned on him the person
with this disorder is never gonna go
maybe it's me buddy is saying you know
but you know the one not everybody sound
like Trump now everybody saying yeah
people are saying receiving end of one
of the Tantrums I met with him twice and
would you do well I told him no three
times it was face he took it well the
first time it was the second and third
times he didn't take it so we're in over
the health care issue and I tried to
explain him what I thought with problems
with a bill on Medicaid exchanges and
Planned Parenthood and in the time I the
second time I told him he said well are
you are you I told him I was opposed at
the bill and he said why so this is on a
Thursday I said well he said why I said
well be for the same reasons I told you
on Tuesday two days before and I said
went through the issues and he cut me
off and he said you're gonna destroy the
Republican Party
you know the tax reforms gonna go down
and it's just you're gonna destroy the
Republican Party because he couldn't
remember what you said on Tuesday no
because it because I want for the health
care bill he said way to take down my
wife my finally interrupted him after
about you know it seemed like gone
forever this was in the Cabinet Room
getting getting you know getting that
late into here
that's mr. president you tell him he did
this you said mr. president yeah as an
affirmation the health care bill didn't
pass and I said are you telling me if we
don't pass this health care bill in this
form we're not gonna be able to tax a
form because the baselines not low
enough
that's exactly right when you lose you
lose and off he went again and they're
in a whole room everybody says yes lean
yes if you lied to him and then he comes
back to me at the end you still hard no
I'm still no mr. president goes off of
me again and then I said well mr.
president and he's I'm talking to you I
don't hear any more from cloud ignore
Trump for a week no I had a girlfriend
one time long time ago and we're having
problems I went to therapy and and and
and the and the therapist said sounds
like your girlfriend's a little bit
borderline personality and she's you
know a narcissist and whatever and and I
said well maybe if I just you know find
a different way to intellectualize or
get used to what she's saying and I
could you know my comebacks would be
different and that I could just accept
the fact she's gonna be a dick every
once in a while whatever and she said
please do please please try for a week
to ignore and not react to these buttons
that are being port orders no I know we
don't sing there needs to be people
around them okay that's yeah okay so let
me ask about house we have the
Democratic consultant here of the last
successful election the Democrats seem
to be getting their groove back a little
bit and what ice when I mean by that is
that Alexander our caveat cobia Cortez I
Anna Presley Stacey Abrams kerryevelyn
Davis these are all women who won
primaries weren't supposed to and they
did it with unabashed liberal proposals
medicare-for-all
ending student debt a different approach
to the war on terror ending mass
incarceration it seems like if there is
a maybe a shining spot in this Trump
tragedy it's that it's made the
Democrats sort of rediscover who they
are and the voters is that what's going
on look I think those fundamental issues
health care a secure job security you
know and all of the things that are
being addressed whatever the whatever
form it takes you're hearing this kind
of a cross across the board those
candidates reflected their districts
well they reflect their their
constituencies well you know Connor lamb
and your state probably has a slightly
different slant on these things but
fundamentally the values I think are
very consistent and so you know the the
Republicans are running with the word
socialism they're trying to say and
scare people scare people immune ISM
Venezuela Trump says we're gonna be
living in Venezuela I grew up in Canada
okay we socialized medicine and I am I'm
here to tell you that this line
that you get on all of the political
shows from people is that it's a failure
the system is a failure in Canada it is
not a failure and can I never waited for
anything in my life
I chose my own doctors my mother never
paid for a prescription it was fantastic
and I just got back from Vancouver and I
keep hearing this like Canadians are so
nice
Canadians are so nice they can be nice
because they have health care
[Applause]
it doesn't say secret swim pal
right or you live in a box yeah there
are certain people in our society that
need to be taken care of there are there
are people without as many opportunities
that need to be helped toward those
opportunities there are people who are
sick but that's the don't have to lose
your home and as your mother got sick
and look I'm boy I've always said the
United States has been a quasi socialist
government for a hundred years for
crying out loud it's not a sauna plenty
of subsidies for oil companies and it
also Medicare and Social Security and
yes of course there's nothing more
socialistic than some of the Pentagon
programs that are just jobs programs the
Pentagon says we don't want these tanks
and they build them anyway if that's not
socialism I don't know what is
[Applause]

whatever you're into its own prime maybe you'll have partners it with prime you can watch documentaries by your favorite bands extreme other albums on amazon music and even order some emerging time for the next country

right







edit
know what i was reluctant than my vacation
that makes it worthwhile there was in a why we're so relaxing and told them this alert
right on the phone
shit not not a drew surrey where could i get new underwear
hawaiians
or so laid back over there and therefore they just swipe left
one guy he texted new phone notice
but happy new season happy new year

twenty eight seen on the chinese calendars the year of his shit hole
what you know the thing about go and gravy already
but about doubt a drubbing he says shit hole where he lasted that they would actually change is real stuff because that was the immigration deal they were trying to do and saying shit hold torpedo did and now they're going to cut down the wedding on that right now library night because donald trump you know he wants to change the immigration process he says
why can't we do immigration while like the way i got milan by using a catalog

actually said they said that we should bring in more both from norway and today norway responded they said thank you pass
so now we have this government shutdown looming and it is a stalemate because the democrats are not budging on the dreamers
drunk
even more did said about and stupid wall because his chief of staff john kelly went on t v this week oh and he said trump on the wall was uninformed
and evolving and trump was furious he said i have not uninformed and who is this john kelly

what's evolution but
i'll tell you what evolution is trouble for two years telling all those beds every time he got that going to be a giant concrete wall of actual wall thirty feet high from goes to goes now now it's of sense
his stream or a sprinkling of cinnamon like you do with and
but
if there is a government shutdown trump says not to worry porn stars will still get their hush money so

any other president there's enough to get mad but yes donald trump only men ever by the way to pay a porn star to keep her mouth shut

you know the story
i'm not even gonna say allegedly
i've been sued up one know in lawsuits with donald trump
if i lose this would be one in one
but they paid or one hundred and thirty thousand dollars you don't pay some than that kind of money if there isn't something that so in two thousand and six only months after milan he has given birth to their is done
donald trump is stopping this porn star who was also cheating on her boyfriend and he knew because used to go home with orange on her collar
but
but as the porn stars you bribery as fans here
stormy daniel stormy daniels
star of young and anal
oh to be young and
now the young and nato trailer trash nurses for good will hunting
and parking with pride to and here's what we learn from her and her affairs with a job she said first of all he didn't use protection
he said he'd only use a condom is mexico paid for it

gotta love japanese the world's biggest german islam won't shake hands to raw dog with a porn star no problem
she asked
she says he chased around the room in his tidy whites
i went from her and tidy why he said well you may my voters

and i love this part that he made her a lot of promises like he was going to buy a condo but she knew he was a con men who would never keep his word oh if only the voters of wisconsin have the same perceptive abilities as the star of working with pride

and so it changes around the robot is tidy why these and finally she says they get out there that he starts kissing your he says to refill ugh
here we go but she's a pro she powered through it
she said you know sometimes i have to have sex with a guy like donald trump you just shut your eyes and pretend it's harvey weinstein

iran and but first up oh wow he wrote the book that president trump didn't want you to buy so you did
the white house like a while


well you have done the impossible you have made america read again
you know if it's a book that brings down this presidency i'm back to the god of irony well
all due respect for great fun book to read but it's not bring him down his popularity has not gone down one bid his base wouldn't read it that people are rated already hate him but it's fun
and it's and you just can't these people that's the thing and i know you've been talking about i want you to tell me something that the other people have not noticed in this book is there something that you think by when they asked me about this that i put in there that they're not talking about
there is but i can't tell you what it is
so very lucky enough money
teasing us like that there is something in the in the light i was absolutely sure of but it was so incendiary that that i just didn't have the the the ultimate proof that the littering what he's done is it
thing well i yeah i didn't have the blue dress
no is it about a woman it is oh it is it is it's somebody is fucking now is oh and who is he just have to read between the lines what lines tell us the line
you say it
the end of the okay well it's in the book than just have to you'll know it now
now that i have to go loco when you hit that paragraph you're going to go
that
i'm not going to make the joke was going to
okay so listen the womanizing thing you do have a lot about the book i mean that i found fascinating that you were basically saying that this is sort of the point of trumps whole life
i love the way you the empire the it really was a boutique industry kind of he really didn't do anything all day the whole point of his existence was chasing tail twenty four seven
twenty four seven that was it that is he's the man i am an old fashioned playboy that's the kind of thing that he says and he says it proudly and i always thought i made last year that your i thought one of the biggest adjustments for him was when he moves into the white house he can play the you know when it was a mulatto
albert eight and then eager yes hotels he goes to golf tournaments we see as all these places ring get together with his mistresses that's hard to do in the white house that's probably why you so pissed off for the done
except now the yeah i mean there's yeah i got back to their back
there are back doors
gailey listen

sean spicer if i can get into the white house
price now get into the white this is the other thing that so first learning about your book
what's in the book just the fact that you were able to hang out
like it's a dorm room like you know just this is the white house that just blew my mind that people weren't saying who's this guy why you see here every day which is listening to us everyday i waited for someone to notice me say please get out but they don't they actually do the other thing they saw it
and say okay come come let's let's talk
and what do you attribute this to
i attribute to donald trump this is like he said okay he like you because you were a new yorker well sort of near his he gave the first approval i said i'd like to come come down and and observe and then he thought i was asking for a job as i said i want to write a book and he said
he just saw he was deflated book might why would you want to do that
but then it was kind of like okay you know what was the tirade
call it fire and fury when you were talking to them right it was like the grand transition or ah yes the great transition a greater of course that's funny you know when larry charles and ever make making my documentary religious we didn't call it that we we called it a spiritual journey
they let us interview them in the church of now i told trump he said he and i said i'm going to call the book the great transition the first hundred days he said
a boring title
right right
so the other thing that where you actually had an impact is because of the book there was a lot of talk about maybe he is just flat out that much
people were diagnosed i mean there was talk about that before but it reached a fever pitch to the point where he thought he had his physical last week that he also asked to take a cognitive tests and then bragged about how great he did even though it was a test that it's the kind of test they give an old lady when she was wandering down the middle of the highway and her
your it's
also you can get the test on the internet so you can get the questions before him
it's it's thirty questions the first for our what month is what day is it what year is it what city are you in
and who's the present a united

so it goes
because of what we're john kelly takes over okay so that is the big watershed moment but this week now he's apparently shooting as i refer a doing the my like with john kelly because kelly committed the ultimate fall pod party criticize trump on t v or inferred that he was not perfect
what do you make of this and apparently i read now the john kelly threatens to quit all the time that's the only way you can get trumps attention and everybody tries to quit the whole operation
it's like had had how do i get outta here
so why does he still command so much loyalty he's been so rotten and said rotten things to just about everybody and all i see is month after month republicans not fighting him more lining up behind him more like
lying for him what do you attribute that to well i mean i think the loyalty thing my book is sort of the example that that these are the most disloyal loyal people who ever ever existed
but but also the republicans you know there was mitch mcconnell said this was early on he will sign anything we put in front of him
so he just becomes for everyone in some way a useful fool
now the problem with that is he's the useful fool but then he goes wacko and said something which destroys everybody's plans to use him so what what are you in what do you in awe of with it
not saying admire did nothing i admire about him but there are things about him that i am in awe of
i like the size of his balls
aren't you just in awe of the size
come i mean i am in awe that that there is actually someone who can go through life
reach the age of what does seventy one right now in still act like he should get what he wants when he wants without anyone saying otherwise demand demand demand because everything is so unfair his favorite word is unfair he's the luckiest guy in the world and he's
got this chip on his shoulder that's that's what i understand the whole attitude is when will white men born degrade wealth finally catch a break in america

everyone i literally a hundred percent of the people around him
always returned to saying well he's like a child right and sometimes he is a sixteen year is like a sixteen year old are or an eleven year old laura to yeah i noticed now on fox and friends they talk to him directly like they used to on ramp or room
i see don
it's the funnest book i read in a long time i just hope the world's days where it is thank you so much
yeah


right
the area is a writer at large in new york magazine an author of the conservatives all are great for an andrew sullivan
the health greater of h b o's and insecure and the host of the park as black on the arrow be speaking at the l a woman's marge on saturday be careful what they say larry larry

right so great to have you guys here let me start off with this what's what's knit we were last on in november seventeenth the twenty seventy what i think it's the big new thing is we're just starting to get into their is that the entire conservative establishment is lying for donald trump
when tom cotton the senator and who was at purdue the other one day were in the room when he said she had and everybody heard shit hole and we all know he said shit hole and they mountains said they didn't say shadow
the homeland security person perjured herself said you didn't know they were white people and norway
his doctor lies for the six foot three grow and edge
he's thirty nine pounds got to lose a little way but he's lying as as well
the corporations are doing at walmart
says thanks to the tax cut and then we find a sad thing to the tax cut that they're raising wages the economy is great they have to compete
a vast right wing conspiracy it is i mean i feel like he's got them all in a sunken place
i mean
this fascinating with he said people are scared to leave like like charlton pincers that people white couple of republicans are those thirteen kids or something
i'm not but you know i know but it seems apt analogy know why are they have a
and the fact that they would twisted and turned into like the woman the norway thing built to norway thing she can understand that it's made of a mostly white people let me know there's no way this running around
that language on my show i i can
i can understand i
it's a function of two things it seems to me
it's both he has to lie because he needs to cover up what's actually happening them number one no one i know and they have to follow they have to follow because it's a cult and he's the cult leader and in a tried and in a try if you stand up against the leader who everybody is supporting then you ostracized
and it's amazing you think washington to be a little bit more grown up than this but they want and it's so scary because because now the know a guy is the one that their me
really scary know he starts more mainstream the latest one is this hawaii threat really shocked me
go there around that time
and it's over this said well you know it was obama wouldn't be but it now that president stable genius
she's threatening north korea mean that really happen and the names this is getting mainstream change by i see this david french you know we've had him on the show he's a guy that bill kristol want to run last time he's in the national review he says you have to understand that the odds are overwhelming that you'll survive and initial
blast that's a little league live below the knee have three heads but you know
he says it to hollywood miss that a strike will vaporize and entire american city much less the suburbs
we're out in the sticks we won't even notice it with this is scary stuff and forty six percent of republicans want war with north korea
this is what i worry about when the funny then becomes the not we've always live with nukes right i mean that was what the iraq war allegedly was a pout remember we live with nukes
we've we've struggled with nukes with iran i once asked to
the last president what was he is well kept him awake at night the center pakistan's they
everywhere i think the difference is that we don't have some on in control now that we just to have the composure con and reticence to handle a crisis and so therefore we so much more frightened and we have reason to be my guild and
one of the moment
when this went from unthinkable to think about yeah we're moving into think a bullet i don't want to never seen anything like this remember how people were scared of reagan and that seems gets now admit yeah
how can people be afraid this single time for this the same time there is a dictatorship with access to nuclear weapons that could possibly attack the mainland the united states and it's not like they are out of yeah yeah the like maria and entirely so little to do that
it is so when they ask about any nose on the down
voting now okay were exciting live tv
so emigration so it looks like it's a base vs base right
the democrats know there's a bunch of the running for president already
and this is an issue
you know some people would say this is what losers democrats election identity politics
you would say that yes i mean i don't think i think really dicey for the democrats i think if they shut down the government because they want to protect the dream is you some people will call illegal immigrants and because they want to prevent the wall
they're going to look really bad in middle america they going to look like they'd rather shot the government down don't get serious on immigration control and that's not a good position for the democrats to be in here but i get tired of the democrats being afraid to play hardball the way republicans play
mitch mcconnell i think scully it was murdered by that pillow like a whole year right he was day absolute held out for a year
gossage that's playing hardball and by the way on our support then how important is that supreme court pick how yeah
well as they weren't afraid to do that
i don't know how hard overseas horrible it escalates you know like a nuclear conflict and at some point whoever is in power is going to have to govern the whole country someone at some point is going to have to bring this country together and unfortunately those kind of tactics only deep in the divide and make everything harder and that's what i'm concerned about
they're getting polarize on both sides the bases a race is less and less in the middle and reasonable debates are now being swamped by personality cult by reality television
the player
is there was not one day and eight years that republicans said i will work with barack obama not one there was one
i know but but is it going to help us just go back at it and the same way know
to do the same thing but you can learn how to fight properly for the things and important but like knowing for the dreamers let's go dreamers how about undocumented americans which is what they really are i mean people have been here for their whole lives would have them do
you know i mean
look i'm for them staying too but i see a lot of footage on t v of people crying
and i think the addresses this is what you're talking about i think this is what people go well this is the democrats this is what this is what they care about people crying i got me my y is no excuse me for asking a really personal question but why not give him the wall
the pete sake why not first my and tell you want because it seemed like these it did not feasible in which case it's not going to get built right it's going to take way longer than even to trump terms give it to him not only that but when you give it to him you get the dreamers you get more people to stay here who are already illegal you can use that leverage on the other issue
and you can credentials yourselves with america by saying we're not against border control and did that would work in he knew what he wanted the he doesn't know what he wants all he all he knows what he wants is true but it's a narcissistic sociopath he's only interested in a feeding his ego is so there's that
i interject from the here
if somebody would actually injured
introduce facts into this an immigrant i'm not a awesome and onwards
we are
weird to the to the west of canada on this usually when an issue in canada people say oh you know their health care system or i pod or game they're always have the last of us good liberal kind of canada allows twenty eight percent of people in through family we allow two thirds they have a point system and
canada it's much trickier it's it's that would trump with gold chain migration family it's education you speak english or french work experience you have a job offer age adaptability
he admitted they many unemployment skills america irritating percent canada fifty eight percent build all with rules for immigration that i'm a little more cynical about the money that fighting against adnan and here's what the real fight is but that maybe what they're fighting against the republicans are
fighting for as a fill immigrants especially low skilled workers are actually democratic voters and with a demo got to do and are importing voters
it's job they say that themselves you look like why is it really doesn't matter
why is it a crazy
to say we want anybody from anywhere in the world but you can really contribute something we don't have the games i wish he would say we had an old dungeons don't make to
i like this diversity lottery he goes on about why does not exist i mean do we have to have their own every single country they represent representation the it's crazy why not just get rid of it this so this is so easy to deal with could aid three minutes but the base is the bidding this from have put it in another way the
public are seeming to betray their own eat those an ideology and the things that used to always stand for they used to be that party of hey you can come from anywhere and you can have the american dream hear the republicans held that up as a badge of honor in their sleeves and they're going against that they're saying no you only can be a certain station in come here
the upward mobility has to start here it can't stay here and he says of you individually
let's get some good news though trump had his physical
any is the healthiest man whatever to live
you know which is the kitchen he such a city road
right
but that the person
jurors who is done in such great shape is chris christie
from my home state in new jersey and he just retired as the governor and you know here in the comedy business
tap when a guy like chris christie retires it is it's a very dark
we have been dining out on his fat jugs for a long as
and we will have more and that's why we put together this little shrimp
someone as the poll chris christie aside and tell him the lap band goes on the inside
mccain things megabytes is the secret service code name for chris christie andre three thousand
first time he's ever won our lands why he's caused a few
it's been a long time since we've seen as balls
one thing he's good at it is clogging major artery
only exercise prosperous begets is pumping the nacho cheese dispenser
first birthday is handing out candy wrapper
the reason we only get the grid want to hear their skeletons in his closet of cow

they said center united on the director the food labour research center at u c berkeley please welcome sorrow german
the same way
you are so great the first time to have your bag
and more relevant the numbers on the things you're talking about you've always been a great tribute and flow of the restaurant workers of america let's first before we get into that connection to the harassment
around let's talk about tips because this is very relevant to a country it's always debating minimum wage
this is one of those areas where america
pretty unique right
we still do it by tips
where are so unique because actually tipping originated in theater yeah it was like aristocrats giving something the surface and vessels when it first came to the states rich americans brought it and actually it was around the time of slavery around emancipation and the restaurant industry at that time demanded the right to hire newly freed slaves not pay them anything and let them live on
customer tips and so the idea of a nothing wage then zero now two dollars comes from slavery comes from the idea that mostly black workers could or nothing and live on tips and now we here we are one hundred and fifty years later with a minimum wage of two dollars and thirteen cents an hour and millions of women across america living on tips
industry were like one hundred twelve people in the country went out of eleven people right now totals thirty million workers own yeah
tell us why it is connected to harassment when there was no tipping system that situation would get better
you know right now seventy percent and the millions of women are millions of people across america who live on tips who worked on the tip minimum wage of two and three and four dollars and are seventy percent of them are women and they live working at i hop and an apple bees and olive garden and their median wage including tips is about nine bucks an hour they suffer from three times the
poverty rate of the rest of us workforce but worst of all they are having to put up with anything and everything from customers no matter how they touch them or treat them or talk to them because that's where their income is coming from that's how they're getting paid that's how they're feeding their families not from a wage the wages so low it's going to taxes so they're having have drummers your her the customers are
harassing them but but get this the customers are harassing them because they live on tips but because are living on tips their manager says dress more sexy show more cleavage were tied are living in order to make more money in tips would you believe when we were doing was only a theory it's just fun go to an invitation exactly well not just that the coworker and management exactly well speaking of hotel
when we get out this research would you believe the industry named a new segment a recognized segment it's called the restaurant the restaurant is a new segment in the restaurant industry and it's not just hooters and tilted kilt and twin peaks it's olive garden and apple these and danny's where women are told show your breasts but the
thing is full
no but show more breast cancer
oh yeah
how do you the number of workers we've had from denny's who tell my boss tells me go home and dress more sexy and schumacher schumer cleavage and come back so you can make more money in tips for good
and nobody else does that just as it was because of on the totem pole too old or longer her oh i mean things that chimps on the unknown addressing the situation they won't journal seems to me
the tubes is it doesn't sense of was good service
it's a way in which it cost him within reward good service well there's a don't do that with lots of other servers and survives you know your doctor your lawyer your teacher mean these are hard working your with many of them are immigrants by the way really hard working and i rent but there are we don't tip anybody else is the only industry where the
actual bosses say we shouldn't have to pay or on workers you the customer should pay our workers for it was i've read recently about a lot of these high levels chefs who went down in the mood to
it's interesting it's a theme that runs through it for me was that when they weren't harassing they were screaming yeah well as we both the mood to the first thing that always comes to a minors i hate boys
of any kind

wondering what do you what other industries you think have not been talked about you were told me about restaurant yeah i mean farm workers face this on the job of workers face on the job pretty much in every industry women who don't have power and you know they don't want to have hundred and i'm going to get in trouble for pursuing
cop
pokemon cop
every woman i've ever known has the story about you know well they lacked hours day has exactly ultimate power but when you change that dynamic you know their seven states for example in our industry that got rid of the lower wage for tipped workers and they have half the rate of harassment as the forty three states that have this lower wage
and it's because in california which is one of the seven states a woman doesn't have to put up with anything and everything from her boss she gets a full wage from her boss you know
she doesn't put up with everything from the customer and that's why thanks to the me to moment new york is about to follow governor cuomo actually just announced thanks to leadership by women
that we're actually going to get get rid of that lower wage for tipped workers in new york and to keep the tubes absolutely well that one was on worried about i think you should be own reward your winter tips and is going on there is a great and suddenly actually ten better in california than most other states but the thing is
workers women get a wage that grown and get an action
it's a little like making someone job
it's a little
it's it's it's an anachronism loses let this one go
i'll give it a
eric schmidt everybody wants to the new they'll go a baby
and i had virtually to new to that would be fine as long as again
a weapon a you know i have one thing i have a people love when you give the moment it
what it is jay
there is one prefer going to do it was one version of this will work to make a personal pollute to join
maloney of drawn because you know she had to live through the hollywood actress
top
the reports of known team accusers
donald trump now yeah no stormy daniels
come on millennia
this is your me to moment

said value for money with divorce really
i realize that you would be welcomed our in our moment man
would change a lot of the fact of the manor is a trump trump is just such to me
here are you getting this know know the thing when he's finished you know being president went over that as americans are going to say me too

is a restaurant owner
he's trying to pocket his worker
the money exactly and now he's proposing a rule that would make ten the property owners rather than workers so he's trying to given self another mountainous yeah and he's talk about harassment when he walks into a restaurant and women recommend retina
so why do all these
white women fifty two to forty three vote for him though
well that's a good question yes
i mean a lot of our folks restaurant workers feel really really disillusioned disgusted disengage from the political system in general from both parties they really like nobody's been standing up for them a lot of them voted for trump because they thought he didn't represent the establishment and a lot of them are telling us they are disappointed he does rep
present the establishment he represents the one percent they're not finding he's standing up to the the last year has shown strong gains for working class wages in this country for twenty years will rub that signals a little bomb us

but do you think that's what he's voters a going to think you guys keep talking about his voters like there's some modern mean it they can now giving him a forty percent higher than it had in a very long time he's gained everyday since the attacks go in through the economy's booming people
oh trust me people are dumb enough to think well he's it in the atheists recovery when it really does help people with low and always does have a very and he will turn around and said don't think about the i did it and you know circumstantially that's when it began to happen that's my concern in terms of real acting trump the the economy is working very
much more stable to the very people the working classes it be working now but i've seen this movie before what happens when the republicans juice up the economy just like they did with the tax could remember what comes next the crash
no i thought it would have been mostly more the war is virtually or usually helps the economy
that's what he'll do need it was the was interesting hears that this is a real time to and every other major part of the developing world is growing together there's a lot of momentum behind this current growth rate now more the new thing i'm sure you may be right i'm certainly getting out of the marquis pretty soon
retirement savings but it may not happen the it didn't happen it's been eight years now
the gold will also cover the an indie band it's not it's not happening for everyone we have the highest rate of income inequality since the gilded age people are struggling across the country i was in michigan in minnesota this week people are struggling that wage of two and three dollars is not going up so some economy donating really were som
that or lot well
all going wrong you know wages are not going on and look at the data level good the day
there's more branches than any other store the dollar store they have like twenty seven thousand dollar stores and dollar generals more than anything else i use it
oh you don't think they'll build the the appearance whether some people are not making it as you say you know but i have to agree with andrew in the sense that the appearance is for the most part that there is a robust economy right now in his or his own home but history has shown that we do not throw out a president during a strong economy the
he turns yeah there's a chance but i'm one of those people that think from get reelected the strong economy and his personality is tertiary at best
it's what i know i don't like in my mouth as states
i don't like to believe are no no but i have to agree with personality this is all about personal it is a cult of personality that's what we found out in michael's book when steve ban and thought he could go up against donald trump he thought he could actually steal the trunk voter because he had the ideology when the trump voters like you're not a star
we like this guy with he's got the plane and the hot why he's the president he's the star steve steve than it was like come on guys who are get outta here
hey guys
stuff
they don't care when sarah huckabee colonel say they comes out in lies everybody out
i don't know
turner said it's very day
says the earth is flat and she comes as a now i'm a liberal ideas twisted is where he says
i hear you better result
reality tv star yes he shouldn't be there yes but he has tapped into certain yeah trade immigration and low wages as as saying that one in this election the last election and they refused but the fuse that civil can't see the you just said mark from yeah but it doesn't matter what the issue is he has proved that because
if i told you two years ago that the conservatives in this country
would think russia was their friend and the b i years their enemy these people i'm sorry republicans i know i'm hard on you sometimes but their sheep and it's so easy to drive
it
frighteningly easy to drive them to a different meadow that bill cute
i mean by law enforcement that was always there thing you could never say a bad word about the f b i the c i a another a hotbed better liberals and now they're corrupt and we don't like them but we're foot see with russia
that's crazy that makes me think he could say anything and sunken can truly my editor
yeah i mean i i mean yes there are there is that basically have to admit that will follow him no and forty percent that's i mean this is necessarily wrong
maine and training as his hard bait and he has handled the african american the up to two
he has nothing to do with this last year trumps those two year has been better for african americans terms and economy the many previous is i'm just telling you the truth okay you may want to hear but this is the reality that doing better because people in the bottom and now doing a lot better if they do but not direct measure
just are not our wages now their wages are not going up we have the highest cent increase among those people who last twelve months a guy a gun those because of low lowest third who are living in poverty and it's not going up their wages have stagnated okay what we're going to run a tiny one less thing it was martin luther king day
monday and whenever this holiday happens all the republicans they talk in such glowing terms about dr king
march with and like what would they be saying about him on fox news if he was allowed well we know with a radical how they would have treated him article would be the kind word well we know we saw how they treated him when he was alone which is where he's alive right now
the
democrats say them
surely they would look at him and see this christian fundamentalists this person is driven by religion more than anything else and he would have no role in the current democratic coalition well the democrats in dixie i'll bet they were more races it is anybody
martin luther king would do it here now right now i'm you know it's crazy idea that crew democrats be like who is this faith
hey what do when you're getting the democrats aren't atheist the
is this long
on an issue that i've done all the heavy lifting
democrats are perfectly fine to say they're christian almost all of them how about how he respects him now let's talk about the present most presidents you know as i'm not even as a true eat it but what they do is respect they do dave service and okay that he chews i played the white sport ross
ryan and they'll say that says way of showing how it feels about my lady wants you to back that confederate statues wow that is enough said right thank you ever been at times

okay
oh have a plan of a ballistic missile as having your way
everyone in why you got the message said the same thing they ran home shut the blinds and close the drapes
you help bring the missile would think you weren't home
it's a warhead a jehovah's witness
there also
as to tell pope francis that it's ok if he feels a little awkward i never knew how to slow down to the stairway to heaven

they didn't get a hold the way through
it
subway restaurant i finally found their new spokesman

father long hi

sadly no role in twenty eight team it's more important than ever that we all keep laughing


nothing is funny people are trying to take over the world and we can't let them

which is why i originally posted this picture of me pulling and al franken
sleeping bob sank
it's a joke a joke about another joke
so i'm just saying here at the beginning of the year if something like this is to receive you don't watch

i'm also going to admit something right here up front that may influence what i'm about to say tonight
i have a penis
and why admit that having one does predisposed the human being aggressive and over sexed i don't concede that it makes me automatically wrong about everything and i say that as a true supporter of the me to movement ivan or black during the golden globes i was home watching tv but still
i wore black but that was also morning the ability to think rationally
i'm down with me too i'm not down with me coffee isn't
something is way off when senator kirsten jill a brand can go unchallenged saying when we start having to talk about the differences between sexual harassment and sexual assault and unwanted groping you're having the wrong conversation
can we just be having an additional conversation

hanley only have one thought now i get it that al franken had to become road kill on the zero tolerance highway
a highway it seems only democrats have to drive on
what do liberals really want to become the distinction dinners the people who can't tell or don't want to see a difference between assault in a van and a back rub by the water cooler
masturbation is normal and healthy but not in the park
giving up on the idea that even bad things have degrees that is as dumb as embracing the idea of alternative facts

i get it when trump side doesn't want to talk he only knows eighty eight words
but we're supposed to be the conversation people just just requires weighing things that's why lady justice is holding a scale and not a sawed off shotgun
senator joe lebron went on to say you need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is ok
yes agreed
but we can't walk and chew gum any more we can agree that groping and rape or both unacceptable
and one is worse

apparently not because when matt damon said there's a difference between patting someone on the but and rape or child molestation right
liberal twitter responded know there isn't jason bourne yesterday

you think he ate a lot of shit in the martian

yeah
many driver responded by saying you don't get to tell women that because some guy only showed them their penis their pain isn't as great as a woman who was raped
this is madness no woman in the world she actually had to pick would choose rape over merely seeing a penis so why do we all have to pretend many drivers statement is noble and matt damon is crazy
we are losing the thread back to thinking itself
you know the declaration of independence starts with the words we hold these truths to be self evident self evident as some things are such obvious indisputable no brainer years that we start from that point
assuming role generally on the page that shit is measurably chemically different than china


but it seems that now building blocks basic building blocks of thought like there are facts
and things have degrees are being tossed aside mike pence and isis are both homophobic but mike doesn't throw game and off the roof so he is better
this isn't that hard
that hard i know it
because we do it with other stuff every millennial i know thinks it's ridiculous that the government lists marijuana as a schedule one drug along with lsd and heroin
because it is ridiculous because things have degrees there are four degrees of murder three degrees of burns six degrees of kevin bacon

his doctor another prize this guy said he's an absolute actual help but he has to lose ten to fifteen pounds would trump said he prefers not using the stair master he preferred lying his ass off

welcome to age be a pipe down from h b o maintenance real time with him
they want okay you what i said oh worlds project
your other question for getting richer crater do you think the ethical degradation seen in this presidency will be a permanent realities of the as well it could get worse but i sure hope know this is some digging out after we've survived this is a low point is a combined all
all of the sense of all the past president

i don't even get me wrong i that's why we got your it again
congressmen share of gems get majority in mid term's what do you think congress should work on right away good question
i think one of the biggest challenges facing the country and its mass by this sugar i that bad from the stock market although that is coming down from that i are structural changes going on the economy the effect of automation is going to be as disruptive to people in retail as globalization was certain manufacturing
and we need to prepare our workforce for that we need to make sure that young people can get the education they need to be able to compete in a newly automated work environment need to make sure that people in the middle of their career or lose their job through no fault of their own are able to get another good job that pays just as well and people at the end of a worker can
retire and ignite here democrats say that all the time why don't they believe you are talking about the coal miners because that's what pilloried all the coal miners and they just you know we don't believe we don't believe we're going to replace this job or common change my life and any way i need that's the only job i can get in the minor mine is here and i want to go down in it
i feel like democrats have a real trouble making that connection and convincing voters that they can do things like that which is that they have the right answer i think i just don't think you're right well first of all you can't give that talk from washington dc
you need to be in coal country and you need to show people respect you need to start the conversation by saying i respect what you've done for a living with your parents did for a living how you put bread on the tape
i can't say that i'm going to change the global economy and energy and so many promises you that i hope you know they're giving you wanna bowl but what i can say is i want to work with you to bring other jobs here what do you want to see your kids do and how do we make that happen
that's a kind of conversation i think we need to have and coal country and around the around the nation it can't be talking down to people and has to mean showing respect people and cold come in coal country were told if their kids just got an education they be fine and they got an education and there were no jobs for we need to be able to partner
federal government local government local a business private sector to help create jobs and the parts of the country that had been left behind
they've done
if the if the mueller report comes in any time this year before the election right
then it'll be close to over once he gets his report but if it happened after two thousand and eighteen it would be better for the democrats right because they've been might be in power
in other words wouldn't it be better if the mueller the report came in two thousand and nineteen when you could impeach and if it comes in and thousand and eighteen when you can't impeach him because they're republicans will go along with that doesn't have then just die in the woods a very well it can't you the stall
that's right
garcia what do you like pets right now
and says way preferable to donald yeah all ultra ultra could either definitely true yeah ultra ultra clean first of all he's got a russian spy yes
he's not as he's not wearing clown makeup
nails governance and out cabinets he knows how to govern yes he's not a complete not he's he's a bush
but he won't take us to your your your war right what i was going to
i didn't want me to say i again i'm so sorry
look i think we proceeded the investigations expeditiously as we can and ironically it's the republicans who are slow walking phase now they want to basically put the government on trial this is what you do when you're a defense attorney and the facts are mounting against your client and he's looking increasingly incriminating you basically put the government on try
while so there are witnesses we want to bring in they keep delaying their documents will want to subpoena they keep delaying they're the ones who are drawing this out right now i can't tell you whether it's better not for bob to finish this year but i can't say this the most important thing is that he be allowed to do his job
that
for the record if you're watching bob mahler don't finish this yep
wait till twenty nineteen after the democrats may be have at least one house so this thing or a minute he's a republican wait like of that he is actually but he's an american and foremost bob more is that america he's going to do this job
the public and the trunk is fighting against that's what did the most amazing ironies of the whole thing called me it was a republican rod rosenstein it was you can't even get along with your own team and betray me swung the election to him
yeah that's what nate silver things was the turning point in six particularly absurd the trunk to be now claiming the f b i was trying to destroy them and they were in fact helping him the majority of america agrees with you i'm sure because a majority of america
see something totally different than this thirty nine forty one whatever percentage that president trump has but you have to remember one of the reasons why we're in this situation now is because things were not laid out the way they were supposed to play out and they have to play out the right way so you cannot say well it was done this but it has to play at the right way
because it's too much covered up too much shift the shifted and everything and mean for instance you know just what this memo situation the democrats had something that gave it from what i mean for my sources are bottom line for line and my correct line for line against new years and even gave a different timeline but the president again wants to keep his
narrative in show the people what he wants to show versus what the other side's had other side has it could actually be more factual then what newness has a known yet was actually what did he have accused himself how in the world can even present any and used to be closer than you this is that this is the president on the newness memo i'm vindicated
rice the present and then somebody there was a democratic response i'm is classified
pretty good friends with devon
we used to get along very well together
same home state signing support and love and event will go straight or not
well
i think particular
is the chairman got very close to the present during the campaign he was part of the transition team he had to see to the table that's a heady thing right
and then when he was put in charge of investigation he still want to maintain the seat of the table absolute power and do both credibly and and the investigation is what suffer a lot of relationships were broken and washington dams and republicans were able to at least talk work things out i mean i had a lot of republicans sources and democratic sources and
last with they perceive to be is that i'm a liberal but they perceive i don't tell my politics not lost a lot of republicans sources and republican friends to this last two years and other thing makes us and that's that's known as memo doesn't say a thing of it there be i was doing his job have gone and getting surveillance and
as a warrant for hanging around with russian agents that what it was what i'm trying to that that is they're just trying to do is alex jones it just create a haze of oh shit
seventy percent of republicans think the f b i is biased against trump this haze of bullshit and everything and everybody who gets crowded and the mike's lens and so forth ban and now
to go unseen mueller do they get a message from trump do you think saying the worry about it all part of the biggest hundred and plus those russian are joe a pile that case your pie that case whack and over yet
and the message he sent there was you have my back i won't even wait until your sentence to use apartment
when he was asked about flynn he said well we'll see about that in other words will see what he has to say is it with me as against me
of course that is so destructive of our system of justice but then that's the point it's especially her and us with our pio actually interviewed or power went to the prison where he made women who were serious addiction problems go out on a chain gang wearing a tee shirt saying i was a drug addict were members of the public more condemn them i mean this is one of the most wicked people
interim championing in reveal so much much from let me see now he's running for senate rare
yeah she's eighty seven right so we had chelsea manning and real arms hail this is the state of our politics
manning did it's really admirable things don't have a pyro husband's career out of the stating that he destroys i any has aligned herself with might turn a bitch and the right or she went she went on i'll say to a party which she went ten min intelligence on those be state how i don't want to be one hundred language
i was saying about politics with them for them

we knew they act hillary's emails were you know they put our false stories up on facebook but this is something different this is actually getting into the voter to even republicans are word they say if the russians can get access to our polls black people could be neck

we're expanding or even media
i it social media
no you're not you're not you're not
or up
with who or what is the greatest untapped resource for the children or the cedric of yourself
love
love some not just people who are in their immediate surroundings but people who might wanna come out of the confines of their own home and and get some care give him the delk everything shows that children neat do best when there's in a caring adult around then had to be their mother
i mean i'm certainly not the authority never had kids and their brain by life so i never have to talk or be around a job
eric you say ones on airplanes you watch children on airplanes
children and their with what
somebody once said to me a kid just need one it does know to be a real parent and it doesn't have to be too
one person who matter what you do to them they will leave that to iraq for them and exactly where i still be here tomorrow exactly right that is established that's probably going to grow up to be a good that's right
president fox are you concerned the russia will medal in the mexican election
really helps with merrill in mexico elections so we'll do our own game
internally
difficult to curb cleared called transparent reliable elections in here is up the city
was not only been but it's also the system
you are the i party was at the party mode or no no no not you i'm saying that was there for a long time yeah yes pretty pretty seventy one year seventy one years and then you came along and what about two thousand and what about now
now we are leading by democracy fortunately it is very meditative system and
we have to be careful states like that
so about it is really the winner
rico remotest okay
som en as a writer how worried are you about trump attempting to curb freedom of expression
well i'm worried i'm terrified but but but i'm wary of getting worse
yeah
a bit threatened by professionals year so that back
it off his shoulder
i do think that trying to undermine people's belief in what they're hearing from the news media is always the first step towards totalitarianism
totally
if somebody is able to say don't believe them i am the truth right that's how you get a dictator or a god
god it's a file
will the religious rage give trump another pass on his latest affair or that's a good question because how much does it take now he's got a porn star and a playmate while the whites is nursing
it just looks bad
what would jesus do what would jesus did well
i mean you're asking me
i don't know he would judge the sex part so much but the line part and the hurting of the ceilings part that i think he would be a little harder on their users can be grab a care about abortion that's what their hair so right as they got her that are about the as long as a got abortion illegal which is about to happen
that's what they care about us and they will be playing that card when when this gets desperate know
do you think he's not going to live about that term
but the supreme court
most important things we import and that's why they voted him in and they don't care about the restroom growing up and they don't even believe in they never heard of sex before and the not going to her about it now but the thing they're really really worried that his abortion because i remember barney frank one saying the republicans are only care about human life from conception to birth after that they could account
an amazing that they're talking about abstinence only with this particular president
push abstinence only and the schools you get this man is godly least abstinent man
that was ever
will rob porter and the shooting with lot in the shooting we've lost with rob porter and the show we've lost focus on dhaka with the expiration date on march fifth is there any hope for resolution dhaka

welcome to h b a pipe passed from h b o maintenance eve real time with him
cameron first pressure is for you guys should we lower the voting age to sixty with that incentive schools to teach civic engagement earlier and with more urgency
i think schools could just teach civic engagement earlier and with more urgency

i think erica senior year and that's when most people i believe take their got was i think we should be doing that every year because that's what we used to call civics yet class okay
my was better
kids these days ago and they teach you like how government works yeah things but drug doesn't know what there are three branches
the house or senate springboard
although i pre registered to vote the other day and i think that's what we need to be doing because right now a lot of the kids my age are voting the way their mommies and daddies are voting and that's a little daunting to think about as i mean that still happens when people are adults but there could be a little bit more freedom is
because as it goes on and again that's the number one predictor of what political party will be part of your parents passed and that's terrifying to think about considering that our parents had failed us oh yeah you really don't like us
okay
piss off the kids any more the merrier
was
oh really
oh no i do we feel about would be a very tight at stanford
so all the way i feel about gotten reform is we need we don't have many limitations on the second man i know i believe in owning a gun and my father has a gun cameron's data has again i believe
both our parents were in law enforcement i do see the reason to meet the reason to have a a weapon and i do see the reasoning behind the second amendment but i think we should have limitations on second them in the same way we have limitations on the first where you can't scream fire in a crowded theater you should be able to get an error fifteen if you're mentally unstable individual i don't get what's so hard for people to understand about that i'm not trying to take
slavery was a thing and women weren't allowed to vote and we did something about that
it took awhile but know if the only thing that comes out of this tragedy is that we outlaw bump stocks and we raise the age at which people are allowed to buy a or fifteen that will be a field that yet because the reality from my perspective is you need to do what we always try to you which is to ban the sale of a lot fifteens universe
background checks and also have the ability to buy these laws magazine but the problem that is it makes way too much fucking sense for our elected officials to take care of
there's a study that today from the rand corporation that shows that these kinds of measures actually have an impact on gun violence
empirical evidence that shows a what's your opinion on like the the fact that the cdc can't research most in this stuff and that's another thing that has this guy dickie that's his name
this congress
congressmen put in the funding for the cdc the so they are unable to study the impact of gun violence in the causes of good that's another thing that has to be yeah wouldn't risk his name was a number
yeah it was only i just landed and i am i think greater things all do you think he was a congressman markets oh oh oh yeah he's aren't the republicans winner
the thing in a waiter what you're thinking what's up with having like all of their records be paper like that's just insane and that's required by law rain
required by law passed by republicans want to hobble eighty when you've tried to modernize these things and keep the records in the way any other a corporation of the big entity would keep them electronically republicans have said no you can't do that limit the amount of time that you could hold on to these things have to keep them okay
we have other issues to get to jon meacham would the founding fathers agree with billy graham lying and honor at the us capital
probably just because it was it would be is it would not be a violation of church and state so much as a recognition of of a cultural figure
madison who wrote the bill of rights and was a hugely important thinker about religious liberty
was actually presented with a case of late in his life about why the us military paying for chaplains isn't that a violation of establishment clause almost certainly strict sense that he said some things are just not worth fighting and i think that's where you probably stand
if you're in jeff sessions current position would you resign
i mean when i read when you read these tweets were trump is going on and it looks like this is the kind of treat you would right if you were in the opposition party why isn't the attorney general way these scarborough dirty joke
through the looking glass and jeff sessions
nothing in common with leaves a confederate soldier
do you feel sorry for the feels something know i mean he took this job knowing who donald trump what and who he is right and you know at some point though you would hope that you would have the intestinal fortitude or the pride to simply say you know
wanted this job all my life but it's not worth it and i'm not going to take that kind of abuse and simply going to tell you go to preserve and mild but he's kind of doing a service for the country by not doing that because it's right john don't you agree if he if he last than trump could appoint someone who would fire lower here
as a sign of where we are in march twenty eight team jeff sessions has become a pillar of democratic work
amazing true not be confirmed for the federal bench right right
amy is there any one particular cars that you see has the potential to unite the many different drugs in america or anything i think it's part of having go at at that
yeah that's interesting
the few things that does unite red and blue america
conservatives
yeah i think effective i think i entered nugent
jeff sessions
i mean like the olympics people come together i mean i'm a little guy i think i'm going to rally around now not to say that they i think fact if if if people the studies that are most optimistic and my guy that if you actually pull people out of their tribes and have them interact assuming
thanks
enormous progress can be made so for example the integration of the military in the fifties was one where everybody said there's no way this is going to work and they went failing that afterwards that was added prejudice in america
now that what this study showed that the integrated you next war and you know there are equal or superior to what they said weiss when you're forced actually when people talk with them
lives are in their hands you use each other's human beings and same attitude stride same sex marriage to actually dramatically change when people started seeing these people as their neighbors their children you know it went from like ninety percent disapproval to sixty two percent approval and just thirty years and are to demonize somebody that you know or group that you know
organizers we have introduced the democrats to the republicans and no it's not just exposure the studies also show that just diverse and exposure is not enough back making the hate each other and more you have to actually interact with each other as human beings when that's car part when you are so tribal right
circle it's no mistake that the civil rights movement the women's movement
the victory in the cold war ultimately came after the mixing experiment of world war two
sailors on p t one o nine were people that jack kennedy would never they would have carried his bag into a hotel
and he the the pacific dribble and really remembered them as as he came through and and the prosperity was important
you know we always the tribes come together but it's always brief and it begins to fall apart again i wouldn't over romanticize the past but i don't think it's a simulation i'm talking about i mean i think where i get my optimism is i as i say in this book i think that alone in my the major powers were what i call a super that it's me and this is not
saying that we've met all these ideals that that we had this over arching national identity
that strong you know not like libya or or but it's strong and at the same time we allow our individual subgroup identities to flourish so they don't all have to melt away i mean we and i think it's as if you look through all the different powers act not even when not if they had to have one or the other but it's strong because it's built around ideas that all different
for all we all cut into the same idea and that is what i find it going away
eric sunni so important to you because you can't just getting people to how do you get people to buy into this national identity unity it's not just by cheering that anthem very loudly right you have the system has to seem legitimate and the dream has to seen accessible to all otherwise to aren't gonna buy into he was about our work cut out for my mother

no other explanation
what the fuck
gradual agents aren't very good good
alabama or redneck contact
father
of course
give me a heart attack
we're talking about dogs dogs dogs to the shooting at us now
it was talking about arming teachers
it would make the track team run faster
phone at it now
can make it more normalized in the school the librarians gotten more out of silence or so

trump trump said the thing that of all the things you said in his whole career the craziness the one that bothered me the most you heard it this rate you said i really believe i would run in mayor even if i didn't have a weapon first of all the guy be of double trouble running
yesterday on my god he had this meeting bipartisan meeting where he just agreed with everybody
democrats and republicans having around that hit whatever anybody said because you don't know anything
assault weapons yeah great idea
armed teachers for that background checks why not sense are very okay let's do it
laws are like a buffet just casino whatever you can pile onto your plate and wobble back to the table with good
oh
completely freaked out the republicans when he suggested raising the age that people could buy a gun to twenty one and then adjusted just off hand seizing guns without due process to people that might pose a threat of course none of that will happen
but for a brief shining moment his stupidity was on the side of good
have you see in pennsylvania
hundreds of couples went to a unification church where the women all dressed in virginal white
when wearing crowns crowns
drinking holy wine and they had their a r f fifteens blessed by the church elders wearing pink and white robes
that happened i read it i was like thank god this is not the story but guns falling into the hands of the mentally ill

scientologists were like pull it together
it bothers me that this park when shooter nobody is talking about the fact that he was a trump supporter
right at the make america great had with swastikas carved into the magazine
it was using and his rightful he had nazi doodles which is ban and favorite votes

the whole text laugh she said she just wants to spend more time breaking up or their families and
what does she will be missed steven mellow today was sniffing sarah huckabee sanders office chair but he said
but he said it's just not the same
now it's it's a little suspicious where she left yesterday because just the day before she spit nine hours before congressional committee where she told them she told white lies
on behalf of the president and apparently when she got back to the white house trump said to her how could you be that stupid
now some people think he was yelling at her i think he was looking for tips
he said he's been in offers thirteen month she said five communications director there's more job security and the walking dead
the ask are day you excited
okay made about trump the shape of walrus
what about milan a thirteen years a slave
tell me that he said

welcome to age be a pipe down from h b o maintenance real time with him
yeah

right



yeah

the i know why i'm happy because kim jong north korea
today it's old south korea
that is willing to meet with the leader of the united states but wasn't available so trumps go
a fat man a little boy
are going to have a day that looks like trump is going to travel to north korea in christian are reason is a hundred reasons why this is dangerous or talking about after all a family that has reneged on every deal they ever signed and kim jong on can't be trusted aide
you know
it's got to all the cable news last night and all these liberals who are reflexively hating on this a obama remember him
proposed the exact same thing in two thousand and eight and they loved it
and they fuck you don't live on the west coast where a new can get here faster than over from north korea
what does is bullshit no president has ever done this yeah and they all failed so i'm going to file this one under so crazy it just might work
this could be the one thing that trump honestly is uniquely qualified to pull off because kim and him rocket man and rain man

mirror image in a weird way they respect and like each other you know trump said he's a smart cookie they had the same interests flattery celebrity tyranny
they both have daddy issues and overeating issues and problematic family members and inexplicably hair

they both love missile parades and both why and their gob scores and one day
f members working for them in the next day they disappear

the one american that kim likes dennis rodman will trump is the closest thing we're going to be get to president dennis rodman
another stupid argument i heard on tv last night well we'll just be giving him the respect he and his family have always craved so what so what if it works my old plant taylor used to hang out with me because i'm a celebrity i still got free weed
and you know it behaved so much i do this may be happening because of donald trump it could be his tough talk it could be because of the sanctions could have been tickets at the olympics who knows what is kim jong on mine it could be because shape of water won best picture
he saw that and thought well if you can fuck affair she can negotiate with a whale

north korea is not the only place trump will be traveling to next week he's come in here to california is that great a didn't want to but this is where the porn stars or
i've been following that we now have a full on sex scandal in the white house stormy daniels is now suing if that was the developed but this week on monday she filed a lawsuit enough you forgot who she is daniels
if you recall
okay the man who got eighty percent of the evangelical vote for president
sixteen and the star of toxic cum laude six
met at the at a golf tournament in two thousand and six after which she was paid to shut up about it but sarah huckabee standards is really fucked up and she said in the press briefing that trump one in arbitration case
with her a lie that contradicted her original why that trump had nothing to do is stormy daniels so now it's just that he said gee said stormy says they had an affair and trumps says they didn't but who are you going to believe the fake blonde with big tits or stormy daniel

i couldn't wait to do that
but here's the story day does not suing for money she is suing for the right to talk about the fat disgusting trump sex that jihad
she wants to get out of the non disclosure agreement you signed and trumps lawyers this week said they want to issue a gag order and she said that cost extra
but here's why
here's where she has a case because in the settlement papers first of all the settlement papers trump goes by an alias
and alias david denison
david denison because dirt degree was to on the know
what those set up this settlement might be invalid because trump mean drug dealer
forgot to sign it this happens a lot to a stable genius
but it is always going out about other countries in latin to get it out
now really not even big as the president fox porn stars but ticket she has a better lawyer

gonna on drop manage to find the one woman in america to have sex with him who then wanted to talk about it
usually when he sector so many says don't tell anyone in they're like not a problem
but the best part is that the documents say that this drama daniels has quote certain still images which to me sounds like depicts what what else can still images that he doesn't one out there and you can tell it's trumps dick in the picture because well two reasons
first it was a big sign on top of the trump penis

and also it's and sean hannity his mouth anyway

very wife somebody or kinds of first up is a grammy winner and a two time emmy winning canadian and actors who holds the guinness record for most comedy specials by a woman more importantly she is a good american who loves her country and should be able to work in it kathy griffin



do i did i cut my hair very very sharia while shame in our hands down pissed off waiting were angry or shame our heads just fine to scare you guys down first of all i really want to thank you for being one of the first and only people to publicly support me and say what happened was bullshit

attacks from celebrities that were like and don't have any i think this tag
yeah i don't care you all the way here
jerry seinfeld now
as if we yet there's never been in jerry's i felt exactly yeah but no data
but we've missed you

one thing nobody could ever take away that you are a hard worker i love it now you will love it you got where you are through hard work you joke by joe and joke at a time
i never had a writer i never had a stereo i never had a manager inches are grinding it out and and so i love doing so for you to have it all taken away overnight it just really pissed me off more than anything because i mean look you took a picture you took a very bad salty
i blame the dog for i've been on these photo shoot and they're always trying to do something provocative writer said hey why don't you know lackey picture the wacky picture and it turned out to be a little do what he has quite wacky okay it was very wacky and but you know if it wasn't the united states had babies the first thing you said was look i went to florida i get it it should have been over
she gets it fine but of course everybody has to go bat shit about everything oh yeah i'm yeah and actually the south the analogy is a really good because almost like imagine if you tip know what he had the worst suffering in the world he went to and you woke up and you found out that the president waited about it which then mobilize the right for everybody
else and then he also lot it was illegal which right
peaceful but not illegal covered by the first amendment know i went to
i mean
i went through something like this yours is worse because you are actually interrogated you were to two months federal investigation by two departments from the o j that aren't yes right i mean after nine eleven i had this on my walls and or while the variety headline the white house keeps heat on a b c s i
remember very well yeah ok so and it was bad ari fleischer was talking about the in the press coverage every day but you had it far worse because you literally had your livelihood taken away from you'll get my show can go and we are ratings never dropped i haven't had my eye was in the middle of a fifty cent each your and i had like twenty five day
it's up until the following fat february because it's happened i may thirtieth teams he was reporting my show cancellations and real time which scared i think the theaters so the theaters which i don't blame because although some you know normally they do like stomp her mama mia and all the sudden they're getting robo calls from like a lot farm in macedonia going if i say that bitch on stage i'm been it
cutter and the chopper head off and put her head up or count that one
no joke that was the number one reason that the
folks who are angry want to kill me that's the monroe and procedure don't want to do
moving on
yeah was it was ugly and yeah i mean
it really get out ahead i think when when the official security apparatus of the united states of america would you'd think would have something better to do and i am sure knew better than you were somehow a threat to the president will they interrogated you you have flying is still a problem for you yeah i mean you are on the deal is know you're on the no fly list
life is much better deal
yeah i'm on the interpol list and so when i couldn't get work here after an interpol the international criminal yeah so i did and overseas tour i did fifteen countries and twenty three cities and i was detained and every single airport which is frightening because they see it and they scan your passport they see it
way this is really scary when you're at the singapore airport and you see the person go like this
and then there's like whispering and then they put me and like a detention room and you don't know how long it's going to take and i'm thinking you know i got she excuse me have it
like show i gotta make soccer moms and gay guys laugh
various in all seriousness there were times when they took my devices that can do that and you might think you know we all have our rights but when you're in that moment you're are really at the mercy of one or two people in that room so it happened happen happened l a x they happened in london heathrow
and it's scary every time you don't quite know what it is so to do it all over again
resume take the picture but if i did my parents now i'm kidding

i waited to do that job allows it
what would you do anything over it
was the aftermath of oh yeah i mean everything about the aftermath was it truly is a historic situation so one of the things i like doing about touring is as you know you're on stage and you can really tell your story without censorship and stuff so the current show i'm doing actually does have a couple serious moments in it because when i described that interrogation you can
hear a pin drop in mean like i said i've just and twenty three cities and fifteen countries and the intensity of those moments when my first amendment attorney said to me you know if this doesn't go well you you leave your handcuffs and the deal j called my attorneys every single day for two months did she come in yet did she come any the everyday they call them
and we can do a it's called a no knock which is what they did department for her no not come in and i'd be like fine c'mon any we can take that back three boys cities
so name was crazy and but that's how crazy it was so i was determined to not do like a walk so it cost me a lot of money of course but at least be able to negotiate the interrogation happening in my attorney's office but it know just been told you could leave in cuffs
you know when it came straight from the d o j and white house
so and that's that's administration that we have now so that's what i am here to talk about his i really believe that it happened to me and i really believe it could happen to you and other people or people's kids around is it could happen it's gotten crazy mean
we're not going
that picture
but i do believe what you're saying in journal is correct everything that was unthinkable two years ago lose think it will not dictatorship fascism all those kinds of things
libertarians are going you nor nothing is off the to correct okay so do you think i know some friendships were casualties and i'm down to three guys
i hear your flow and i hear your fluid
very trendy now very hard sell tickets
and this place treatment
so i want to got can from cnn which sucked because i was never here in an employee only one night a week that they made like this sweeping statement and well i was going on jr was like of all people like don junior that freaking crow mag like early human whatever it deal is goes out what good morning america and
i'm just want to ruin catholic reference career we want to decimate her and that was flight months after the photo so what do do some not decimated right no you're not

we need comedians know that sounds like a proud of what are the what we really do you honestly in this era to to sometimes go over the long yeah we know where the lines are and also to establish that we do live in the country with reece beach that was distasteful it might have been a lot of
it was free speech yeah free speech is still covered the board and most important and also the outright is kind of co op didn't like weren't
somebody knocks over a garbage can set on fire and their all right person of say that's free speech but they kind of co opted that but you know you and i do the kind of comedy to push boundaries and and to do that you have to move them and then cross them and push them again and see what works and i'm finding like i know you're on the road as well i'm finding that people are wanting that kind of comedy or in such an intense times
people are jogging can't jokes know i mean
the does flu
the real deal and they want to be very mean to donald trump
i am too i'm definitely try i do have by the way in a small victorious announcement soccer okay so i'm dipping my toes into touring again even though the trams and nobody wants me to work again but i'm doing my toes and and i just booked today i'm going to do a show at carnegie hall in new york
i'm also going to go right to terms backyard and do a show at the kennedy center
yeah




as a conservative radio show it was founder of the resurgent dog carbon author of of for you wake life lessons from a father to his children eric ericsson's bug where this year
okay she's a geo please draw and blow to contribute to see it and i don't have our
i'm pretty no vehicle parents ages theater in minneapolis march seventeenth in the ago in fargo and marjorie to try crowder
so are listening to a monologue or do you want some the girls that
i'm sure a lot of people weren't thinking that is when i was going to say about trump and north korea because you know we live in this tribal world where everything has to be the blue team of the road team and look this deal may blow
we're talking about it right now
for i just i just want to read obama has quote from two thousand and eight and just remind people where he was because he was asked in a debate if he would meet with the leaders of iran syria and north korea venezuela cuba without preconditions and he said i would and the reason is this that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them
which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration
meaning the bush administration is ridiculous and hillary cat cold state department turn it and everybody said but the based loved it and he won the primary any made the money
general election and if it was good enough for him i think it's good enough know i think there is one key difference there
very very keen on reminding us of this yeah donald trump is not barack obama
i'm with you on give it a chance it's better than the alternative and i'm all for diplomacy but i'm still i'm not gonna sit here and say that i have a lot of inspired confidence and this working out in our main to may watch these two guys debate on what to do about the nuclear situation and north korea is like watching
to hammered drunk bricklayers debate about what to do with a brain tumor
them but i know already at the worst place it could be they i mean i was in hawaii just a few days before that alert came over this year and i had friends there said of course we were shooting and are painted came over in our fallen to the missile is in the air this is a real this is right and the absolute look i
i have an underlying and barack obama said that i wasn't answer i was against him
giving confessions to that take on cuba i thought that was on a good idea to me this is different because that's got nukes and then as a sense of urgency now and i live in the east cause i live in miami i gonna lot faster than i am but i think that as a sense of urgency that that makes it less explore whatever solution is that being
said the idea of donald trump negotiating with the came as i'd what are they going to do put their buttons on the table and have been better button
but yes but probably you know that
the bluster blurted that know it's not an unprecedented in the history of diplomacy for the peace breakthrough to come after the two guys have their who's dick is longer shouting match at each other we've had three consecutive administration's that everytime north korea saber rattled we paid him money we gave them food and now we've got a president
true i you wouldn't say it's incompetence or something different whatever he said not going to do it this time and suddenly they want to come have a face to face meeting give it to my mean she had i started he was towards taken out and we never will
try something arrest has already has it except for the bomb actually exploring a kind of reminds me of when we talk about mass shootings and somebody says deliberate talking point and i'm certainly not for arming people but they say what if somebody else was in that room with a gun or would have made it even worse really really could have gotten worse
just the guy who's a not spraying the room it can't get any worse
except for being annihilated
not from could bring the nuclear war on by going there next and the had a winner
i'm going to be pleased to hear he doesn't understand diplomacy i agree with he doesn't understand math or spelling or science
but he does understand schmoozing there is something about these two guys i think that is very simple go they say i have a yo mama contest your mama is so ugly and just go at each other
i don't have you have the insult say i didn't think i have has been going and crescendo with north korea it's gotten worse increasingly so there is a sense of of what had happened
kim these what thirty two thirty three he's been in office five or six years he's done a lot of bad things we saw assassinate his family members and so forth well it's a rough go over there i'm guess we will take over and you use a ruthless dictator the be learned from his father you got to eliminate the competition first drums of business band
the a way
maybe he did that and now he's ready for something new he's going to be an it's another fifty years he can see that map you know that map they show at night of the two koreas yeah south korea ablaze with electricity north korea completely dark his people are in the dark about that he has seen that and he's probably thinking he might be fun
and to join the world lights on things
they may falling falling forget porto rico thinks their fame will be nice to have

we got nothing with they've gotten closer and closer and closer to bomb with american experts saying they're not going to get a bomb it is time to do something different world not for nothing but i'll be stoned if did actually even happened yet he's already very very mundane but never underestimate how important respect is to people just the
of him getting this meeting could calm things down a lot sometimes that's all they want is to be treated like an equal like wow we went to a meeting with the united states now we can all breeds a little and i will tell you it's not only campbell wants respect it's tramp who wants respect and he listens to the media and i think that if he sees
people sending him affirmative wants to make you know kim likes porn stars
right yeah bring stormy day
okay so let's rather the other war the trade war drums started this is pretty crazy first of all answer me this panel somebody answer this for me donald trump went to wharton least on the smoothest he does not seem to understand what a trade death
is he talks about like we give them money and they give us nothing that's not a trade deficit that's trump university

doesn't get the eight
come on
to be an actor is he must understand that we get something back
for all the double trouble the campaign trail bashing liberals and and liberal academics he's being led by peter navarro or a fringe in our relation yeah no no
he's been basically i guess is down return
period of our was a university academic it i leave university california at irvine he's a result ha papers on china none of them and maybe one democrat canyon you use a diplomatic candidate repeatedly very liberal wanted to ban the incandescent light bulb
donald trump bought into his china rhetoric and brought him on board for tourists there is not a liberal or conservative economists alive or in the past hundred years who thought they were a good idea but this guy apparently knows the buttons to push with the president but as with everything he made this big pronouncement and now we see him doing caveats and convey
pushing and pulling back it is be the only consistent thing about donald trump if his inconsistency we signed to do with integration we signed do it with guns with saw him do it was guarding days from the military the guy you know can hold more positions then become a filter
yeah
now everybody came with
don't have a shot at
no i don't think that that he understands the day there but i do think he understands that his base also doesn't understand it really a main the tariffs and every he knows they're going to say about
joe millionaire stock market well that went down but tell me this why is this fringe economics but not trickled down why is his tax cut in prosperous times is almost no economist who think that that's a good though i would disagree with you on that i think there's definitely a liberal conservative divide on economics but it's hardly an equal device
you can always find a few notes anyway listed when there is very few people night the i mean the university chicago is a prominent economic school that pushed ronald reagan back of the nineteen eighties on the idea of supply and may have a panel now with like forty two economists who also this was a bad idea
do but
yeah the not into that
you know this isn't a situation like tears there actually is an academic divide on this with tariffs is like the anti vaccine crowd were you have that doctor saying don't give kids vaccines that tariffs there's actually a pretty academic a rigorous group of conservative economic economists who supports supply side economics okay i a question you know
so no growing up poor model life when is it going to start trickling down

you know they just tried trickle down economics to get in kansas it was a disaster i mean they have tried this experiment and the keep trying because we already have the results but whenever they do this you cut taxes some out to this magical point and then you orange why i and my boat and when
acts as a nineteen eighty one when didn't hack work in two thousand and one we saw an increase revenue the problem is the spin the inside of republicans who say they want to cut government and they never actually do if they actually did super bowl cut she would actually see an increase in income and government has because republicans used to be anti spending they also will they be against and delta or a precedent
good
when it comes to stimulating the economy i mean you give more money to rich people a barrel oil futures and shit
but you can win money to poor people they buy
i just

the last three months since the tax cut past we have seen very good headlines come out of this tax cut we have seen good numbers would have seen good job numbers it's an experiment and we're going to see what the short term is looking good and it's helping trump we've got to see with the long term was going to me it's going to be an exponent either republicans were right or we were wrong on
fortunately there's going to screw something option
okay will people
gary coleman is comparable to those removed over the terms of the warriors people are losing this worried how can you imagine the fact that this guy who apparently you know who and abetting reported and said that he thought of leaving over the response to charlottesville over trump equating neo nazis to those protesting against and found his
moral compass over tariffs least finally found
administration officials to quit over on principle
people have not sled the white house this bunch and the british were burning it may two
so what happened is there going to put up some motivational posters you know these motivation and just williams i'm here are like people put these up in their office team work great things are done by a series of small things done together and know a good morale up with their authors attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference so would you like to see some of the ones are put
up the white
their lungs like it's been sixteen days since our last indictment
this one hundred percent of the procedure don't grant
hope she doesn't work anymore

teamwork a better word for collusion
character always stay in it
integrity when in doubt just chat locker up
sacrifice there's no i in treason
dream big as the ugly married guys who dated whole picks
and believe at the end of this shit show there's gotta be at least a book deal
they are


then so good
so quickly
but it didn't do it ever really loved you and also years voted on my side about a lot of issues and by this point of the show i'm so argued
you can pick up the flag out but i know we're both sort of fighting the outrage machine you know the the professional outrage people and let's just get out because i saw you got some hot water for nothing i've got a bunch of hot water okay without the immigration into the point where like i don't even know what the fuck they mad it anymore i used to at least go okay
i get it i understand it's ridiculous but i get nine even understand what they're meant it the tweet was what you were watching when the olympics in orion a gas to a person born in california her parents are japanese immigrants and landed a historic triple axel happy in illinois
it out video along with a lyric from hamilton that said immigrants they get the job done and now the actual lyric is we i got the lyric wrong how dare you and i jumped up on now here's the thing any i despise the in a phobia anyone who reads and i work you know is that i love in the grants and as the idea they now hold on the idea that i
it would in any way a contribute to a culture of hostility towards minorities and immigrants is horrible to me and i feel awful that anyone heard it that way
what is what is your estimation of why there's this fringe on the list that attacks people like you and me who they must know are not racist
as it just lazy
it's just too hard to attack the real villain i think that if you fight battles way behind enemy lines think a it's the narcissism small differences anyone that departs from work orthodoxy gets a lot more heat in my opinion been people on the actual right i also think that offense taking is being weapon i used it is a route now too
political power saying that i am offended is a way of making someone radio active it's a way of smearing the reputation of making them a liability because once you tar someone as a racist or a misogynist or a fascist or whatever the word of the day is you know it's a way of taking them down a peg and i'm really concerned not appellate
you know people that have a public platform like me are like you but the downstream effects of these earrings because here's what happens if you're someone who wants to get into the public square and wants to teach something provocative and keep your head out over the pair you are not gonna do that you were going to hesitate and doing that if you know that there's a mob waiting you and you see
what happens new to very very prominent people for for saying sort of the smallest things it yeah man i day one more thing
i mean just husband died and i call it so the shooting of won't i really i've been revisiting the philip roth book the human stain okay the human stay in two sentences on it it's about a classicist at a small liberal arts school who uses the word spooks meaning go he means it literally it's taken as a racist slur and
what happens to him his personal ruin the irony of this is he himself is a light skinned black man who is passing as a jew
i'm reminded of this because we sort of live in the age of the digital stain what people are trying to do is to take even the most well intentioned and anna die and comment intentionally torque it and then throw it out through the echo chamber of social media in order to ruin people's reputations and i think it's very strange that were live with them
most privileged people in human history objectively and yet people are spending all of their time on earth hurling pixels at one another i made very very strange use of people's time will

people are scared to front of the real people who talk in private with the friends and how they conduct themselves in the yeah that's not a man those like because everybody's on social media that's like their avatar and that person is super politically correct right out as reason it's like everybody has
their own publicist who's them on social media
which makes it but i also it's the opposite also in real life people are civilized people say i'm sorry i didn't mean that you're standing but on social media they're acting like tor on i mean are usually we should also not lose sight of the fact of how much the russians have been employing thing and involving themselves in social meet
fight on both sides to sow discord in america i don't know how much of the of those attacks that go against you or against you or against me or my actual people on how many our butts well most of the there's actual issues that were minute please
petitions you know that the u n i read in a respectable publications and you know rather than talking about i don't know i find it amazing that there are a feminist web sites that are dedicated to attacking people as being insufficiently feminist rather than i don't know talking about gender apartheid in saudi arabia or iran
it is a real perversion of priority of your dog or the road

nail in iran for taking off their her job
no one is talking about that in the leftist media why is that that's a question we should be asking well those talking about of your many terms and will come back you have come back soon animals or just that but let me let me ask about the movies because you watch the oscars i did okay
i didn't suit okay to working
but
what i heard was that nobody wanted to say anything that you can talk anymore where you can talk about intersection at year about how the ideal man doesn't have a deck which one's for jimmy joke and i don't think that that appeals to most americans i know that there's a ridiculous still popular the tickets
yeah exactly
it's done many bad things what it is bob
so i think that look i think that there is incredibly important role for culture and for artists and for movie makers to move the culture in amazing ways ellen changed the change the culture really embrace change the culture get out this year call me by your name i do believe that
art has a really important in crucial role to play in cultural progress but i don't think that people are tuning into award shows to be hacked to know by celebrity and i also hated that if you don't like black panther or wonder woman neither which obscene
what is you don't like them your bit version yes and the and than the answers for the bullet there's no
just gotta and there's no bottom to it black panther is now getting torn apart because apparently there was a lesbian plot line in an earlier generation of a tough and they took and how know how the public mostly emma stone emma staunch emma stone tried to be woke and say the right thing she introduced the category for best director
and she introduced it as for man and gregor awake will she got torn apart as a white feminists which is now an insult because she didn't mention jordan peel and gear del toro were also in that category it's like being angry at us over compliment in the sunrise and saying why are you talking about the sunset to but i mean it's it's not yours
for something
even if they wife
they can agree with your nanny by personal everything you say and that five percent but
people and the party the country that sounds like you
yes think
think about all i said new year red state to what did they think about this insanity i mean the movie where the lady parks the fish feller
yeah
a little weird
well that's true i mean the movies are not what america is watching i mean i feel a little distance from the movie winners are lately i haven't seen the siege rocking movie
look i think i'm going to hate it but i'm i love i love it i think of it but i might love with i like i may not allow a little last time i saw best movie winner for the awesome right i get to the movies all the time i take my kids to the movies but it's like what hollywood thing
sure the greatest movies they're not what my family goes to see i mean for god's sakes the dark knight should have gotten the best best picture back when and that led to the initial controversy they've been talking about it ever since and they keep getting even more esoteric in the movies on unnecessarily i do think that the country is in a state of hyper sensitive
pity because because of what's coming from downtown because of what yes
hey guys i'll tell you start with dollar each other but he's made it was no
made everything worse
know
under attack and are up and you have it backwards the country was so politically you know what i'm going to say it was so politically correct that he was the antidote for sale like it
hotels are like it is even a out like
he's now for let's not politically correct don't think he's made one of she's made him most he is young people hypersensitive
he's like a champ is run it
right there in a hair trigger waiting to be offended if not to have been scant it's not to further divide in divide and divide the left we should be meeting donald trump's in in liberalism with liberalism not right
packers instead of people saying that seen a full way an anti immigrant this well they should have main focus on that faggot suddenly get it as i about died like it's donald trump is the comment section of the internet come to life and the white house
those read the comments section i think the media spins way too much time partially in every little thing he says on twitter should ignore that stuff and focus on the big picture is president of the united states senate hunting
united states but again a lot to talk about the bigger issue a good on old drop stormy daniels how about you
it sounds physicians but honestly i think this could in a weird way be the thing that brings me down because this is what do you think what i mean we'll look up what brought clinton to impeachment for tonight i'll bet second of all my colleague michelle goldberg had a great column about this where she explained it is not a sex scandal this is a a campaign finance
scandal and transparency scandal and
i think if this brings him down rather than i had it was even who was going to impeach and republicans i mean paul ryan granted and ah fair enough paul ireland and this week that the stormy daniel thing was not on his radar rob rayner is broken
later in life i was a campaign finance law you're gonna help me
it doesn't matter because you have a u f
that is split democrat and republican with an independent investigative unit that doesn't bow to either side politically because it's got the protection of a fifty fifty split on the pc they begin invest in things if your lawyer is get treated in his home equity to pay someone one hundred thirty thousand dollars to keep them silent to benefit your campaign
i don't care what he says this was a benefit and unkind contribution an out of pocket contribution to benefit donald trump's campaign there are huge potential legal violations for this that i mean go back to the john edwards situation when people were doing it for him saying let's not tell him we're doing this he still got indicted for it yeah but john edwards was held accountable
right right down to never is i'm with honor they don't give a shit
where in california through and already have man like wow
where you are one of the few even genitals christian leaders who have actually holding donald trump accountable he has hand apoplectic question right saying he gets mulligan i am yeah having one a and to a fair enough i mean it's just the hypocrisy and i imagine just for a moment

and i am by the way he did it michelle obama when he killed him
one of the reasons i remember given that why we couldn't vote for hillary was because can you imagine the scandals can you imagine the fatigue we'd have with the scandals with hillary law might be honest and showed up at the base slapping of you know all of that people who had accused bill clinton will put his accusers were going any a stadium
to be running a web t shirt contest in a parking lot in panama city and as trumps showed up at would lower the trial
and they let him get away they don't it doesn't seem to bother them the christian right
only they going to go in the christian right i've gotta say in his heart felt that your particular pastors who surround him who are in a transaction a relationship with him who if they really care about they would if they believe their faith tell him to repent and they're not because there were any transaction a relationship and one day they will be held accountable by in a very angry god
yeah
just want to measure one more thing west virginia yeah the teacher strike one
and
at me when you say well i leave lips the ultimate red state mr redstone stringing that way right and this was a union thing and i think people saw teachers and they saw them like literally bringing bag lunches to the students who very often don't get a meal except when they go to schools of the schools are closed the kids don't eat and you know
i just kept thinking the reason why the stadium so strapped for cash one trickle down economics they tried that bullshit
and too because true implied he didn't bring cold background because you can't bring coal back and so i just wonder when those people are going to catch up to it forget about the moral dimension of just what about the economic demand i think that so i think it is a win for liberals but i think there's a real opportunity there for it to be an even bigger win
on a grander scale when it comes to the american left if they see it for the opportunity that it is because of everything you just said because they got their pay raise in west virginia but leadership's going to pay for it by slashing funding from other places like maybe medicaid or community colleges pretty shitty way to go about it if the democrats realized i could come in here and tell these people
we are the party of labor if i go to arizona kentucky oklahoma where the raptor to strike emily measured nine west virginia every murder one if they had any web when and i'll tell you i think that we're will sign west virginia and what we saw today in florida with the gun law that was finally passed in florida
three mad
the last two years what we saw as a victory for activism one what's by the teachers in west virginia and for their students of parkland that demand action and say we're not going to take this crap anymore going to florida legislature and their leaders and they got results today bird for them

since the shape of water just won the oscar for best picture hollywood has to do what it does best did to death signals
the one of those stories about lonely people banging animals
jake jail at all and broke back mountain lion
woody allen and take the money and run
and jon voight in midnight cow
she said
if you're driving this thing that good through my windshield and kill me tying a hanky on it does it make it okay
and there were all the on us to pause website has to explain your article is all about how this kitten and this baby our best friends how come the look on both their faces as if you're a little smaller id view
you know people turning into a werewolf have to stop staring at their hands
they're like turning into a where was i i feel like i'm turning into a werewolf but i'd better check oh fuck
yeah were still people here in l a and the rain check the do they say i knew rain
yeah
oh i don't want to try your home brew beer
keep your carbonated bong water
as a term for guys who make booze where they live inmates

and finally no role it's time to admit president trump or is actually accomplish one good thing he's ruined the phrase thoughts and prayers forever
first the problem with thoughts and prayers and has always been that thoughts are the opposite of prayers
one instrument
one is from the enlightenment and one is from the exercise
but it wasn't until trump treated his thoughts and prayers after the park when shooting and one of the survivors treated back i don't want your condolences you fucking piece of shit prayers will fix this that prayer officially became an eye roll
yes america is finally getting a prayer doesn't work because if it did every drug test would come back clean and deadly
and then be no need for the morning after pill
but it's more than just prayer thanks to trump piety itself has ceased to be a third rail in american politics how could it any more when the world's least godly man has been so fully embraced by our most religious people evangelicals all they love them some donald trump a man has been to church four times
and his whole life free of them to get married

the only time he touches a bible is for depositions
and if we ever went to confession they have to take a meal break
he's into golden showers not the golden rule

it's true he does not treat people the way he wants to be traded
so and trump got his mulligan from the values voters that's when we new religion have jumped the shark and it was finally safe to say none for me thanks i had bullshit for lunch
look at some of these recent examples billy graham my entire life i've watched presidents from both parties suck up to this blowhard like he was the american gandhi
but when he died last month it covered like olympic curling local storyteller did at ninety nine
morose last week openly mocked mike pence for believing jesus tells him to say things mocked by i'm rosa it's like getting dunked on by kevin hart

even oprah was widely made fun of when she said god if you think i'm supposed to run for president you gotta tell me and and it has to be so clear that not even i can miss it and a lot of america said oh please not the i have to check with my imaginary friend excuse which was bad enough when people like scott walker
said i am certain this is god's plan for me something got also told rick perry rick santorum ben carson michelle bachmann herman cain sarah palin got is a nice guy but he doesn't follow politics

folks this is progress i used to be a lonely pioneer here calling religious thinking the neurological disorder but now it's like a everyone's doing it
and in that there is a lesson for the democrats things that used to be third rails don't have to be third rails forever republicans get that for fifty years their fundamental principles were law enforcement good russia bad and then
freaky friday
twenty years ago the idea of arming teachers was universally derided but now while we'd point and laugh they're doing it
democrats on the other hand begun every gotten conversation with i support the second amendment
because they fear this is one of those third rails i can never be touched even shooting victims then when they wake up from their calmer their first words or i still support the second that
now would it be a hard slog to change the public's mind on guns of course but a hard slog never phases conservatives ronald reagan used to be a joke now he's an airport

the second amendment is just words humans made up at a certain moment in history when they felt right it's an amendment not a commandment and we can make up

could make up new words again instead of the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed we could change it to the writer the people to apply for the privilege of possessing non military style weaponry as long as they're not bat shit crazy shall not be and

circa near agree with larry kudlow that medicare and social security should be handed to wall street to privatisation is a good age for sure i'm sure he is for for that now
saturday
were you want to go where i don't know what do you what do you check it out
marrying a question
gosh i think i think it through a problem i think the privatization of so many things actually especially when it comes to people's parents in retirement a lot of our problem has been that so i would i'm going i'm going to educate the other it as an economist who plays
i'm just going to give me the other argument go for i've seen the shard of were money if you put your money in the stock or us vs if you just put it in the bank or whether it will do better in the market like the market one goes like this no you can't watch it every year because the market goes up and down but over the time if you put it in when you were twenty one why bother
tell you retired at sixty five book and he goes like this
we had a force for savings program i'm just the way we had a real for saving five and where you couldn't take it out and somebody else and will affect affected going to be managed elsewhere and there was a guarantees on it i can go for that it's not the crazy great
that bush
where is your uncle george work
yeah it is my he's my gut and to think about the had a there's a lot of us cause is it adds an okay job
if you're getting out
there's a lot of us now much so
how was the rest of the bush family holding up under trump courage to take the high road i think is right i'm not sure either one cares that vote for him
in fact i'm pretty sure they didn't speak and made to stuff
the old man starts sure skated on the us
i've ever talked to him about idled and never again you hear me don't do that
no because there was a conservative it sounds like the same thing you know that al franken was accused of in that just went into the ether
okay except for peace a former president of united states
you know people didn't know that about and there's a whole bunch of women said it's pretty pretty messed up pretty unacceptable and there was a joke that when when it's disgusting and inexcusable
right you are always create of
well i mean there's no upside yeah yeah i'm with you
i'm not sure what al franken did i'll just say that i'm but i'm not talking about happy either one i mean who who is grabbing i'm in a photo op too weird it is weird
and everybody wants a photo a bill maher had you ever even considered i mean a touch of lectures well i guess exact
hands up
why does the and are re get a tax exemption and how do we take it away

they do they would like to say that i don't want a political action committee but i do have that when and otherwise they're saying they're grassroots nonprofit organization but dave use illegal corporate tax loopholes to build out an entire political lobbying way that doesn't get taxed so that that is that the corporate tax loophole but that's also because he knows how to work the system or do other
and then how to use a crisis
but i never let a crisis go to follow the money on the right now we're arming teachers you know yet they somehow turn one channel and sure any other moving ahead in many states somehow they turn that around to to find a way they could so morgan it's moving ahead in the states where they still beat kids with paddles
i mean it's not i don't think it's taking hold certainly it's not there is no agreement with eggs educators and experts about our mean teachers teachers don't want that when they just because a on money on the entering go after him on the taxes or whatever it is but the real thing the real opportunity given like cover cover the world of finance is the company's it's all the companies that
do business with the and people who do business with guns it's the credit card companies that allow the transactions on the cards it's apple tv an amazon and everybody will allows this stuff over there airwaves that washington unfortunately i don't hate and fear and i could be wrong i hope i'm wrong but i think in the meantime there's a huge swath of stuff that can
actually happen but it depends that everybody actually generally not asked to the action relate to your pocketbook right consumers have to wait about two years before we can use our powers citizens to kick somebody's out of office i can make a decision tomorrow if i want to go to a different store if i don't like walmart walmart
they didn't you since they got the business of a to didn't have
but dick's sporting goods dead
i got
i got paddled a couple of times and i now
the story me
only when you do something really bad
delahunt show had a didn't have like males in it or anything
not quite sure what kind of paddling he's talking about when they wish to live on
alyssa
have you worked in the white house would you resign and principal or stay to help minimize the damage trump causes out so i i don't think there's any heroism and serving in this white house anymore i think initially people really did think that john kelly i'm going to serve my country and do this but it's you're not serving the pub
like at this point right you're serving trump and his personal trump interests and that's that's just not yet known whether they are right but the very clear what they are actually are advancing his family and right or else is willing to line his pocket bucks whether it be russian oligarchs or any other dictators and he may or may not want to emulate but there is and i guess i i
i did work in the white house and there is no question that i would ever work in a chunk white house and the sad thing is everybody who walked out has walked out tarnish like it's it's yeah it's a dead end job rigorous fairly close to the sun
would you have
he has a better reputation than sean slice or not you want john early monica lewinsky is doing better bright wise and chong spite started the former why know any good as you can attest anyone who kids in contact with human wood chipper people just
the guy it on he
no do a job that donald trump you shouldn't be wanting to me and i and i do want to go out and i do want to thrown about public public servants who are i was a political appointee there are public servants and the foreign service and military civil servants who keep the dated a function of government running the fact that they are failing demoralize is a massive problem because they're the ones who make sure we don't
things like our social security checks always say is the real problem though is if look you can call all the people who showed up in the beginning and opportunists which they are today they're the new people are believers and fortunately or unfortunately fortunate for trump an unfortunate rebels cartoon villain but but but the opportunity to the degree of thought that they were saving the country from trump those people don't
yeah and so i think there has to there has to be some thought about whether you do want some diversity of thought in the room but you even a kind of people i don't know what can i answer as he has to want the diversity of thought and it really doesn't like what do you get out of serving like that haven't won any i fix anything that's what they're there
claiming these days all over to is that he why that's why there's there's turn over because he he has this he added he likes to see people go out a fight and like this
the guy doesn't look as though she had a kid like why i like to see people go at it if i wanted it is how we know the boardroom i mean this is how he's the host of the apprentice on fire he instigate and he may old boy about selling lemonade on a corner
i don't like it wasn't all there for us to but he had been in the owners think he'd be able to take business savvy and apply that to politics and all his other things and and policy may be so many people have probably even though don't you it is and it's shady business deals that's on a works in real estate it doesn't work and all those your policy how many those voters convinces my question how many those voters that he did can
events
have changed their mind or more importantly that has anybody said since trump was elected you know i was really against him the whole time but these fourteen months he really impressed me i
i to reconsider my vote
that's like one guy is a pagan foreigner are

welcome to l h b a pipe down from h b o maintenance real time
garbage slander what your democrats were you doing in order to win
still the true
it's important you know when when
you don't have to go to the far left you don't have to go to the far right
mears we solve problems and i think people look to say how come you can't solve any problems and that's what we do and people are not as ideologically bet i believe in the country as we seem to think that they are just think you gotta you gotta get things done
your it out a country run by all women may that's true for that
we're going to have a fighter democratic point like the republicans are going to have about center left right that's going to be a battle royale and prepares for the future
krishna is what do you say to people that claim that emerson embassies the liberal equivalent of fox news
defended your network many times on that point it makes me crazy because
fox news does not stick to reality
and that's nbc is liberal leaning that they stick to reality but i'll let you add to their question what do you say to people and that your network only focuses on trumps for profits
so i'll take the first second the first question which is that the way to understand fox news it was built by a very unique man named roger alles know who had a foot in two different worlds he was a tv show business guy and he was a politics guy is a guy who advised richard nixon and five george w bush what he was building and the
owner of that network robert and rupert murdoch was explicitly a political project that was the goal from the beginning it was an ideological project it was a political project it was a media product that has never been the case at emits say never been the case there is no roger ales and i missed it was never believe me it was not built by ernie els like figure
it ended up being where it is in primetime largely because he founded audience for that
yeah jobs was army yeah and it was a reflection of of the fact that by hook or by crook a market demand was found which brings the second point that you focus on track for ratings daughter was present united states and it turns out people really want to hear about what the united states is doing and there's only so much that you're going to apollo
guys for covering the president
and
and i
everybody's ratings are up due to donald trump and by the way he loves that and takes credit for and then he was jokes his favorite the just seem excited he doesn't want anyone else to make money on the fact that they're using his image and and persona to make money with wants to figure out how it can all come day i you feel intensely
before the exposure election where did the robot
say you'd hate it if i was boring
as if it as important thing is that the emperor toss britain which to the employee absolutely and sak that's how he picks people to apparently he like alter as he is interesting as opposed to make master who are boring and or yeah
right
thousands were you called liberals useful idiots of the russians would you say it applies to republicans and know
okay so i'm sure it's like a giant of the title of my book was useful idiots i was eight and the of art okay
was it was a quote from vladimir lenin who said that other girls in the west would be useful idiots for us and we could tell them all kinds of lies and they repeat them and out so that was my point was i think it's still valid
i think guess it doesn't apply to some republicans to the trial and regarding yeah that totally not all though there are some there i just want to say this on behalf of the republican party since i've been hard on them and i do think that we can either save this great american institution or we can turn the page and i think we should save their republican party
or maybe i keep saying go back to republican classic i think there's yeah yeah right
need somebody is mitt romney is looking pretty good know
gina other any regulations that you would be in favor of repealing i really good question
yeah the ones about those garage door opener

i am
well i don't love the every regulation the only regulate when you feel like is and need to do that when somebody is harming somebody else and you need to resolve a market feel so yeah there are some that should go away and we look at them and we required to look at them like every five or eight years
you look at them you make changes you try to keep up to date but what you don't do is go in with a list of things that you want to get rid of regardless of knowing anything about them are looking at them and do it for the sole purpose of reducing business cost to certain constituencies that's not

how old trumps trade war to stabilize us foreign relations
he he kind of went back on the steel one right
any put one's on
such a classic a mean girl with the shiites
i'm still terrified still terrorists is a great example of a very efficient means of producing corruption which is to say i don't answer black a blanket era of but i'll make some one on one side deal with everybody like maybe you stay at the trump hotel and maybe you hook up my son in law with some financing and going we can work out it's like it really is a classic means
using the state to produce corruption the now we've got all these the individual bilateral deals are going to carve it out ultimately what it's going to end up with his china's going to punch back right now we are not in a trade war were of the beginnings of something that might become it right now it's actually fairly penny but if it gets worse it's going to have read
i can't wait for the term voter to walk into walmart and there's nothing there

welcome to h b o pie passed from h b o maintenance eve real time
over
it's
you have any suggestions are keeping a family together
hyper partisan politics
i mean you can bridge the divide your a mid western border
that is worker know i think
i go back to minnesota eight to ten times a year which lot by work there but i always see my brothers sisters all the time even their time even that times when you don't have time to check in and i think it's about checking in and keeping people party or talking i mean yeah
people are talking
they're mad at you don't let them run away from me and don't i am i ok corral go after all the work
you did exposing mental institution like willowbrook what do you really think about trump declaring we need to reopen these institutions why think it as governor spitzer knows there is a confusion in the public mind between people who are mentally ill which includes schizophrenia post traumatic stress
bought bipolar that's different from my area which is the developmentally disabled mental the school mentally retarded
down syndrome autistic people who were way are housed in institutions not asylum but they were warehouses that exists that people forget over five thousand people kennedys
a lobotomy and all the rhetoric just horrible horrible treatment of be one has kind of normal like you something off and those are the people who like running down the street
guns or things that look like guns and the the developmentally disabled or people whose i accuse or below normal who who you want to have his mouth you main living environment as possible that gentle people they are obviously very needy
but they can be you know
good post take vocational training they can evolve they can live longer rather than being in institutions were sixty of them were jammed in a room naked smear it their own feces unattended one it and then for sixty people have one more thing than when he did that king it was terrible
if they're good

yeah i can max
do you believe that the u s has learn from our experience and vietnam terrific book by the gutter a great writer
and highly
the us has learned for experience and or that we are continuing to make many of the same mistakes obviously lot
this person mean somewhere
fortunately i think we continue to make a lot of the same mistakes and this was a frustration for me as a story and you can study the history you can draw the lessons that getting people to actually internalized them and act upon them there's something else and for example today across the middle east one we're fighting the war on terrorism i think there's a tendency to think especially on the part of the president that american bombs and bullets will win the day and there was a
similar tenancy in vietnam but think we could bomb the vietcong into submission
gen william westmoreland thought we could kill the vietcong faster and they could be replaced on the guy that i wrote about edward lands wales said no this was never going to work out the only way to win is to have a viable and state a government and set and south vietnam it that people can actually support it's a day we're not really focus on creating governments that people can support across the middle east were just focused on bombing and then leaving and
that's not going to be a successful long term strategy yeah i know he talks about isis being annihilated but there may be annihilated in syria but just going to take their talents to south beach well
it in their case
that's where i always think oh i got i don't remember what happened with al qaeda in iraq and al qaeda in iraq which was the predecessor of isis was annihilated by two thousand and eleven then president obama pulled our troops out of iraq it it says and i oppose as a result of that he created breathing space for isis to arise and the take this fast cable say it across
in iraq and my concern is that trump today is going to repeat that very same mistake that he and other republicans were criticizing not so long ago thing it's also true if i might say that we always look at our model as the model for other countries and we have no idea who all these tribal things and all the history and i think we always try to
these people that do things our way and they don't have what we have to do that they define freedom differently i mean that was george bush's big mistake he was like everybody loves freedom we also don't forget that it's all about religion in the middle east we don't understand that it's a different than the sudanese we we change the order and the era
invasion of o three unsettled society that had settled however may be unfair it could be perceived from people in a democratic society but religion rules in the middle east it's been forever millennium it'll be for and history that happened six hundred years ago to them is like
yesterday yeah that's just the middle east that's a lot of contrition or yugoslavia when that place fell apart now you gotta have on the ground understanding like the guy that i wrote about arab lands that we spent years in the philippines and vietnam and really came to understand our society and he was trying to talk truth to power to generals without their good just bomb there a way to victory but today i see a and
a similar mindset or again there's not in the white house you don't see a lot of people were very worried about the dynamics of tribal society in iraq or syria you know trump just wants to throw you know bomb bomb them and then think that we're going to one that way we have the phrase wag the dog other presidents have been accused of starting wars to distract do you think true
there's above that now i'm going to go and i think that there's almost nothing the tropics above
the around
when you say something
what you ignore his we get one president at a time we get one president when he succeeds the nation succeeds when he fails the nation is failing
so no way you know when you alienate yourself from the government and say nothing they do is worth a shit then then the country that is that what we're doing everything we don't want him to succeed what we're saying is that his absence of fact based decision making run around oh just pointed out
pointed out the decision to move the national guard the border i view as a manifestation of a bad week he wants to distract he does something got home i did that area
no no no but but not this moment not i don't wish they'd say no you're not gonna
we all we all want to succeed but this guy won't but by the way that he said something nice about him your house
only that gravity of the show well
arthur when he made the when kim jong on said let's meet and trumps a great let's me and all the liberals said that's great and i said no you know what these two guys probably the two crazy as people in the world they might understand
laura ingraham also supported moving the capital to jerusalem and so believe me i am perfectly capable of doing you know when he does so no other one that's important to tariffs in were democrats should stand up and say you know what it's time we stood up against china which should do what is a global coalition not is one off deals somebody had to stand up china
it was gaining weight as like an adult like democrats have a supporting trumps strong have started a trade or with china this is not gonna work out we'll need to stand up to china and traded up but on we get not rice why that i be and way
don't just stand up it's about time somebody said what do you think of republicans do regulating the banks and some democrats the road late in the bank well he he hears the thing i'll say it's been so many years and we had a financial crisis
it is the same boat any single most erotic pelosi move i've seen since moving the national guard for the it is
ten years after the crisis we want to go back and recreate the very predicate to the crisis of oh wait just makes no sense banks are lending their lending enough the economy is booming why go back to minimize the in limiting the amount of capital they need it's insane simply insane but it's also
i completely agree with you one of my happiest moments in washington dc they are few was when i worked on the wall street reform bell sat at the bill signing saw us really try to china page and the time when them wall street in the banks wrote all of the rules in the sack days they still are the biggest donor
to democrats and republicans in the financial sector and seeing that list of democrats that elizabeth warren had the guts to call out that list of democrats who were just saying you know what less deregulate again let's go ahead and join with a republican caucus this is why the democratic party is not as popular as it needs to be with working and middle class people have

welcome to age be a dance
from h b o maintenance real time with him


people are happy
dr
drop came up a great idea
right i've got to the border
setting the national guard
why you're doing this now of course like everything would just because you've been watching fox news
and they started to talk about a caravan you heard about this care of people from central america has come care of it are everybody freaked out
home depot was like we're gonna need a bigger parking lot
no he thinks he's going to lose his colder
they made him president with her book about immigration
she's mad because he and built the wall gets so she's waiting angry things about him when you cannot lose and culture of the last time a woman spank him that bad

all out with him everything is about keeping his base happy you know the forgotten americans can we stop using this term but a ridiculous forgotten america the lost tribes of the rush
or condoms living in a hidden valley
no they're not invisible these people instructor at walmart in their pajamas i worst ever

even if you wanted to get people out that the wall wouldn't work somebody was telling trump they said using technology instead of a wall is a lot cheaper and more efficient and he said if i if i wanted cheaper and more efficient i'd let the mexicans it
the other genius idea had lately as a trade war with china
witch project will be now china has responded with tariffs of their own so the white house's frantically backpedaling are now we were just threatening
just the first offer bigger you know the markets the stock broker to do that seemed to be enjoying the unpredictability of president brain forward
because whenever he proposes something the markets tank and then one of the cabinet secretaries comes out and says oh don't you dare
nobody around here does in the markets bounce back
everything this guy says of like or fourth of the blame on the dog

the final story i think is really interesting story daniel
lawyer
this says she can describe president drums genitalia in great detail
based on that i'll pay or hush money
tell me that he said

how much of a bombers legacy will survive
the republicans are really think most of it will i honest to god think most will obama care already has they couldn't repeal it will the jury's out there yes so they tried a thousand times to repeal it and they've been they've given up that not going to do it only
way into your to there
the dodd frank reforms of wall street
i think a lot of the environmental stuff is going to is going to stick because electricity
solar power is getting cheaper wind power getting he were all that all those changes i think our outliving because he made better policies in this stuff truck tried replacing about what are you in your apartment where users are wider than than poetry accomplishments i mean when you look at the way
the morning or generation my generation generations that you're stepping up you can trace that directly back to transform a waiter told us or the ones we've been waiting for that ultimately
our salvation work i'm not from will come from his legacy which has he made a lot of people particular in my generation believe we can do what what what
he's going to transform the courts in a very bad dangerous way and that we're going to live with that for very long
i mean they're sort of stuff
it's bad there's there's parts of this country we're never going to get you know
okay
no let's move on to something for and let's good
palate cleanser
do you feel that reality t v can be seen as pure entertainment or does all media share responsibility for setting some sort of example for viewers
question i mean it is a loaded question i think for us
bravo as the most educated audience on cable outside of all the cable news channels and they're smart enough to know the house was there aren't people can watch stupid they can they can and they can know that you cannot make people feel guilty it's true i read the tabloids
done it since the eighties when i was wearing the right
i've had people say to me you know celebrities will don't you that because you know what they take pictures with my children and you're only encourage and by giving them your money
hurting my job i'm like fuck that you know what i agree on a plane tomorrow morning to go to replace your do to i'm tired in the morning so that i worked all week there's your i want something i can laugh at yeah that makes me laugh out loud not intentionally it just does yes
also keep up with my friends okay
did you finish your enter good
oh shit he flipped a table should i do that
they reviewed it just right
you're going to fuck up your life
they're taking your kids
okay
my it is as a critic of the use of excessive force by law enforcement how would you suggest we go about changing department protocol legislation
in fact california it's already looking at legislation
it was very marginal destroyed while you literally right and what happens right now is police departments essentially right there on patrol guides that tell them what for physics at what you know that the rules of the road for police officers and what they do is they building huge amounts of discretion rather than setting boundaries that actually makes sense for keeping
everyone safe because the truth is it will also keep officer safer
i've been running the bill for a long time
how they had this idea that if i feel threatened at all i get to kill you
that i don't know how you legislate that that mentality has to manage why we all empty are clip into that guy if we think he's got what happened to just watching the go right forgot about the old free just goes away
cell phone or a gun
after to start having to pay a price for bad behavior that will change may i see right price and they were starting to make some real changes with last couple years of the obama administration is finally got a new york city's made some real changes even while we've had some really big problems because there was an insistence that we stop policing people from poverty now
now didn't happen and eric garner right but if you tell if you actually say out and actually district attorney races have mattered a lot getting reform minded people elected as public prosecutors is actually and ken thompson in brooklyn actually said am just you can bring me people n y p d for low level marijuana
and we're not on prosecute and that's actually what
oh he passed away
jason candor as the first in an era millennial five months
what's the current oil
i'm thirty six thirty six as a millennium just bury finance i'm i'm angry senior millennium
there
what do you want to know i want to do more
okay
inviting you to know i think
he was implying that you are hitting
i certainly was
thank you
i resemble that remark
as the first no avail ever likely to a state wide office how do you feel about the reputation of your generation of being an engaged lazy and self obsessed yeah
yeah i don't have any of the are the threat i think the idea that this generation wants to have our personal identity match will receive from our country will receive from the company that employs is that those some entitlement i think that's not true i think from the folks that i saw in afghanistan who volunteered know and that when they sign in the
out of line they might end up there to the folks i saw marching in ferguson
when i was secretary of state of missouri i don't see entitlement i see patriotism well there is a lot of that
some of the
i think the problem began when parents i don't know what generation it was a or millenniums but as soon as kids were able to say fuck you mom
that's where we all went down hill
any kid who grew up saying fuck you
fuck you mom generation
that and don't live in my yeah know i know
they live in a lot of people's houses okay
ended you think the me to movement has affected the game isn't my question that somebody wrote
believe me i am obsessed
it says ready or do think the me to movement has affected the gay community and yeah i think it's affected everybody in hollywood i think it's affected a lot of people are on the country that certainly in this business yes absolutely
because of kevin spacey way because we all have to watch how we speak to each other the entertainment industry is very salacious by the nature of what we're doing i mean where where look striven there's a lot of jokes there's a lot of things that are not considered appropriate in the workplace i think everyone is
had to look at the way that they speak louder than kevin spacey i can think of a lot of well i'm just saying anything up in the entertainment business whether you're gay or straight it effect right beneath the earth
some day she in the shoes about to drop
people out there that you've heard that maybe be should possibly yeah like had done some things and maybe yeah the positives
going to be good for them
i'm just looking for a school
good for a skill
saying this because i think it's really important and now that analogy between two people in this country have largely been significantly less protected and even when we have laws on the bucks will cause there's this this this assumption stereotyping about somehow you couldn't be sexually harassed
and that is that is a serious and justice that we had not nights and be beyond that i mean listen they're discriminated against in the house down
legally across the country and we have a vice president it was incredibly anti gay and a nervous to see what and not of cause it right so if you're sexually harassed and then you don't want to come forward because you i don't that's where cue comes in
my view is to say
yeah

welcome to h b o passed from h b o maintenance eve real time

very good so the question you want to work
or as we talked about starbucks we talked about our great border rights bill we talked about our efforts to be climate change but for you bill i cannot hear the best when the united states
oh regulated as well regular regular extra extra with the county would give you a run for your money they are they're in a little pressure on us we've heard from attorney general in seattle actually we didn't make sure that the back off
wouldn't it be wonderful if the first time don't throw said something that was actually true as he said he leave us alone and marijuana decriminalization that
jeff sessions i said good people don't smoke marijuana
you are not good people there okay michael will you ever release the contents of the warning shot disc of evidence you tweet about you
possibly it depends on how it progresses i mean we we worked on it
wow
we took that picture and we we treated it out in it was exactly that it was a warning shot to michael go in the president that if they tried to claim that my client was a liar after sixty minutes that was going to be consequences and it worked and it worked perfectly because we've heard nothing them
we have the dvd and we're going to release it when it's necessary and we're going to see what happens with the case

make no mistake about it it's locked and loaded
can i ask
just like this yes mean i've been listening to all of this about trump and watching how this conversations go in the us and i have one question about it i mean there's all these people in the us who are on the conservative side who are aligned with trump for all sorts of reasons and there's all this tension around his presidency and attempts to pull him
out of his office for various reasons and
what do you think will happen it's that comes to pass what what do you think will happen to these people that have identified with trump and like how is it that that the democratic types your example are holding out their hand to say to these conservative type sort of like welcome back into the fold because it looks to me from going out for an outsider's perspective it
your country is polarizing in a way that's not good and that you know people are going after trump and i understand that it's not like i don't understand that but there's all these people that elected him and that are identified with him and they're they're not taken this well you know and so well they're not they're not it's not and you know you might not think they're very bright and all of that and
and you know their backwards and and all of those things but but but you know you need to have respect for the rest of your citizens and if your if your country isn't going to pull itself apart and as you really see this happening from an outsider's perspective when i come down here and i lived in this makes for on it wasn't by this before
if he was just a regular republican president with the republican policies i would say you'd have a point but what what is so alarming is the assault on democratic norms what we were talking about here today things like threatening to put people in jail threatening to put journalists in jail wanting military parades praising dictators wanting to be a
dictator i mean we are at a moment here this is i try to impress on this on the people who are too young to remember a lot of president and a lot of elections how incredibly different this than anything that ever came before i never much like the other republicans who were in office but i have a renewed respect for them
george
they just wouldn't what about nixon nixon got caught and he gave himself up basically well audio other this president makes the watergate burgers or brilliant
it's easy to me that it's not point we can we can be as tough as were being on the president we should for all the reasons you just said bill without telling his supporters that they're stupid without saying beret of deplorable if we want to bring them around to what i would say is a more enlightened kind of thinking and who happened to see donald trump is someone has turned the presidency into one
long infomercial from our logo you know we can do that without saying to them you've been due to your champs you're dumb your deplorable and i think we need to talk to them with more generosity than we do
he says that the left is too preoccupied with being non confrontational
re my last is buy orders by we are entering now i know that he's a good question the idea that that liberals especially intellectuals are are preoccupied with politically correct speech that their eyes i see yeah i know they're too preoccupied with which identity politics by a large margin
and they tend to categorize everyone by their ethnicity and their sex and gender and i think all that does this turn people into tribal actors in that the end result of that is contacts weren't you also saying know that that the left is too worried about offending people
i think that that goes along my world yes well that and then another hand when the left for example offends people in their political sphere air questioning whether that's somehow bad for society writ large well i'm concerned about i don't i think that those two issues
those two issues are somewhat separate i'm concerned about the the dialogue in the united states around the presidency
pulling people people farther and farther apart it has nothing to do with the behavior of trump i think this is an independent issue you can you can say positive or negative but he's only answers my order i know that's the thing is it's like that's the issue that's that's the issue they they support of and without the circus he's just a lonely clown
but he has these people in congress who are unable or and this base that it is a cult of personality not unlike dictatorships we've seen in the past i mean he he said once famously i could shoot someone on fifth avenue and not lose any fans who yes and he has proved that to be almost true i mean week
cannot imagine what he would do where they were turning up because i don't know what that would be i don't think it's anything because whatever was he would just say well it's fake news but it would also imagine he's impeached just for the sake of argument and were convicted okay either of those but it seems to build it mattered one he asked to leave yeah i know why it's not it's not an and
detail but it still seems to me that it leaves you with the problem of what do you do with the disaffected forty cents that are going to be very happy about this independent of trumps behave kind of like the sooners after we kicked over saddam well that's that's a hell of you can nice site yeah right
i'm just this is an argument looking for an argument rather and a solution without waiting for impeachment were making sure that people understand donald trump cannot stop us today donald trump could not stop me from the first net neutrality bill to make sure people have access to the internet he could not stop us from
can i stop for that kid on climate change with all his bully eighteen say that it's just a hoax he can't stop us from fighting climate change he can't stop us from ever the best paid family leave and sickly policy he can't stop us when we demonstrate keep in progress in our state washington state
i know why that's nice
are certainly is stopping us from protecting the environment he has signed executive orders the first thing he did a novice would he has was design in order that said hey you want to dump your coal sludge in the streams go right ahead the head of the is through it is reversed all of a he just changes to the environmental pollutants pollutants i know
but let's just say he can't stop it and he's changed the landscape every so you can't do anything and eight and he's doing he's pointing crazy judges less day i say these are changing things as we speak when i don't cover it because of stormy daniels but all of this is going on

welcome to h b o pie passed from h b o maintenance eve real time

the bad advice
okay what do you think of it then juggles who give trump again for his behavior that is otherwise
i don't think
i don't think well of them matter
nerds right
no i mean i think there two evangelical styles sort there's an evangelical style that says we always knew he was a bad guy we were just voting for him because he wasn't hillary and we needed basically like a tough guy a bodyguard we lost the culture wars and that i can work
yeah and that that i can at least understand but then there's the other styled it's like trump he's like he's king david david had a lot of why just
if you were but don't know
that are important jerusalem
well that's it i really believe that a lot of the then juggles believe that jesus he was coming back many them in their lifetime because he's going to want to meet them
he's gonna want to meet you too
but the debate of
they do the trick for you
like bank well
okay so do you think that conviction of bill cosby will lead to more celebrity trials
so every throws of like
sure
i do work
the important about these cases the cosby case and whatever is going on in the subsequent investigation of harvey weinstein is that we really do need to make clear division as roman said earlier in the show between the fact that there are people who have committed serious felonious offenses
should should be taken in front not only a court of public anger with the court of law as opposed to people whose behavior is disreputable but not illegal and part of the problem in the early part of the me to movement was that there was a blending of the two
thing which know after you speak of lady
that would talk over the lady
people
haven't committed criminal offense it's definitely should be treated to criminal court and that's the only place you get due process
all this other like screaming and yelling about whoever got didn't each process you know about frank i didn't get due process and matt lauer it and here due process that mark halperin to get due process there are no due process of losing your job or mark halperin unfortunately yes
remember i'm really really good
if reporting can lead to criminal proceedings and at times yeah it's not all of the reporters but it can happen in tandem and that when i would just say in the wind reporting one thing that was really important about the cosby president is in a world in which most women could never envision taking this risk speaking out against a powerful guy and actually being hurt
and saying hey look at these women who came forward against bill cosby even though they were smeared they were covered their stories were sort of kind of heard that was a hugely important precedent to tell them about i think we err on the side of listening to and not believe all women that's not a thing no one says that but listening to women letting them and speak in finding out if they're telling the
using reporting to find out more i mean that's where the where you like glum their al franken you in the same sentence with matt lauer somebody else and just bernie mac enough friend yeah because it just i just don't think mark halperin and al franken are the same guy
really
to them as they lost their job which is a bad thing but it's not like a lifetime tragedy like i'd lost lots of jobs quite frankly man
i think pretty great tragedy for the democratic party to lose a leader like that
i got cost
notably done i don't lay by the democratic party is not going to sound out with their numbers on already like the right thing to do i'm a constituent health of al franken i voted for i'll and bag didn't know these things about him if he i still don't know those things i know what a few people said
you know as
they're just in that picture alone was enough for me to reconsider my the picture was just really that you can't get by the picture
the one we're doing that
you know what i can't get ruined i got that somebody should lose seven job
he said actually loses a job for that we should hold those people to hire account but he was a comedian at the time
it's just it's a threat
really letting trump certainly has to make all this so much more ah yeah so much stronger because when when the person who is in the highest office has obviously not only gotten away with all the stuff of the course was like but also clearly treats women as objects as ornaments it's horrifying to watch and i think that
that's one of the reasons why people have just gotten so incredibly angry in rightful backlash can i just say what are the most common things i hear from survivors of sexual violence when they care debates like this which are smart debates and very fair and all of that this survivors the people with the actual story is get lost because we have headline after the headline about these men and we're not
listening to the women and sometimes men as well who actually endured the mistreatment focus the conversation there
sounds most of those victims of sexual violence aren't famous and the people that commit those acts aren't famous and it's those are the people that we really need be paying attention to it's rampant and service industries it's rampant in restaurant industry in a hotel industry and this
this is something that i i'm glad me to transition from the me to to the times that movement in a matter of fact i don't want to start using that more times it for everyone
and it came into
the entire
wrote the entire business model of facebook undermines liberal democracy how can we stop that model
i think it's almost impossible to stop that model because it is for me the definition of just hope he is good citizens get their information about the world as determined by the world's largest advertising company
and i mean as much an interesting way to put it i'm on it the world's largest advertising yeah right and and i mean i think as for it when mark zuckerberg said it had no idea this was going to happen i actually believe them i think he had no idea because he didn't want to look into it because he was talking his book which is i have
moto we need to build money fiduciary responsibility that's the way it's going to be but it is very clear that of all the things that we've talked about that are ripping apart of the fabric of liberal democracy nothing is doing it faster than technology
every day
that's behind fake news that's behind you know sort of us versus them that's behind everything that makes us not want to have civic nationalism and common values and there's nothing that makes me believe that we're moving away from that but you don't want i mean i i've i've read part of your book
and i think i agree with that generally but i think one of the strength of your book is that it's not just about sort of
i think there's a tendency for people who are should have associated with the establishment in the west to want to pin everything on facebook and fake news and social media and so on when the reality is that you know the reason people believe conspiracy theories and fake news and all the rest is that the people running the west
you know the global lists to use to use your language has had a really terrible track record over the last fifteen years and i mean the biggest threat to a liberal democracy in certain ways is the fact that we had the iraq war a global financial crisis
sort of totally terribly designed euro zone that lead to all sorts of economic problems that we're totally foreseeable but none of the people paid to foresee them for saw them and so on and i mean in that sense i think the strongest part of your argument is about the people in charge not the will run alone i really appreciate that and obviously i agree with that but i think that think that and everyone should be
i don't know but i think the thing than my book but the thing that everyone to everyone
when the time
the thing that really been turned on its head is a twenty five years when we started the internet it was all about on the internet no one knows if you're a dog right it was empowering tunisia and egypt
yeah now everyone knows your dog on the internet they do it doesn't imply rely on it out
tapping our now we went from this ludicrous techno optimism where this was going to liberate everybody and save civilization and now it's destroying civilization and we never went through the period in which it's like it's got good targets and it's got bad parts of maybe we can emphasize the good things and downgrade the bad things i mean a ten year to wish steven pinker here was to make to
to make the case that he makes the actually we look at the bad part of it but look at for example how many people have been lifted out of of extreme poverty
probably a lot of liberalism in the last twenty thirty years how many a billion billion billion in her out of poverty and it's never happened before in the history of mankind am optimistic in terms of the global most macro view it's a pretty good time to be alive and tanker in the world and right he had that labour has actually less violence
but the astra need gotten worse in the united states we have our life expectancy going down here
quality is growing here and life expectancy at between the races or says wow but you certainly earning or ad time he said hey going to that what's coming as host the united states is increasingly china a country that is authoritarian that uses technology top down and much poor right and as a consequence i'm much more concerned about a world
led by that and i am but a world that have and were eviscerated our capacity to go toe to toe
so that's reversible and all i'm saying is only if we found the state department and watch but i'm say it's reversible it may not be reversible this monstrous by the book for this year but first that the milk will do it all but
you're getting at the last question how would you stop the west from committing what you call cultural suicide well first should by allianz
ross is real
i have books out of print bill has a night hold hold true
israel's
you are
for books that are as a rant no one reads books anymore
it's an act but i have i've actually quickly and have an eight i think
buyer bucks okay
okay but i would say man is right
that part of it is that we don't tell ourselves we don't tell ourselves in the west that we are inherited of a great patrimony that we have wonderful great liberal tradition we we all we do is most elites and most of the public discussion is about everything that's wrong it's important to highlight things that are wrong so
can be changed but we have no culture horseback i'm to advance
the fact that we live in a time of extraordinary growth and extraordinary opportunity and you know china is is a danger and a threat china also is a country that has no ideological whole than anybody can preach it's got nothing to preach it's just a different can't breathe
and they can and can't breathe and what good is dragging america purity album in the next ten years with like three hundred and fifty million people meet in eight and relief and there's no money for it and so i think if we think more positively i mean it sounds like a little dogs that main i would say that
it's all true except that i just think the environmental iceberg binge watch melting and that's where it's going to get us going on
tell me that my
watch

welcome to h b o pie passed from h b o maintenance eve real time
users as your the waters rest
in the nicotine
what what the republican reaction democratic bridge that their health from the public or pushed for their position to make false statements you didn't even get to that oh really that he wrote his own medical report it to the doctor like that
dr arabia is the answer depends on the flammability of sean hannity

so where so past where the buses run
oh good i'm glad you're loosening up and agree with me out
you around about it i'm trying to save the republican i know you're and you're doing a job
mapped as libertarian as a member place to the in today's political parties hell yes
libertarian party first of all me were an interesting moment right now we're both major parties have retreated on stuff like government spending like holding line on interventionism against surveillance warrantless surveillance
things like that
and i would also argue freeze at age in the we need more libertarian ideas in both parties and also in a libertarian party i think what does that look like in his underwear
general how are an essay operations being protected from a president who leaks intelligence to our adversaries
without arguing the premise
the seriousness you carry ohio
michigan wisconsin you get to secrets
until you get an issue there in shock to the voters if not to the agency
depressing
but that's what it would be worse if he was interested they would be worse if he actually read a briefing or cared about anything except whether nordstrom is selling a bunk his shoes and that's one of the challenges we have we have a president michael gershon want to push wu speech writer said donald trump lives the
eternal now
little history no consequence
job with intelligence is context
and we just fly by one and the long game yeah exactly that's why we didn't have a hot war when we had a cold war because it was floored by your people and that's preferable way to do it
alright is there a chance john that current partition divide could become so irreconcilable that america plunges into a second civil war
i don't think so but you will nothing out
come on over there you go
because historically we we did have one i think it's more likely that they'll be a reshuffling of the parties the elements that belong to the parties that's happened whenever there's been a failure of consensus on the central issue of the time so on slavery in the fifties and sixties on industrialization
at the turn a century on the role of the state
in in the middle of the century and then chiefly in our own time
the shift from republicans being the party of lincoln truly do the gym and the democrats being the party of segregation is gonna stop saying that the party of lincoln
the party switch yeah completely switch it is just ridiculous but but
there's something wrong with aspiring to bed now of course the case recently is that they don't well the case right now the case right now is that in any sixteen is the first recorded case of a candidate of a hijacker boarding a plane and the passenger siding with hijacked and that's what happened with trump he took over the base
they got rid of the pilots jeb bush's and the great moral question right now is who wants to be on the right side of history
talking that earlier and say this will not stand
hi
i love when republicans say that the party of lincoln like i love it and like okay now could you act like it do with it
i mean doing i mean it's just like when conservatives suddenly are all worried about women's rights and gay rights they bring it up so that they can bash muslims but then when it's actually their own policies and actions they don't do anything to uphold it but then when it's convenient
they use it as or fig leaves for the otherwise races behavior or where the party a blanket it sort of the way george bush remember when he was talking about his national guard servers or don't denigrate the guard well in his day the guard was a way to get out of the service
and he took advantage of it
when he was president
it was a way to get sent to iraq so he completed those two okay
the question right now it seems to me and the democrats are going to face it again with sanders and warren and the republicans are facing you're right now is the central issue is globalization and it's implications and neither party as it stands has a coherent answer to that and the the racism and xenophobia are all related to the fact that people
are worried that immigrants are coming in undercutting them the date is not very strong on that of course which makes it all the more hard to make an intellectual argument about it okay mayor as a young democrat do you think the party would be better off if nancy pelosi and she would endorse are younger and less polarizing democrat to be leader
speaker pelosi our house you're close he will retire when it's time
are the article that talked about how a lot of hate she gets is precisely because she's a woman and they will with power that she's the when the most effective party leaders ever so
that's painful for her leadership at everything she's dead i think when it's times and i'm glad it's declare like that
okay i think to the water point their party does have to develop a bitch
there's not just age ethnicity
sexual orientation that looks i think we're seeing that i mean there are more women candidates than ever this have your bye bye

well i ever would start your day but i remember heavier to be known as america's mayor is not as america's worst liar
guy what on fox twice and twenty four hours admitted know about the harsh money to stormy day
many of their exactly right oh we caught drunk in ally yes
ten times a day by pushing record
but if everybody touches get stupid
he's like the human version of huffing paint
giuliani said he's not going to allowed trump to enter into a perjury trap of perjury draft would be arrested because microphones
but they're clearly worried that that michael cohen has flipped
they should be worried because michael and knows where all the bodies are buried and by that i mean he's actually probably buried so
in the category a giant scandal that we don't even pay attention to pick the president is the worst person ever
so we don't even notice some of these other scared came out this week that the dark at the personal doctor for drum peril bornstein we saw him during the campaign
weird looking dude
he claimed this week i think he's
it's bullshit that trumps goons raided his office to steal trumps medical records what would the republican be doing if hillary had sent goons
to her doctor's office to steal her
it's insane that we just let this shit go on like that but with trump it's like well he doesn't want to know he's fat and bald next
this is the doctor who who wrote a letter during the during the trial sixteen campaign when people were asked me about the candidates health said the trump was quote astonishingly excellent
his health was astonishingly excellent and that he was the quote healthiest individual ever to run for the president's
today and yesterday the doctor said yes trump dictated that letter what a surprise
doesn't sound like
yeah dictated that ladder and the doctor said yeah trump to carry the letter and i would tell him what he couldn't put in their couldn't put in
the letter says he was the healthy as men alive
what did they ever you know drab say he won the kentucky derby
do a second blood test to make sure he wasn't one of the x men
well the typical offers the part that said he tested negative for collusion right

the healthiest man ever to read
he said even the healthiest one that teenagers can remember bush used to bike for ten miles every day member that obama played full court basketball trump was winded when he was shooting paper towels to those

so fat his shadow has diabetes

welcome to h b o pie passed from h b o maintenance eve real time

an arc the greatest generation has given society so much as hollywood seen its own greatest generation yeah
i don't know what
the grid
nevermind
don't get we know the democrats are guilty of identity politics what responsibility should the left take for why politics or so polarized today
i think when we found out show democrats had control of congress for like fifty years and ninety four newt gingrich into that i watch everybody figured out that anybody could win any election that's what created the massive polarity the we have now where it were two to prejudge and he i can win any election right well anybody can but you must admit that the ripper
public is cheap more no i don't have to admit that i went away voter suppression you don't think that voter suppression have been to california with illegal immigrants be registered to vote
that has been studied and it's not true
will trump says they were three million illegal votes
yeah she's numbers right but i think that
it's i know it's a lower numbers about that is it up to a million i don't know i don't know the number of i don't know the knowledge that you know it's a abroad
well i've seen it happen to share
the border just out there i mean i i i live in san diego on order and they do register your legal leverage to vote in our elections
a democrat speaking to the border or it let me ask you as a question about the border because we didn't get to that
we didn't get to this issue this week
district is right at the border as you say jeff sessions it answers we were having a very new policy and it doesn't look to me very american and that is splitting families at the border if a family of mexican people are coming trying to get across the border we're going to send the kid off in one direction and the mother to jail and put the
maybe in baby detention center
splitting up families israel
that's not a year against let me tie would say
i'm going to get booed and one second we should
really the whole family if the parents are here illegally
separate the family in the whole family back and if they want the kid to stay with the guardian or somebody here like someone that it's already here in this country until they're eighteen years old they can do that why i would have family up i which and everybody back and show you apply when everybody going to was policy is it just to be as big a prick as we can just send the message you try to get to this country will
your family then ago
maybe maybe upgraded admit that okay
i just ask what about refugees what about people who actually are fleeing dangerous circumstances you only have a tradition and then i'm opening our i've been working for five or six years
try to get people that are translators in iraq afghanistan syria rename replace should have help with the us military times and their families right moved to india and pakistan but you're not to escape people and afghanistan were been trying to get them refugee status and a us and that's hard to do you still people that are not over here yet that are overseas
who should be here so get that job and we should do as americans but remember this is not about mexico which about people from the entire world want to go to a better place than us not wanting them to bring the same problems that they're fleeing from with them here and there was a nice fighters they want a country ruled by law that's what makes sure safe that's what i want your yes
i'd certainly met people from other countries who say i do not want the shit that i fled coming back here i threw that they'll off when i got here don't make me wear it here
ethan hawke what are the keys social differences you notice between the united states and canada as someone who lives in both countries that a great question
one of the a
you should be piloted and not
you know you'd come on a show like this and you wonder what you're going to get hit with it's so interesting to me because i do i have a place in nova scotia that we spend summers at and they have for a long time the things it's amazing there is you know
you would call rural people lobstermen fishermen
hunters guys out mystics this book
six in the people there are environmentalists in they are extremely educated in in protecting their environment and it really because it's their living in a make it really easy everyone has to recycle they have a bag for compose stay of the bag for plastic bags for different things and you have to do it or you get a fine
so you can go to a hunting shack and it you know a nanny at four in the morning people play in their smoking pot they're drinking and they're putting their recycling where it belongs
you know
they going to they make it really easy to do the right thing
is is really exciting
okay rebel care about the environment and
joan get him started on observation is not an environmentalist but that's what people who want like i do all kinds of days but conservation is not what the wild land to be beautiful i want dear all over so i can shoot them and eat them
plenty more for everybody else rolling
environmental movement gray one hundred as efficient as country and they are the ones who should be leading us the cause and it's and look if you eat what you shoot that's no different than someone who goes to the supermarket so the hypocrisy fact my doesn't have antibiotics that it does an exact roy jones
we're going to do a better job of with trash and at bus stops in this country that we share my god we don't make it a and think what do you think that you can go or why do you think that like the teddy roosevelt isn't great model of a republican leader in college
why isn't the republican administration take that more serious like how how are they okay with when scott food is doing because the history of the greatness to the republican
yeah right to home and making that more available as i feel like that is a place where you could really show the department of interior that navy seal hedge know a former congressman navy seals now the head of the interior and he is doing that i mean he's he's a conservationist those groups like so far better nash
will they try to bring more elephants or around they try to bring more deer their introduce an antelope back into san diego in a way next year when it went out and like lot of thousand years and about scott how can you not about that allow for alone
what about you
do you think he should resign know yes i'll come how come
i think that there's just one he a large international in our environment is so over and socialize with all the extra inches on everybody
one of those give up at all i'm like i don't agree with this guy anything but he why they when because they're not fuck wants see they show
they say and that's very attracted to people and democrats need to learn that schiano total wrestle
this has gotten more environmental question the i'd rather be this with the cdc says diseases born right ticks fleas and mosquitoes never used that mosquitoes in california when the great things about it now i see mosquitoes
out of control and these carry really horrible diseases that they don't have a clue how to fix and you go camping or even years to come just staying and home you're going to this can be more prevalent this is because of global warming because winters are shorter that there's more environment that's friendly to these bugs for a longer time
time it's going to bite you in the ass literally
the air is you know it's not something that rich people can cordoned off that's what i don't get about why republicans why the koch brothers are not environmentalists say can't have their own air though you can't get away from this shit it's going to get everything but you gotta you're selling bottled and remodeled and nothing more fiction
yes i am a global warming
in new york times or talks about this didn't mention global warming wants or wasn't the word climate change wasn't use the word temperature was you one on and has to be one of the main reactor english speakers and what not telling at all on i promise you it wasn't in there they should people fly now from other places and the ease of access in travel and in the world be and flatter that is what has really lead to this
not pigeon flatter now
they're want the one big elephant in this room that we're not talking about is money in politics
just the head in iraq
not immune but republicans really have have led the big money they are think the republican party has been much to corporate guys but now the way too close to wall street way to close we were used to be the party of not free trade a fair trade of mere trade what trumps do and now what i did i did we do and on steel on terrorist
on an afghan and and a adequate what he's doing its kind of the time
right
don't wanna get big money on politics like going to just go back to the operations can't donate

right





no idea where your story
it's for part
there was a shooting in a volcano in hawaii an outbreak of a bowler the congo
but don't worry drop as one or get all by tweet
oh wait wait
this just in getting his twitter rulings a bowl of incredible
okay no trouble
shooting whatever they enter a walk

really wonder people aren't having kids and where did you see this as the fertility rate is at a record low for the second straight year the infant shortage is so bad now or airlines have to play tapes of baby cry

and we're going to babies drug administration while the during the other shitty stuff gets getting all the headlines
a different ways
there are now cutting off federal funding
for clinics that provide abortions or even refer patients to places that do abortion that's right no money for abortion that money has to come from michael cole

i think up may have skip health glass
did you say he had bill gates what bill gates that bill gates that trap recently and he said trump asked him several times if hiv was the same as h p v
that to our president is a man who asked to have to talk at this age of seventy one
dates try to enter the question have you tried to put it in a way drunk could understand that mr president hp the that's what you get for sleeping with a porn star
hiv that's what you get from sleeping with hannity

and the big feather in his cap is blowing away his career big deal looks like it's falling apart kim jong un says now that he will not dismantle has nuclear weapons or less us military threats are removed from south korea and trumps is his politics
will not be dictated by north korea that's a new job for fox and friends
oh trump is working on jobs in china
did you see this heat treated president g and i are working together too many jobs lost in china
wait jobs last where did you say i'm sorry what country are we making great again
you know why this is biggest it this is so naked china invested a half a billion dollars in a trump resort project in indonesia and like the next day trumps lift sanctions on their telecom company z t which is spying on you that's why our spy agencies are against it
i mean you can tell this one is really shitty keeps referring to the chinese leader president geek a chain

nerve this guy has to them throw tantrums about he's being investigated
how dare they investigated a clean whistle like me i mean it
it's the year anniversary of the muller investigation and trump of course the greatest witch hunt in american history of course everything is the greatest in israel well maybe it's the greatest in history but it's got so far as seventeen indictments and five guilty pleas it it's hunting which is it's finding

the latest theory from the bubble
said that the f b i he has planted a spy
in the trunk campaign
no not a spy this is just that the f b i does for a living
that's what they do trump sorry man you have ties to the american mob the russian mob to russia no courage to the kremlin are doing great indicted coke and spirited to fuck and goals and jenny lawyers and tax evaders and fraudulent businesses and charities and bribed and originally
porn stars

investigate shady people like you know
like owning an ice cream truck and going why are these kids follow me all the
chasing them
yes there's a spy
it's the new reality show the apprentice and so old had the ball
who's below the white house tune in next week
a mole i'm in a dysfunctional relationship but double drop the more weed i smoke the more paranoid he gets

and then there's the royal wedding to say i am excited would not be accurate
i already have my alarm set so i'll know exactly when to start not giving a shit
but
on the bright side the queen finally found a job for charles
we walking megan marco down the aisle bigots who better as a happy marriage good luck charm
trump was not invited to the wedding he said that's okay know about the royal wedding you said in their honor he would continue to royally screw america
so i don't want to be the web like enjoy the hell out of it tomorrow are you gonna watch of course you are going to be great when a be list actors marries a man who will never be king in a country that doesn't even met

and event so important and even the russians are in fixing it
yeah
this a while but first happy as the former f the special agent or author of messing with the enemy surviving in a social media world of hackers terrorists russians and fake news clip watch

right so listen
in light of this shooting we don't know a lot about it but it is of course involved with social media is everything is your book is a lot about that you have something a phrase i thought it was originally and click bait populism you think this applies here would to tell us when it does we could not have donald trump is present
before the era of social media in there or audiences that hit power him what he's been able to do and what other leaders like the leader of the islamic state have been able to do is use social media to power their agenda and when it crowd leaders aren't born any more a crude through repeat weeds likes and shares and what we're seeing today
a or audiences taken on the tactics the same tax that too he said the russians and using it for their own partisan purposes we don't really need to worry about the russians at this point because everybody's copy in their playbook
that within twenty minutes of the shooting
there was fake information about the shooter the right wing is always trying to make these people into leftists they faked him with a hillary had on right
and people don't really check this stuff they are going to sides first of all that confirm what they want to believe that to begin with right right this is all about confirmation bias an implicit bias confirmation bias is i only pick that would i want to hear implicit bias is if it comes from my friends family or people that look like me and talk like me then i will
one and believed to be true and no one can shout that down so the first thing you see is what you tend to believe is true and that would you see the most often and that's why this social media and this information we saw like today can mislead people defame people it can ruin people's lives and yet none of it is true in it's very hard to correct them falsehood

the shooter had two subjects on his instagram account guns and trump
i don't know what that means but i don't think it's good know mean what we've seen across all of this populism whether it's jeff hardy populism we used to talk about with isis islamic state or with the extremist groups in the united states it's violence and it's a promotion of violence and we've got easy access to weapons we've got unlimited
access to social media very easy ability to make content it's a dangerous
just the way they micro target for selling products they do it with people's opinions to i know you've said that alex jones or example is perfect for for word russia is doing because he will lead the right to the gullible idiots that's right people that are falling for this often times are new to these information
sources they don't really know how to evaluate them their new to social media and they're hyper partisan they really want to be part of what i call a social media nation in the more time people spend on cell phones and with their virtual friends the more connected they come with them and that search to overtake literally trump physical nations those people that live around
around them like americans so they start identify not by the american flag or a common beliefs and values in democracy but hash tags avatars buyers and pictures you want to know when isis supporter is that's easy go look for been one pictures are how cute pictures their daddy pictures and isis flags if you want to know the true
i'm supporter is well that's may mega had mega trump train in a handful of other hash tags and the next one that come up is the resistance i mean if you want to understand how trump overtook the g o p it's the same way isis overtook al qaeda and how the resistance could overtake the democrats that's the next real social media bubble that's come out when he mean the
resistance could overtake him i took the resistance was the democrats jesus it's worse than i thought well
it's true i mean among are they different and said you can understand there's more of an identity attached to the social media nationalism then there is to these actual traditional organizations so al qaeda used to say how do we know these people are and al qaeda radio pieces we don't actually believe in these things trump supporter say and now we have the resistance
which often times is that the battles with traditional democrat so and in the mainstream left so as a long time after year in what do you see this week when trump since there was a mole from the f b i and my campaign
doesn't do moles and campaigns do they know it's a bunch of nonsense and i mean it's yeah
the rush
don't need to make fake news because the president makes plenty for him to use
the new threat really is that we have american active measures we have americans that are destroying us institutions with complete fall so the f b eyes mission is to protect the united states so if they had tips that there might be a russian infiltration into the united states to meddle with her election which has been found out then they should go after that
so using a confidential informant a trusted source to go test out those lead it would be negligent for them not to do that and they were doing what they should be doing protecting america

how it has turned around about the f b i i mean i was freaking out when trump won the election because at that moment i started to the i was in his pocket
there were calling the f b i trip you yeah the trump ville near running right they were saying that me release that letter eleven days before the election that song calorie because he was losing control of the f b i he had to do that from pressure within his own organization under no that's true
but how did the f b i completely turn around this is so scary that they are so quickly able to change people's minds on a fundamental matter like who who with the who is the f b i with yeah it's interesting that the president likes to pick on people they can't fight back namely the intelligence community and the f b i wrote can't come out in defense
and themselves who can well the milan investigation can but they're going to do things properly they're going to go through sources they're going to go through methods and traditionally from what i remember it's a very conservative organization i remember going to the service i remember going to the seventh floor of the f b i gore's with a green shirt one day and there are like white or blue here and yet
what do you do it
yes i've always been a big fan of squares their squares keep society going in ways i could not
my read through it is very true i'm not the one hunter i'm drawing on the cave of the wall but that's not essential
did was much more essential what what do you think about rudy giuliani saying
a guy just threw up at the
throw up in his mouth
right my right

im saying that you can get information from a foreign government and that's perfectly legal you know when iran people try to get dirt on may it's not nice but it's the way it doesn't matter if it's or russia or that's crazy to right now
america first means americans first don't take anything from a foreign country was trying to destroy our institutions destroy and put divisions between our own people so that they fight each other so they can break us up into pieces divide and conquer us you don't do that and what we have seen is even in other cases let's go back to
gore vs bush there was a gore staffer who received a playbook essentially for the debate what did he do he said i'm turning this over the f b i and i will recuse myself from the debate because i don't want one to be seen as doing dirty tricks and to i don't want anyone to think that there was some
up when the debate comes that the exact scenario if the russians show up at your building called trump tower as rushing government attorneys the first call you make as the f b i and the last thing you do is shut the door and don't let those people and



wow
see our area and thousand and cia operations officer ran as an independent and the two thousand and sixteen presidential election please welcome and mcmullan
the savage love columnist and a host of the pod cast savage love dan savage

they are apparently it's actually very wise says back
i'm getting too paranoid isn't really that scary out there as it am i having a bad week or because i tell ya i i feel like term is swimming
i feel like he's remaking this country and into his own ugly image there have been school shootings before of course but we've had this is the sixteenth this year
that's the most ever
i read that november ninth day after his election
the most hate crimes recorded that year he calls immigrants animals
i saw this guy ranting about the new york lawyer the million a lawyer ranting about you're speaking spanish and he says
my next call is to ice
haven't done that a no fly zone that survives in new york city get the hell out of spanish triggered see that is what we're proud out
they were big but i don't think they would go i'm going to call ice on you i think that's a gift and we don't have a solo across country of white people calling the police iraq people who happen to be walking down the street carrying their bags to a car after staying in a
a hotel overnight
trump has been the great this inhibitor and what he's just and hypnotist lot of great weather leno's that was that was under the service and a little bottled up and should be bottled up because it's a poison
trump is just open the floodgates and the poison is coursing through the veins of our body politic and are entered citizens and it's horrifying that i'm depressed i think it's worse for us here in the west coast because we wake up to trumps early morning tweets it's the first thing we see people on the east coast can brace themselves for five minutes
i think dan says is absolutely correct i think some of these sentiments have been cocked up and sort of hidden in caves for a long time and in dark corners of our politics but it's not just trump it's all the leaders especially i hate to say republican leaders who sit by silently core as these things are
needs to be more of a counterbalance it has to come from the right has to come from republican leaders otherwise there's going to be a segment of our population that increasingly is going to be led down this path i call bullshit
i'm already
face you were saying this
republicans have been cranking up the races town for forty fifty years the southern strategy
but saying like dog whistle dog whistle dog whistle along comes trump who takes the dog whistle and throws it over his shoulder and picks up a little horn and just
maybe lead the logical conclusion of republican politics about fifty years of republican i her as but i haven't agree i haven't seen more of a symptom as opposed to a cause but i do think it is circular and he is making things worse and we do need more leaders to stand up one of the most troubling statistics i've seen during the era of trump came in a canopy
all in in january of this year seventy two percent of republican voters believe that trump was a positive role model for children if that has no leading indicator of trouble i don't know what is and
a poll numbers keep going up he's in the mid forties now that's normal territory for presidents and americans thirteen percent of them think he's honest they don't care
they don't care that wonderful start to care if we continue to have the school shootings i mean like the sort of
we talk about you know i one of the things that made me totally unable to vote for trump was a famous you know the hollywood reporter tape right well the access hollywood exceeds me when they enter a has grabbed heads donald trump grabbed by the pepsi ok and it is
it's appalling the fact that we are not trying to do everything possible to try and stop these shootings is disgusting you have to be twenty five years old to rent a car why don't you have to be twenty five years old to buy a gun we should try
when parents today put out a press release saying let's stop naming the names of school shooters because all they want is that notoriety let's try that let's try maybe even holding people like the one that just happened today he was using the gun in his father what do we hold people criminally liable
the republicans passed a law that made it impossible to sue car manufacturers for libel and they can't be held to the same standards in any other company producing a product for the consumer market in this country then again we had shootings before donald trump but i just think if you if you made
then diagram of trump and what he's brought about
all right types and then just these internet unhappy types right but we don't want to say that obama is responsible for sale or clinton our at all and i know what i'm saying that all we're just doing what you said before where was the word to use this inhibitor this in the head that are
twenty seventeen was but i think the worst year in terms of casualties from her shootings in four of the five worst in history worst mass shootings in our history happened within the last five or six years i mean this problem is getting worse and again two thousand and seventeen was the worst of the most appalling thing i read today was the more high school students who died in school shootings in america this year
than us service members had died in the two wars that are still under way that were involved so sorry schools are more dangerous than iraq and afghanistan and they did you see the interview of the one student today where that person asked her did you ever think this is this would happen in your school and your answer was yes
that is unbelievable so appalling about it was the report it was asking for the comforting banality yeah so that the viewer at home could like relax about this not happening where i live right or like return to normal expectation this isn't something that happens every day and this is something that fucking happens every day in this country because of the n r a the g o p
and i asked
like it when there's a sex expert on the show
you nothing i'm an average
so this in sell thing if you haven't heard about in cells stands for involuntarily sell but we did a little bit about it a few weeks ago on the show and there was a tragedy to them now
guy in toronto only a couple of months ago or last month i good ran a car through bunch of people because they're angry they're angry that women don't like them and they can't get laid they want to
and there was one a few years ago in santa barbara and this is a social movement now and they want the government to provide prostitutes for the not quite
bernie sanders
they're beyond geographically prostitutes they they talk about redistributing sex as a commodity and it's about really insulating women is handmade tell stuff not about sex workers it's about the government giving you a woman as a slave not the government giving you a voucher so you can go see a second they're nasty they think women are receptacles
right
and they wonder why they can't get laid exact
if we can zoom out for a second as write a sex advice column i do with sucks of those packets are your everyday from people who are miserable because they have an untouched ever their virgins or they haven't had a relationship between twenty years sexual deprivation and romantic deprivation does make people miserable not all people become in cells become part of the end result
movement but this is truly a misery doing that kind of loneliness and that kind of despairs we have to figure out there is a lot of people out there who don't have sex and relationships there's a tiny percentage you become active in this insult committee what's the difference between men are socialized to believe that women are their property and they're entitled to women's bodies and that meets with the black mold and must
algae the grows all over the internet and those are the two places we need to really intervene
men are socialized to what they expect from women and the massage any that runs riot on the internet that creates the insults not sexual deprivation but would change when i couldn't get laid
it was i good okay we'll start a band become a doctor
know
get a job at a restaurant they're always fucking each other
morley and make yourself who are they going to go over time
the problem though
i think what it means we needed to do besides it's socializing males differently is we need to be stigmatized decriminalize sex work because you know you have social skills most people who have social skills even if third a dry patch and they can't get laid they're going to be able to get laid eventually you know there are people out there who don't have any social skills the vent diagram have no social skills and in cells
circle and
we
yeah that's a lot because of the phone will spend all day on the phone you don't have social skills
when you think of sex work and sex workers and decriminalize and stigmatizing it's not just the stigmatizing stacks worked for the sex worker but also for the sex buyer and what the culture says about someone who buy sex is a criminal these a misogynist he's a monster he's a loser and so one of things that get said about the in cells is why don't they just go see sex workers well we already feel like losers so going to sex workers going to make
that were especially if their prosecuted we need to do now i don't want to wake lock my friends were sex workers and rooms with violent rage filled in cells but in the same we socialized medicine not stop social going to expect women to their property and nice to meet on sex workers and sex work there are some people who the only way they will ever get laid his to buy is to pay for it i mean that shouldn't be
the stigma to think that people are if people were quadriplegic like the movie the our those sessions with helen hunt oscar nominations quadriplegic the only way this person is ever gonna have sex in his life is that he buys it because he's so physically disabled will some people are so socially disabled that their only outlet for any sort of sex again is
yeah i mean we have an expert here on these issues all that those comments stand just as they are
i have to say this isn't new i mean people who struggled but some arm unfortunately you have the here
how can i say i have to say i'm i'm evidence that you don't need to look like dan to get a gay and i mean you can you can get a date
the high of a less complex answer just run a few laps and brush your teeth and get out there
edit
people who are right yeah i know adapted the bear and repulsive but the put the other thing i have to say about this is again this this challenge i don't think his new what what has brought it out in this sort of way in the past couple of weeks learning for the first time about this in sell movement i felt so all because it just seems sure darn crazy right but what i think what
it is as we have a massage and mystic leader a president who scapegoats people for one problem or the other any combine this sort of thing this massage any in the scapegoating blaming other people for your problems and it gives rise to the vocal the localize in of these feelings that i think you're confusing thing with them
sergeant is to happens to be our president has had many wives and has as we know as had sex at many women and paid for and paid for it so yes and paid for it but it's a confusing message when aside i said
in the case trump paid paid for this he also said he tried to offer money to stormy and karen i'm just saying trumps to massage and he has not turned women often will and fees okay i let me interrupt for a piece of comedy
but i do enjoy the that times married for us magazine us magazine should send me a frigate fruit basket
because we do this all the time twenty five things
you don't know about me busy
okay so this week we're doing michael cohen
i got on my kids use air quotes from they call me a liar
the reason i have sixteen cell phones is because i grew up the first fifty and the toilet
based on that stormy daniel sketch i can't believe how hard i used to look
i can get you some clean urine
i was forty five years old before i found out ice picks can also be used to pick ice
i do crossword puzzles when i'm waiting for line to dissolve a body
and i mentioned us lazy lawyer i think when i'm stealing a ring off corpse corpses hand and get stuck i run it through don juniors

my first media parents was me dragging a slice of pizza gonna fly

and may oh you are bitches i'm already in russia
denmark
see is failing to deliver economic growth and how to fix it
wow

congratulations on your book and a terrific i think you have the right topic i'm also worried about democracies a dying tell me why so many people aren't concerned and when you say democracy is in trouble i think a lot of people would seem so abstract how do we make it personal to them and let them know it's important to bear actual
while while their whole host of factors that are suggesting that democracy and to seize for one thing voters participation rates are down considerably on the around fifty percent everywhere here well maybe the united states is the vanguard him liberal democracies and i'm particularly focused on the us but of course across western europe where democracies are so prevalent we are
seem very low
participation rates are low income households even worse it's less than thirty percent by some studies in the deep concern is that this is really far from the one man one vote mantra of democracy but the other issues that money has seeped into politics
about one hundred and fifty eight families in this country that responsible for fifty percent of the of the political contributions to the president in two thousand and sixteen lobbying has doubled in the past couple of decades people feel disconnected actually disaffected and their study some pew them the think tank that eighty percent of americans just don't
even trust the federal government to do what's right and a regular basis and we don't really teach the with of that and should anymore so i think i don't think people know what's missing because they didn't know it was there
i think that's absolutely right and you know issues around civics and education but also there's really no minimum standards for being a politician anymore and the way that they used to know we don't have politicians who have experience in agriculture is farmers and teachers and lawyers and we now have a professional politicians and i think that's a great disservice to us as well
so a lot of people around the world younger people they look to china know because china gets things done but it's not a democracy so you're hitting on exactly the central part of the thesis of my book which is this my nokia in political in liberal political systems is particularly problematic all the problems that the global economy and the unite
states is facing over the next decades or long term intergenerational problems things like the amount of debt income inequality worsening the risk of technology killing off jobs i mean those are all very very deep structural problems and yet our politicians are very short term that thinking about no next election and this creates discuss your how do how do we make
i'm not do that way but i mean that's the really i mean that's why china succeeds because of course you know if you have a dictatorship you don't have to ask somebody with we should do with they go watch but switch from coal and let's do it tomorrow and they can do that or they can bring people out of poverty which they have yes you don't want to live in a country or i wouldn't want to live in
a country with the government exactly we live here because we want to they can think twenty five years ahead we don't think twenty five months ahead he has how do we devised politics i think that we can incentive buys them by linking their pay to longer term outcomes i think one of the areas while their compensation i think should be higher but they should be forced to
justify their compensation just the way we are forced to say the laura
in that sector yeah so loudly it
drugs in that right exactly but just in singapore for example the politicians are actually paid bonuses at the end of the the yeah based on long term outcomes what happens in life expectancy what happened to gdp i mean in this country and politicians and paid we get people like the discount pruitt go ahead of the yes i think he's in government
just because this is as good as it's going to fly first class you know he's in it for the production well you know i think there's been so much of a revolution or on compensation in private sector i don't see why we shouldn't apply said stringent rules to the public sectors well but some of your fixes for democracy sound like going backwards
they sound like maybe they're not for you're talking about waited voting which is worse on people who are experts but how do you determine that sometimes get moreover a vote and what they used to call a poll tax know giving people an exam before they can vote i can certainly see this
there you have to profit
i heard the what we certainly don't want that i mean i think i'd be the first person disenfranchised if i actually started to put proposing waited voting so we don't want it in a way that does adjective such as wealth a race or gender are the the guidelines and but as an immigrant coming to this country you are required to take a civics test and essentially i think it's really about
showing engagement and caring about the civics civics and also the political process and that's really what i think is worth considering
that sounds like a good neutral place to to weigh in and maybe he started the referee referring of the girls are issue because course this week
open the american embassy in jerusalem us which did cause a riot as was predicted
course people are blaming both sides what's your view well when is they're not a riot in that region of the world i mean i think it's an armor
it's incredibly incredibly infuriating to me that we tend to be so short term on these issues why don't we have a set of proposals that are longer term that actually can stick in a way that is much more fruitful made this but the a bandaid interventions and in i do understand that there are some but i've been to jerusalem i know
know that people are living cheek by jowl from very different religions i don't see why we keep coming back with these very short term policies that we know are going to be problematic in the long term what do you
i love you but the riots were not caused by the end the see move know i should they were linked they're not like they are no know they remains much worse than these demonstrations were going on but they explain how does anyone actually israeli thousand and eight when hamas attacked israel and two thousand and twelve and and attacked israel
two thousand and fourteen the embassy was in tel aviv all of those times
this was no this was intentional first of all these protests him and going on for six weeks and they intentionally moved up the day so that it would coincide with the opening of the embassy move so that we would all be discussed in in heartbroken when we saw this horrible split screen of a farm could trump looking like she was at a country club next hour or desperate
diner yeah i agree with you they planned that absolutely right and i'm just saying let's not fall for a trap it is being set by a theocratic authoritarian rule that is send the children are for rooms know
i couldn't agree more with all of that
there's this idea and i would call it the soft bigotry have lower expectations so before when people booed me on the subject but i think they're the bigots when they just assume that if something goes on in this part of the world as you said there's going to be riots and you can't organize your foreign policy iran choose what what is muhammad
going to do
while i'm running
shut everybody else
we're wondering where wondering why now why did the why did the us government move him as he did yours will now but this was going to happen previously past administrations have thought okay will doable will do it as a part of a larger peace deal that was sort of where the right in the left on foreign policy were but we have a different situation you know we have a president who is increasingly vulnerable
because he and his people's families and his administration his campaign are being investigated by and a special counsel and everybody else mid terms are approaching the democrats may take the house back and he'll be at risk of impeachment he was throwing red meat to be that's what was yours
this has been the capital of israel in every country has to decide grew up and we've got to be able to dissect what the right policy is there for the united states but in what's motivating trump in that movement now in the way it was done because in my view we could have done that and we could have done it now but we could have done it in no way that may be extended
an olive branch to the palestinian authority maybe not have much
i agree about her got it's the palestinian authority that's in misery in gaza is they're the ones who are cutting off a boss is the one cutting off the electricity to guy's not vote for complex reason you have a terrorist organization running gaza so it's it's it's which complex as you hundred and nineteen forty eight harry truman recognize israel
when it was first announcing it was a country and a lot of people in america said if you do that there's going to be riots and there were riots now would you go back in time and say harry truman shouldn't do that because there were going to be right and we shouldn't have thrown moving away of something israel netanyahu wanted desperately trying and so it was a point of leverage he's a
there goes the worst you make isn't guys in some concession not of israel to try to tamp down the violence or or or come back to the table and negotiate in good faith with not hamas but the palestinian authority which they're not doing and so trump just through that away and didn't use it as a point of leverage and no longer
a bad deal maker he's got some pretty good deals of the last couple of weeks i mean he's guns for him yeah absolutely
i just think that i wouldn't dismiss them as outright being a bad deal made about john harbaugh yeah oh yeah to us and but you know i try to the extent that think that's exactly my point is that his base in his is a direct audience loved exactly what happened
he's made promises and he's he is keeping them like it or not that's the point i did what kills me is that he's inviting these korea i mean it's not just evangelicals it's like katie it's heyday it's bad guy jeffers it for islam is born in a of hell and hitler caused israel one of the people that travel invited to the opening of the undersea to give a prayer was this
reverend hey you got yeah most often became camping because he said that hitler god sent hitler to hunt the jews because they rejected christ and he's the dude and netanyahu is fine with this he's the do the trump invites to the embassy to give it the jesus right hand robber jeffers i mean it's all a show it's a production for the base that's what this yet
not to say not to say that the policy of moving the middle east jerusalem isn't the right thing or that we have new to i agree kills me and the reason i grabbed the going to go exciting
just spit it kills me that trump and the republican party are turning israel which should be a progressive issue into a right wing one and i think it's a was turning
it's now not one single democratic are showing on rails the either israel did that under obama went to war with obama and democrats if anyone turned israel into a right wing issue the last eight years it was the hypocrisy of people who who this position and like where would you rather live with your in the middle east
in gaza there's no real low our pride terry the guards it's not your values yet they're defending my okay so i once had queen of jordan on the show and they said we'll will address or as your highness and i said i and will not
not it as queen
or of that area just because any clean and i bring this up because the royal wedding is tomorrow and we did something on the show a couple of weeks go about grandfather fathering stuff from old times and not getting upset about how everything has to be what we used to think back in the day and i made the point that people are doing things
today that are going to look terrible i think the way we treat animals is not going to look good in the future i mentioned beauty pageant
still have to look
and i think calling people your highness i know that the biggest issue in the world
but it bugs me
i think it's really stands out like a sore thumb when we're trying to get our alitalia and about everything else and we were happy to do it americans loved the world the more than the british like oh yeah we to a british really wanted first family and their surrogates right now
that's right
ask ask or to defend monarchy just a little bit learned something to be said for taking the power in the trappings and the majesty really of the role of head of state and pushing it away from political parties and political power that the trappings of airforce one in the white house the palace been benefits republicans are benefits the democrats depending on who's
in power in the u k and other constitutional monarchies in northern europe vat is the royal families shit and the politicians don't get to get their grubby hands all over it and exploited for political gain and political benefit and there's something to be said for that the role of head of state being separated from political but to other european countries subsidize the monarchy the way
the british to him and it cost them a lot that's a big house clean and that's not the only house they got summer castles and giant plate what why and the prime minister is like in a office park
there was like that's where the monarchy should let me see donald trump in an office park is approach normal
yeah but i mean it just seems ass backwards to me and i don't know why they the foot the bill for that
last issue
gina hospital
was confirmed she is going to be the head of the c i a l a
i mean there was a lot of controversy about that because she did run a black side apparently she was somebody who was overseeing torture in two thousand and three when it was all the rage
and i think it's okay just because whoever is behind her would be worse at least she wasn't on dancing with the stars
yeah complex issues here i'm glad we had the national discussion again about the enhanced interrogation and in torture and all of that i mean we were not in the right place before as a country a wasn't just it was deal jr elected officials on both parties actually you are aware of this we moved on from there
they're mostly the president still talks of torture but as a country we've moved on i hope we never go back to that but i will say that my concern with gina hospital not been confirmed was the president trump would then nominate a political loyalists to somebody who would use the great powers of the central intelligence agency ago
an organization i was which i was proud to serve for over a decade in perhaps turn those on the american people on behalf of the president for political purposes we can allow that to happen i don't believe gina and experienced professional having gone through her thirty plus years of experience they're having experienced a national
mistake with she were announced you that's right now israel is that enough but we still geographically i may i i think it's not over his intimate thing that because the president says he still wants to do and not just about the president i think the united states for decades in the past has been the vanguard of true
justice and values and what we've seen over the last several decades it's actually been quite disheartening as somebody who's one of the poorest regions of the world and we expect much more from the united states is not just about legality it's also about morals and ethics country and we're talking on the stand that scene is that right
the moral authority to tell other countries you can have nuclear weapons because when we first started doing that it was like everybody understood where the good people example or the people who would never use them except were the ones who did one
where the people who always stand for right and good and we're not that we don't have that authority and get more i'm not for other countries getting nuclear weapons but i can see why aren goes why should you be telling us that have nuclear weapons
you're not a dirty place now
the enhanced interrogation it's not enhanced interrogation and torture enhanced interrogation is towards your one of the techniques that was described was locking people in these boxes were they couldn't move money ago to say amateur if you go to dhaka the concentration camp outside munich there is a room full of the boxes that they locked people in the torture them the things that were describe
having is enhanced interrogation when the nazis did it was torture it's still torture when we did it it was torture okay thank you

our oldest boy who was taken do or truck rally in indiana has to tell us at one point during trumps page he realize oh my god my dad is an asshole

and finally no role of all the fairy tales we've told ourselves here in america the one we most need to get rid of now is in america no one is above the law
like conservatives could we be i'd about this magic infallible constitution that jesus personally delivered to the capital
it's incumbent on the rest of us to remain clear right about its flaws and when you don't have to follow the orders of law enforcement as trump clearly doesn't you are above the law
i'm tired of hearing t the lawyers say the president can't refuse a subpoena even rudy giuliani said that he said you gotta do it i mean you don't have a choice you except that was a nine hundred ninety eight when clinton was president
now rudy says we don't have to use the president and the united states
as where these three ex wives can tell you he's not really good at being married to anything

i know liberals have this vision of trump forced out of the white house and arrested but that's not going to happen no matter how many cartoons or that you post on your facebook feed the news is tightening i hear people say no the news is not tightening his face is always that color
the constitution does not give permission to indict or prosecute a president yield can't legally resist arrest but he can could you ignore a subpoena could you pardon yourself if you're obedience to the law
strictly voluntary or compelled by shame of which he has none you are above the law if you don't believe me the next time a cop is writing you a ticket try saying i don't think so office or your traffic stop is a witch hunt
don't bother arresting me either i've already part and myself executive privilege bitch

the constitution only has two week courses for an evil president the twenty fifth amendment which allows the cabinet to remove a president who was crazy and incapacitated which might work if trumps cabinet wasn't crazy and capacity

and impeachment but impeachment means nothing without conviction which requires sixty seven votes in the senate which even after the best blue wave election ever would mean at least a dozen republicans crossing party lines not going to happen were on the honor system
and republicans have fresh out of honor

john adams had it right back in seventy and eighty when he said there is nothing which i dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties but that's what happened and even the founders couldn't foresee our current level of tribalism were half of this would hear laurel and a half would hear ya

they never imagined a congress full of shameless partisan enabler who wouldn't turn on trump if they found out he was using the eternal flame to light far it's

and in that atmosphere
as president doesn't have to do anything anything except explore how far he can go until he stopped like the way he used to walk into the dressing room with the this universe pageant
oh i know i know we're playing three de jess and he yeah he's playing i tip the board over
because here's what's going to happen muller will requested interview trump will say no mother will then subpoena him trump will say go fish
it goes to the supreme court their parties are now to we learned that in bush vs gore but say they do the right thing and order him to hundreds of peanut and he still says know what do we do then called dog the bounty on her

that's when the same experts will be saying a president has never defied the supreme court stop telling me he'll never do that he always does that
it's not normal is not an argument that works on donald trump that's the kind of dare that make some hard
like a penis pump that runs on coal

if the supreme court rules against him he'll attack them just like he did the f b i the justice department that supreme court will be the new deep state enemy and their rulings will be good news
this year when president g of china made himself president for life trump said president for life i think it's great maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day
a month later he suggested he should have for terms like f d r people say he's joking about this stuff but when his trump ever told a joke
his idea of a funny gag is making mike pence kiss his ass in public
maybe the reason he keeps saying he wants to be president for life
is because he wants to be president for life think about that

what
well we all wish the first lady well bought a truck still have the hospital for a procedure they're very vague about they say trump visited or three times
there's a hot nurse at the hospital
or she's resting comfortably at a golf course there will be the army
what did i find a place where there are sympathetic would drop
so here's a new poll
only thirteen percent of americans think the trouble is i wish i wish i knew these thirteen percent
i could sell a lot of time share
it's like this
both corrupted buddhist or every seen this guy scott pruitt ahead of the environmental protection agency

but don't have to do to get fired or any or fuck strongly daniel

this week we had the one year anniversary of the bob miller probe into the russia
fair and in the entire ear bob barr has not said a word he was completely unflappable
as opposed to donald trump
where's the most flammable person in america
the good work as one of those inflatable man outside the quiet

because any a lawyer rudy giuliani dvd dvd a thing he wants to wrap up the mahler prob c'mon c'mon wrap it up
if they know who's got a plan b and a plan c to wrap up the world
a plan b is exerting executive authority plan c is let's just say it's about good for north korea
thank you one guy
spread it around
yeah things are suddenly off the rails because trumps any national security advisor john bolton said we want to do this on the liberty an example
member would happen in libya kuroda daffy wound up with a knife in his
so that's what we're putting out there was this only libya
sample and so the north korean bathroom said we do not hide our feelings of repugnant toward john bolton
well there are some common ground
but here's the scandal of the week which of course got buried because we're so used to scandals china was into this china invested a billion dollars in a resort project which will in rich trump personally immediately trump gave china a curiously favorable trade country
question
put this another way trump ordered sanctions listed on this just telecom company is he phones we have them here
well they're spying on your right now
just hours after the chinese government gave five hundred billion dollars to build a trump resort in indonesia this is a diplomatic and negotiating tactic called open bribery

right




yeah
we're very good job at night
a tough tough week for the line
the line the one that comedians sometimes growth that
a lot of work the wide africa was roseanne to go away forever and the gutter he wants to be to go away forever so so much for wanting more female voices and television
roseanne
my friend but our world came crashing down
a series of tweets you put out on tuesday that were just so full of racism
spirited theories and personal attacks they were described as of horrid bordering on presidential

this is instructive the tweet that sealed the deal i think we all saw on television and i'm sure when you first saw this you had the same reaction i did i don't have a decoder ring
i have no fucking clue what new wing nuts in your bubble are talking about
now my friend roseanne admitted that she had been admitted to a mental institution she said she has multiple personalities and unfortunately one of them is quite a racist
but it's also not a mystery to me how a person with mental illness could be taken in by a party that has lost its mont

the j in the tweet is valerie jarrett who was one of person obama is key advisors and she took the high road she said this is a teaching moment
whoa what a day for drum supporters first they lose first they lose their favorite show
they get threatened with learning

trump responded in kind of where he always does right focusing on the real victim him
this back a tweet about the hawaii is volcano would make it about him
on orange and gas a

such a whiny little bit
he was complaining that a b c
never apologized to him
yeah because no one in a b c ever compared you to an ape you're thinking is may

the snowflakes on the right and yes there are plenty on the right to try to drag me into this saying i should be fired because i compare drummed to and a rag tag
okay obviously this is another day where we have to do explaining jokes to idiot

here's why that's a dumb analogy it overlooks for key facts one trump isn't a rag tag
so white people have not been subjected to a racist trump comparing them to apes for hundreds of years
my offering trump five million dollars to produce his birth certificate in two thousand and thirteen to prove that he was not happen ape
which i'm sure you remember he then actually did
certainly went to court to get bedside million dollars
but i did that big it sells itself a response to his birthday
racist bullshit so
for i've already been fired by

the other person i was in hot water that samantha bee apologized for her her joke which called about good trump a sexless c word trump was furious he said i am the only one who gets to talk dirty about my daughter

why is he mad about that word
not come feckless
no idea what it means he was like a bunker
luck is not loaded with fuck
maybe in a whole history the world nobody has no effect

i say that very strongly
yes the man who put grab them by the pussy into grade school history books is very upset about the coarsening of the culture
trump had much bigger things on his mind this week he held historic talks with kim kardashian
at the white house this really happened there's a picture of and you can find it online if you google when american died

but when you're thinking about it it was probably a good meeting they have a lot in common they both come from reality t v they both have their own brands
both screwed a lot of black people

there actually was a high level talk to a young child who is the north north koreans by master news and margin and delivered a letter to president drum trying to get the korean thing going again
drum says version of the reporters it's an amazing let you pay me to see what was in nine minutes later he said i have not read the letter
really
roseanne drunk
crazy crazy but apparently the letter was very polite but direct it said if you ever want to see maloney again place fifty thousand
small
the base of the washington
no one has seen the first lady in two thousand and two days
she'll turn up
and we all going to get a good laugh and it turns out she ran off with the mexican gardner

i heard as charlemagne by god as backstage
have a democratic presidential nomination and twenty six day and you might remember the standard from remote bernie sanders






you are more popular than stormy daniels lawyer
sounds like they want you to run again

but there's an election before twenty twenty
been going around saying and i couldn't agree more it's the most important election ever i'm going to ask you why but first a little bone to pick with the politicians i have been hearing since i was eighteen years old every election is the most important election
you all cried wolf on this one and a lot of people are not going to believe that this one really is the most important please tell us why
the most important because we have a president who is a pathological liar
have a president
who has strong or authoritarian tendency to once through every day undermine american democracy
and in my state and all over this country you have many women who have fought and died to defend the american democracy and this guy looks so all over the world and it kind of likes all of these or authoritarian leaders
he attacks the media every day trying to make it harder for them to be critical of him
and we have a president who is a billionaire himself was surrounded himself with billionaires who gave huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country and then brings forth a budget
that would cut medicaid by a trillion dollars mehdi can't by five hundred billion dollars cut nutrition programs for hungry kids cause social security disability a president who told the american people
that he was going to provide health care to everybody remembers their bill
cheaper and better cheaper and better and then he supports legislation to throw thirty two million people off of their health care that they had one does that sink in with his people
because gas prices are going up reality show the around deal people do not as good health care and some have been thrown off is going to lose jobs because of this of trade war he started when does the cult of personality where away in favor of wait you're actually hurting me what we need to do is a couple of things
frankly from a political point of view it is not good enough to simply attacked from every single day what we need to do is bring forth an agenda
that working people all over this country are going to respond to and let me be very clear and i've said it before
in two thousand and sixteen it's not the trump one it's the democrats lost and for too long
how to party
democratic party has been dominated by wealthy campaign contributors they got to open the door to people who work with their hands people who take showers at the end of the day not at the beginning of the day
actually many young people
we have a generation out there have some of the brightest most decent young people in the history of this country beautiful young
let's start to get this for years ago in two thousand and fourteen we had the lowest voter turn out for midterm election since world war two thirty seven percent of the people voted if we increase their voter turn out by fifty percent democrats when the house when the
and that's what

so imagine the democrats lost last on
what your agenda one newman and have won the nomination right but it talk about an agenda they're all behind that now get medicare for all in all the people who are running for president we can i know who they are
income inequality all those issues but an agenda is not a message they are different trump is better and messaging they know his voters don't seem to care about an agenda or anything except build a wall locker up
what's the democrats message if he had to boil it down to something that would sit on a hat which is about all people can take in at this
what is the democratic messer democratic message is that we need a government that represents working families not billionaires

an agenda that says that a health care is a right not a privilege
speech to the young people and says that we should make public colleges and universities tuition free and lower students
trump has shown that the american people they elected him i understand he didn't win the popular vote it had gotten a lot of votes
and his popularity rating keeps going up not down yeah it's it's almost in the range of like a normal president which is really scary because he certainly is not that so they obviously don't care about so many things they used to care about like decorum or policy or democracy or
freedom of the press so in this new arena and he's a is brilliant at controlling the debate and controlling air time what does it democrat has to do to compete on this new the day
new stain that's a fair point in the air time issue is very difficult people's where where the democrats talking about distance you want in many cases democrats or but we're overwhelmed with trumps tweets and the absurdity of the day so i think what democrats have got to do basically is go into
trump country
and talk to people who are now living in desperation you know the truth of the matter is one of the reasons in my view the term one is that he sense that they were millions of people in this country who were ignored by the political establishment
they ignored by the elite they're working longer hours for low wages they are scared to death about the future facing their children and he said and he lied i hear you our job is not to lie to have the guts to deal with the serious issues that they face and to take on the people who are power in this

my bill i'm here in l a today tomorrow
i'll be with workers in disneyland who are working for one of the largest corporations in america they gave their ceo a four hundred million dollars compensation package but paying their workers starvation wages and i'm going to stand with those workers getting decent wages and for me


we're going to be dealing and working with folks from black lives matter addressing a broke criminal justice system which more more people understand the it's fundamental reform

you sound like you're busy i let you go over more
a big agenda and by the way you don't look any different than the last time you read so if you don't run don't do it just because of age don't let them intimidate you are out there

the democratic party is traditionally pulled apart by this battle that we saw in two thousand and sixteen between the left and the center hillary clinton's a centrist you read a whole different kind of campaign
how do we unite them because that's the path to victory is to is the night and the last want to do it was obama who was really more of the centrist but people saw him as a leftist because they wanted to i think we are coming together around a progressive agenda as you indicated medicare for raising the minimum wage climate
change etc
and i think frankly that at the end with the primary season
every person in the democratic community will understand that we have infinitely more in common
then our this for differences or and that we got to unite we've got to bring our community together to take on the most outrageous president in the history of this country

okay


as a prize winning economist in our rights than airtime secretary to m s n b c or friend brad stevens is over here
and democratic strategist georgetown reverse see an anchor german or paul begala
a staff writer for the atlantic contributor to m s n b c n n b c natasha bertrand
a knife overtime is going out to them after the show on youtube okay so i'm going to pick up from that discussion and let's talk about never trump or as you are and ever trump or i guess still am right you actually voted for hillary i did and you are now
you are now a member of a party that no longer exists that's right
in theory it exists existing remarried but
when i read this week is only five percent of republicans have a negative view of president trump so i guess my question to you is do then work for democrats in two thousand and eighteen you've called hillary a survivable event i think ball and i would have gotten quite a bit better they on
what do you actually work for democrats
i work for the new york times some people say it's the same thing
look what i what i'd love to see is the republican party rebuked by the electorate in such a way that it causes some kind of excuse the expression come to jesus moment for
the alternative is a republican party that's going to continue to drift in the direction of france's national front and other not just populace but bordering on sasha parties that we're seeing rising in europe and we can't let that happen i think are ahead of them and somewhere
anybody surprised at how quickly this party was overtaken by the trump people because yes yes i mean my whole life the republicans were the corporate party and they were for free trade present slapping terrorists bryant so far mostly on our friends and allies as an interesting things and nothing can make been happier
by the way into be attacking the europeans can aids experts who are best friends
the republican stood for a whole set of of social and cultural values
that they like to pretend to oppose on everybody else he he's up ended the entire thing that's been shocking to me is how quickly the republican establishment washing by which i mean mitch mcconnell paul ryan all the big shots have knelt before sod and brett easy
for me
brett milk crystals
a few others just like and band sas in the senate center mccain there have been some who stood up and it takes an enormous amount of courage it's not really surprising to me it's not fine to be in the minority in congress and the republicans they wrote that trump wave may knew that trump excited his base so much and they saw
they kind of the way that he animated so many people and the way that democrats with hillary clinton just cut and and this goes back to kind of the the shift in strategy that we are starting to see from progressives starting to ryan i'm very very progressive platforms like states abrams in georgia for example just being on a pile
on apologetically progressive and liberal and not trying to pander to their lives in a way that donald trump never dead
the person who might be the first black woman governor right
in a good actually won the primary in georgia should be another woman who
took the opposite approach was going after the
maybe the people voted last time for trump the working world class the maybe you know you've had your trip to crazy town come back home to the democrats and she got her ass kicked and this woman so zebra is no i'm just going to go through the base just minorities young people fuck the rest are you nuts
but then in georgia then i've i've worked in about what i support and stacey evans who got beat by fifty three points so this was an instructive thing for me but stacey
abrams who won what she said and election night soft stacey evans a woman who was defeated endorser right away
so you're seeing party unity and an abrams said something remarkable she said i want to ensure that all georgians from farmers and montezuma to mill workers and don't know that we value them she went out a way that night actually to put forward that wedge issues but web issues either actually did a great job of trying to stitch things back together though it's just like bernie did here i think that the day
distance between the factions the republican party is extraordinary the distance between the factions the democratic party is not very great and he will try past national healthcare and a bill clinton twenty five years ago and he supposed to be a martyr how but if you're if you're nominating very progressive democrats in very red states you're going to lose and i don't
want the democratic party to seize from the republicans the the the mantle of being the stupid party into the point is is to win right that's the point of the the election so you know democrats think if we just turn out our base when you turn out minority voters who didn't show up last on we're going to win guess what to can play that game republicans
can turn out large numbers of voters that also gave her to there's more of us the new that's what you think know that's true and we just don't vote
i mean i agree that you might be right we don't know but but in georgia it's interesting
the democrats nominated moderates before and they only got twenty five percent of the vote around twenty five percent of the vote in georgia and come support among republicans may be around eighty five and ninety percent but people who identify as republicans are extreme king people are leaving the republican party so if the what they said would yeah
this was going in years ago a grudging democratic much right and and trump looked around and when you know what i still see a lot of white people out there but still
a lot of thought that crackers and i'm going to go after each and every one of the put a lot of those white people voted for trouble had voted for barack obama they are not lost us democrats do have to go out from i think abrams we'll we'll wait and see forty four percent of voters in america are white with only a high school degree how can the democrats be the party of inclusion and exclude for
four percent of the country it's a bad way to govern it's a bad way to run and i believe this they have much more top common those working class white folks with people of color than anybody wants to let him know that i saw senator sanders should i make in the case so that it had a great job but the issues that are the you know the true
the left issues when you look at the polling people who care that much about the environment even guns which was certainly got a lot of publicity lately you know somebody like connor lamb walked away from at issue you wouldn't touch that the go the democrat and one in pennsylvania
income inequality i know right it's over and big issue but voters want to be billionaires you know they don't hate the rich i mean i think that the immigration the mantra of the democratic party and twenty eighteen or twenty to twenty should be make america seen again
right
kind of purple state candidates why don't we ask candidates one was the last time you change your mind when was the last time you cross party lines on one issue
show us that you can get along with the other side i think that would be amazing and i think it will be winning for democrats maybe winning or redeeming for republicans if they could do it because right now our politics spends towards the fringe healthy democratic politics should bend to the sun to look at virginia this week virginia expanded medicaid one of the fondest dreams of progressives like bernie like barack obama
like me they expanded it with a republican legislature why because elections matter the democrats picked up seventeen seats they almost got the majority and their moderate governor ralph nor them cut the deal to expand medicaid to four hundred thousand virginians that's every liberals dream so i just get there is a way forward for
so why we
but republicans are running on immigration that their big issue that's what gets their base riled up they've already run thousands of eggs and it's always on that issue and democrats are weak on that issue or they don't know they're right on that issue and they have to stay right
they should be your next boss is going to be an immigrant and probably already is
and it's shameful out you're working with voters now
that's that's a that's a core values issue about what we are as americans and one of the reasons i've said i can i cannot see myself voting republican again is this stand this hatred this constant bigotry against immigrants high and low

i think democrats should have and probably still should call out present trumpet it's a con it's a con
net flow of mexicans is from america to mexico has been for almost ten years we've lost a million mexicans we have misplaced of the gone home while you slow down
if you if you look at what democrats are winning on its what bernie talked about connor lame in a very very conservative district ran on entitlements more medicare medicaid protecting social security he ran against that trump tax cut which eighty three percent of which goes to just one percent of the wealthiest people and that's in a district that trump one by seventeen points so it's these
economic issues i think i do think they should call b s on immigration stuff because i think a diversion that mean you tell him what the diverting you from i don't necessarily think that people that voted for trump are paying attention to what he's actually doing with regard to issues i think that they're just focusing on the latest outright cycle it's also so hard for there to be transparent re
porting about anything that's happening at the border at the anything that's happening in terms of real substantive issues when you have a new tweet from the president every day and you're wondering is to he wake up is insane today i mean it's just really really difficult to keep up with all of the scandals and that is a major reason why he's been able to just distract everyone so much with every different thing that he has
going on every day and that's that's what i think people are looking at everything now about the republican party is about owning the limb to say it's about know it trolling people and distracting said that they don't see what the actual the sausage being made well as to worst episode here and real time previously on real time
i was saying that prison drunk wants to be president for life and that he literally is above the law even though your everyday on to the he's not above the law who's totally above the law but there's something even scarier than that his son done jr who i call a dish big on fox

all my greatest hits the night
i don't know if they will people realize that he is being groomed already the he's a huge star know in the republican base and he's shopping a book i saw a headline today it is donald trump junior sniffing around for a book deal i guess i don't remember that we showed the book he wrote last year
some kind of an introspective guy
i read some of these and now that we know he's looking for another book deal i'm going to read some more would you like to hear that
it's out by the pictures i vp is like sometimes i like to get out into nature to pause and reflect into imagine where we'll put that because you know
is a true satisfaction comes i'm earning an honest day's pay and working your way up from the bottom i would imagine
you realize just how insignificant you really are when you look at all the stars in the sky or talk to your father
sometimes i worry that there is so much beauty in the world i'll never have time to shoot at all
people who say never mix business with pleasure haven't done cocaine off the backup of qatar reposted
strongly daniels will be a good name for a cocktail

if a genie ever granted we three wishes my first wish would be go back home terrorist
and we have met the enemy and he is us i'm kidding it's mexicans
yeah

yeah
wow it's about time i got you yeah i've been wanting for a very long time man think you've added me you are a great talker so it always makes my job easier when i have absolutely i hate the fact that you are insulting orangutans open complain on the donald trump
everybody
the plane of age during a modern and down
and i think we have quite a lot in common one we both been fired on the fire fluids from four different radio stations seven times in life though if you count like taco bell and stuff like that
hired a few times and those and it's not a bad thing right i mean it can be a actually a blessing in disguise
i believe in divine miss direction
because because you know when it when he would call me an office they would always say you know we're looking to move in another direction and i got a homegrown name is kendra gees a little to her she told me once ammo is not dumb will the u in another direction it's god will be due in another direction and know you don't believe in god but i do so
ten your name yes
maybe your was in my name i believe that
and i think we also would give the same kind of advice i read in your books and the things you would say to younger people i remember years ago i got into all sorts of shit because i was taking on the idea that people in this country are always saying live your dream but it's always someone like an award show and making kids like want to be
musicians and model
athletes athletes i'm going to have this great story about someone who is very important you yes i do you fuck your dream you dream
vote
i actually say fuck your dreams you know because out but as a funky and dreams when it's not actually your dream could we do live in a country especially when you know you from node and the people that look like you black
that a successful are usually in entertainment have some form of athletic so everybody wants to run to the field that can't work for everybody it can't just not possible so every night and you need somebody to tell you fuck your dreams that you can figure out what it is you actually want to do but they told you you are not really a good rapper
right
they thought your dream right
your dream rush forgot what it is you actually one right and that's also something i think we both talk a lot about social media the fact that people don't really have their own opinion more right they have to check what everyone else is saying they wake up in the morning to attempt to shake is it ok to think like this didn't write it ok to like this
oh this is what everybody's not like you know camera with this so everybody width of in the morning and we wait for social media to tell us how to think and as way okay
so let's get into the people who were fired this week joker
what do you what did you what what was your reaction when you first heard about the rose and situation
it wasn't surprising not at all
rosanna the history of racism she either history of bigotry and i wasn't i didn't feel sad for her oughta cast on crew because when you get in bed with somebody like that you eventually know you're gonna have to deal with the consequences of their actions so we may go now you gotta go now
yeah i mean there's certainly no condoning it but there is something about a person who is mentally problem has mental problems
wow when lead and not not a lot nowadays you know me
if she had just came out the day before and i have mental problems i'd be like well that's an excuse you that this goes back a long time
does not excuse it absolutely no no i'm not i believe her freedom of speech but i don't believe that people are free from the consequences of stayed speech because
but you can't tell somebody how to react to it not been calling you know black woman a monkey is smart when your boss is indeed a black woman
it's horrible
and i think what we have to also understand is that donald trump
took great ownership of that show when it came out a member him at a rally saying this is great rose and she's something like this is officer for us to represent as well you know i always said about the trump people there's two things they they hate being called a racist and black people
you know they they make they make are so afraid to say you are racist because then they all up in arms but doesn't it kind of proves it to me that rose and you can't have it both ways she was your representative as the trump voter and now it is revealed as we've talked about on the
show before that the trumpeter was not really animated by economic anxiety so much as this i want to have my country barrier i eat a country that looked more like it did in the nineteenth what
arrested and i tell people what is all the time when it comes to donald trump when it comes the rules a financially they're going to be fine even after this whole situation will dig in fights you can we find somebody you're just too broke to be openly racist

set the fuck up forever
the openly racist shut up romance no move on
well i'm sure she's in hell right
put herself so that's why as where did they let people like donald trump empower them me like why are you following donald trump he's rich he can afford to be openly racist and right u k
yeah you suck a lot of anxiety
year
i found interesting
the people of color live with the kind of anxiety you think
your man okay
it was a shock
interesting the way you put it that way that kind of every day anxiety beard is my second book my first book is called black privilege opportunity comes it also created s l right now in real time
thank you i appreciate
second call it shook my anxieties playing tricks on me and that's what it's about is about you know just me deal with anxiety my whole life dealer would panic attacks and now wanted their be to try to deal with it because you know yeah when you are black man in america you are constantly dealing with a sense of anxious this like to eat he means it is the only two hours without taking
because i don't know if i'm going to get pulled over and taken to jail for some stupid and if you had to sit in a cold take needed to shape you know why you should call it

i think it's great that you can make yourself shit on command like that
that's a black thing but i got every right about losers
so this line thirty every morning

arie explore
so what about let me ask the panel this what do you think about the rosen situation and the cement the be situation and the whole idea of people stepping over the line and being vaporized will we should be able to make intelligent distinctions between will roseanne said which was an example yeah hundred and what samantha bee said which
was an example of outrage her outrage at an outrageous policy towards immigrants so yes
either the words you use or misuse the word cyclists which is really is almost as criminal but
but i get her point which is is furious that yvonne to trump is participating but not suffering the moral consequences of an administration that was forcibly separating mother's from their children suddenly that should never happen in america

there's a distinction to be made between what is a violation of free speech or what might be a violation of free speech and what isn't
and for the white house to have come out into of said immediately after samantha be made this comment and said she should be fired her show should be taken off there there's an argument to be made that is a serious violation of free speech
you illustration you're telling a search that workers
this is not
the president was completely silent about rose and comments and that was that was a company's decision to take her off the air for a racist comment that she i don't you an word can auto word was the because i don't understand why as an insult to call somebody something you enjoy
i agree especially know
and they keep changing the rules on on all these words
years ago you would never heard that word and are you hear it on larry david has done episodes where the blue with all around the word continent job with the british say that the queen probably so it's not it's not that bad and a little a little come to get over here
i just don't see that horrific sick of sense and i understand why it is a big word and women hate that word and we shouldn't use with the words do change meaning i think a lot and it is romania just changed because when ted nugent use that word about clinton mr trump welcomed him to the white house roger
stone drop ally
united not timid this is this is trumps bit close political our that word was fine for mr trump until sam be used it so spare me the self righteousness mr president
or sold at trump rally is that called hillary clinton that very worried i mean how many teachers and we have a door how many times that we have to see hillary clinton called that were during the campaign of course without a pizza in the town campaign so it's just all very disingenuous it is this is what we said and it was good joke that how he made it about himself but it is about him
this way and then surely you pointed this out the president sets the tone and there's a lot of social science research on this about social contagion that when the president says bad things about african americans about mexicans about muslims
it increases there's been studies of reddit that shows which never was very happy place it's gone
critics a way way way i absolutely hate crimes against muslims or up seventeen percent this is mr trump took office it's not t doesn't directly caused it but there is a social contagion we all learn from others but a particularly we learned from adelaide it reflects the movement itself because what the movement combines is is kind of sterile nasty
knows with relentless juvenile self pity and that's the president's character
which is breathed and therefore i want to kick you out of my country i'm aggrieved and therefore i want to put down your race or or or your religion how this came to represent the conservative movement has one of the great moral disasters of our of
time and that goes back to your earlier question at one day we're going to want a healthy conservative movement and some of us are going to have to represent that five percent tiny sliver so that sometime around nine hundred and forty five or i'm in two thousand and forty five there's there's something to stand up the whole all
benefit conservatives now to stand up against the racism and bigotry and white supremacy then the health related
and that's why i don't think you should dismiss never trump or we have to do it every single day it's why i'm not a democrat and i'm not going to become a democrat i'm going to remain a conservative but someone has to stand up and point this out and say this cannot be the movement ever stop using
politically correct times like old right call them what they are crack ass crack a white devil

has a particular republican bread right when when a klansman burned across and a family's home in maryland wrong right and went to their house at the same day he saw on the paper he went over there and he was no great what celebrate
he called out when david duke ran in louisiana george h w bush called him out he eat about him
when the terrorists bombed us george bush three days later went to a mosque try to educate people they just not about us like reagan also started his campaign purposely and the shelby county i know he has complicated history but in a moment of rachel ray rice which he did well
but in that era
edit your guy called john mccain who who jeopardized his campaign sure a rebuke a voter who wanted to insist that barack obama was an arab that was an instance of political courage we should never forget

could have phrased it better
she said he is an arab and he said no these are good man that's not exactly the message we want out there but i know what he was trying to say get him the benefit i do
so
where's millennia
no it's not the most important really hope she's ok we hope it's not helping her husband deported
no
think the last time she was spotted was the day of that of the prisoner traded in north korea

and that you're criticizing i don't remember this offered a not fire agree given his she's married to a titan center line or anybody you imagine i trouble looks happy you sweat more
so i'm just saying you sleep in the bed you make
okay so
pardons i only have a couple of minutes but we should mention is of course donald trump
ruins everything he touches but this i thought it was particularly said biggest part and is one of those cool powers that of president has to right or wrong it's really an act of mercy and of course he's turning and it's just another partition tool to undermine our democracy and he is so for juror pio and a scooter libby engineers to
any conservatives who were treated unfairly
the department of unfairly and now he's thinking about
martha stewart
oh we're gonna bitch who were also who used to be on celebrity apprentice
he's using it for a political allies i mean that show and right that this is a tool that supporter and you commit a crime i mean hey it's a great time to be a celebrity fallon because dollars round man mean i did he like
the main part in and also i mean there's a pattern here he has said that these people were treated unfairly well guess what he has also said that michael flynn was treated unfairly he has said that oh yeah but this is the kind of tactic he expect from my duro in venezuela or places like that you your political
you your political allies you know there was a front page story in the new york times by my colleague rosie golden sun about drug addicts who share drugs and one of them wakes up and the other the other is dead and the one who wakes up ends up going to jail on charges of of of homicide this is an outrage that this is happening in in this country
imagine if the president use those his part and powers to help those addicts to help them recover instead of sending the sending of having them sense of prison that's the sort of thing a pardon to be before those are the sorts of people that order before to imagine that it's martha stuart
i mean how many times can we say it but it's just the most extraordinary wave misusing the power of the presidency and debasing the entire why do we can talk into this guy like he's a president though he's a celebrity in cheek so we shouldn't be surprised that a celebrity is looking out for other celebrity but it's not celebrities it's sending a message to the people who turn on
human the russia can a dodge the fences when he has focused on lying to a federal grand jury disobeying a federal court order election law violations perjury these are exactly the issues mr muller is looking at so this is like he said this is three billboards outside the white house
that note i have to go
you
okay
from doesn't have to produce those two three and one hundred immigrant children he lost but we are going to need to see maloney
just proof of life
a photo of her holding up a newspaper
an here
here's a bad sign in the last time anyone saw you have your husband was holding a shovel

are all these golfers who chose to keep on playing during a volcano eruption have to take a serious look at their marriages
that's a hot lava toxic gas or an afternoon with the wife
what do you think bill before vote on this one i would
neural islamic terrorists have to come up with the new attack various besides all akbar we get it got his grade that's claire from the way your jabbing that life into people
but why and on freshen it up with some other tired catch phrase like billy billy or
can you hear me now or no collusion
you know if we as a society cannot get the boarding group thing right
let's just give up
you have a number is one know than sit the fuck down

we can't even get this right everyone has to try and push the way up front for what it's the night and gate agent not the last helicopter out of saigon

no someone has to tell illinois which fears legal marijuana will force them to retire almost three hundred drug sniffing dogs i'll take them

this is exactly the kind of dog i need loyal trained and able to answer the question why the hell did i hide my week

and finally no conspiracy theories has to go back to what they used to be fun little stories we would tell each other when we were high space aliens crashed in roswell hitler escaped argentina elvis is alive and working at the i
that's what conspiracy theories used to be but now they're the ideology of the republican party
conspiracy theorists used to be called crazy now they're called senator flag

it used to be an unwritten rule of both parties that you can't just make shit up the old you're entitled to your own opinion but not your own facts thing but
before republicans discovered yes yes you can just make shit up
you can have your own sacks in fact we just pulled a fresh batch out of the oven
and by the up and i mean our ass
you know
i never like rush limbaugh but i would take a return to ninety's a ditto heads any day because it turned out that rush was really just a gateway drug
to which they eventually built up a tolerance and then needed something stronger that was glenn beck
which led to alex jones and now republicans your the alex jones part
literally nothing too stupid and conspiratorial that you will not swallow hillary running a child sex ring out of a pizza parlor sounds right
obama his birth certificate fake jade helm absolutely trump tower the easier it gets the more they like it that's their jam they believe anything so we can stop sending reporters didn't diners now to figure them out they're not there for the breakfast they literally
there are clouds in the coffee
this week found out that eighty three percent of republicans either definitely believe or unsure whether five million people voted illegally in the last election something trump just completely made up even appointed a voter fraud commission based on his own fraud
odd
remember that bullshit i made up i want you to get to the bottom of it
this isn't about ideology any more trump has none anyway when he decided to run he didn't brush up on conservativism by studying buckley and reagan
and there's only experience with gold water was in a russian hotel room


and this isn't about actual republicans either those guys are gone george bush the first quit the and are ray in nineteen ninety five when some gun nuts called the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms jack booted dogs more said deeply offended his sense of decency and honor
but when alex jones has children think their own deaths at sandy hook it doesn't deter from from telling your reputation is amazing all that i will not let you down
their some makes you say and crap to crazy people sort of why
we should grab a pussy some

the latest thing truck pulled out of his ass is this nonsense about the f b i spying on him there was no spy it was just the mirror checking out whether someone on the trump campaign was communicating with russia based on the tiny fact that everybody in the trump campaign was communicating with

it's what the f b i he does investigation
it's in their name

even the folks who believes that the world is secretly run by an alien race of shape shifting lizard people
they ever video to back it up



can argue with that
but spy gate and there's literally nothing and that is so alarming because one way we measure the health of the society is by how conspiratorial it is communist countries arab dictatorships those places you could always sell anything because there was no trust in the institutions reaper
applicants that's what you're doing to this country

the only answer is that more sane people have to vote than insane people in every election so
tell your same friends that the mid terms are the most important election of their lives and tell your conservative friends that climate scientists are working with the clintons to slip a chemical into the air ducts at polling places that will turn everyone who vote

that's the america let's start off be important issue of the which witches or tv star got fired for trading
server show was cancelled after a series of tweets that were rife with racism in conspiracy theories and personal attack guess on the upside you're on drugs legal jeeves
said it was the n b c
the ambient if she would just stick to the drugs that ice

it was a series or which you started out saying this is where it said are saying chelsea clinton was married to george soros his nephew completely not true that george soros was a nazi who turned in his fellow jews in the concentration camps i don't want to say this is tin foil hat crazy shit
good about three tweets in surrey interrupted and said you can google this shit
honestly this is for people's understanding of racial issues is on the level of come there's no white history month
so so that's the big story rose and lost her show and trump said big deal i can't find milan it
have you seen that no one has seen the first lady for twenty one days
we were wrong about drop is not hitler read henry the eighth
but honestly
who's crazier roseanne or trump category
it is kind of the torso i mean trump treated this week
his tweet not matters but i never fired call me because a roger corrupt mainstream media love to keep pushing that narrative
okay we're not saying that you fired called me because of russia because it's obviously true were saying that it's what you said you did

and it's not like you to lie
terms to fence literally who you're going to believe may or may
what donald tramp as much bigger things on his mind he held his start talks with kim kardashian
you see that our is deal making skills are a sharp is over

welcome to h b o passed from h b o maintenance eve real time

we finally reach the post american world your wrote about a decade ago
what do you know what i was writing about in that book was the posts american were because you had china rising at india rising you had your a bit had come to get the point i was trying to make was were to get a historical shift of power where these other countries often been a long been mired in poverty arising in
economic growth political power cultural confidence
that word has been going on you know the emerging markets were five percent of global gdp twenty five years ago then a fifty percent of global gdp but what i did not predict was that the united states which sort of abrogate leadership
its position because i i argued the united states would still be incredibly powerful it would set the agenda it represented the values it had a way of be able to be the leader and this shift where the united states has decided to literally just walk away from its own creation i mean people forget this was the world at f d r and harry
room and built after world war two and to see the europeans as as he has sort of surprised because they don't quite understand like with you built this house and now you want to set it on fire i am surprised that a trump could rise i mean that is that within countries where as how quickly the republican party
just completely got behind him it reminds me of the neanderthals you know know
no really
i love agent the archaeology and that kind of stuff so you have the humans and neanderthals were sharing the planet
from about one hundred thousand b c two about forty thousand and then suddenly no more neanderthals well i think because humans
they figured out the blogger so they could kill from ten feet away i'm getting this from the movie quest for fire
but i think
so it's like there's neanderthals and then suddenly gone and that's kind of what happened to the republicans i feel they were just there and then they suddenly decide what happened is and this is get one linda was asking what happened to my party i think the trump recognize and the primaries you see this that the the base of the republican party was in a completely
different place than the elites in washington thought the elites in washington who was still repeat reciting the reagan formula free trade you know expansionist foreign policy entitlement reform the base of the party is now a white working class based that wants to hear about mexicans muslims and chinese people they want to hear about how the but the mexicans are dead
new jobs the chinese people as in your factories that muslims are killing you trumps says beat them all up you'll be great again without help
one
i mean the fact is they were like sixteen republicans running in the primaries
and didn't he did not get a majority of republican support during the primaries he got a plurality anyone anyone in a lot of places but the fact that it was so divided the fact that the party had no discipline whatsoever i mean i like to bring back the smoke filled rooms let's have a vetting at peace
right or they decide to run for president for good and they said it you know
should trump did as a political matter whether you would it reality or not he he had sixteen opponents many of them governance and a little to slaughtered the my one by one without really any and of to helping and now and now i think the world and the bills making is today with the never from
trump is diminished dwindled almost nothing but you've got this incredibly high historically i said before historic level of support among republicans and no one even though you can at least the beginning of the administration you want to people like paul ryan and mitch mcconnell as well the go along with trump to get their agenda done well they got their tax cut and now today there still and then
yeah i imagine this earth day
i know right
there are more he's always get another here
they will spend time writing these questions
this is for you hear michael you said you can you said you can be a minority and a conservative but can you be a minority and a republican under this administration
you know that's a good question i think that the expectation at least from what i get from talking to other african americans and minorities in general as sure we don't have a problem with you been a republican bill our expectation is that you are articulating the concerns of our community so yes i'm a i'm a black person who happens to be republican that doesn't mean i don't
care about police brutality and as a man i don't care about criminal justice reform those are issues are disproportionately impact my community and it is my duty if you will when i'm at that table when i'm in those meetings to advocate for the issues of my community because i recognize there will be moments like the moment we see now where you have a jeff sessions running the crew
the justice system and he rolling back a lot of things that president obama did with bipartisan support that benefited african american so it is my char and say wait a minute here you're not going to pass policy legislation is going to continue to disproportionately impact not only black people but brown people so i think you can most certainly be a conservative at a man
already but being a republican right now and age a trump i think is a very difficult thing when i go you know right
sure michael have to be one of my favorite republicans because what we've seen as a of you
pretty short list
some of your best friends or republican you know the islands economic lines but the thing is is that if you have black people who understand it even in that
with administration that what trip is known as undercutting the value of the only black people but republicans as we've been saying and the fact that you at william coleman the fact that you had a legacy of black people jackie robinson for that matter who were republicans who understood that it was about an economic orientation of fiscal conservatism it was not about
the culture wars that trumps seems invested in because one of the fact is we missed and all of this is the demonization of the big black bogey man barack obama and that spooked a lot of people into voting for the republicans a as one
i disassociate myself as a black conservative were what we call lily white conservatism that sort of walls in racism if you will bigotry sexism if you will and i think you have to make it clear distinction between the two and where the republican party
go do you do this
i can understand how you could do it when the republican party was a party that was about economics and free markets and for you right now the republican party is defined by its suspicion and hostility toward people who look different sound different worship different gods so what do you and that's the party how are you distinguish what will it for reading
president from talks a lot about patriotism to the country when we say the pledge allegiance to the flag we say one nation under god indivisible celtics as one nation under god indivisible one nation rhetoric or reality do he truly believe we are one nation and if we are than that means we recognize that we accept that we are country compounded of different folks from all over the world where girl
what they look like they're sex or their religion well that's not how out of your fellow republican
okay thank god or time certainly doesn't family you had to do look at you know hurricane maria and and look what happened in puerto rico always allowed has limited know area invitation to the sea pack and mention not it an anchor

welcome to l h b a pipe pass from h b o maintenance real time


right






i actually know why it
real that because finally somebody
but you're not going to say it always treat those countries actually in jail

the judge said they should lock blog
even worse knows kim kardashian is not taking his calls so
going to get apart
trump said about men
the kid that they do with a exactly you're partially brought him in you gave him the title campaign share with you that just something we told him
it's like roommate told elvis and a black belt and wasn't really
so much happened this legal stuff happens week find me after eighteen months of working on this the the justice department's inspector general released his report on the f b eyes actions and the two thousand and sixteen election trump said he wanted to
read the whole thing before commenting i'm joking of course

five hundred pages he gets bored halfway through a fortune cookie
the upshot of it is that the f b i help traub as we all knew and trump made such a big deal out of hillary's emails that komi didn't want anyone to think that the f b i was helping hillary and was on her side
so they read fucked her campaign
it's like when the raf needs to show that he's fair he shoots the home down quarterback in the mouth

and michael cohen the junior their trunk
her lawyer would agree on a problem
lap dog he's they're saying i don't know this sure they're saying he's ready to cooperate with prosecutors i hope that makes trump nervous i mean michael cohen has given more money to porn stars than charlie sheen
but
and
go and took out a restraining order on michael out an eddie
right you to stop appearing on television
the blade i love this community is creating a circus with his quest and question unquestionable
thirst for publicity
michael
you work for donald trump
but and also listen to this new york's attorney general has filed the lawsuit trying to shut down trumps families phony cherry
they say
assistant illegal can do is basically a slush fund which they used as an arm of the campaign they were funneling money to some of the least deserving charities in the world doctors without borders though
that's not a real charity
st bart's children
so with all these scandals you know who's poll numbers are thinking like a rock that not donald trump's his are up people who are sinking or anyone in the republican party who crosses donald trump member mark sanford from south carolina the guy
hiking the appalachian trail
is really having an affair with an argentinian woman he was like my appalachian trail
what you know he vote to a trump seventy three percent of the time and said a few critical thing out he didn't win his truck primary because he had he survived he was reelected after having sex with the argentinian woman
but trump banks porn star is right here in the us ladies and gentlemen
one reason trumps numbers are up of course he has a new friend

i know it seems like years ago it was only the beginning of this week they had their big submit trump cannot stop talking about what a great guy
negotiated
we found that out
he's got a great personality
he says
a funny guy he said is a funny is a funny guy is a funny i know he does this one bit
where he will throw three generations of your family in jail
listening to radio that's not on the government stage
great stuff
sex ready to do his bit about how many north korea as it take to grow in a light bulb none we have no electricity
funny

donald trump is over there and tried to give it to whatever they were dry to do
come into the modern world so he shows him i couldn't make this up a fake movie trailer that trump put together and looks like can put it to get did you say this show a few seconds it as you have to see it the believe it
a new world can begin to gain one of french respect good will be part of that
it looks like something scientology
could make if they were emerging with amway
drug comes out but he's got great beaches
hotels yes because so many people in that country of money to burn so they get a condo on the beach of course know resort hotels in north korea are a little different
cool down in a room service they ask if you have any food
so
and across all the credit you're saying in their right to and nothing really came of this it was to people who lie about everything who signed a deal that was specific about nothing
i would say it was a feckless stunt

while he was in singapore the president past a milestone he turned seventy two years old
that
trump people are welcome
insane but welcome
but
that they throw him a big party in the hotel suite and then the hookers pete happy birthday on the

like a canary funny really
but first step
man this guy i've been rooting for my whole life of all the pundits i have read on the conservative side this guy's the sharpest minds of all i want them to get in here for the longest time i'm sure he has a pulitzer prize or to george will lead

yeah
may i borrow it
but i wasn't kidding i want to do here more than anybody else for twenty years or a lesson good be persistent
five years but back in the days when we used to the clip things that of newspapers and magazines
they still do
i clipped you more than anybody you always kept my liberalism honest so an oxymoron but go ahead

so he said you're a great words meant i thought we'd start with some words i heard this week that i hadn't heard before
sen bob quarter so the republican party is now a cult
it's not a cold cult implies misguided if sincere worship
this is fear
not worship folder invertebrate they're frightened
but it seems to be a cult of
donald trump now has an eighty seven percent approval rating and the republican party that's higher than any republican except george bush right after nine eleven higher than reagan at this point
higher than eisenhower bush the first yeah donald trump that guy that seems like a cult of personality
well as told of personality among his supporters and the supporters are nothing if not vengeful differ from him and for that reason
vast majority of people in congress or in congress to be in congress that as they want to stay there
and therefore absent term limits this is the careerist motivation they have and he's the biggest threat there is to that so how much responsibility do you think the republican party barriers for producing donald trump you can't really picture him as a democrat even though before this run that he made he really wasn't he didn't have any fix party
he belong to democrats republicans wanted to be an independent for a while
yes but let me do the democrats are wanting in the spring of two those followed summers twenty fifteen you had eighteen republican candidates on stage and the most lurid stood out in the summer of twenty nine teen there will be eighteen democrats onstage and maybe the most lurid will stand out there
the idea that only the republican party or only the right can produce something like donald trump is naive and cheerful really name somebody on the left to is in any way comparable to donald trump who was lurid on the left i can't name the mouth but just been lowered will arise in the next year they might and and they might become
it as they compete to stand out in this crowd on the stage but how would they stand out in the way donald trump then he stood out by being more xena phobic more racist
more horrible than any way more vulgar more personally vulgar
and that wouldn't appeal to the democratic base i don't
don't understand the democratic base but how
analyze the democratic race pretty well all i'm saying is that there's a dynamic in the nominating process produces an opportunity for free beauty in people like the buccaneer currently on the white house you know and buccaneer nother great word okay so let me throw some other words i was saying in two thousand and sixteen before he was elect
it was a slow moving cool
i don't know if you think that word is applicable
appeasement is a word that republicans used to throw a democrats anytime they even talk because i'm going overseas
i think trump is done a lot of that i don't feel like he's often acting in the interests of the united states of america purposefully if the red cross interest with his personal interest to me that's treason or any of these words applicable or do you think they're all too strong i wouldn't use the word trees and the trojans a crime and i think we have to resist the
impulse to criminalize political differences even when they are shoddy differences and foolish differences such as he as about his new best friend and north korea
i don't think it helps to to ratchet up any more than we already have for the volume of our rhetoric about this
what if it's true i mean everything he does i can think of any policy of that doesn't help blood and are potent
well also feels helps lot of let's think about
the subject of slow motion cool
clearly the modern presidency now occupied by this man has swollen beyond reason and escaped the limits implied in the constitution
by have to say that the progressive than this country brought that about it was woodrow wilson
the first progressive president and the first president to criticize the american found in which he did my peripherally but about the essence of the constitution he objected to the separation of powers
because it inhibited the discretion of presidents to act without the fetters of congress what's a day we've got and uninhibited president and i don't think progressives are happy with what they help to bring about
well i can agree with that but as always you spigot eloquently
so are you optimistic because i didn't other greatest or in here recently john major but we were arguing about that he's much more optimistic about where we're going i am not i think that we have crossed the rubicon on this i i'm not the historian you are but i do remember what the rubicon was
caesar came with the army's from ball and they said if you cross the river with that army we cease to be a republic any more and we will be a dictatorship i feel read a caesar rubicon moment there's much to be said for pessimism because pessimist
pessimists and write a good bit of the time and they're delighted when the wrong which is why i subscribe to the ohio and and eight thousand ninety five theory of history snow name by me for a little known fact that in ohio and eighteen ninety five there were two automobiles and they collided
things go wrong on the other hand this is not a flimsy country it was made by flimsy people and the flint a real us about human nature and the temptations of power who wants to philadelphia in the summer of seventeen eighty seven
and devised a government full of blocking mechanisms three branches of government two branches of the legislative branch with different electro constituencies and electoral rhythms
super majority his veto veto override judicial review all kinds of ways to slow it down and make it difficult for an overbearing executive or congress or judiciary to have its way but it's not working it really yeah so are its own
take me through and how donald trump was going to see his demise because i see what happens is muller
what is report trumps says it's fake news like you did a b i g report today is based believes him he doesn't get impeached we can't do that because you need or majority in the senate that's not going to happen
if muller in dates and subpoenas him he says go fish doesn't show up what happens and i don't think he would even leave if the last election in two thousand and twenty because he would call it
set this up in two thousand and sixteen it's rigged because he thought he was going to lose we've already seen the polling his base thinks it's perfectly ok to cancel an election it's it's rigged and politicized i think he leaves when he wants to leave i think he lose when the american people to tell him
leave or when it doesn't strike me as a kind of man it does a painful duty of public spirit so that he was not having fun which even going as having fun that's the worst thing that happened to us is that at first he didn't like this job member of the white house was a dog now he likes it was not going until he wants to go had a really depressing
oh would you george well there is a very serious argument mr keller breezy a professor at northwestern university makes it among others that the appointment of robert muller was unconstitutional is not mahler showed the fact is under the appointments clause the us constitution as
developed by supreme court case law a principal officer of the government and by the power he is wielding them the people the a subordinate to muller qualifies as a principal officer all principal officers according to the supreme court must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate which he has not done there for
it is possible that a year or so from now
a case comes to the supreme for brought by manifold or someone else that says news of the supreme court's words in cases like this all the subpoenas the indictments and the convictions and the sentences brought about by this man are a fruit of the poisonous tree
i've been trying to sell on fox news for over a year now this is news
supreme court decisions going back forty years about the appointments okay let me ask you one last thing though always bugged me because again i do admire you so much in your your ability i don't know why you're not more with us on climate i'm accused of not believe in climate change and now they're not doing
it would be impossible to state with greater precision the opposite of my belief which is this the one thing we can all agree on is that the climate is changing because it always is changing it was changing when the medieval warming period came about it was changing when that was followed by what's called the little ice age none of that happened because of the
internal combustion engine or the carbon based economy that we now have what makes climate science so interesting so complicated and so inherently unsettled is that there are so many variables of which human activity as one solar activity as another all i'm saying is that before
we'd make enormous exclusions from our freedom
and trillions of dollars in investments or and wealth created we ought to be more certain the well being created is in renewable energies the wealth being created always is by the technology that is coming we've seen that many times on this country so i think that's a specious argument that we are giving up something by becoming more green and it doesn't
you that scientists i mean i know you're a brilliant guy bigger not exactly a scientist but scientists climate scientist and overwhelming numbers usually the number you see is ninety seven percent it doesn't get much more subtle than that
it doesn't persuade you that they all have come to the same conclusion that we're and yes climate always changes but this is also different both things can be true there's nothing counter intuitive about the proposition that human activity when there are seven or eight billion of us now is effect in the climate but the proposition that goes beyond that
as we know the trajectory of this i think mrs understands the extreme lot of bad if iran
right we're gonna find out yeah not a climate than not
i'm not a climate denial climate defeatist and the sense that we're going to proceed pretty much as we have been for another fifty years at which time a lot of the predictions that have been made hostages given to fortune and are going to be i think shot by fortune as fortune has a way of doing alright up try to work and into in years to come thank you so
much
yeah

as a daily basis turnaround however of isis inside the army of tara michael weiss is back
say and contributor host of firing line or margaret over from june twenty third on p b s margaret over
now
ricardo you are and heard from right here in california are congresswoman karen bass great

okay so george well we're just talking about maybe getting trump out of their probably not i think more they are he was too i'm i'm stopping the malo report this an inspector general report came out today you know it sounds like a boring
but when you when trump lies about it it's really not can i read some of the things he said about it because it came to that conclusion the exact opposites that he said i think it's most instructed to hear donald trump talk and then
now that we live in opposite world
it totally exonerated read there was no collusion or obstruction it does not exonerate him because it was a now
jones they were bloody against my electorate know it joe's the exact opposite exactly there was totally biased know it reaches the conclusion that there was no bias that they made mistakes but there was no bias he also says call me was the ringleader of this whole den of thieves now they're thieves
you look what happened they were plotting against by election and it just shows he can just say anything exactly in the post truth world it doesn't matter any lower
called i don't care that george degrees that's a cult when you get into it and they drink the kool aid
let's you
five hundred page report yeah basically seven words seven words is what easy road in i'm i'm on the judiciary committee and i know when i get back next week we're going to subpoena the guy that said the seven words in two thousand and sixteen
and he was on the investigation for three months and mother got rid of him so what is the really none yeah and by the way i mean this guy who said this is on record saying if i wanted to scuttle donald trump's nomination i would have released or leaked information that he was being investigated for colluding with russia that would have turned the tide particularly and of the the can
pain but yet you see here in black and white this report is quite damning about the guy's behavior not just carry but the other officers and attorneys and agents but it states in black and white we found no documentary or testimonial evidence directly connecting the political views these employees expressed in their text messages and instant messages so the specific media investigated decisions we reviewed
in chapter five in other words okay they did have bias they did have a political tendency they're human beings they have thoughts right and f b i agent who was investigating a serial killer or a rapist or money longer going out to the bar talking to his colleague that what we're going to get that son of a bitch that's human interaction their big mistake was they express their opinions on f b i issued device
the irony of irony being this investigation was about the conflict in public and private correspondence and i think we should demand that are justice department and are just as officials not pretend we wish it did a higher level of integrity and that they not get money in a political waters and and i just i think the contrast between call me and now
crowd is with the mahler investigation right is that he seen nothing of our and i think nothing of his people he has hermetically sealed and because they idea is it is all about following a law and it is not about trying to anticipate win no action and how if i do this and be seen from my reputation and forget about it
not about politics and out just say one thing about your point about opinions there was one place where it went what i think past of opinion and unfortunately that's the text they got showed this thanks this is between two f b i agents peter struck and the and the woman that he was having an affair with trumps on ever going to become president right right and he right
bag no no will will stop it okay so nobody reads the five hundred page right on our side never catches a break that they got this one thing that is a smoking gun type thing though is whether this is not just an opinion when it's the guy in the investigation know he wasn't doing that he was just trying to impress the girl

saying oh my god is having fresh new say no i'm captain save a whole
late at night
stop it
big bad daddy who's the guy who is good as dr
was to make the sex

and the door they need to they're already calling for the mother invasion to be shut down because of that kept us department official said mean and media i mean you just don't do it just don't call their don't go to politics yes i am that the letter of a lot during that time when i was worried about you remember when giuliani went on a show on sunday and he said the october surprise was coming
and the concerned then was the f b i agents in new york who was apparently mad but i know we're sure they is from plenty of exec don't let me ask about the primary elections on tuesday we did the right
the narratives alps
what hundreds of as eagerly anticipating resulted as high res kind of november
as a patient here in away
don't worry that the narrative seems to hold that the democrats give fielding more and more stronger women gathered and the republic

the republicans are more and more of a cult
the big take away is that if you cross donald trump you're out exactly that's what happened the mark sanford
the woman who beat sanford said this is the trump party now this is no longer people saying the republican party the party of small government the party of freedom all that stuff i heard from people like you and i doing normal republican it's public and classic
also i think it said recently endorsed her on twitter you see this is the thing and people the media have a hard time getting around how is this guy so insane and comical with using social media to express opinions that he has other ample avenues to express including the white house press corps
he does it because it does resonate and he has created i do agree there was a personality cult that i use that term very conservatively because i don't like moral equivalence between the united states and totalitarian regimes will get to that we talking about north korea but around himself here it's not even your with me or against me you're with me or your professionally killed
you're out of a job and that's frightening but there was another space for dissent but it presents an opportunity for that because you i think when when they elect candidates that and so far too extreme and we know what happened was really more in alabama number one i believe that republicans that are real republicans then it suppresses platoon
actually suppresses their vote and then for democrats it should be energized i didn't in alabama has an example the pedophile lost by one point five of and that they hadn't already had air and he when the black vote was inner shore and that was why he went to what's happening is a and bella airplane tail and is is just sort of acknowledging that the parties
trying to find and in those deep red districts and the districts that are like that sanford seat was gonna be a republican district no matter what tend to be overpowered was going to win eight but in those kinds of feet the trump republican wins now and said that fact the for vacation the republican party certainly for now what we don't always if that is like the obama coalition that didn't
continue after obama we don't know what the having price and i'll look like post trapped period i only post out and think faster when you that that there is no i was driving
just can't shake shack continue and that mold or other people who i met him from hundred last
maybe the
a party back because it clearly has no gladly gladly right
i rarely to
the way can make america
when we can hopefully america to a guys not allowing bill
going to go near there

i'm not saying i want to give a shout to canada
okay
i loved can we all love canada
i just want the people of their to know because women on and can and for a while though
it's not us you know that it's just

and the contrast between him and justin trudeau couldn't not be greater and i took this is the perfect time to do an update for something i enjoyed for my entire childhood goof recent gallant he remember to said gallon
go and gallon those cartoons they used to have goals as i can't read that but
boy looks like the yard
gallant that good as the jedi
dashing polite justin trudeau such a great contrast to the old fat stupid
were updated go visit the island
justin and
for example
justin weights politely for women to get on an elevator first donald grabs their opposing

justin researchers an issue and consults whereas before reaching a decision
donald violence brain fog and leaves his staff to clean up the mess

justin speaks the king's english donald speaks queens bay

justin remains devoted to his wife when we met in high school donald remains is devoted to kim jong who he met

just separates paper and glass donald separates parents and children

justin took an oath to protect his nation dunno doesn't wear protection

just an age where the fork and knife while fine china donald age bands that have a buck
justin tells us that you have a problem that they know donald tells else that leave me alone i'm pope to eating
just didn't know the importance of balancing work and family donald is pretty sure the name of one of his daughter starts with it
doesn't look sexy with his air blowing in the breeze looks like mr clean stable the dead

just as a passion a box donald's wife arrived in a bog
yeah
the campaign glamour terms
really

yeah very funny and i think it's great that you're turning your talents know something a little more serious you want people to vote we can't get enough people out there getting people to go to blame up the midterms to twenty years ago they call that rock the boat
yeah anyone to a but it's still around actually a really amazing work here but i started this campaign with my friends that funny or die which is the production companies by will ferrell and adam mckay who have been producing early on the street for many
i was just making out with george will back stay
israel
so
it took me twenty five years to get me and also hundred minutes together

what if i come back so i'm talking about voting yeah so i started this campaign with funny or die called glaring up the midterms which is are fun way of trying to make the midterms which sounds like it sure sounds like home or to a lot of young people sound fun and exciting
and sexy millenniums you know any ails the millennium i am not
are you really are a little person i'm a little behind on a thirty nine but and i have as i as i have a lot of young fans you know really on the street has a cleansing him that following a lot and a big falling online and so i thought you know i'm always tweedy angry things every day
and as many of us are and there's a reason to do that
is productive but i wanted to do something
yeah
annoying that felt productive and that right a tangible result and so we're doing this campaign to get young people to though i saw a statistic which said in the last mid term in two thousand and fourteen only depending on which report you read only twelve to twenty percent of millenniums who could vote did vote and that's a staggeringly low number and so
where did you ever her generation of figure mean
a break even aware that they're very self entitled but they just can't
yeah i did ask my twitter following after the california primary where the numbers are up the numbers in california were up on june fifth that's a good start especially in ca forty nine or we is crazy jungle primary but when i asked my following why the ones who didn't vote in california didn't vote if they could i got a lot of
frustrating but honest responses and me it means that people are still really fucking lazy right
authentic lately the midst of all ever like and you're putting on shows like you've done this before and like you have to be registered to get in the show it's basically a bribe exactly is it wrong to bribe people to vote why don't we just pay no well we can pay them and so we're going to put on a show
do you make the guys
they get the barn but
that we're doing are actually if they're very locally curated will ferrell and i did a show and district forty nine in oceanside here where we'll played ron burgundy who has a very direct connect san diego for i'm not as we were in only entertaining the people that came who registered to vote but we also brought up young local leaders community
leaders kids working on dhaka analogy b t equality and march for our lives in bad district to come on stage with will and i and talk about the work they're doing and it was it was very inspiring so

ask what would motivate people to vote because i keep hearing this is very important to you tube diggers you're running keep hearing that the democrats have to do more than just be anti drum
okay but wait i even here very often don't even mention impeachment because that just makes the other side crazy they're crazy already
the latest poll embassy news wall street journal poor people are coming around to the idea the donald trump is a dangerous criminal the needs to be checked by forty eight to twenty three voters indicate the likely to support a candidate who promises to provide a check on donald trump i do think it is about donald trump
i don't think people are hearing about the other issues yes i do think you should run on repealing the tax cut and restoring your health care
to get a message like that
you have to get the message out door to door and then youth do it in an entirely different way and so we're doing this project sea change where we're taking democrats from los angeles going into red districts and we just kicked off a youth program with millenniums this week they are coming together and they're going to come up with their own plan on how to reach those
voters were giving them the boat or file they're going to figure out is a twitter is a tax what is it but will have them will come to your show your millennial should meet my millennium
kind of growth fair amount of and now and enough fat fucking you're saying these primaries now it's it's younger voters right the my nails are motivated women that are is angeline already batteries and for that like tramp is on the ballot and that's been energizing factor that's mobilizing and that's that's not bad for him
mean that any yeah it's that's not a good formula from kinds i mean you know that he's using a games just kind of trance on a that bad it doesn't mean republicans are as in bangor is it a good thing that on tuesday we saw that the republicans are primary there are more moderate candidates for these crazy
the curry stewart guy was in virginia now i guess the answer is it's good if we win will implement it is we don't dry it that and we've got a nazi adjacent guy the if it's a swing district gets good at it it's not then they're going so i'm corey stewart in virginia now
as these running against him kane hello like he's raining it's a very it's a blue state that went for didn't vote for hillary clinton and to gain and he's running and against a guy who's holes
i do had to deliver you got ever had
good
first he was he would never even wrong
just for publicity what the parties or any money with what you just said that there was this sort of coalescing faction of people who want to vote against him and see him thrown from office
counter to the idea that in fact he has trump or five the entire republican party and if you oppose in your out right here is really scare excuse me one second in view your shot but curry stewart this guy i'm talking about the third you who confederate not nazi adjacent logos that
he says when they start chanting lock her up because hillary so dangerous as president
he also said tim came to so now we're calling what it tim can do to get locked up
where the place again where it's so scary where their politicians running in regular primaries in elections who were calling for their opponent to be locked up here's what donald trump said today about komi me i loved the way he listen to the way he goes from the as should james caan be locked up
i'd never want to get involved in that that's the first thing is a second sentence
just seemed to me like they were criminal lacks oh third sentence what he did was criminal
i think i will never wanted to get involved too it seems like criminal acts what he did was criminal
and then what do you did this horrible bed in terms of constitution terrible thing to our people locked up let somebody else make them
memorizing lock exactly what we're not normal i have a natural were not annoying right here that we are calling and saying what it is and a lot of people are down after going to probably had a heyday in november which asia they deserve tail and he looks so upset about
yes after the country but this isn't this isn't bad well not be the country we're all just as a but as i are
what you're saying is right bell like this is isn't new lab and we can't allow us to ourselves to normalize and it does take us are saying that this is unacceptable don't also

don't underestimate the ability of these guys to reactivate seemingly settled questions of the culture war this is a guy who also at removing confederate symbols and statues was tantamount to what isis was doing in iraq powdering babylonian in summary and artifacts in other words the union is like isis or anybody who opposes
every and what it represented is similar to the islamic state is creepy scary to think with the child
i had this debate already did right we have to start debating to raise a culture war or not there is a fucking culture
i'm dealing with someone like tramp who is ripping in fades from their parents from their mothers
is a battle of good versus evil and i don't think it's over simplifying it
yeah
they ask a request okay a lot of times in the past when republicans didn't like a kinda like many who didn't like donald trump they said okay but when i go into the voting booth on casting a vote for ronald reagan or i'm writing and betsy ross er mitt romney said he's writing in his wife's name isn't it past time to
do that don't you have to vote for the democrat

i'm going about are you laugh and say analysts and all are planning and your not dumpsters you can't do that bullshit anymore you have to actually vote for the demo
principles well you have to mail your principles if your principal i here if there's a trend person in your just strap there's only two he can't play then you have enough of a democrat and our thank you colonel times

and finally no role someone asked to explain to america's police that the purpose of the body cam isn't so you can upload your beatings on do you do

when did punching someone in the head become a law enforcement technique
the cops need to make up their minds they do a river dance on your skull and then when they're putting you in the car they say what your head


we need to stop saying most cops are good like we know that to be true i hope it's true but i need some evidence unlike cops
the bad ones not the good ones problem is again we don't really know what that percentage is that's the question i'm asking tonight if most cops are good why are there's so many videos of them being bad

just in the last month we've seen just a few bad ones bidding this suntan lotion office skinny girl in a bikini completely a typical officers mercilessly wailing on a homeless guy in oregon and totally not represented and policemen beating a black man in arizona that's a lot of videos of
guys who barely exists doing shit that hardly ever happens not to mention the milwaukee bucks sterling brown getting taste for a crime white people can't even imagine existing while black
this is why nfl players want to taken me not because they hate the end



when the cops defense the woman in new jersey did have an open container of alcohol
the homeless man was making loud noises
and the man by the elevator look like he was quoted preparing for a physical altercation which apparently means he was standing up
being a speeding ticket in a parked car big your flame decals look fast


seems to me we need a me to movement for the police
if garrison keeler had to go away for putting his hand on a woman's back perhaps we should decide what had happened when two men or women down in the sand and punch her in the face because i'm sensing a power imbalance here
there's obviously a lot of rage that police work brings out in a person and i don't doubt for a moment that it's justified and that we need to do more to help officers find better ways to channel it but we also have to call men who were on the defenseless while their buddies hold him down what they are cow
cowards


eighty four percent of cop say they directly witnessed a fellow officer using excessive force and sixty one percent so they don't always report serious abuse
this thin blue line stuff has got to go away it can't be the
it can't be the duty of every american to say something if they see something except the people whose job it is to do something

when when cops ask minorities why they don't snitch on their own minorities have every right to say you first

and stop to stop defending the indefensible they're always reviewing these videos as if they're ghost hunters looking for signs of a poltergeist
the only thing you need to review is you're hiring practices
we need better psychological screening to weed out the people who become cops as payback for a high school
because
that's always the real crime is an attitude not being instantly deferential we need to ask the question of the wrong type of people becoming cops it's a fair question
the police to drag bullies like the priesthood attracts pedophiles

like carnivals attract mathematics
look i know there are good cops i know some personally i used to buy drugs off one great
i do know some cops i do know some who do their jobs like total paroles
and it's true there are no viral videos of an office or putting his life on the line every day for years so i get
i get why cops are so often ready to explode america is a nation that current statistics show is twenty three point six percent scumbag
and
two cops deal with everyday thieves pimps road rage or his gang bangers people are lock their kids in cars perverts jerking off and bookstores
shiloh above
but if you expect nice don't be a cop the amount d
police work it's like practice g ass holes come with the job
it doesn't give you the right to abuse people remember you're a cop not a flight attendant

welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him

what are the democrats being doing
during to attract is affected republicans were fleeing the
catching them in
i my view of this is that you're right
like country is facing an existential threat right now we have to make alliances wherever and so i think we should welcome them i think we have to recognize that accountability is link in a car drove voter
yeah yeah i gotta do
we share this country we gotta start talking making inroads we can just

that democracy is at stake and then them okay
let's see black knight code
is there anything that could happen that would make you say okay we need stricter chromosomes go was
so interesting because it's it's amazing you know everything always goes to in each stricter gun laws in response everything with respect to firearms
i think don't need to be a more holistic look and approach to it because if we took into account the way things were before
morgan laws now than we did before which supposedly was they're doing because we didn't get rid of the assault weapons ban our state there are states that have actually deregulated than lies every the last ten fifteen years
twenty to thirty years ago
plus
or you know i'd say in the nineteen nineties when we had an assault weapons and and that was actually was ended and that was a and in the southeast past adventure of things to and restrictions on get like stand your ground like stand your ground
newton era to to why we're over the world for one reason to statistics on black people spending their ground against white people versus the reverse does not come on world for blog
yeah
also actually i should forfeit no no no no now that rubs it that specific last stand your ground in early because i'm scared i get to shoot you
interpret stand your ground and that's really i would stand that police and first away and then when it's a white person shooting a black person that is forgiven a lot more than the reverse
it that is the case in predicated on routes and brings a disproportionate effect of stay underground railroad been of it to criminal justice issues burner and been there something needs to be done about the but the idea that if somebody who's written in my life i shouldn't have to be forced to retreat to
wall before i decide to defend my life if it written you know yeah i mean that that's just always been a lie i mean people have and standard ran as change so you are inherently against the idea that concept of stand your ground you're just a the way it's been a plot now i think stand your ground is is is basically makes it so that it's easier to kill somebody and i have
to that
we had a role it is one of your life has to be normal world before stand around was that your life had to be rent and would stand around it's like any pain that you perceive as a threat to or
radical that's a slippery slope again that then that's predicated on the objective standard wrote would be the standard is inherently our objective and a self defense will because my understanding of those stand your ground from an objective standard is i have to be i'm not forced to have my back against a wall if my life is threatened to defend him alive
right so i don't think that foreign minister
where i'm standing my ground here
michael pollan do you see a future where the government sponsors care for mental health what would it take to get there
well we have a real mental health crisis in this country one of the reasons people are interested in psychedelic that it is area
with the gun graces i mean that yes we often and debate with the guns years and and well you have the suicide rate is up twenty percent in the last few years in gresham is up eighteen percent since two thousand and five addiction is rampant and and mental health care in this country has very few tools is really broken if you compare mental
health care to any other branch of medicine oncology cardiology infectious disease they've all accomplished important things they reduce suffering the prolong life span you can't say that mental health that's a true come under one hundred years ago the kennedys will about minimizing their dog because that's what they did have one hundred years ago i mean it
as a long time ago at one hundred
i think he means every the last i mean last few decades
have they come up with things that they're depressed and sellers on i remember even something like mike wallace talking about they didn't have ended depressants when he was never the less than that to meant to have no kids today than there were a few days definitely that a boy and honestly they just poor something in the test tube and make it better right
well it's not that easy but they didn't have that option and all know fifty years but the anti depressants we have actually many people don't like taking them though their effectiveness fades over time they're very hard to get off so the and then or suicide and they call suicide yes yet if there's a suicide blamed on lsd that's a huge story ray that is
routine
say that our problems are not a constant i'm not a holiday when i say this but i think that technology has completely up ended mental health in this country and we're going to we all love over we want to order a car i'm going to go to open table and and get a dinner reservation but so many of our kids are now shut ins
devoid of personal interaction and instead creating identities to just go
really disconnection beds at the root of depression and and big up in obsession always own damned phone's well
it actually well that's another expect as another for terrible addiction
okay metal pictures on picture to do than any least a suicide rates have increased an older man rural communities
i mean that it's not universal this is the kind of problem and a majority of gun deaths in the us or suicide in the ass and the research is much clearer on gun control and gun gun ownership rates and suicide than with homicide and you know that the crime rate effects are unclear the suicide rate effects are very clear if there are fewer guns out there people attempt suicide as much and but they don't succeed is often because it's
absolutely not sure that's yes i know that i was actually going to change anything or shut it down if there was a direct correlation between the a number of guns that were available and suicides we would be leading the world into was there are also called the area
also named business and are increasing and the you added you to fewer fewer suicides among black and hispanic people than among white and asian people independent of gun ownership so we have demographic advantages we should have an even bigger advantage over other advanced countries and suicide rates than we do and also we do a most guns but
they're in the hands of fewer people in other words the people who like guns have been any guns there was a guy less we go with five hundred and fifty three gun
that picture of this guy's arsenal oh my god this is what they found in this guy's house
is that many guns
here's a dead
tommy guns
let's be honest i think the discussion but we have to understand something right so i get it right you're not a good person
i'm actually worried about a person like that basically killing a lot of having the ability to easily lot he only has to an announcement
like any aliens finance well are what inspired by one person children are being slaughtered let her die in jail you're attributing iron in your inherently attributing a negative character to firearms out right right yes there's lots in some guy at their at and fire until x lag
but you're not advocating banning callers of limiting people's access to to vehicle you can't take what i mean the number of people are murdered by guns as much higher than the people murdered by arts

letting ever been could blow intentionally yeah but intentional murder is still horrible though for someone to die in a car accident somebody didn't we really can say why this is why we're never no disrespect to either of you were never going to get anywhere on this issue the best we can hope for is a better integration of data because i'm sick and tired
reading a newspaper the following day well there was this warning sign and this agency knew this and this new this where i left him the right hand
i know that at all
also been the last one i want to mate with respect to the using the number of guns up there and you feeling some type of way is i look at guns differently been you
and there was a point in time where i looked at it
there was a time tomorrow with that it probably the same way you did right i had about as an organic progression of firearm ownership as one can have i was against gun and go but i went to the right one time when i shot a gun and that change for me
now i can see i can see a myriad of reasons for why someone would own a firearm whether be recreation sports collecting so forth and so i also want to see that those number of guns of their on my mind doesn't automatically go to oh my god that's horrible and that's bad i totally hear what you're saying i guess one of the same team as you're trying to say that for grasslands live rounds whatever he wants
the ban guns now when saying ban your gang were saying regulate them same people with mental illness and background checks a variety of things about certain types of guns no one is saying you can't have again and i know the entering always wanted to say
for my safety and protection as children and other people you should we should have regulations like background checks every single guy now how would you enforce that
if i was gonna suggest that suggested solution at least have something that's enforceable rate isn't for us as well he had banker channel would you do them a getting do them for right know at that discussions and bells the energy find tell that to me the to me mansion bell support that bell would you support that got an to my question
and that's that
i will enforce what did i lose control
okay with more of this are gone at a rate who could could

route that are right
yeah i hear about your undergrad
i don't like of drug
it's like a truck a day
operator at i'll give you up and to cry about
one of the border this work what happened i was pretty good may want one i've never seen a bother when you create his own crisis as much
what he just turned out a the sight of families being separated yeah can you believe what that asshole donald trump with doing
just wage or donald trump find out about the other things drugs doing put an end of that but that was two days ago
now trumps banks which were totally in support of the tracking where the kids policy now they're against taking away the kids because the cult leader
change tears mind i would say these people are sheep sheep are useful
and there are still thousands of these kids in detention or except now we've changed the powerfully are certified free range

we had change we will not keep kids in human condition separate from their parents we will have human conditions where there all together
that's right america our transit camps or family style
but i think they just given the kids i pads then every parent in america when it just went have i pad will be fine
hold
trump trumpet announces that he wants to merge the department of labor with the department of education to make a new administration department of child labor
just follow good ideas
but we don't have an education left in america anyway the administration itself cannot spell you say the executive order about the separate few have children and parents misspelled separation
in the title
i remember when our laws were better thought out that a sign in the break room
for a score and seven years ago stop eating my yogurt species
but this is why you don't lead donald trump drop or he went to france and he saw a military parade
anyone in the military parade with kim jong on any wanted a goal i just don't like this
the other fantastic idea trip up this to create a sex branch of the military
it's a space for us
to guard are interested in space to protect us from the shit all planets
yes just like a trump administration needs more space cadet

trapped as a lot like captain kirk he gets off on growing aliens thank you
new anti semitism

welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him

back the
bradley word for it howard your whispering character josh lyman
yeah
josh
there were a jerk or less real character fair at the trump it
fair he wouldn't be the driver
stupid question number was released
ryan astrid barack obama be leading the left into the bridge or or is there a better option
there's a better option
but the question i would ask about that you know obama keep saying he's playing the long game
what what's he waiting for know
it's about i would i would hope that he would be dead
yeah i mean now would be the john and i think he will take obama better would be michelle
i think he may be the only choice by the way for two thousand and twenty idea
that's popular woman hating america
okay
which would be the best strategy for games into are you taking the high road are fighting dirty we already entered
like a more which of your movies would you most like to make a sequel to
interesting
well sadly there are still relevant so
i mean
i was gonna ask you about bowling for columbine
guns
now that fascism is coming to america
their side has all the guns
any second door
seventy eight seventy eight percent of americans do not own a gun right and they're all the liberals and there's right
that their seven million americans that own one hundred and sixty million guns they have stockpiled them this is the elephant in the room in terms of the discussion of what are we all do putting their bodies and the line what does that really mean we'll do it not violently but we people are afraid people were afraid people who voted for hillary were
afraid that she would win because of he told my second amendment people is going to be a regulator and get ready get your guns he was calling for an armed revolt if hillary won
ask yourself that question it gone the other way where where he won the popular vote and she won the electoral college
that civil war
they already know or and that's what everyone's afraid of and we don't we don't on the guns but there's more of us and i think the military aggression and they've got bigger guns and more guns and i will never comes to that but the thing the military know it's a huge question grow
that if he sees the commander in are you worried that that question and from a sitting senator you're talking about the war in yemen and i was trying to talk him into declaring it unconstitutional and getting us out of the damn war and he said everybody all the office for a few minutes and he shorter
presented to me
while
it was in terms of maybe the last massive loss in the midterms which i don't think is gonna happen now let's say it did and then impeachment proceedings proceeded with haste from both parties
and trump with call his legions and in the street with their guns in the military do it and frankly i couldn't answer it
can i mean is worrisome because him that we have to us i don't know although constitutes workers and because the military is in general conservative and also because he is their commander in chief here's an interesting point
two sociologists do of paper recently called the casually get lazy studied the world war one world war two greed and all the wars we have good dad granular data on they found there's always been an imbalance poor people more than rich people everybody knows that i'd rather as a brain but in the last seventeen years of war the gap has grown ass
ironically show they want to see if that had a political impact they went and did a very fun on pole with controlling factors for other answers and so forth
came to find out that most of the families who lost someone or had someone wounded badly voted for job
there is a political result of what we're doing right now which is learning poor people die overseas or get horribly wounded or come back with posttraumatic stress for all the rest of the republicans have always had this amazing ability to be in an abusive relationship with their voters the more they hurt them get the more the
yeah i had a to gay in the midwest
he said to me that trump groomed economically vulnerable americans like a pet harassed like while like would hamsters or yeah i was like wow
but there's have changed but
but at a fiery area
when i think
his vanity and search for love to fill the god sized hole in his soul which is not intelligence but it's as inevitable as water rushing down a hill right he will go for that love and
yeah that's the that's the bait and switch why there's economic anxiety oh wow blaming immigrants works
that turns it up and then you and i get a tax cut
that's that's
you know that the switch given the commonality of threats cameron asks made on social media by mass shooters should the government take a more active role in monitoring these sites
now prompts government i think
one thing that i feel more than max a cupboard as donald trump sal
but now i am
hey much about what happened in annapolis
the person who is fermenting violence the most is the president can overheat the crowd on journalists a holding hollering screaming mass of people he individually pick fat journalists for them to direct their ire he us the enemy of the people he says that we are unpatriotic that we do
not love our country and were surprised when someone picks i feel it on the street the way people drive angry and i feel like more than ever there over the line
like the line in the middle of the road i'm always honking like get on your side of the wrong
i don't know maybe some that is texting but i never i don't remember that before i think i think bill worse than anger most people i think a lot of people in this audience are filled with despair
and delivers a bad week this was a week said it was like nineteen forty when france fell it was like seventy when the temple in jerusalem
know i mean that's how it felt there's another and put seventy thanks
it bothers me the supreme court you're out its history has always shown a difference to national security issues it rarely wage and on national security issues whether it's the patriot act unconstitutional wars
we're going to get a court probably going to be even more so that way and so more supportive of the national security state will become the warfare state we've become and that's very very dangerous that's where as in our we were all good
today had to remove a teacher that they are for sale and the t shirt said rope tree journalist
some assembly required
and and enough uproar about it and they are not selling anymore what were they doing selling it in the first place right can come china
really
but he has as generous
trump has perpetuated this year this level of calling for violence and that that's where this civility that's where the civility debate if we're going to get back to some place we gotta do it from let's not be threatening each other and when i say each other we're not doing it to them
it is unprecedented even presidents that who i totally disagree with they they did not actively want to separate us this guy wants to separate us one little piece of hope
my mother's been dead for a while but she was born in nineteen fifteen earliest memory everybody stein
from the flu she goes to college the depression happens it looks like this country doesn't work it looks like western civilization doesn't work she gets married has two kids

they lived through that then mccarthyism takes out you know poisons the country

reddit starting or celebrate earlier i pick where's your get out there and celebrate the driving and everything america years just that
yeah this was a tough week for liberals are kind of feel deprived
been the supreme court heard would up american academy is retiring for the new supreme court justice trumps says he a list of twenty five great
everyone on the list is against roe vs wade so if your work had planned parenthood may be a good time to update your linked in
but here's what happens now the president who got three million fewer votes the woman a beep nominate someone who then is approved or not or the salad
where a liberal california with forty million people
does the same number of votes as conservative nebraska with half a billion in our democracy
but whatever we're talking about this because let's be several of these say all that you heard what happened to sarah say understood that it is getting very on several up their steve miller who was the secretary of terror in turkey
he did or the other night and one of the other patrons in the restaurant scream and fascist miller was areas he pointed to his up doll jet apologize to my date
but yeah it all got to inflame bigger is maxine waters you know maxine waters one of our congresspeople from here in california she doubled down on this she said yes absolutely shame trump people have you seen trump people at restaurants at department stores at the gas station shame them
why a second to try people gas stations are restaurants and department store

they feel more hostility out there i do one third of that get this almost one third of americans think we are heading toward a second civil war
and i

welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him
right great okay amalgamated how would you suggest the us retaliate against russia to check or we ask that question they've shot
you'll get another one i see another one era and therefore you going to try not to repeat the graduate as the years
since trumps revolvers and stinky have any of your g o p contacts and congress become more inclined to believe well i may ask a different direction
i hear that the republican party is shrinking hear this all the time that because trumps numbers within the party are so high it's because the actual number of republicans are going to it always makes me want to ask you how many steve schmidt are out there how many people in the republican party
are used to be who are now switching i think it's a very significant number and i think at she college educated republican women in the swing district delivered the blue way for the democrats because
but but the future the national republican party looks exactly like to feature of the california g o p which for the first time in history of the two parties in any state the republican party in this state is now a third party smaller than the decline to state registrations when you look at the net
that that that millenniums feel towards the republican party you look at african americans brown people you located just demographically the country and you consider that when people in print out a political party generationally and eighteen years age they remain faithful to that party really for their lifetimes for for decades and deck
age and decade so the republican party jumped as a huge huge huge problem demographically and it's going to continue to shrink but as you get a drinker a is it shrinks it is smaller just like the california republican party has it will become crazier
the point that i made earlier about the media this was also trump was an accelerant he has made the situation worse but weirdly if you if you look at data over time of party registration the decline in republican registration in some ways began much earlier before trying it was a lot about younger voters specifically young women if you look at what millennial men's party
unification looks like you go back to the first time millenniums can vote which it the two thousand and four era millennial men are just as republican today and they more than the for millennia women those numbers have fallen to where it's a democrat last fifty margin
the parties not paying attention to that stripping party gets to it
everything we see now is about a shrinking group of americans trying their best to enshrine power and privilege and prestige
so they know that they will they will come a day when they will have the numbers to do it
but if they lock in as much and changeable or difficult to change mechanisms then they will hold on to one another they don't have the numbers will join but what's really funny
that as a cheap but that has been all that reigned supreme court t from barack obama right because you try to and in something for out about numbers and and if we have mandatory voting they would not get close to winning office if everybody who yeah but but we don't have that if we we have voter suppression is and i'm saying get it's about am
radical went name's the rules wherever they get power they each of literal some are and ultimately the ultimate roles book is the constitution and they are taking dead aim at our constitution and brett commoner is the coke select in canada you look at how we came to me through the federalist aside long letter to asia a coke was investing seed money as he eddie royal society since the nine
and seventy cavanaugh is their guy he was selected by donald mcgann who is a coke person who is
trumps white house counsel who did the vetting of these candidates this is the coke candidate for a supreme court and that is a crucial thing that we should be talking about over the next month okay i was going to ask about stormy then
serious stormy daniels got arrested
supreme court
it doesn't you don't find this an alarming that we are now arresting private citizen it's it's not that me that it was only maybe it was trumped up charges i set up it was a police set up what do you think happened what do you have would do you think it came who gave that order or was an older not needed to be no water needed to be given i mean you know it's like the
the fight between the brown shirts and in the black shirts on the nazi germany back that aegis that you want change you
that means rolling up your political enemies you roll them up whenever you want to create mayhem it's like you said you know you have nuremberg and hillbilly nuremberg and these people will go out and they will affect change themselves if that means walking into a newsroom and killing everybody in it they'll do it it's unspoken laws and unspoken orders that are given out there
as you said these things are long ball games they will change the system to allow these things to be punishable
other as politically motivated but for his part and parcel with ice agents for example in a cocker new hampshire bus station walking down the why asking people for their papers please show that you're a citizen and so in this country the only appropriate response and someone asks you to show your papers and prove citizenship is to say go fuck yourself right right
okay
before we get on a bus but but all of this is is alarming
all of it as radical and we shouldn't be used to it
but we got used to but the current president and the men in to see the papers of the previous
it is him signaling and people saying that with me and they are kind of falling in love and doing exactly well that's all have or on this goes way back to nineteen sixty to are in the republican party deciding to plant a flag in a stable wouldn't let a major hundred
anything else far from that oh that's right away like and more of the world's the tripods were were under arrest
and and i came to the planet and they came from an autograph
i wish there were always under the limit the first law enforcement organization that into a strong border patrol and ice they are you know i feel sad about this because i love my law enforcement officers i train them in countering terrorism and counterterrorism intelligence all the time i engage with them but there was a block of people right now think that they are
the enforcement arm of the trump administration and they are taking these orders literally like you said new hampshire bus station really you think that there's going to be illegal immigrants trying to get on a bus up there they want to enforce his orders in the head ice himself came on television and said until the owners your change that's going to be
the orders locking up kids no problem this is a malfunction that has to be re calibrated and when when we change if we change this congress were going to have to change laws to where they're gonna have to pay them
had was good
last question briefly james asks who in the prospective field of democratic candidates do you think would be most likely to be donald trump in twenty twenty it was year ago the essential skill is going to be somebody who can provoke trump
have trumps swing it then and then be smart enough to stand back in not get into a brawl in the middle of the ring but to cut trump with humor
to laugh at hand right is a narcissistic
humor is the most potent american
our rank and than a great
we got we might as well cause you to stand up there and robert deniro with all respect he says fuck you ride he's play and trumps gang exotic godzilla you new godzilla he just gets stronger
you you try to how vile donald trump
yeah and also had strong are supposed to harness and the poets best we can do fuck you
name a person
i like sept molten kim ryan to to young congressmen and wow
ohio because i think that there's heavy a lot of energy for new and you know we talk about that loss of affinity for the republican party among women i mean it looks like the commanders meeting from the handmade tail when these guys
so i think that whether it's john hickman loop or whether it's eric garcetti of this city it's gonna be someone camera
just out of the progress through the line but i will add to that it is very hard to win
democratic primary with not be from the south and you have a name in back from the south and i think you have to mix into that group people like and you of new people like that because the democratic crisis and swings of soak because what bernie had a problem he could have one but he did
he did not get into the south quick enough did not as message strong enough to not connect close enough with those old the older black women voters and you have a killer makes great guy but was his killer was a killer
does it to you
because i have like someone from the mid west or it could work but is hard but there's there's going to be at least two credible african american candidate and there may be three as governor patrick wrong are not gonna take me seriously when i got it
an outsider
i'm doing now guess

welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him
the
wanting to know answers to what why do we need a space for us and we have yes
mr trump sent out by pets to announce the space
pence does not seem like a space guy but he's in charge of space force a sixth
branch of the arm service that trump wants was
separate but equal
it that don't notice the space force opinions what do you think congressmen your trunk two dogs a draft five times to avoid serving and in vietnam but maybe if you could have been a space
fuck out
job i had the moon shot as vice president they wanted to have something equipped very nice present but is there is there anything to the fact that space is different than it was twenty thirty years ago
it is it is becoming
a place where countries will as as the north pole is a place where countries didn't use it used to contend for power and they will be
do have to invest in space the airforce does that get the air force and we should do more that i don't know that we need a space force
i think it's the seventies on tv i made it to it sounds like a sitcom doesn't sound it but the most important thing to know about it is and i think the congressmen and will agree with this is it's not going to happen
it's it's up to him and has to be voted on by congress and this is at the moment the beginning down payment on it as eight billion dollars that you don't have it's an increase in the deficit by another eight billion dollars and would never get through as it is now well they ran up a trillion with the time
tax cuts so eight billion would be nothing if they wanted to do it well yeah but when he speak real out next year he's not going to

you're running against the
no i'm not going to run for speaker myself but i do think it's time for a new generation of leadership but our part
we'll see we'll see what
okay
he learns what do you say to people who claim m s n b c is just the liberal version of fox news of fuck
look we work with facts of fire
yeah really is seat back the balance of my time
steven pinker how do you fight a political party that's winning with a platform of hate and fear well it didn't identify which one
i to the democrats should take ownership of policies that have worked like the environmental protection agency which has reduced air pollution
i don't really democrat i cannot brag well yeah like any may already measures which really have reduced power and a trump has really shown us be people in this country to hold it against your when you brag that debate and this midterm election season without your inspection be about nancy pelosi rain like there is his agenda
asian on discussion to be had among democrats if they went back our if they doubt however the it should be about ideas and if democrats are moving more to the left on healthcare she has patient be out there talking about medicare for all or why they don't agree with that or how you will defend to the and instead you have this constantly their reaction to what the president has to eating
more it becomes around whoever the bogeyman is at the moment whether that was hillary clinton or and and total iran and here in california where have these very competitive congressional races that's again i mean and the times we wrote that story now what are people saying about nancy pelosi because it is nearly as the candidates get lost and and that doesn't really help any voters trying to distinguish
what the ideas you're actually fighting know the democrats position on track
we get we get the democrats are opposed to trump we going to start talking about what we're going to do you know what we're going to do
i wouldn't completely hold up on
rad talking drunk
there's a lot to be said about we hate trump and he's a traitor
i mean he did sell this country out to another country i would hope i would hope one
that stop saying but we've got to start talking about well we're going to do you think that bragging about what you do is good so we have to teach you had agrarian as ones in one
that would be culturally appropriate
here
i think it's best for a black celebrities to shun trump or meet an attempt to reason with him
what to trump
the law photo out like he he never when he wants he wants to talk to at least actors and comedians about the problems that have like me why don't we just talk that david blaine and make them all disappear
never like he's never serious about what he does and i think i'd never say that present me with him who got a result other than being a with him in a paycheck so they said
what do you think about
there's any credible
oh cause know he sold us out and that was the by
a soldier here's how
written by the guy who owns a huge
the headline added that for me was that president tramples eating paper
which right eating paper yeah whether you're tearing up i had secrets are you baby he just eats paper
what the hell was that i i think it was a fit of anger just was a crowd
this is a labour and with nacho cheese or yeah he says that than his regular guy
this is here to report to have him saying they were like that
i not only that but don't
from say they were
but as i think it's also funny that trump accused obama and co mee member of secretly taping but who did actually taping
that they would present morose a and my will go on and that's all we know about it and that and a soccer ball from potent as a minute

a very good i don't know why
barry go to public a special election
say that know our our special lectured on the road

once again very rewarding said you're going to retire to women i'm tired of all those it
you know this
wave coming majors
democrats going up a good time and got word
don't forget day
the president vacation boarded aired it
go on vacation in new jersey where you go on vacation new jersey
seven a good for everything is going to cheat others died
if it works or why would the taxes of his wife

he looks like he's getting old nervous about the investigations that are swirling around he admitted on twitter
his son danny fuck for a start
dirt bag one truck for
for sure that juniors meeting the famous want a trump tower during the campaign was in fact as we all thought to get dirt on quit
and he said don junior may have wandered into legal jeopardy i love that wandered into
that's what my favorite game show
legal jeopardy
right after wheel of fortune
thank you sir
rudy giuliani said he wants the whole investigation over by september good luck with that he says
travel trump is willing to sit down with commercial
to get a rubber color but it trumps supporters of coffee sitting down with muller as what they call it perjury trap because every time job opens his trap he commits perjury
and then forgetting about that little legal trick you can use coal not lying
but but that wouldn't be the case with he said a new record broke his own record of course of lies in a week one hundred and thirty two last week
previous records one o three he smashed it
my favorite liable i swear
giving one of those nuremberg rallies there in tampa
and he
and he said
a tremendous movie screen outside for all the thousands of people who couldn't get it
there was no movies great
no it outside try to get it
you know at least when jim jones told his followers to drink the kool aid there was cool it
so this is interesting amoroso in the news she says she has tapes

i guess
are your native californians are you from out of town
from california you know what we are always thinking about it and year is fire seventy percent of the state has spoke over it you can see the fires now from space
trump tweedy blaming the victim saying we are making the fires worse because get this he said we allowed a massive amount of our water to be diverted into the pacific ocean
that's right we're having trouble putting out our wild fires not because of global warming that's because we dumped all our water into the pacific ocean
yes and they call what they drop on the fire retardant

welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him

the internet just making sure there be eighteen year term limits for the supreme court yes some people have mentioned i would say yes because trunk got two picks in a year and a half jimmy carter never got one zero
mixing got for reagan got four years
look so i think a little reasonable case to be made for i think you want to have judicial independence which the founders thought could be accomplished were having life tenure by the also probably thought that over time the people and supreme court would sort of match get over long period of time
the ideological proclivities of the party that was a plane them but if you like a stab at people don't focus on you go back to nineteen sixty eight fifty in the last fifty fifty years and if you count the new nominee there will have been eighteen people a point to the supreme court
how many of them were appointed by republican president fourteen of the team so it's over eighty including for from two president who did not win the popular vote correct
because of the jamie raised liberals on the court but the reason why people have freaked out more than they might have is because you know yesteryear there were times when a president gerald ford would appoint someone like john paul stevens who ended up not being is ideologically pure and right wing as some of the people you have now that that problem has been solved by the right
in various ways but it is interesting to see how lopsided it has been even are democrats have been in office for much different percentage of the time then the fourteen to eighteen would would suggest well you know where the founders screwed up they didn't know that we would stop smoking
so they didn't think it will be living in the eighties and nineties
if if we were still a smoking country will wouldn't have to worry about term limits we wouldn't have a country run by people who were all eighty eighty nine years old
so you're saying america was never really that great

they were lousy
america okay
charlie you're going to join other principal conservatives and vote for democrats in the mid term i would prefer to vote for sane rational republicans i just i can't find them
but let me know
god i'm to write in you know the pope rig
just a jungle and would definitely won't be the pope known it
edit
but no you're not going to vote democrat or you know about
only two sides
okay we're going to pick race by race and i do think that america needs to had like to not crazy parties and i do think that of principle contributors all abandoned the republican party then leave it to the the swamp lizards and and the crab pots and the trumpets but as of right now
i don't see any any any constituency for republicans who are going to stand up against donald trump and i do think that the elections going to a referendum on constitutional what about democracy to about the next presidential i mean john case that looks like he's making some moves and the mitt romney if you could find mine consists system
could be you know
do you think there will be a challenge from the republican classic wing of the party there will be a challenge and it will fail because the the party has basically become is jonathan was saying has become kind of the baltic what does that movie
we sat way okay i it tried to eyes
it won't fail if it saps enough though right way to elect a democrat when it will suck say well and that's why
i'm not saying john case it will win the election but as he runs as a third party candidate the third third party candidate will be interesting but then again i mean don't don't underestimate the down from could be reelected a white guy which you know i mean never underestimate the democrats to blow and i'm the guy who says anything even if he loses the election
yeah really funny but okay
jennifer how important is the election of women to the success of the democratic party board drug ability to take that there's that i never get a whore so often right
lack of that
it said the groove on say they're very potent give us the be provocative about why they're not
no and and we're going to see i mean we have incredible numbers for those of you who have been watching this lemon or kill and women are killing it both in winning right they raised their

that comes out of emily's list were in the mid term's last cycle last time and about nine hundred women who had raised their hands to say they wanted analyze let's help in this cycle forty thousand winner
catherine stormy day nose and on earth
grabbing tape and women i think it is women who were going to wind up emanating we hear of this country i'll on it
one of the stardust analysts of the elections in speaking the house is dave last it works it could legal bought and he called issue
he's already called it the ear of the angry female college graduate and i'll tell you when you talk to trumps political advisors that use the constituency they fear most because they already vote in huge numbers and his approval rating among them is i think twenty six percent something like that it's truly they voted for him and twenty sixty i don't know what the college educated women
he won white women and he says i won women he actually means wife women
yeah i don't know what he's numbers they were actually met so bad that will not so bad and sixty and now he's underwater even with white women just white women without college educated
how has the trump family gone so many years in new york city without facing major prosecution great question i would love to know that easy way out my bed

got
detroit's some nightclubs
now biggest large fountains one some more
adam is it naive to believe that california wildfires could be random are they truly do to man made climate change oh that's a that's a softball question for me they're absolutely dudes in am a climate but not know that that just eight years are people that are really going after differently you would have ruined you for
people don't realize is that when natural disasters happen and people say oh it's an act of god
we really are the ones who make the natural disaster so distracted and the case of fires it's because we built we're doing this on this show coming this year
because we build homes so far out in the wilderness that now we extinguished every single fire that happens right but those are like forest need a certain amount of fire you know like small fires if with clean out the dead wood when you extinguished every fire because oh my god now people are the suburbs of encroached out into the forest then the dead wood builds up and then when the fire does come it's a real mother fucker
and that's what we're seeing that's what we're seeing right now i mean it's impossible to live in california and not realize that climate change is real and that we live in a man made landscape that is crumbling under it's own way it's really astonishing and a nice weekend everyone

feathers for a brought her she's good at selling sure it goes like drugs
they're talking about her but she says drop is a racist research and suffering from dementia and then he knew all about the collusion not exactly bombshells
it's like reading a book about chris christie and the big reveal is a snacks at night

corsair trump is taken at all well i'm joking of course
he turned into the ambrose that eight times in twenty four hours or so far as colder crazed a crying low wife at a dog
that's the feel good summer hit reliving
crazed crying low life dog met whiny little bitch
when people are mad at the dog carbon trump has a very long history of calling people dogs which is very ironic because he expects those around him to act just like a dog unconditional love right always be loyal and pee on the bed
and you know what you think about it michael cohen taped to i'm a roasted taped in hollywood access tape the only one who didn't take him was obama
trump i retreated that michael cohen listeners to refute something morose said claiming in the book that trump at one point was eating a piece of paper
i actually can believe
bump waited michael cole and to refute that that's something a snake using a rat to disprove a weasel

you don't even have to tape up he admits everything himself he pointed out that omer i'm to only lasted as long as she did it in the white house because she said great things about me
is the only boss and starts a job interview by saying so tell me a little something about myself

the other things that are coming out from this book apparently trump things jarrod is a little gay
he says he seems a little sweet to me that his word for day seems a little sweet to me and i i agree judge on a real man i bet he doesn't even use hairspray
jarrett said he's not taking this lying down and then someone to run it i'm jared you don't like out at all at night of vodka drips you over a chair so you don't wrinkle
and our education secretary bette davis
apparently trump lock her in private calls or ditsy divorce
luckily she will never see it it's in a book

morose this is betsy divorce is destroying our education system and that her governance is a travesty to children
divorce was not having that she got run on the phone and said sorry what's a travesty

the racist stuff trump they were talking one day but harriet tubman member mother was talking about putting her on the twenty dollar bill and drums are too ugly to ugly for the twenty dollar bill so they made a compromise harriet tubman on the front david duke on the back
that way he could say they were good people on both sides
yeah the miss mr over three there was a grand jury award over three hundred catholic priests of sexually abused over a thousand children even jesus christ today said jesus christ

this little on the dictator for trump has revoke the security clearance of john bread in the cia director he says it's a security issue it's not it's in security issue
and trumps says he had to do it because he treated out brennan is get this frenzied has wild outbursts and makes outrageous and founded statements
wild outburst outrageous unfounded statement who does that sound like

we're back
okay do you agree with
ron wyden statement that there should be consequences for platforms that don't both people like alex jones
i don't have consequences are writing
regulated and some level of how they operating and so he did that it may actually and i think probably a lot of people worry about that idea
doing company should be able to do whatever they want
free speech bertrand of
zero should we get rid of tipped wages
he said
yeah nice sat and well if you want to maintain a legacy of slavery and keep sexual harassment keep the two dollar wage in this country otherwise
and you know what if you put it on the ballot will actually go out to vote maybe will change out the stuff that we've been talking map it is changing the rules
places words after that
we actually just one in d c on june nineteenth we raised the weights or three dollars to fifteen dollars on the ballot in michigan
do you think it's time we had a constitutional convention to alter some of the fundamental problems with america
i do i've been for twenty years problem is they're the ones who want a currency
the claims book that this is the koch brothers thing you know it's a convention be very damaging endangers a big you want to go back to dred scott say that's where i want to do it and so you open that door
it's interesting progressive liberals have been fighting this for years and the koch brothers and and conservatives want to open that attack they want to go back to appointed senators i worry about right now in this country we've got forty percent of people who say that the president should be able to shut down a news organization age and i'm happy i worry that will get into a very deep meyer
if we go into a constitutional convention
i know the operating system has some flaws in some bugs in it but we may be replacing it with like guys who want to hit rocks with hammers i really worry about it there is a long term problem though you know we've talked about the electoral college and how lousy that yeah we have gerrymandering but also as the population becomes or urbanized rules rural states
i have more power in the senate so we have a democracy crisis
going in this country and i don't know how you get around that we are going to pay like charles how it all
somebody call just one thing going to do a cause you to convention remembered that reboot just from zero we rewrite at that point and likely instead it's really unlikely that a very difficult and agree on lunch and right
and it's really a lot more people saying it to take a baby step and the baby's two ish
not to dakota's
why wouldn't a plan
it was good enough of deadwood one day
exactly
what do you think david corner of reality winner be as a translator who leaked the russian hacking or aboard being since there were five years in prison well as a journalist we count on what it with the name and links well if it's a long story
know as a journalist recount on people are leakers information that's vital for democracy to function knowing what happened with the russian hack was very important thing now she did violate the rules of employment but this penalty that she's gotten five years is exceedingly long one of the longest penalties and
it's i was there to create a a chilling effect right so that other people don't do this and we stay in the dark and if we have a new administration and congress who won't tell us what happened fully the two thousand and sixteen hacking that we need people like reality winner we need more of them and now we're going
get less of them because we still don't have the full story has trump and republicans don't want us to i worry about think we've got a president who goes in private meetings the oval office with russian spies and ambassadors it goes behind closed doors and god knows what they're talking about no to tell us and he's he's been in deep with the russians
since he was a since he was a young as t d avoiding veteran of new york
yes you know what she broke the law and and the sentence was harsh but it was within the bounds of what what the guidelines were and set the german something aside she broke the law but we've got an administration that more fundamentally compromised our security on so many different levels than she ever could have dreamed of doing that to be fair the
russians metallic you know there was an irrational fear either chinese will get there
indicted grandmother's turned themselves in way they get this maria booty no fucking bettina what
oh cool up
it's a wrap their job
look she was absolutely perfect bait for these for the dc conservative nerd crowd they're like russian girl who likes guns around

okay
they resist it
the reserves this show up there on our side
thought we had a pretty good
have an episode of law and order g o okay
made for democrats kind of a relief to trial what our way i can college member when you finally got laid after eighteen months
yeah trumps person no lawyer and is for former campaign manager both found guilty so which to trump nothing
i cook
oh and admitted to every crime in new york that doesn't involve standing on the sidewalk or three playing cards in a box
they get all of that in new york
we don't do that here but no trump called of a rat is er ret
the trumps they have a needlepoint pillow at their house it's a friend is just someone you haven't thrown under the bus

if you look at for a good lawyer michael cohen
stay bed of a roadster and trumps defense is always why would you ever trust someone who i picked to work for me
for the other guy who got it the other day on the same day kinda within an hour oh how embarrassing
i go to the oscars from someone's wearing the same dress it's just
but yeah he was guilty of eight counts for counter bank fraud for council tax fraud and one count of worrying ostrich after labor day
yeah
to trump heard that he was guilty of tax evasion and bank fraud trump were shocked he said those are crime

the trouble with very different about mr mann to forge then he was about michael recall interact
metaphors he's a good man refused to break like that right call it said such respect for a brave man hash tag white collar crimes matter
dark day for a country but on the bright side
mexican kids got released because they needed the cages

yeah i put the kids and kate
so
but republicans in congress standing by their man they are reaching camille cosby level of denial know
the republican party so deathly quiet and perfectly still about all this you think trump was fucking it

as the president defenders point out very strongly don't need a crime if you look in the book of things that are crimes
they got nothing like a girl or just brings up old shit
you say you colluded with russia and they're like yeah but don't quit and got a blow job and you or flip flops on our first date
meanwhile trump did see soon as a hard hitting interview on fox news with the air art and just was free associating at lightning speed you'll never guess what he said it to which aren't
what about hillary's emails and what about the f b i z males what about the desk did one about that time obama paid a fine
even q was like slowdown fatty a sound kind of crazy

bob woodward's new book excerpts did it's called all the president's thinking
bob woodward first nixon
oh and drop he has brought down more republicans that gay sex and the public restroom

but it's a double whammy for the because personally excerpt give out for the book and then the day after that
anonymous saw this
this anonymous
it was printed in the new york times or a very high up so
official at both the book and the op ed take based the same thing that there was a resistance from inside the white house
i don't know sir arthur said many senior officials are working very hard to protect america from trouble
and trumps started to respect someone who was going on he went into a cabinet meeting and they were all wearing pussycat

but this anonymous as a senior official who wrote piece that
he or she finds trump to be a moral an impulsive and ellen formed and petty so suspects include everybody
but it's it's heard that everybody in the white house is living in this bizarre a world where they are not who they say they are and today maloney said oh i thought i was the only ones

shiva didn't i mean even as millennia
she said no it's not me
if i i'm going to say i'll write it on my jacket
trump is so pissed off about what a turncoat right in his present a traitor board but tried the russians like that
haste pissed off
it says the new york times was turned over turn over and not turn him over
country does he think he lives in return people over for national security purposes and we catch this guy he says the threat level is going to orange

but still white around the eye
you know it's a warning sign when the president looks like a warning sign that

debating whether he's crazy i'm still getting over the fact that the president dies is a a platinum blonde and pains his face and basketball
he sounds like a drunken looks like a tequila sunrise
and these two things came out this latest
hard pressed to find someone who worked at administration who hasn't at some point called him an idiot or some version of that idiot more on that now we have the defense secretary mantis saying working towards and working with it was like working with a fifth or sixth grader
and trump he was so mad when he heard that he spit chocolate knows

yeah
let's do it again oh no or alive
but the paranoia
white house because as soon as the anonymous came out then trumped course detective drum
twenty seven high level people have now denied it might pens denied it might bump pale coats bad as they all said it wasn't me
link and that his team of rivals trump has his team of shaggy
nobody remembers
but there are even talking about how everyone in the white house has good at detecting why detector to a lie detector test for the drug administration

we don't do that in america
we don't have enough electricity
but who wrote it detective trump want to know who is the author who isn't is it kelly
isn't kelly and couldn't be sarah huckabee sanders not like heard a lie
brick very sit right it i can't even read it
ben carson said anonymous anonymous do i look great
but i will lead the last word on anonymous to the president himself
an anomaly


build the wall i think that drugs are still getting it
yeah
backstage jim carey's
writer and producer of the documentary active measures now playing in theaters and on i tunes jack brian jacques

thank you to integrate service with this movie is out today people can see it
right now it's on i tunes and were be a country this because i think this is so great because it pulls together we ruined hearing so many things you watch the news and every day it's a different scandal little lot of that has to do with russia you pull it all together and when you see what pollutants aims were from the beginning x k g b wanted to get rush
your back to be super power status and you see who trump is it's almost inevitable
that they would figure in each other's lives like this the stooge and the puppet master absolutely and it had happened in other countries before
in a playbook was the exact same and you look at these the sphere of people that trump is hanging out with starting in the eighties and dealing with independent people that is going after going back to the late nineties
it does seem completely inevitable he's the perfect mark is mean
like you say the playbook goes way back when russia and the kgb who do they look for and how does trump said that he has so intelligence officers when looking for somebody to flip they have an acronym they use which has mice and it means people that are susceptible to money ideology compromise or ego and those are the levers they
try to pull i see three out of four ram
he has no ideology
but you don't need all for now three and four must be they must be like we did our guy really need one you'll need one and yeah he's totally it okay
and that's what i love about it goes back in time to i mean this
didn't happen just in two thousand and sixteen where would you put this where would you put the beginning of the story where we try to find the beginning and it was a long trail back but we really started the first clear act of illegality which was nineteen eighty four when donald trump personally sold five condos in trump tower two russian mobster named david bowie didn't
with the state attorney general rule that was money laundering
that relationship
continued first her casually there were a lot of russian mobsters that lived in from buildings
tons of rush monsters are buying from properties and hang on the casinos but between the early nineties and around two thousand and four
from go through a series of bankruptcies and he starts losing the ability to get seed capital the casino the casinos yeah atlantic city has is three only man lose money in the casino yeah
people give you money for nothing yeah indians make this work yeah
and it was destined if i mean steve wynn
not exactly in their heritage running history knows they can do it
and steve when they you magnet shows in the film describes why he lost and it was it he built a casinos twice the size of any other casino atlantic city it was never going to be successful but this thing this fascinating to me is the russian mafia yeah that the fact that explain this to us again
the russian mafia really an arm of the russian government yeah so it a little disconcerting to find out america is now
so subsidiary of the russian mafia the i think that's a really important point and i think we as americans seem at the mafia we think about the godfather or tony soprano a character it's good doing battle with the government whereas in russia that's how they launder money out of the country that's how the corrupt officials starting with potent and his inner circle get money from
russia to save judiciary is to safe areas where to go back to why their money is dirty to begin with yeah gluten and is always hear the term old girl yeah those are the people around him right yes and they're all thieves right they're stealing from their own people absolutely they say potent is the richest men in the world of that bureaucrat salary
how do we know that though i mean was it the panama papers
a huge part of it but also just the assets he controls the fact that he and it's it's hard to quantify what kind of money has in part because it's rubles which is not a steady currency is dollars but also because it's so opaque so they're taking it from russian industries from just the cost any like any dictator and in such as europe
hundreds russia it's also ukraine they still tons of a gatorade
and it's throughout especially energy true they want to park pocket in the west or in safer and they have to hide it somehow out and real that's where trump came real estate is the easiest way to do that
even in the the patriot act has a cut out for real estate transactions so unless there is a bank loaning money which there isn't because there's no they don't need alone there is no government body looking that transaction they use their own brokers are known as nodes which these points of intersection between dirty money and cleaning it out
and those brokers are always russian mob people and so there's no government and a trump property is all over the world know they are laundering money and have been the russians for decades yeah great
so like the hookers paying is like the least of it
only not illegal
not illegal
what they know maybe a hundred and eight
some places might be right but they know he's committed financial propriety run now they know that he's worked for them during two thousand and sixteen and that is an ultimate comfort so when paul man afford who was prudent man and ukraine when he came on board is you see that i do as what some stall our guy right i mean that they didn't even has to catch
catch them right in collusion the game to my collusion because the collision with so baked into the cake from so long ago yeah and not only that i mean it's an essential component of the operation is well i mean these are originally look at what happened in ukraine they have been in georgia play by play the same the same operation one of the components
each of these and not just the ones we show in the film but other options right the world is the candidate that they are supporting they accuse the social media let's out the opposing candidate they call them criminals online and the candidate that they're supporting repeats that line calling them criminals and so an audience has heard it in this independent format they think
one guy thing it on stage is that candidates so it sounds like he's the only guy telling the truth
so potent basically franchised you know
trump was one of the mcdonalds owners who bought the lice and frequently they use billionaires that an urban in politics before because they have no track record with just trump know he's this much of a russian
i think so i think it would be very hard for him to act in line with the historical precedent just one for one without knowing what he was doing also people i think assume that because trumped doesn't do anything up policy because there only the government or law or the world based on the word or words that
goliath
we're getting this something the president urged age knows and i want to air it his organization is organization thank you he knows what is going on in ryan asian and those the people and everybody you talk to says he knows what i think this will be doing a great service see this movie
you need to what you need some alright thank you jack thanks for making


everybody
a political common and and host of the x files are insane and the former white house senior adviser under president obama david axelrod

she is a fantastic the most even over paper is failing
i'm rochelle goal very low
it was the seven term us congress i'm from pennsylvania fifteenth recently retired you spend more time with his sanity charlie

it was very happy that because we saw president obama speak for the first time today
right now more about this than others
is this because was this planned for now or was this because of the events of the week i mean i think people the threat level and all of our ass what way up is that why has his own those i think his sense of urgency has been pretty high for a while here so this thing has been plan for several weeks she was going to get this war
the university of illinois but whenever you're going to speak about this president and where we are as a country you have to keep a sharp pencil in your pocket because you never know your one tweet away from a rewrite and so i'm sure that and you know that some of the lines in that speech reflected events of the last few day can i read my favorite he said
people ask me what are you gonna do for the election know the question is what are you going to do right
right
okay
anybody else on obama or can i move on to the supreme court
under this car and i mean the obama thing was so heartbreaking right i mean this vision for a second when you remember what it was the president's yeah but you know my job that i was yeah it was not to remind people of of of what we had but to remind people about who we are and what our responsibilities are and that's i mean he's looking forward and back
it's one of the reasons why he hasn't been out there because he thinks we need to act together not wait for the messiah
and i think he's right that people are out there doing i mean i and in much more of the state of black despair and panic than obama is just temperamentally and bad situation
the one thing i agree with them is you do go out there is astonishing the amount of kind of civic revival yes i mean they amount to their women particularly as laid as trunk on how they get it has they cannot tolerate this man yeah i think the president makes and president obama may seem fair points about the republican party what's happened to it
it hurts even more republican than democrat says you there's like it unlikely her lecture me about what's wrong with democratic party but i think his points more fair and what happened at a party and mitt romney and mccain bullish reagan eisenhower roosevelt i mean a good result so this is a way that's a real soul searching to new in this party the party he's
to be about some ideals now it's about loyalty to a man
and that's what's particularly troubling and then here
it was more troubling this week is this man
even if it gets to his the luckiest son of a bitch
say this about that is that is the one thing about him but he is so lucky when you trade places with no i don't think i am lucky right now okay but the fact that he got the second supreme court pick any can pick a guy who can now vote not just have him answer subpoenas and you can pardon himself and the rest of the last that he's lucky
yeah and were cursed i mean you know he is he any this pretty dark right he's this sort of metaphysical kind of gaul on think you're at this like personification of americans since to keep stumbling into these positions where he obviously shouldn't be but the but the metaphysical twist is that he's always miserable and takes no satisfaction from any of his son
guys are born six feet from home plate and i think in a home run
that's as reality of life so what's what's so so disconcerting about what's going on with the supreme court hearings is that it's a charade he's going to get on the supreme court and power begets power that's the thing for everybody who was like hillary is just as bad really
now that we see that the president's own cabinet i mean at first it was the democrats hate me for no reason and then it was the media hates me for no reason and there was never trump or hate me for no reason and the f b i
with my own people
the best people number was the best people the best people turn out to be the lakers
so
atmosphere the fact that he is picking this person and this this cabin who
can i read with lindsey graham says because it since it's a fait accompli are just one event
lindsey graham lecturing the democrats had a chance and you lost if you want to pick judges then you'd better win an election you can't lose the election and pick judges if you want to pick judges you'd better when what we did
i thought they had with

even just picks picnic garland that then trump sheets his way to a minority victory is an unindicted coke and spirit or in one of the crimes that ensured this election and now is choosing the judge is going to you he thinks i think leaded skate on all the crimes he committed to become president and i wonder how mirror garland watching ted cruz question
kavanagh here all the times he agreed with merit garlic and holding up mirren a garland as the gold standard by which a judge should be measured a guy who they wouldn't even give a meeting much less a hearing or a vote i know
if they wouldn't need coal if they could run the red states on hypocrisy
just

you're right it's is little like w w f wrestling it's kind of exciting to watch but you know kind of how it's going to end the only debate right now is he going to get fifty three a fifty five votes not as really an issue okay so this anonymous
or however you so i know that's not your
what's going on that we know he doesn't do drugs omission
but what was that about
well that with the bigger issue is
there was much more or less the people who probably did not write that article and then there's supposedly who's your guess if i had to guess somebody national security establishment
i want to get my friend in trouble but it's also a dan coach director of national intelligence
you're going on her friend
america
but whoever it is says that there's lots of people who think the same way and could have written the same op ed piece so you think don't go to the you think you know i had a feeling i was i like that that jon huntsman theory but i started have a feeling it's going to be somebody his name or i'm not super familiar with yeah i think it's murder on really someone were not familiar
or with nothing your papers going to be that balls he has to go this far out on the limb and then we go i think that john kelly second in command is a high level person staff secretaries hello person so there's a lot of people learn in the news all the time that are still by any measure senior government official i think it's like murder on the orient express were
everybody gets one sentence

i think it's general kelly
i do first well i think the mccain funeral
was the last straw for a lot of people and he's the kind of guy who i mean look he's not been happy for a very long time like i said in the monologue ballistic people who have called the president of an idiot
it harder to find one who didn't and kelly has been in there he in would read bookies or something like we're we're in crazy town right there's no point even trying to talk to me doesn't understand anything i just think he's got the balls to do this well that's another question do you think this this is heroic or do you think my
question is what was nine point what was the point if your messages on going to stay inside and act as a guard rail against those crazy president why poke the bear and make him crazier
either come out and say claire who are you are at say it wasn't a call to arms right to me you could turn of understand if somebody said i'm here to tell you it's worse than you think and congress needs to exercise it's oversight function but that's not really what he was saying you saying there's people here have got things under control so that my look pretty bad but you know yourself that deregulation and were here
handling thing or give me dispensation through continuing to work for this whack a doodle right or yeah i might go easy on me and my a lot of the trials were all that laura fyi this guy i think the person just simply trying to reassure us yeah it's really bad but there's some of us here who are you know we're adults i think that's what he's trying to
do i hope this is truly a senior administration official i'm you'll be terrible from new york times if it were yeah i'm ready whenever you mean my outlook by and calming i didn't find that calming not really we didn't know what my outlier opinion on this is this person i would like to say to them
thank you for your service
the united states has made the same mistake overseas so many times will take out saddam hussein or somebody we don't like and don't think about what comes next right yes saddam hussein was terrible what came next the isis what comes next if these people who are preventing him from
doing really crazy things go i think general kelly would love to leave this is gonna be worse than iraq
he said that he said this is the worst job i've ever had he was in full lucia
the other side of that is that all of these people gary coleman all of them has sort of short things up and made sure that for all of the president's manifest incompetence kind of the trains run on time for merely it has i think given everybody else a sense of false confidence or a sense that this
this whole thing is more sustainable than it seems rate because people will save you all the time right after the election i really thought that everything was going to fall apart but now you know it seems chaotic but everything started holding together and as it holds together that president masses more and more power he gets more charges he gets more loyalists and so you know if this had come
out safe three weeks into the administration congress might have been more willing to do something he's already just sort of been able to build his power base even if it's fragile and that and so at a certain point they're not they might think that they're protecting us but really they're just kind of squeezing through
will a few of their republican policy priorities and making it seem as if things are okay when they're republican priorities policy wise we have lived through that before and we can survive those things he were part of the court for it
that's not the case with rule of law and the end of democracy and all that other stuff that he threatens in a way that we have never seen before that is what is so unique and these guys are stopping that but they're not stopping at or maybe there's nothing some of it butler but people like madness
i'm glad a geneticist bomb and defense
good for the country a guy and coaches at home or next tellers and while there i never thought i'd be saying he wears the guy for american sort of the challenge that
the toes
it doesn't chevron am someone who are going to step into that
we've never had a president who doesn't stand up full throated in support of western value
no independent judiciary judiciary democracy and free press rule of law and that's job with the present he's an excellent ratings are who are older doctors a embrace that is totally workers and losers
who wants to undermine the order we created that we benefited by this is why it's so frustrating to me okay so listen i don't know if you've heard about that or work down in texas and from
he's going up against ted cruz and ted cruz
great
and every week we see that kind of pulling a closer and so today
is a little bit nervous now and one of the attacks he's made against good or workers that when he was young he was in a rock band
folk rock but i don't know what it was but it wasn't texas i guess it was folksy music and we have a copy of the album that he was a liberal in texas so liberal folk music is a little different
i'm a liberal country music it's called tear drops in my avocado
the
liberal country songs i'm so long so i could adopt that

thank you for waiting for me pretty i would always been a fan of yours
i saw you the first time i ever saw you you didn't act and you didn't even speak you just did impressions with your face that's right yeah that's right and i said this guy yeah it started early when i saw golden pond when i was a kid i went out in the theater and i was like
hicks shrubbery
i didn't know i was doing and i saw myself in a shop in a shop window and i went wow that's his face when it came home and
i mean by the way i have to tell you to of the most audacious the same night at the comedy store for mitzi oh come on years ago years ago the like you are they should certainly the years ago gym and okay
i don't think we have all the time is happening
you know that
that's the new school of all time happens okay well i never was you're an actor
yeah old and i suck right yeah i didn't pass old tight you got you were regular and stuff i got up there and the microphone fell apart of my hands and first thing that happened you know it's going to be one of those nights in and i ran past me the back to canada for two years
you know i've noticed we're both around the same age and younger but as time goes by i noticed your mind really move the furniture i don't think that was me i think you're transferring that really i don't like mandela of yeah i know that
i never let unless you're thinking of greg kinnear
young love really omar

i'm glad your memories of my life were better than my you are beautiful
but i must tell you i've seen so many movies
one way i judge actors is by like oh look at a party or yeah he did great and that could anybody else do it and usually the answer is yes sure with you
lot of times a splinter know
why i see her it is making the wrong choices that committing completely no i don't think you have my my favorite movie and i love many of them is cable go oh thank you
show i feel like they should be on a film festival together there's something about them that is very prescient about the way the world came to be absolutely you think they're we are parent lists
we are baby sat by the television were taught how to think by the taliban that's the dangerous time i think about what's going on right now there there's there are there are generations growing up right now who are learning to lie that lying is okay yeah that this kid say fake news is that you're supposed to hate half the country
and if if if anything if anything we've got to get back to a place where we realized that a vote is not who you are you know and and because you voted republican you're not stupid you're not different you're not worthless
i could break bread with anybody who voted for trump we could find some common ground to love each other
doing stupid shit
we expect so
stand together so let's plug your show us why this character the hitting the old kidding where are these of mr rogers
who i think of the shows really interesting because first of all i get to work with michelle go hungry again which was a dream the first time in a dream come true again movie was eternal sunshine okay
i assume every knows as bio
that's really
but yeah it was a beautiful experience in it's about a guy yeah it's about it's about
love being hit by lightning
i mean this this is about a gentleman who's hard is so big and and his his approach is so authentic that it's undeniable when you come in contact with him when he sounds like you
well i was going to do is a seeker
when you what you are always seeking something right
yeah here not always happy know i'm not always happy that's for sure happy to the weather and
but i don't live in orange on place
that isn't isn't are ordering the see to let the flowers grow because it's hard to find what you're looking be especially when it's deep yeah and basically i have learned how to and i am is angry and caught up in this stuff is anybody i outrageous like a cop the carpet bombing of outrage that's happening i deleted it under aren't absolutely no i first sorry i didn't realize until
so you and jerry seinfeld coffee show when you use your studio what a great artist you are now i see it all the time on social media because it totally the only show you a feel of the show that i love this one of drum
no that that's my and noone ads aren't the flying monkeys
perhaps i want a detailed analysis and then lincoln is then there is my main can guarantee lincoln symbolize i love good biggest trunk was always a president that actually had the worst tribulations our country has ever faced and brought us together now the opposite is happening right now
i'm a president who started out when the country was gather and had a wonderful leader and he is tearing us limb from limb work destroying every institute let's let's talk about
we don't remember that he's a car salesman he's using connor and stabs a little and he's he didn't he didn't make america great again but he did turn back the odometer
okay
as i wonder where the back seat right right
we're going on in because i watch this week what i kept thinking was it all comes down to this case of narcissistic personality disorder we've all talked about its and to been on the public seen what we see it in real time somebody really unraveling spiraling toward madness so i'm an asshole was that i out know
there was a with him talking to bob woodward right we heard that this week at the end of it he gets a little frustrated and as well accurate is that nobody's ever done a better job than i'm doing as president he says
what
travel what demolition man

is
a couple of drinks implosion up couple of weeks ago he gave himself an a plus
even if he thought these things you did to say them out loud as soon as he does like that
star trek right and meeting kind of says these things that are so outrageous over and over and over again until eventually people think that there must be something they're right that even if it's not you know even if he's not worth ten billion dollars he must be worth like one billion dollars as opposed to a few million or
suppose being in debt if you marry and right you were going to run into one hundred and five right so that's the ratio of truth to bullshit
anything he said if is twenty don't want to
twenty to one man when you have this older you know like when his i can sing for his home his personal cabinet and that was turned on and the person with this disorder is never going to go maybe it's me
of course whenever you want to see something internet everybody is saying you know the one on everybody's and sound like trump know ever to saying
janet
is in my head or saying yeah people are saying that's it
it's on the receiving end of one of the tantrums
yeah i met with and twice and whether you do well
i told him no three times to his face he took it while the first time was a second and third times you can take over the healthcare issue and i try to explain away with problems with the bill and medicaid he strangers and planned parenthood and
time the second time i told him he will i i told him i was opposed to the billing said why or this was on a thursday so why he said why as well be the same reasons i told you on tuesday two days before i went to the issue
the off and he said during destroy the republican party and
know the tax reforms gonna go down
you're going to destroy the republican party because he couldn't remember where jews that because for the health care abilities are going to take down on i am i finally interrupted and after about it seemed like lol forever
isn't the cabinet and we couldn't get in get laid into here as mr president he telling me that this you said mr president yeah
but nowadays as an affirmation
it was going to fail if the healthcare bill didn't pass and i said i you tell me if we don't pass a healthcare bill in this form we're not going to be able to attach informed because a baseline is that long enough that's exactly right when you lose you lose an aussie one again and then or a whole room everybody says yes leading us if you lie to him and then back to me at the end you still are no i'm still know mr president goes off
from me again and so on mr prasad gone and done talking to you on one here anymore
and when want to be look you want to see are sure and cloud ignore trumped for a week
know i had a girlfriend one time long time ago and we were having problems i went to therapy and
and the therapist said sounds like your girlfriend a little bit borderline personality and she's a narcissistic whatever and i said well maybe if i just find a different way intellectual wise or get used to what she's saying and i could my band comebacks will be different and that i could just accept the fact she's going to get month
whatever and he she said please do please please try for a week to ignore and not react to these buttons that are being punished we actually don't there's a lot of money are trying to have no i know we don't
little this morning and i'm saying or needs to be people around them
okay that's on all we apparently yeah yeah yeah okay so let me ask about we have the democratic and zoltan here of the last successful election
the democrats seem to be getting their groove back a little bit when i mean by that is that alexander or cover your job your crutches i had a presley stacey abrams carry evelyn davis these women who won in primaries weren't supposed to and they did it with unabashed liberal proposals
medicare for all ending student debt a different approach to the war on terror ending mass incarceration it seems like if there is a maybe a shining spot in this term tragedy
it's made the democrats sort of rediscover who they are and

i think those fundamental issues health health care a secure job security and all of the things that are being addressed whatever the whatever form it takes your hearing this kind of across across the board those camera is reflected their districts well they reflect
their constituencies well you know kind lamb and your stay probably has a slightly different
slant on these things but fundamentally the values i think are very consistent and you know the the republicans are running with the word socialism they're trying to say i don't scare people scare phoenix alarm nose and venezuela from says you were going to be living in venice when i grew up in canada we have socialized medicine and i
i'm here to tell you that this bullshit line that you get on all of the political shows from people is that it's a failure a system is a failure in canada it is not a failure and can i never waited for anything in my life i chose my own doctors my mother never paid for a prescription it was fantastic and i just got back from vancouver
and i keep hearing this like canadians are still nice comedians are so nice they can be nice because they have healthcare

when how real live in a box there are certain people in our society that need to be taken care of their there are people with out as many opportunities that need to be helped toward those opportunities there are people who are sick but that's been injured enough to lose your home and as your mother got sick and look i've he said
the united states has been a quasi socialist government for one hundred years for crying out loud it's not a sauna plenty of subsidies for oil company that was net also the only air and so easy
yes of course there's nothing more socialistic than some of the pentagon programs that are just jobs programs the pentagon says we don't want these tanks and they build them anyway
but that word the democrats seem to get a plan to fight this slack this slander of socialism you're going to be living in venezuela i don't have to say yes isn't socialism to the word and everything we have to stop a pilot i am i am interested to see if that works what i see
see now are republicans madly and the president himself madly pressing these buttons hopefully you won't press that button pressing buttons
to try and scare people and it's truly this learning and occur to me don't you think they think are unable to resist least used up the currency of socialism with obama right i mean they pulled that line so many times with obama that people i think you don't particularly younger people people who are younger than me have really positive associations with socialism but even younger even on
people i think are so used to every democrat being accused of socialism that i wonder for people who would ever consider voting for democrat in the first but drive and really this analogy rebellion the attack and strategy right now this election is really not about the democrats it's about republicans it's about the party in power it's
it's a referendum was all about i'm not going to be eras united states that's it
some democrats relating to the before i had to be against trump and that's that's the reality republicans plan left they're going to let their their their their opponents they're going to try to discredit their opponents and others whatever they've got good opposition research and going to go there without their lungs already there
has become a farm system for the russians
yeah you think that trump is the only one being groomed
no well there and eight are it right now are unable to exactly they are enabling regular on as a republican
i'm frustrated by this this point that
i'm very much opposed of and report and i think most republicans all
russians out
the whole idea
i'm not very controversial
can't loses the wrong place we never even had to like we say i'm against that didn't have as to be said by
i'm assuming learned is going to put in and many out with the republican the third the town i would say i'm sorry about like it is time for new

when they have to get rid of the honey smacks these are grabbing of other honey max

even before the salmonella they were basically heroin for kindergarten or
it's got smacked right in the ne
richards would aid is here are six years old
all someone has to break into cult and underwood the first virgin bachelor on the bachelor who has also been on the bachelor and bachelor in paradise
while waiting for the right one
your penis just isn't that special
yeah i know you think of it as a trophy to be bestowed upon some lucky disney princess but
it's just a dick
a guy has even my pants probably
called may be what you're searching for isn't out there it's in here
and by that i may go fuck yourself

never mind the anthem the link must address the most offensive thing about the nfl that all the commercials are for beer tapes of trucks or insurance is that all you think men are drunk fat slobs who gotten their trucks and crash them
we're not we also like chicken wing

all don't make your four year old wear a shirt that kisses your ass
this doesn't pay well my parents are great it tells priests i dig older guys

they're all now that we've found that kimberley guilt oils pet name for donald trump junior his junior mint
he must come up with the appropriate candy nicknames for the rest of the family term could be whoppers
erica gober
jared kushner dude you be
wow bob

and finally new rule until donald trump is no longer president don't talk to me about any cause except democrats winning elections
sorry partnership for a gluten free american
drag queens without borders
you're gonna have to wait we need democrats to keep a laser focus on the one issue that really matters finding out what is trumps kryptonite i think it's ridicule the one thing that gets under his skin besides red dye number two
is being made fun of remember how he received when obama made fun of them at the correspondents dinner
the hair on the back of his neck stood up
which was fascinating to watch since it's been transplanted to the front of his head

we need someone who can shred trump like a stand up takes down a heckler because trump is a heckler and to fight him we need a comedian
that is why tonight
after serious thought and consideration
i am officially announcing that i bill maher
that would be a great idea if al franken got back in the



good enough he's smart enough and doggone it people still like
now of course i can hear purists already saying good bill what about the allegations
america always over react and then has buyers remorse we did it with nine eleven and janet jackson's net ball and bird flu and bill clinton's blow job and certainly one of the all time over reactions was al franken sex predator
can we break down what he did it started with that picture it's a joke he apologize for it no one died then there's the sketch our wrote to perform for the troops with glee and tweet and she says frank and had written a moment when his character comes at me for a kiss i suspected what he
was after okay what's been forgotten is that although i was always careful to say women should be heard he never said yeah i did it he said he hoped resigning didn't give people the false impression that i was admitting to doing things that in fact i haven't done that
sweden is a favorite guests of sean hannity and donald trump junior twitter power and somehow roger stone new it's al franken time in the barrel before she made her allegations public
i believe our
i think that's though my right

women should be heard always and we should always keep in mind the vast majority of women reporting serious abuse or truthful but women also didn't completely lose the ability to ally in two thousand and seventeen

crowd knowing that oh yeah
i have to see for the record there was a lot of ask grabbing tail
i'm going to get to that
quite isn't your place
you have the whole show and i have this one little time with year
i also find it very curious that in hollywood for two decades parties at the playboy mansion popular in the world of the sports the only guy who ever got out of line
it was al franken
seven other women for anonymous accuse l of mostly hand drifting while taking pictures does it matter that at least two of these are ridiculous one said al asked her to join him in the bathroom
another said he told her a kiss was as right as an entertainer this is not al franken another woman said during a picture our quote put his hand on my waist grabbing a handful of flesh
again
our president now is joan crawford
are are democrats really going to permanently send away one of our ablest warriors to being a waste grabber
he didn't drive off a bridge and lever to drown can we get some perspective

because every infraction no matter how small has to bury rehash for an entire lifetime that's not politics that's marriage
yeah
you know when you're a politician being touchy feely is kind of part of the job campaigning is literally cold pressing the flesh have you ever met joe biden it's like meeting a great danes smells bacon on your clothes

some guys just aren't good at hugs that's why i always take pictures like this

and here's me sitting
we can have me too and al franken they're not mutually exclusive it's time to get our off the bench so we could come back to doing what he does better than any other democrat taking down right wing blow hards i
si how franken debate donald trump and by the way so you are right
i guess
jim carrey and jack ryan

so it was not a good way for him near the woodward book is actually called fear in the bookcases trump is a congenital wire was having a nervous breakdown and three amaro said how come nobody believed me what i wrote the exact same book
he's got some amazing stuff would where does that he says that one out of the white house like trump wanted to assassinate assad the dictator and syria which of course is against the law in america we don't assassinate people
okay
they that we have been quite a few years gets really didn't make a law against it but trump said apparently according to bob woodward quote he says saad but and kill
let's do it let's kill the whole book and lot of the
in fairness he said the same thing about nordstrom
at least at provided that question i've always had want to be like if sunny carly own read america
trump is getting it's possible more unhinged he said yesterday that there are pictures of robert roller and james komi hugging and kissing
lindsey graham said can i save him

we checked there are no pictures of call me and butler hugging and kissing their friends that's his big thing called these best friend is moeller so what they were colleagues for decades they were both the fbi director
batman and robin or friends doesn't mean the penguin isn't a rock

but of course to trump fans they don't care about any of this stuff that's reality
what they care about is nike put out an ad defending colony capper neck so right wing patriots now have you seen there's they're burning their neck they're burning issues they call that owning the liberals that will teach them burning our own clothing

it's like the boston tea party instead of t v threw themselves in the harbor

the all right you know the people who marched in charlottesville there especially mad about this but nike's trying to win the back with their new air hitler's
but this guy is hard to pin down brit governor and you've seen him he said he's not allowed to give opinions on politics you have to give his opinions on current event not allowed to give you his opinions on legal matters

welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him

have you found that your philanthropy is more effective wouldn't an independent of government programs
i think notes that if he needs to be focused on getting government programs
work better
right right
the money comes from the government we gotta make sure it does really well something's only government could win world war two and i think only government can solve the environmental still think that something
you think about your fellow billionaires are want to go to bars
fucking stupid
anybody say my racket
we're going to be out
you gotta do is they a
good at it
okay
will anyone in this administration ever be held accountable for the separation of immigrant children and the abuse they are enduring well accountability is a tough thing to come by lately but
i hope so
probably not
now and it's fine it's appalling and that it is suddenly politically courageous to come up and say that that's a bad and babies in cages are really really disappointing
good girl and a grandson and then what's your advice richard clarke to the next person how to respond to russia is ongoing attacks with you had your old job so there's a building in st petersburg call the internet research agency which is in fact a front for the russian intelligence service so it's world are trolls and that's where all that old and middle
a lot of them are and they're still doing it every day
i would fry every computer in the building we have the capability really yeah we could do that tomorrow with a portion of about tomorrow we will so why don't we do it because they'd replace them the next day maybe but i'd feel that i wouldn't they do too
they're already doing pretty much everything they could do to was there in our power grid there in the pipeline controls and if they're if they're in our power grid couldn't they couldn't they freeze or computers to now they can yeah there's a corner
i'm asking for a friend
yeah
oh
we can't be to what do you know by computers
right forty three
okay
he recently held a shareholder meeting steve for american taxpayers you think the government should run like a corporation that's interesting because when people elected troubling
business
this is more than much the gun
i think we should have
the as we need somebody who's got the discipline in thinking things through in knowing numbers in using data were not trying to maximize profit or exact i bleed and balancing the budget but it's not all about that it's about the outcomes and using numbers and being
systematic and with usa bags we welcome anybody in my country to use our data i mean politicians when they run for office they always write a book
dishes and that's my platform seems like usa facts data is a much better platform that a dumb book if you wanted to run you could say this is i've already done the work i already know what to do it to have sex america and i'll tell you something we just finished up called the state of the facts poll we go out and paul and stuff americans
want the facts
gotta you get that out more and looks a lot
that pretty funny
values they wanted spell say we want to start united you don't want to be opposed to here i want to stay married i like like like it
want to stay where you know my wife doesn't
sure to put it this way
you'd probably do more and stayed married to my lovely wife to him
i'm thinking when you're saying is the fact that i need to start talking louder because they can
i don't want to be the quiet bordeaux
just going off your your great i wouldn't change a thing but but what happens when you have these objective political pull it effect like things is that whenever something comes out that one side disagrees with republicans think that a lot of fact all these things or the congressional budget office or oh it's partisan
what do you say when the inevitable that things partisan because they don't like the numbers comes we don't make forecasts
forecasts are partisan what happened happened what happened we know how many people are covered by health here i won't predict which goes forward we know how many people died in a what age last year we won't make forecasts for kids and be partisan the history she's we can't even look back and objectively say that is what happened accept it
what we need to i got and there's more to say you can add your own opinions but you can add your own facts and we know what happened and i'm getting at is disgusting when people to just ignore their number like

how the clippers going to do this year and we're going to win a lot of games that's a forget

a final question as he cup do you regret your right in road for paul ryan in two thousand and six day
take to do
yeah
not voting for my party's nominee i don't regret that and i'm chance on that all the time and yeah of course
i don't regret that with every day i and true then i think right in that in that for me it was not for me
don't really help now it did it
there is only it were me is only two parties only into people running it seems like i couldn't adults are either but i can tell my sign in twenty years can agree with that either awful oh yeah
yeah hillary was going to be anywhere near as bad as trump worth while i can't forecast by she was a terrible terrible can't candidate yes not president would she have been a terrible president i think remains rate based on past it close to how terrible trump is well that's a high bar okay
so i'm sure people make assessments and one thing is always better than the other isn't the irresponsibility and to pick that out hold your nose and do the right thing i did not think one thing was
now they're really seem trump for almost two years and you think hillary could have possibly been this bad
in different ways yeah i think she could have like what like what would she have done that when the magnitude
relax i didn't vote for either i know and that's the problem but where i don't know
when i voted for nader i copped to it i said i was wrong
you believed that i don't believe my was sorry okay but know i'm just asking you what hillary hillary have possibly done that that would be as bad as trump has been i think that she's deceptive and on accountable and ways that people don't condone
don't don't know we have that now it's awful but not really as deceptive and you can judge that you can inspectors to do is told five thousand why i don't regret not voting for okay
that question not even not about you have stood up to my whether a glorified thank you everybody
we had a night

yeah hurricane floor and it's been downgraded that's the the good news but still hundred and thirty mile an hour winds you say it's spinning faster than sarah walker be sanders
the religious folks they were has come to play with americans don't they pat robertson said today this is erica it is god's punishment for stormy daniels breaking the terms over a non disclosure

yeah transferred to another week proving how president show he can be as usual the victim in any disaster is him
he spent most of the week talking about hurricane maria the one a year ago in porto rico which was it an incredible songs
success
three thousand people died he says the death toll was exaggerated by democrats to make him look bad
that's his thing with the democrats they make up things they make it's all they do is they make up things and who knows more about makeup and donald draw
every game trump hate is a big hoax
democrats made up about an hour
big hoax the climate change is a big hoax
the inauguration crowds doubting that was a big hoax everything he has no the mother investigation is a big dogs the female orgasm a plot against me

and then to round out another fantastic presidential week and nine eleven he traveled to pennsylvania with milan ear for a memorial service and shanks maloney a marquee event with a moment of silence that began when the hollywood access tapers released and has continued up
and did you see that he walks over to a crowded his drooling idiot fans this is on nine eleven the most solemn day we so we commemorate the deaths of all these people vote

welcome to l h b a pipe pass from h b o maintenance real time
okay

that was
computer miss the show itself
air the course
what walked out about for sure
michael moore
the momentum progressive figures like better work or andrew golem and red state demonstrated the democratic party needs to move further left in order to win
of the party does to people are already there the majority of americans take the liberal position on nearly every single issue seventy percent what medicare for all eighty two percent believe when shooting a the same as man
run the whole as climate change everything
where liberal country
and we win by three million votes and we won six the last seven presidential popular votes
republicans the one only wants in thirty years but i will add at which they don't want it like you say something like medicare for all american people who do want that majority i didn't know it was up to seventy but day are absolutely one hundred percent clueless about what things cost you have no idea when they ask what should we cut oh yes let's cut we spend too much what your because they say
you need to cut foreign aid that's part of what and its are young and english i see yeah but the budget i said the pedestrian i interviewed for this he said
why couldn't you just say free college well we did say free community college in the work that and i should know what though that's how we lose elections do what they do see free college yeah but we haven't forgotten how we're going to pay for it he cares

you're going to pay for it
later and and as thing that democrats need to move left is such bullshit i mean as you said michael my fellow misha gander
the people are here with
what we're talking about is the democrats moving to the center to america and
yeah well that a bar there except for all those that want to kill you
well
the thought well it's a large base going to blow bubbles a big stones i know i you know noisy no no that's wrong we don't want to kill that that's what makes us net world
really erosion of all the blood would be like bad
second wait here's the thing when we're back in charge or should i say if i'd like to believe when we're back in charge here
people watching other voted for trump when we get medicare for all where you're going to be covered to when we don't go into the next war we won't send your children off to war either be that's that's you get the benefit from all the things we're going to fix climate change you'll get to live now
going to go
trump promised that he talked about universal health care that's why they talked about know that
and then he handed over the policy to the same old republicans in congress yeah but the reason i won the primary because he was not like all the i swear it's an issue now and he was saying shit let's let's just put out let's just put out the slogan that's getting get the knots voters because we kind of sao republicans do that and they will it and then
caught the car and they didn't have a plant and it's still there and he's not going anywhere
i think democrats be better than actually going to take an exam and i don't want to be better anymore when a when i went

and plan for this accent the point remember what drums healthcare plan was what he was running something terrific
we're going to replace something to that he died on that first six months and then he said i'm going to give you health care that's better
better cheaper and covers every available no regrets from your example i mean i know what i'm saying
that's what people were exactly remarry vote for where they were only thing a big difference is that once we say it were actually smart we're not stupid and we will actually work to try to get people those things will fail at some of it but at least the democrats are going to start aspiring that i don't think in having a here to do it in never going to win
one side plays by route
the other side i don't give up on having serious idea that can be executed agree with that but they do have that just getting into after a your execute well and that's not going on it out you know i'm glad to have no serious idea when it comes to things like how medicare for all that work for failure on etsy you look at bernie's man or know no i agree
made no sense and your idea yeah arts majors is then we don't know math
any get somebody let me guess
few other questions
steve out and given what you now know would you advise david cameron you are an advisor to former prime i was a and i liked him a lot of british conservatives are not crazy conservatives like in this country
one thing that's really worked very hard at that yes
maggie that you would you advise david cameron not to hold to the bricks and yeah i i did actually advise them not to do that
but i had a different view which you probably wouldn't agree with which is that rather than having a referendum which i was certain would be divisive and end up in a mess
better thing to do is just be to say clearly in an election in your platform we think we need to leave the u because we believe in democracy we believe that people that make the decisions in a country should be accountable to the people and the use it on account of bureaucracy that's what we believe so that's what we're standing on rather than leaving this open question when no one really knew what would happen
the end of it if you to put it in your official party program you could have developed a plan and a policy and you wouldn't have this mess that's my job
okay was hoping to be a little more bloody them
i know i'm going and get it okay tom thomas far right media personalities just alex jones and tucker carlson game
are they gaining influence or losing it
to good question
a lot of it has to do with the platforms you've got most of the radio stations this country owned by corporations that have an explicit and over right wing bias you've got a television network created by a billionaire who did this in two other country did this to to other countries before you get our country and and you know last one hundred million dollars a year for the first five years
major investment air america lost seventeen million dollars all you know it was terrible thing
they are willing the conservatives are willing to invest in infrastructure you get his entire teams of people who are just scrubbing wikipedia all day long and behalf of right wing i a ball and and it just goes along the lot of of trip for the others are crazy conservatives are much more interesting when you're crazy they come up with lego england owns comes up with
great little green men things
alex as a performer yeah and were as if you liberals go crazy it sounds like npr i don't know i can do
i think
a couple of things are just to say that you really can't put tucker carlson in the same kind of know that
he's i didn't really a second thing is that again from the other side of the fence people would say we've gotta have days because because the rest of the mass media is so dominated by the other argument it's just the best dance again bullshit the rest of them as many is dominated by effects well that's
right wing infrastructure because there is an affinity that's your opinion
through that whether it's not opinion show it
it's not exactly in light of the article written by this is for you
written by reagan's daughter patty davis how do you imagine that is very few hundred he said she was sexually assaulted okay how do you imagine leader oh i see
how do you imagine the cabin organization would be handled at the accuser work conservative woman rather than a liberal
i think we kind of already saw this happen weren't some rhyme his alleged victims conservative
yeah i think so they were that's my recollection rat
and what happened why it's bad people rallied around the yankees child molester
right now
he was in their party he was he had had a little our next to his name and and oddity we have a democratic senator alabama where it's just shows and anything's possible if your opponent folks children

jack

right




why
because
marriage
were three republicans found a little backbone this week
we are going to have an investigation
bring the investigation by the the i was going to last week so put that on your fucking calendar

the two ladies in the senate the republicans and just like of arizona
they this
it has turned around because he was confronted when he was getting on the elevator
what better that
who had the good that you're you're telling me right now
me when you're telling me that i thought that it matter

that guy take it in the elevator like that
fiance say sister kick
oh
oh and then they tried cornering lindsey graham but but he got away because he's familiar with the back door


republicans up a lot of trouble with sausage party a republican
so you don't they did they hired a female prosecutor to ask the questions to professor ford
a mobster thinks there's a bomb under his car he makes his wife started
they're doing
but her testimony when someone's being real
shows it reads even conservatives had to admit it was compelling and credible it was so compelling and so credible during a red cabbage tried to turn up the music that

but this was a very different bread cabinet he came out swinging like his penis at a college party
well that's that's that's why there's a sexy happened so fast in this last week remembered the beginning they would get a second accuser
also rather credible who said this was it yeah
he was at a party there and she was drunk and he dropped his pants in front of her and exposed themselves i mean imagine you open your eyes and seeing that dick
and then he pulls out his penis


this was a totally different bread cabin on than the one tested running like a week before totally different angry volatile bitter belligerent because nothing says i'm not capable of violent assault like flying into an unhinged rage
good
it gets that supreme court will now be a bookish law nerds and the hulk
but really if that was a divorce hearing she would have gotten the kids that's how i

why did cabinet suddenly act that way because trout
told him to
trump didn't like that he was being make and you no good bread he likes bad bread he wants someone in his image so we gave him a whiny little bitch lasted

know what we have the evidence is year book and everything this choir boy yeah cabinet know
i split my high school years concentrating on my my friendships and church
that church you know what defense doesn't work so great any more i can't be a sex criminal i'm a catholic

it's like saying i couldn't have met russians i was it trump tower
going out about it as many friendships with women is helped many women and supported them and help them with their careers
and he also says he's a big supporter of me to in fact when someone is ordering drink your he says give me too

i don't know if we could say he is definitely a rapist i think that's too far but is a fucking liar and a drunk
definitely
but even in this testimony he mention beer all lot
lot i like their do you like beer i just finished be are you have any
i thought he was going to write out on a clydesdale
half of this year book entries
drinking getting shit stacey
didn't keg club and rounds club and gets on the court skip the rope give them a toga this guy
but he might not might not get on that's at least a glimmer of hope

wait you can look at kids in the eye and say america is not a country that puts a predator on the supreme court in the white house sure but not theirs

looking good for nail the grass tyson

i know you're not for this guy but be nice it is one of the most influential person around today is the former white house chief strategist for president trumps stay ban and his own

well it took a lot of property they get the audience to be that nice
but i'm going to say to you what i always say that conservatives when they come here first of all thank you i appreciated it says while humans why the republicans are in power and we have none hillary clinton never came here maybe she'd be president of and more consonant victim yet so
and i know that
you had a little event there at the new yorker they had a festival and don't want to read mouth i'm glad bowls quote because they were going to interview you and then you are disinvited i've been disinvited many times by the way it's a good club
and malkin glad well said call me old fashioned but i would have thought that the festival of ideas boost to expose the audience to ideas
the only invite your friends over it's called a dinner party what are your thoughts on that while they changed me for david remnick chase me for a year to be honest pond kiss and he came to me and said hey we be honored if you were in this festival ideas i said fine i don't want compensation but i like going in the hostel audiences with tough interviewers i mean i do very little concerned
median do c n n b c
the economists i go to the toughest places tough as tough as interviewers and say hey no holds barred roster audiences let's get it on and again that's why the republicans are in power so let me ask you about a does sharp and sharpens the blade it does let me pick your brain about the democrats because you're a strategist and you got your boy elected but no one said that could happen
second sofa like that
just just showed up
you know and i don't want to get on this but first you were crazy about sarah palin and then you are crazy but donald trump i think you look for more ons who are empty vessels

every single person and it administration has called in an idiot
that's what you look for i get it no
by the way by the way it's will get into as you get into his economic war china it you see what he's doing to realign the world's economy look that it didn't go to harvard kennedy school does he speak in the vernacular of the elite to this world know he speaks in a very plain spoken vernacular but he's incredibly small hideous i'm not it's not send texts that i'm worried about
his press conference this week he says crazy shit that no one thinks is true you don't think but now but here's the power the press conference no other gutless republican would go into that lion's down for an hour and twenty minutes and take all the incoming he stood up for calvin i'm more than a these guys did and i think it's one of the things that and power
kavanagh to go into on thursday and to take on the democrats have trump had not done that
the way he did have some he did have some answers that we're not the standard answer is but look he's got he's got know of has a standard on it's about reality he has his own how divorced from reality

they must have done your nail digress their work and are you do to fight against the anti intellectual movement in america i i blamed some of that on the the attitude that so many intellectuals had towards those who were not as smart as they were
we have a long history of just smart people discounting the views and opinions and feelings of those who are not as well educated and that can really piss off an entire demographic so at least eyes and educator i try to not distinguish one for i just bring everybody with you together to empower
their critical thinking that they're other people don't wanna learn know you have to admit you sound like the teacher who say be students don't want to learn rather that in your own teaching habits as failing okay
you can't let everybody off the hook it's like everybody's a good person and try harder with them i mean i i don't i can't as an educator i can accept
donald trump something you know i can
i mean that's that's because it's like guys and dolls and tibet
anybody
don't bet you one thousand
not teams donald trump that the stealth bomber is not literally invisible
wilmington at least of all people are thinking that then teacher is handing someone information to replace information that they had that is false correct and aspect of teaching but it's not the fundamental dimension of it it's getting a person to understand why the
thoughts are wrong to begin with and then it's their own epiphany good luck
yeah i don't think he's not going to have an epiphany because anyway
i would say doubt
innovations in science and technology are the engines of tomorrow's economy
and they will drive our health our wealth and our security if you invest in science
that will be the country that you always wanted to be here say that's one the abolishing obama
yeah that's the forest and the thought about me yeah
it's not anti intellectual as and i think it's anti science anti empirical true fact that they hit the major danger because because
what science is and how and why it works were taught is a sexual effects and spit it back in the test and you move onto your next class science is a way of carrying the world it's a way of knowing what is true and what is not and establishing the objective reality in which we
almost function if you don't have those capabilities and you but gain power oh my gosh it's the beginning of the end of uninformed democracy here is a large chunk of this country that is not
interested in objective reality again
and then not critical thinkers as well and you have to release them winning in our and sometimes i watch out
oh boy
i have landed on
he just says bellies and okay
one of my two books
that are on the best seller list right now has been on the best for seventy one weeks
having tide waters of trump books that have come and gone how can i get my god i can be
science book on that so that gives me hope somebody cares about it

how many copies because of the solar cell it's highly variable so just about how many copies
scientology best yeah i know the total number is not what the hell me how many copies the book has in total yeah a million can change a million know yeah have a country of three hundred and twenty million okay so it's still not a lot of other people meaningless we were other people in other countries read english yeah i know but
we're talking about america
i want to showcase kind of sixty translations also and i don't a well but it doesn't about america
it is in a sea of trump books they come back and forth should be going to talk about popular books it's sitting there in the middle of one words book on fear and and at all there's always a small percentage of people who will be bright but million
i'm like in the number million yeah i like it too but it's one three hundredth of the country
april ryan
now the science that was man
do you think we should bring back the equal time rule yes
yes and what is that equal well first of all let me break it down in science
hi my brother
so say
are you a that tender line on
oh okay so cellphone for you so those of you don't know i remember when president trump the in canada trump was calling on morning joe when he liked joe sky as i do either
her other networks while you didn't hear the other candidates colony they could have because the equal time rule is gone it's gone
yeah if he if he they can have done it is well if there was a will if there was the world still in effect right
president trump would be on they would have to give be equal time to other canonized that is no longer effect and that's one of the reasons why do you want down shot one that free advertisement
each other then he only my question is bill why didn't the other candidates have the chutzpah to go in and say around and let me do that it was a scan donald trump played the streets on he won and you're right they were into this does down there are were for this this is not how sit for the plane the street game
wow
evelyn how should america deal with russia post trump oh my god
if there is a post drum i mean i think the way that his administration that is to say everyone that hand and our government is it didn't address that yeah it is firmly spelling out to russia that if they continue with this really horrible behavior you know invading other countries occupying than messing with our elections continuing to mess with our sense
poisoning and killing people in other countries
munich i can gone on it there's a list of like twenty things if they keep doing all that stuff but mostly are kidding man mostly our election and much were america and ukraine and happy but i don't care as much about ukrainians i do about fucking with our election i'm windsor major that's like way up here and then the rest
sorry about the coin
that's a yak on our country yes but ukraine is also an attack america and is max's as it's an attack on the right of a country to say i'm a sovereign country we sovereign ukrainian people want to be associated with nato and the european news and the west and we want to be democratic and we don't want this guy in the kremlin telling us how to live our lives
you know the answer to your question as wouldn't and troops for it but we should be stronger and we didn't occur to train them and i think so where do we do so we need to do more of the from stuff because they won't cooperate with us until we are sufficiently across the board consistently from all the way up to the president was cooperating russian and american ass
astronauts in when they should get the current
they got the orange out
they will see okay claim without casualties are going
over there threaten the flow
i will tell you that i can't go too far on this
email or that
dr needle
them that they aren't they are that it is a troubled world up in space with russia and china i'll just leave it goes base station is one thing and commercial space is one thing to lead morality into the future
jos joke
yeah
max what do you think people are fascinated why do you think people are first and that with doomsday just dopey and futures lot i mean i think there there's always this fear especially in america because i think there's something very deep about our isolationism and were always remember we most of us came from someplace else
and we escaped a lot of us escaped hardship our ancestors escape hardship to come here and there's always a subconscious fear that what we escaped will one day find us and i think that's why there's always this terror particularly because when times are even good you have an explosion of post apocalyptic movies tv
video games so many movies about after the bomb went off right and it's horrible and scary because it is a movies do come true it's always there and if i can go back to what you said about russia i think something happened recently that we need to be very aware of is that the russians just rioted because couldn't
raised the level of retirement when you can retire i think it was sixty five average russian man dies at sixty six and what that did is it exploded the myth that russians will be able to sacrifice for the motherland and pay any price and that's been the idea that oh no no we can take the pain
russia will be invincible and that's bullshit we can hurt them we can make them bleed and the russians have been fighting in the gray zone they've used economic warfare information warfare cyber warfare we don't do any of that we used to do air right and it's time to get back in the game and it's time to make i've bleed

their state and educated religious nuts and with the alleged doubled down on them
what all like larry the cable
this guy is a cracker even for alabama
the same way that trump is an asshole even from new york
so the plan is then eventually every state is going to be represented by the person who best embodies what everyone in america hates about that state like california will be represented by a waiter who didn't wash your hands after shooting for
and
texas
united by a car with a gun rack
trump unveiled his tax plan which includes repeal of the estate tax which has caused so much hardship for america's most vulnerable millionaire
and then airtime says the tax plan is a windfall for a hedge fund managers corporate executives and real estate developers and could raise taxes on the poor and the middle class

welcome to h b a passed from h b o maintenance real time with him
i have a
carbon trump works the supreme court and workers are christian forward barbary i don't know what happened and nineteen eighty two here's what i do know kristin for it was attacked by someone bread cavanaugh will lie about anything
that's what i do know now she testified first year period before the happy acres assisted living
otherwise known as the senate judiciary committee
bread cabin or defense that was high school
college and law school
the nineties and yesterday at lunch but other than that
only attacked women when he was drinking which was always but that
doesn't ring true this choir boy routinely as he went on fox news this week with his wife and said that he graduated high school he said a virgin and was a virgin for many years
and his wife had a look on her face like that explains a lot
visit us and i love this he saved his calendar that alone is psychotic had an opportunity to guide the supreme court or saves a calendar from nineteen eighty two
to prove that he didn't do it get going to say on the calendar tackle woman that part

bread cavanaugh keep saying all these accusations you said twilight zone much as big code word it's twilight zone
yeah everything looks pretty black and white

of course trump had to weigh it she said if republicans nominated george washington the democrats would vote against it and then trump said watch your did add some accusations
yeah but they involved a cherry tree
he said the accusations against bread cavern are all falls and a big fat con job and who knows more than trump but women faking thing

what are the people who asked admitted his press coverage you other day how does the fact that you mr president have all these women accusers effect
decision about brett cabin on his accusers and trump said i was accused by the for women
well actually it was third change
or chain if you counted bunker

and of course the other big news is right bill cosby is in jail
seven
three to ten years for a sexual assault which at least in our courts is still a thing
and cosby's mug shot the guy he took admitted purposefully blurry you said that's what you look like to women

barker

okay
how would link and have handled today's republican party were first well i must say i always hated it when republicans go where the party of lincoln artist change their whole dynamics and it completely slipped station they should be forced to drop that we're the party of like that's not at all the same party right now it is not the same party but i must say yes
listening to you tonight it made me so good after this an acrimonious week to laugh tonight
really important to have that lincoln used to say away whistle off sadness to humor he was able to tell funny stories he i don't see a sense of humor in our current translating i mean so narrowly missing element but i mean they were looking at you when laughing with a
what
what if lincoln we're here today what he would be talking about is how to reconcile these different parts of the country we can't let it be that other people are different from us and we don't care about what they're thinking and feeling we have to remember that a majority of the people want an inclusive country they want immigration they were like medicare they want to education they want mobility they want the law
lack of inequities to be dealt with it and they care about a healthy planet very lucky
yeah
like those things go out and vote you're so right power begets power i spent president trump is not expand that his base it's still in the thirty percent so we don't have to be so upset about this if we can do something about look more people are running for office and now the young people are excited more women than ever before take part in that and get them to the polls get them

jeff should be governed be doing more to ensure that kids facing hunger or able to get access to food oh absolutely
you were government can really
him now i've had been working with on the hunger issue for over thirty years
i've had wonderful success by not going up against the fear though lobbying there
but working with the governor's they seem to be a lot more into the people there were a lot of people are we lot of use governors don't know that there's a billion dollars of federal funding
on their table
programs in place to do while he was hungry kids but if they don't have those programs in place and well it's the same thing with medicaid expansion they've got lots of money on the table from the federal government in obama care the republican governors chose not to use that money the why again liberal tears because it was
costing them anything
what what it feels to me to be like will sort of mergers democrat but it's kind of conservative feeling to go more local will look
more of them and that's what i'd bring up about shoreline environment rather than waiting for those guys i mean you definitely got to do you voted for sure but engage in another way
we have another whole powerful way of engaging in all these issues
personally i don't say i'm going to both for the guardian
you made your vote now i can feel guilty i've made my
engage in a all right i mean all the changes in our society have come when it percolate from the anti slavery moment the women's movement the civil rights movement that progressive moment it's the citizens and let's make it and then the leaders channel with it you were talking before about government forces leaders that we can't be so waiting for the leaders we have to take the responsibility i shall we
are the citizens of

several in the morning and i saw this woman who said something really interesting because it seems to me that passions will looking were looking for people to be passionate about the environment
and she'd made from a really that interesting observation you should punish him is the flame that comes from been some sticks together you can get in there and get into it and chewed up and you know that you have we have plenty of passion right now but it's the wrong kind of passion
it's a passionate an intense hatred well it's the other luxury them
i mean i wish i could be as helpful as you it when you when you look at the rhetoric right now it seems very similar to me to the rhetoric of the eighteen fifties early eighteen sixties in which people are talking about the other part of the country as if it were another country
when people and we will prefer to be run by a foreign agent in rather than we would buy a democrat yeah we're at a point where the discourse has colonel to such an extent that it can lead especially now and again
if the legitimacy of the system continues like you are talking about the popular vote issue in the electoral college presidents elected gerrymander if this continues we could have a real legitimacy crisis in this country where people will actually turn to violence
and you can see it beginning you can see it people wanting to vent this anger in a sense of in the streets or by going up against people in the elevators or and breast or you can see it keeping up with nine targets little tired or equally need to have a constitutional amendment and citizens united we have to overturn that would to
state everything and you do that you triggered the other tribes even greater and greater levels of passion that's the problem well then we have to have the passion that's equal to that
i feel like
bucky fuller and the thing that really makes a lot of sense as far as what we're talking about his shoes when you want to change something
you don't have to go against issues come up with something that makes what you're trying to change obsolete
don't spend all this energy this anger anger you can we can we can shift get involved with how we see you have to talk to each other i mean nothing
lack of communication and when i was saying earlier in solo you thought it was absurd i think when i look at the meter and a certain way because i'm still basically right of center i see and hear things that you may not see in here and when i say that i'm hearing those things it's useful for you to say i hear you as opposed to it's absurd caption what a marriage counselor
what
countries are man
you know what i read an interesting thing i think it was from are sometimes spread glenn greenwald saying that gonna miss nbc they get ratings every segment
okay i'm a minute by minute
no guess they're called the minutes you're going to rock and downs are were minutes you can follow where you lose your boat or right okay so who on m s n b c is ever going to risk their show by saying something that doesn't exactly with what the audience already once in a year and think so that's kind of a hermetically sealed bubble to it's just one with a lot more facts where they usually on the right side of issues
but not the whole time know and sometimes you and this framework for example oh sorry to say about race or gender the right really upsetting a lot of other people in the country you're in this who you not
can wouldn't say that to that base and i can i can be agreeing with them and go oh for fucks sake and turn it off really
everything is like what is a curse you're so right
what a surprise
we're all communicating online and on screens and that's a very different experience when you're talking to someone looking at their eyes and face and body language and where you actually do you have to accommodate them a little bit david jolly are you going to follow other principal conservatives and go democratic and the murder
sorry for you david jelly
so i love that question because i came out in october of last year and said i think democrats take the house
will be safer and a divided
everything we've talked about barack obama talked about a post partisan america but he try to do it through a two party system
i left the party about five weeks ago

between the two parties and i'll tell you the inflection point we're expecting our first child
and among adults

what
always gets a look at
oh gets his own perspective on what i would say is on a shirt among adults we can have the republican on republican side nearly three years ago i stood on the house floor as sitting republican member of congress and called on donald trump to drop out of the presidential race and i have never lost my voice i have never gone silent as all of my republican colleagues have none of their tough because people were
either way your parents are probably republicans yeah it look it's incredibly tough but here's here's what i will tell you i hope our daughter learned to things from our example the first is for three years we thought of sight for something we truly believed that the republicans could answer to better angels but the other less and i hope our daughter learns is this there are fights
that at times wiser men and women walk away from and this is a fight and then you're going to start know somebody else can fight know that dignity the republican party out and i find those two parties are democrats and the traitor and it's not a big
i often read that paul ryan quote where he's got on tape behind closed doors saying good somebody else is know to republican to i think on couldn't pay level mccarthy record these are the new republicans on pollutants payroll or
and rural backer and paul ryan doesn't go oh my god what's go to the f b i he goes okay
doesn't mean i'm living on her saying to tell we know where i mean that's true it it
solid that i had a question for you well i'm is why why don't they use our like like chick flick he's actually one most powerful people on earth
he's a politician right now is retiring want to
who needs a job right and now he's going to have a nice cushy republican job
can i say that have been have a nice job like the look as isn't this more fun being with
when people get mad at me for doing tv as a call your congressman
but here's what i will tell you and this is something we have these academic and intelligent conversations about why why why why why at some point we get to judge little leadership integrity and the moral fiber of our political leaders and we get to say you made a wrong decision and leave and that's where we are right now and
no question
if or when roe v wade is overturned how should progressives respond who were with protection
you know i'm wearing a lot of
saddest things is here
collins talk about that as a non issue when you listen to her very long and tortured delivery of her speech today
to talk about you know i'm not worried about roe v wade and i think there are lots of people who are worried about roe v wade i think she's very wrong on that issue
i don't know i don't know what i don't know what the solution to that is but hopefully to motivate people to get to the polls
can i can i suggest something very big that liberals would actually be better off if bus way disappeared
because then they would actually have to go to the people and ask for democratic majorities and in fact they're all democratic our news in most western can now i nor is he going to get anybody for sure

so much
do you regulate should like a look
right now
finally
we're we're going to be completely free open your shirt if you
wow
okay
right could compose myself as well
fuck
it's a major what do you make of this strange relationship between trump scarborough in prisons
or morning news show called morning
good never
memorable i remember it
he antagonize in your president used to be friends right is that the deal and they became friendly accused her of being a bed face through it was that
i mean they were friendly and jokes
scarborough is accused of being too kind to him throughout the election when it really matter in terms of people taking him seriously at the beginning especially
editor
what you yeah they didn't become critical
sort of in a very emotional anything personal
and papers go from them were drove both i mean why the you jump started attacking men in a really vitriolic way you know even more than a year ago
that they had some kind of personal relationship with untoward in some way
and
and
they a couple yeah but untoward is that he would spend it on that he was suggesting that there was something going on that one knows what's going on
anyway because there isn't a sleep
hello filth
basically was vanity
like what became of that you know we've got to get to the of it
became very hurtful
and then as president he attacked her for having plastic surgery and claim incorrectly there were photos of this event that she was bleeding at marla so obsessed with that is nice
the iconography of credibility that it's actually true misogyny me
no he's he's a bad day you don't like it i don't like
surveillance on yeah absolutely
also i couldn't even
try to tell you
he
he had a birthday accused obama of not being born you
and then we saw diving and we were boobs okay
after obama released as versatile then trump when after his college records as a black i would be in college he's working his wife there his life
the best of then the college and then who knows what next so i said oh please the court and logical
in a way his mother not so believe
he understands how time works
least one time
time right
oh they are
america have any that can happen
get up with a renewed a little less regulation but
you get sued by trampling right let me finish our it so he offered
he offered obama of trouble for obama five million dollars is he would release his college records i know that itself is so ghost author the president it's vulgar vulgar
madeleine would easily anger man okay so i as a joke offered trump five million dollars if the could prove he was not the son of an orangutan big as we show
say
there
so
moron
then sued me too because he went into court with his burst or i made drunk produce his birth certificate busy such an idiot he as it was gonna say or to hang on
human to have a baby with it and so he sudanese with the five million dollars because he proved he wasn't in a result
the i can't even use i fundamentally misunderstood the theory of evolution
one of an hour
i i can explain much about married so stupid but he just to fuck with people and i think really you can look in so many things that he's done now in the white house and explain it i think our fucking that people which is not what you want a president obviously which is not part of fun thing to say it's just factual it doesn't mean i'm on a team is factual to
they don't
with him
it's not a team right let's not have to i'm sorry
team
don't have a team
reality and and other stuff
anyway
like i go with the whoever makes the most phones which is mostly the democrats not always harold is the democratic party moving to for a list
some parts of it are in define left but just sort of being unrealistic about what can get done democrats came out i guess was a few months ago with a plant call a better deal with help what our plan was a girl the economy and create more jobs and raise wages at all start a fire in it and it didn't really resonate really anybody i think we're gonna talk about growing again we're going to talk about protect
people's privacy this equal thing where people hundred forty million americans had their their data stone is a part got to stand up for that with the same time figure out how we're going to grow businesses grow wages and for that matter grow the economy and we can do it without taking from people we can do it
growing economy and we do that they will begin to get one pair to getting something that will resonate with more americans because something as much as we talk about this guy is out of out of control as he has on foreign policy and economic ideas he won the race it was nine months it seems like it was nine years ago was only nineteen months ago that he was neighbors installed as president with gotta understand we're now
going to win again just by complaining about him if he offers a tax plan would get a counter would a tax plan if he offers a health plan it's been we've got to offer health plan it's better i think what bernie sanders it around the single payer plan i like obama care i think parts of it a work and we've got to figure how we shored up and strengthen it to abandon it like bernie want to do right away it was the right thing
do and certainly not what the republicans propose doing so we got a ways ago will find our way there and be going to get russell brand help us article is over
what's required
i don't understand a word you're saying but i love listening to yourself
sounds to me some mistakes were made around the time of the boston tea party

welcome to l h b a pipe pass from h b o maintenance real time

okay these are the
what for you okay
great more top officials in the white house defecting and speaking out against him well
what a rush
the writing on the
next after the midterms when the democrat to take back control of the house and possibly the senate i think you'll see a great defection they'll be a mass exodus and everybody will be trying to fight or write another book or tell a story so i worry about who's after i mean
that that verse crew was bad but what
i mean like rex terrorist and you know i said that i could get wrecked religion back and there
chevron to have someone who could step in
okay going on is the us army justified in its decision do this charge over five hundred immigrant recruits in the last year well if you're talking about i think it's the end
program i think that it's just a it's frankly one of these things it's less a policy decision than some kind of administrative cock up in which they're just are a lot of different pieces to it but i have to know the specifics of the case involved i do think that when they're folks who don't pass a background check and what have you but i honestly don't know specifically what area careful on the show
the real atlas careful eddie is free speech on campus being stifled with students protesting controversial speakers i mean what about that part is political correctness that you can't speak on campus the home of free speech any more i think this overstated really
yeah you can imagine after milo spoke to her going to sell that he probably went someplace else and spoke without any any any incident you think about charles murray and middlebury probably while that what she did it and why you the next day without any without incident so if that were you can speak now no thousands what i'm saying there are thousands of lectures on college campuses
cross the ideological spectrum that happen every day without these incidents what you usually learned a lot about it i know that's because that's because it it's sensational just like you in your opening monologue you talking about the weather man they got a guy in the weather report when the wind was blowing and the people who were walking behind them casually sometimes we report about what
is happening our campuses in a sensationalized man
dave
how is your democrats address how badly they are polling with latinos
if there's one worry area for democrats in terms of november bets it right there
one of the issues there is it's almost more fundamental when we think of the latino vote often in the media in in politics we treat it is okay immigration and we think that is the major issue it's going to drive it and we expect it for democrats are going to get the lion's share to latino vote and yet
there's a recent poll it's said latino voters what is your top issue it was not immigration it was the year i went there to latino has identified as conservatives a quarter identified as republicans i think ryan had to pull their from a couple weeks ago they had trumps approval in one hitting forty one percent latino voters i've seen it between thirty five in forty one percent and also you have
historically low participation level lower relative to every other group out there among latino voters especially in mid term elections so if you're a democrat and you're looking at california texas florida couple other districts around the country were potentially will have to know though is going to make or break you i guess your biggest concern right now you got the suburban energy you got the money i think that
it's a big factor for them
rebecca why do so many liberals peg maloney as a victim rather than as a willing participant in a crooked family god i don't now
of
drives me bananas spring as there is such that sets an impulse to what i mean maybe it's about you know ever renewing hope for white women but maybe it's about that same impulse to think to to want to make a secret hero added some many next to him when it is so clear that milan yeah
these women are propping him deriving power participating part participating in the oppression and the destruction of the democracy and i don't know he drives me crazy
i loathe as much as
hope that the idea that money and some kind of secret agent in their resisting know she's she's as horrific as he with
republicans are still chanting locker up with trump rarely is it necessary for a democrat to publicly distance themselves from hillary clinton a ghost since clinton in order to move on from twenty six it's amazing the way they they do to tell
it a few was as if she was president
the idea that we could run away from the open calls to violent massage me by distancing ourselves from one lady you notice said they base out as it doesn't it is not about hillary it's about lock any of them up you said in your monologue and is dianne feinstein this week you know it's lock her out on her stanza stands in for a much bigger matter
for for when they want to do donald trump's political
just to turn a strength and weakness so when you look at the enormous enthusiasm you have on the left you talk about angry mobs right
turn it into something that looks scary and threatening us so that people will rally around it and that's part of what makes him so effective that's why reasonable to cut down all of his rivals in the republican primaries when he has our rival a clearly defined rival then he can be very very effective at trying to turn their strengths and weaknesses and that's why when
you have an actual democratic nominee that's the moment when he might become a lot more politically effective and he has when he does not have a clearly defined rival all that and he might just need a new channel leader and the i've attended to his rallies when we were on the campaign and there's a guy at the rally who lead these chance and he just might want to opera absolutely he just might need a
playlist instead of lock lock her up locker at they might need something to say by locked him out
the fact that we're talking about an american politicians saying lock her up yeah about anybody the american politician the most powerful man in the war in the world it's right it's so third world and there's so many books called basically it could happen here
surprise and grieving the also see populace politicians and pretty much all of the market democracies around the world who are gaining prominence this is not just a us phenomenon it's a global phenomenon and i don't think we're seeing the last of it i think we'll see more of it in the years to come right thank you everybody

welcome to age be a pipe down from h b o maintenance real time with him
you think it's fair to criticize democrats are taking money from our state
this is my feeling about that like take the money i mean it's already the
i think this whole thing with you a fee and they gave a big they're getting back the money but he gave for women filmmakers like keep it like where's it going to go to the board of company of already or failure
nearly like murray
james carville do think the democrat doug jones as a good chance to read roy more
yeah right
a rich guy is actually a blade and seven
stealing out
the for nine
you know you gotta people are okay dogs that foundation a writer and library for attacking them in any paid money to his wife when iran money they mortgage the building and down on them and gum rate to pay a lot so i don't know what are they are there are some people who believe that the bow
thou shalt not a whole thing up a even if we should and state
we believe that from the and they are you ok
need this post
the only true
the commandments are laws realm steel and don't kill which we can figure out on our own the other ones are about don't build a statue paypal of alabama think that washington made another thing that initiates then rom more right because not enough they've been watching more believes that standing to the anthem is against the law did you see that he said
it's the law
the edge of been put her in
and he said that voice command yeah
stamp
erik erikson do think steve that and will be effective finding candidates to primary congressional republicans finding more and
finding them to primary yes funny than the when i'm not so sure we've got the one who was in jail the one who believes in chem trails i'm not sure if the one who believes in u f o's is one of his
they may very well be some of the republican samples were guys and honestly a lot of the republicans that was guys i think deserve to be beaten because them campaigning in breaking promises got the base show pissed off that's what led him to burn the party down with drop so they deserve it but then they're going to lose to the democrats of the general election you run the felon or the chem trails lady they're not go
going to win the general the a lot of influence with those voters what do you tell them about i listen i said dildo for trot they didn't listen to me
what do you tell them about an issue like healthcare were like
i've read that many like the affordable care act but they don't like obama care
there were many them you know i think i probably have been saved by
trump called doble in the care of this week a disgrace which is such a disgrace to mean maybe you don't agree with that but it's not a disgrace and again james where are the democrats to sit and full throated ugly and say this is our signal dirt cheap that i can't do you know what pushed about every democrat eight against repeal and replace
okay the democrat
they pay a fit by what about they voted by i mean
what you want a democrat in order to talk about all the democrat
what do you a i'm saying
why is going to get you very far
in a democratic party they'll all come out and work at be that tax cuts create sharp fish as they do it just can't do that
you're a democrat you can't run against immigration can do it if he didn't he wouldn't be a democrat
the nature of who you are you can't believe that global warming is okay because you're anyone in your dna until you are it
they don't think that way they're still shooting that happened under the afternoon k and there's after that though thing they really trying to tell people that if you cut the state tax you going to grow the economy
can't say no no person and can say that but stayed maneuvering can say or to gauge the you pronounce his name
in have been a fair
what do you think of jeff sessions sending a justice to farm and lawyer to prosecute the murder of a trends teen in iowa
you know i just i i think
murray actually know because i find that essays yeah i wearing a stance and one would think well maybe this is interesting even as a change of heart which jeff sessions but i'm suspicious i'm curious i don't know why he's doing it this is a man who doesn't have a record of standing out for any individual's their rights and algae t americans and this is a man who advised me education department or ascend that
guidelines for and transcend our students and his and then somebody who doesn't believe it's a real thing that people have gender and it's mark yeah so i am concerned actually and because it down
on the surface to headline reads really well he's in rafting and maybe maybe they'll find out this actually wasn't really a hate crime or kind of intolerance
and i suspect that there are worse forces at play here
i go back to the thing about a democrat be the and
go think people are plenty appointed black people under the gun cashflow dollars people they documented dish
overwhelming the number of wires that they call that people don't care they don't care
michelle is why go back and look at how many special counsel independent prosecuted etc and gender are republicans are all of them because if a republican and done investigation of what you have a democrat and russia invaded but never it under investigation is that where you can have a democrat get and you know what all of the don't cry
establishment
editorial writers the commentators the everything oh yeah she ever why are they never a democratic independent couch ever
a look cause
we get except the back that they will raise hell and not pay attention to what a democrat
right to a point where you get that a point to say what we need to do is why as much as i do people running a lot of to had a size is not exactly equivalent to lying okay and or german the political right we're not talking about the policy
talking about next time when they target holes they always say people will say they trust the republican party more to defend this is their the daddy party and let's put a chip in that because you know when john kerry ran they went there i will put up a war heroes to they when they go there and we don't know
i great

right







relax receptor a scary time
i want you to relax
security sweep i've been assured there are no bugs of a bottle

got okay
the good the bad or said bob's pipe bombs through twelve people attempt this what happened in this country is an attempt to decimate the upper ranks of one of america's major political parties and it turned out to be is exactly what you thought and angry asshole in a red

he thinks trump is the greatest human being ever to live and of course he's from florida

and i could make a stripper
also strips experts
experts call this pic florida
now it gets worse lives and plantation florida
how is that still on a slave ship florida taken
okay so that we have a racist male stripper
a worked in a storm trooper dead
his name
is caesar say act like most most of drums friends he's white over fifty a registered republican and has a long criminal record
it is also bankrupt has a creepy then lives with his mom and
may and are ray named him loot water of the month
if
it's been arrested
eight times a terms battery for drug possession and threatened to bomb the van the creepy van he had had pictures of trump all over it make america great and then pictures and hillary and other democrats with their faces in cross hairs
is it ok to call this one deplorable

that hurt republican feelings because there's also a prolific hate twitter sometimes sending threats to democrats and he was frequently trump rallies where he was known as a moderate
now he's a typical trump loser blames everybody else because his life sucks that's who he is that the profile biggest supporters are always to a middle aged guy who's package doesn't work

ultra twelve with the bomb also i'm guessing it on a big believer in science
in his petition for bankruptcy and two thousand and twelve there was a handwritten note attached to it said that he lives with his mom and has no furniture
and we know whose fault that is eric holder and hillary clinton
why do you want to blow hillary yeah she's not in office she lost she has no power she's a gram bar
fact when the bomb squad was opening the package he said saved the wrapping paper

make no mistake what happened in this country this guy wanted to wipe out the top democrats in america all the major players got a bomb obama obama
obama by the clintons eric holder porch him kane is waiting by the mailbox

bernie sanders is you to stay but what am i chopped liver
anybody on trunk shit list got a bomb cnn dot on george soros john brennan robert deniro meryl streep was snubbed
nothing look
it's good yeah but i heard he was thinking about it and it's
done honor just to be and

trump is mounted the bomb or to not be good the bonding because it hurt his momentum he actually said this out loud would heard his momentum with the midterm election because before we were talking about like great care of the caravan of the seven thousand of these desperate honduran people who were coming
only about half now are still going if there's anyone left by the time they get here they should get a trophy i mean
if this was white people that would be on nbc sports
the iron man

he didn't need to get instructions from donald trump
he just went after everyone on trumps shiftless because he knew that's what that's what's expected and in a way that's what happened to you when you get busted in hawaii in hawaii i was thinking about my mind it on vacation
in ohio
because you know that person who was obviously gleeful to arrest you want nothing from called that cop and said do it they were just trump people and they knew what would rate so tell us what have and there was actually floor and the craziest part about as as it was when it
it was three undercover or he won my man and one male

fecal matter on a dollar bill than on a toilet seat i do now you're welcome

politically correct l a wants you to show us your to it
but what is not exactly
my my village in their faith and take the money and i know is normally if you happen to do that someplace where it's illegal they just write you a check at it's never it's something you get hall dense for a strip search
the officer shona or sheena correctly who took part in this road she send emails right after you got arrested giddy about it chocolate she said
you're welcome i work for vice now we arrested stormy this morning she's in jail
you know this is not death squad stuff but this is not what america is we don't target you had to go to jail we do as politically target the people we don't want and that's what we're seeing happening in this absolutely yeah
okay and brother where they said it was a long term investigation into allegations of human human trafficking foreshadow
like you are hiding refugees in your to it
right
back after this learned from
okay so let me ask you about donald trump now that we've got the important stuff out of the way
why did you fuck donald trump
you know i have no fucking a no idea why you thought
that kind of well he has a spell on a lot of people so i'm in
so it wasn't money now i was not paid here offered after now he never out to pay me but we never on foot
okay would you have accepted now know now i would have been like so if i know but you get paid to have sex on camera that i get paid not by the person i'm having sex when i get paid by the company to film it
technicality
yeah but a motorboat that
okay
yeah and look i don't want to think about drumstick anymore
the only one already have but i mean i mean i was the first package i got the first packed and sadly mine off


let's go right to the cooking said
but he didn't use a can now
but you are partners to that you let that happen
wealthy
i thought porn stars post a guard that's your moneymaker how can you run your rod though the sleaze bag like that
on
yeah i don't know to hard hitting interview
you said the
what you say it's not a me to it is not immediate what do you think the me to movement and they certainly could have thrown in with the no i couldn't because i would be a lie okay and the i wasn't assaulted i was an attack or raped or coerced or black belt and then i think that
the him moment and movement was a very important thing for opening the dialogue and it was very powerful
and i think that when i first came out i was telling people what had happened the truth that they tried to shove me and the need to box a friend on their own agenda and first at lining part of that but it's not the truth and i'm not a victim and that regard
birds more feminism but the most important thing is not a big from right you had the agency yes you did what you wanted yes and now you say
there's audience fuck somebody they regret
i'm that guy like many people
i'm showing it tonight so
but like at that moment where you said ugh in here we go here we go
the dutch like the greatest title for something
if somebody does not write a book about and you don't be like oh here we go i think to be my musical
the ago
work in a strip club
be able to think of a better way to monetize this been shaken your tits it
my intent

for the pc crowd loves to reprise i love it okay
okay so last question porn today
it's different than even where i think when you did it right shoulder i like i said you still doing it
but when you started right what year did you start with term thousand to two thousand do i don't think it's benign and you know i'm a pretty liberal guy but i don't think the porn is benign i think it's right be it's it's it's gross it's demeaning
i understand why this generation of kids is fucked up
that's what they're looking at on their phone when they're fourteen hour know i agree there some seriously
disturbing savage it's posted limit for sure but i mean all of it's not bad
i think there's a place for it and healthy relationships edge
a way to explore sexuality open dialogue
i'll always be a fan i think by just like anything there's there's good and bad in every industry and is it something that should be consumed a lot like alcohol or blanche
i think
make a buyer to make a good case that a good thing for america and i hope you have a good love thank you


hi guys
is trying to get it
it economists are the larger and post an author of the corrosion of conservativism why i left the right max boot
experts
politics
water an nbc sledge n b c contributor betsy wonder of great
communications director and or version and this the new documentary much which was on i tunes on the author of the book trump the blue collar president and that a scary remote

i know he only lasted eleven days when the job but i gotta i thought you did a better job than the other two they have doing it thank you i appreciate that will do everything my nickname rhymes with booing
tell the difference okay so we're going to talk about bombs and lies this week
with bombs i think what i saw this is the president on stage using a domestic terrorist attack to threaten the american media and my wrong about the because he treated a very big part of the younger we see today in our society is close by the purposely falls in inaccurate reporting blah
mainstream media must clean up its act fast that sounds like he's not condemning the bomber it sounds to me like he's partnering with him he is literally saying that shannon's fall and
got nailed upon your i'm not you're not stretching any of his words to get and sense that that's the point that he's making and there's a really i instructive comparison and i think we have to make little talk about this about a year ago bernie sanders supporter shot up a baseball field full of republicans and i was korea i was there at the baseball field that they're following the story and within hours early sanders
on the floor of the us senate decried it does about it so this is horrible i have nothing to do with us there cannot be a bigger contrast between how he handled that horrible catastrophe and now how toronto saying that it somehow sienna his fault that this crazy guys going after them it just couldn't be more so i don't think sarah sanders and actually said something truthful and
now she so the trump to so track could not have been more presidential and that's exactly right for donald trump you could not have been more presidential but that's a tragedy for the country because we actually do need somebody who was more presidential of he mostly massive opportunity here if you just expressed a little remorse for his own hateful rhetoric for calling them
media the enemy of the people for calling democrats traders and evil and crazy if you accept that a little personal responsibility people would have loved it you would have gone up in popularity but he just can't do it
smart
you got that i would you listen you can be loyal to somebody and you have to be honest about the situation you know i don't like to take advantage because it's like selfishness and self preservation and so you have to tell the true the max is making a point i tried to make the point in the white house which is probably why only last at eleven days
it was no reason to have a war with the media the first thing they did in the white house was turned the lights and cameras back gone because i believe in the first of men men and you have the whole people in power accountable
second
and the war declaration because here's what happens is both sides get fired up jeff zucker sent out of a missive and then the president sends out a missive and then sarah comes out and says something and it's totally unnecessary because would it winds up happening if you
like the president's some people may or may not but he has an eight to ten point head wind as a result of the bill city of this rhetoric meaning economy's doing well he's got a lot of things going correctly for the society as it relates to jobs job growth deregulation etc but this sort of stuff is now a battle between policy and you're saying this is how
helping him hurting and heard it is and eight to ten percent head wind blowing that is really depressing his poll numbers and preventing him from getting to a higher ground that he could get well and also let's be honest this is never going to get better because what he is asking the media to do is not criticize him see i said this week
ago the end diverse through it's all comes from this one trait of narcissism
this is a disease that we are not going to cure and as long as he as it it's not going to get better because the media's job is to criticize him especially now more than ever so that's going to keep going on and he's going to keep interpreting that as you are being negative to me and part of the reason that it's such a big problem for this particular
president is that she's obsessed with the media he probably get more cable news then
the average human beings they want to be number one was more races viewers have cable television and because of that because he's so obsessed with the way he's being covered and because he's been obsessed with for decades going back twenty was a real estate developer and he would call a tabloid reporters in new york to pitch them on stories because of that the media has a much bigger impact on his mental state
state and on any other typical president and that's only is op's adult and see also got this amazing sense of victimhood i mean i think crusades put it best when he said some our views both victim and victor and somehow even though he is president of the united states he feels like he was being picked up on he feels like he's the real victim here not the people who are getting bombs in the mail i mean war with them and
been on the campaign trail and seen him in action i see the little bit differently i think that he said these ingrained impulses that counterpunch maybe roy cohn matter somebody taught him that early on and so every aggression micro or macro aggression he's made a determination that were forty five years ahead five
times harder and it's war from bill you know but she's just isn't working for us
sorry for her

caring more about his psychosis
this is more real than having an observation caves but i was going to say that but this is an incredibly dangerous for this country to have an arsonist in the white house who is setting fire to our politics this is very very dangerous this is not going to end well and you know he may be doing and for partisan advantage but the disadvantage is to the country our politics or
what what happened to calling things terrorism i seem to remember the debate with obama mitt romney when they were all up his ass about you didn't say terrorism what she did after bad guys aires an act of terrorism but this isn't an act of terrorism and god forbid we yeah we unfairly maligned protect
mueller group based on the activities of alone well
listen to me i mean listen there's an opportunity here to pivot
i hope he does because of he pivots any dials back the rhetoric of a little help the country i think max to win arguments and not going to have he doesn't he's not have kids that are you serious

at age seventy three it's all going to click and reality
seventy at age seventy one he was using twitter better the most sixteen year old so and eagles and i'll remember anyone really turn on twitter i don't know how actually how i mean the reason why all of us are getting ahead and shadow ban on twitter is because he probably won the presidency well using twitter i won't he was very very effective with the you may not like what he was doing but the
whole point of my book is that the people that i grew up with happened to like he was doing i have not had an advocate in the last thirty five years in the oval office for the middle and lower middle class people and years you may as
but he disappears he is flying with an airliner he is why did he win why do you win all those are you live in collar people live because they don't bet on do it by policy people in this country are over policy they do it by of ceiling and i'll admit the axis of evil in this country is the media and it's helplessness to they're not super know shit had i raised genius at manipulate
bullshit in the needle in a three is immediate
here's a marketing blue collar people are some of them are races at well but this guy was don't of the elitist the right now he is saying that the ponderous of them are not the elitists are different don't think racism is what their problem is i mean he is a marketing genius but he has helped along by the fact that he has
no sense of responsibility or restraint he will stoop to measure is no previous president would have possibly snoop to in order to win votes and he doesn't care what the cost of the country as i heard you talk about
several shows have you said we want to say he's not like you know now will that's what other people did i mean that's what sarah is anders
i'm not i'm not i'm not a an apologist i know you are because okay
arctic and okay
kearney good self okay i call things as i seem okay i disagree with them on the child separation policy i told him that and a lower the flag at their john mccain i can come up with ten or fifteen things worried i don't agree with your one of the good ones
but i'm really trying to be going i'm just trying to call boy right i would go ahead man we've heard that before
the that went out to those here's reason you said you agree
he said we both know these telling lies i'm not happy that he's a liar nobody should lie but then you said but politicians happen to lot but you know you're a politician now so politicians lie when the lips are moving and so these people lie that itself is a lie because that is is trying to convince people will they all lie
he's in a field with others what can i just read what lies and it wasn't the point deal with that's where your quote no i understand that but the good lord of the quote in that are they what i what i was basically that's the part i'm interested

i mean this other thing was over the years bring you're trying to say he lies they all lie just want to tell you this one week no one that means i'm giving an apology for the line that's not what i was trying to do i was trying to explain to you what he is doing why embellishing those stories but it really worth stand to themselves
embellishing has a nice way to say be as anthony okay
why i'm not i'm telling you why he's doing it and i'm trying to explain why i'm going to beat them calling out call them out on yes
we shall call it okay i'm going i'm going to it was going on in the country okay i'm going to call out a few young was just so people know because there isn't an election coming up and maybe i can persuade a few this is just one week
housing argument for this election is lies on the scale even new to him they are a hordes coming here he calls this an invasion he calls this a national emergency these starving hondurans it's not a national emergency there's is a few thousand of them we took we stopped three hundred thousand at the border last year
he's say republicans are the ones who are for preserving the ban on pre pre existing conditions
when it's the opposite he's saying that the caravan had middle easterners in it
i mean i could go on he he's not disputing flax is disputing the concept of facts when asked about middle easterners in the caravan he said
somebody said there's no proof he said there's no proof of anything
no proof of anything but they're well could be
okay i made a list of things you can prove obama was born in hawaii see an end ratings are not way down climate is man made climate change crowd sizes can be measured
kavanagh didn't graduate number one from yale law school helium is lighter than oxygen
no proof of anything
has a point here
it's important to understand about trans and when he talks and the fans things is that he doesn't think about what he's saying in terms of truth or lie he thinks about it in terms of winning or losing and so he says what he thinks will help him win regardless of any any notion of re our connection in reality has and a really good example of this is very recently he had an old
bale that he signed a bill designed to help mitigate a horrifying catastrophe that's killing countless americans he said democrats largely opposed to opie bell that's not true it past ninety nine to one in the senate he's me only president who will try to pretend that he did it out bipartisan support their a major legislation and
because
and he wants to take this opportunity and are no know that's an incredibly it's an incredibly important point here to to refute what the news trying to say here which is that you know somehow politicians lie and he may be lies a little bit more know this is off the charts long this was a blizzard i watch it
because a lot of politicians lie a little bit for donald trump lying as the default mode according to the washington post he lies and average of eight times a day if he tells the truth it's an accident okay

calling him out on it
he's a lot like being the hall monitor in the elementary school calling them out on it just like elementary schools need hall monitor whether we should all the american they want to loose ends i really help you obviously want to beat ago and yes okay so if you want to listen i can actually cause i'm in saigon
what he is still in his use galvanizing his base he has figured out that by mechanized seeing these words the way he has and getting you have said and max of said and having ten people had seen and read the lies and the washington post has them to six thousand lives let's say ten thousand and one its record breaking any let's say fifty five
let me make the point and say it's fifty thousand what he's doing is he's got the volume up on something and he's made it a calculated bed that the people that are voting for him don't care about that and he's made a calculated bit why i said right
what you what is the alternatives
don't so all him out on the line say and the forty minutes thing he said all that doesn't matter what we want in a loss what do you say i get that but what is the alternative to not calling out lives we all live in a world where we're pretending what the mad king sees as we all say oh no he says the sky is an we don't call him out on that because he is
so what did his strategy okay to call him out on a see upset you're getting right now there's a group of people usually may upset everybody should

i a guy a fair shake from their government so if you can call him out for the lies people think you're not being raised there
you're going to lose and again here here's what's really lot already that here's order already know there's been a lose again and when you when you id bag after the election and he's wanting and i'll explain to you what he did he explained it got it's not really advancing on oil you them knowing why an explanation that's the strategy and it's working at some point
there's there's going to be a national crisis there's going to be some sort of mass casualty that or recession or economic disaster and the american people will need to know that someone in a position of authority is telling them things that are true and every time the president tells are ridiculous mythological magic magical nonsensical lie
yes there's there's a defense that you can make from sort of this political machiavellian perspective
in a long term for this country it's laying the groundwork for taken literally
i'm gonna bring out
it's going to were answer the question you're asking and you're going to like the second half of the show probably a little you weren't as i mean for i'm not a new course i'm trying to explain what he's doing now you and you very animated about it and a lot of people like that
maybe not these people but there's a large group of people in middle america that lie him because he can and need to the an animated about this stance on preventing and and we can't even really seems like a strategy match and i got actually give you the label i now have a link but we're not having the same conversation because ah let's bring on jonathan
in a different word two different levels like that
you ever get into bed and somebody is on the other sheep they're under the sheet
yeah but i said
together they
yeah actually you know i'm going to be you know at lists like i say the same thing and believe me that he's inside knowledge isn't a new york university stern school of business and go off paper times bestseller the coddling of the american mind are good intentions and bad ideas are setting up the generation for failure jonathan hi

right
so you have this all folds and together now the last thing we need in this country is another reason for democracy to be friend but your book says wanted the darn kids today
explain that a little i'm paraphrasing here and actual and professor you said and better word than i the please share well
the the book has its origins in and observations from my coauthor greg lucky on off he is the president or the foundation for individual rights and education defense free speech rights on campus and in two thousand and thirteen greg began noticing that for the first time was the students who are asking for protection from words and books and ideas and speakers
previously students had protested speakers before but they'd never before medical eyes at the acted as though if this person says something i will be harmed damage people will be traumatized and so this was something new and when they put it in terms of safety well then administrators have to respond
so this came in around twenty two thousand and fourteen and it brought with a whole package of innovations you might say micro aggression training safe spaces trigger warnings all this stuff appears from outta nowhere around twenty thirteen thousand and fourteen that's something i did not realize until i was reading your book i thought it went back further because i've been talking about the fragile stuff for a long time but i didn't
realize that this is a new generation the millennium goals stop at nineteen ninety five that nineteen ninety four that's right okay so now we're into the i you call them more generation zealand same thing that's right and even more fragile yeah well this is can leave
start blaming i want a black lives play sports point blank okay i say oh it's you against okay with you i will do all the parents and with the all the all the teachers so you know the basic the basic finding which i think surprised a lot of us a lot of was assumed that the millennium were from nineteen eighty two to around two thousand and nineteen ninety eight but kids born around nineteen ninety five had a varied
from childhood from kids born a few years before and so research by jean jean twenty the show that kids born after nineteen eighty five they don't get driver's licenses as much they don't drink as much they don't go out on dates they don't have sex as much what are they doing there sitting at home on their devices talking with each other and this seems to be changing social development and
no this is not just some perception from outsiders because the rates of anxiety disorders depression self cutting where they have to be admitted to hospitals and suicide all of these rates are way way up especially for girls and it all begins right around twenty eleven and so it's when this general
asian first entered college campuses and two thousand and thirteen
that's when all this new attitude about speech comes in is another reason that they're sitting home instead of doing all those funding is because the parents insist on watching them all the time exactly and then we talk on member or twenty years ago we've talked about helicopter parents hovering over them and now they call it a bulldozer
parents get a clear out any obstacles
the edge parenting i've heard right here so that the kid who doesn't have to ever face any difficulties how can that can function in the real world that's right
the most important psychological idea and the book is anti fragility that there's some things that are fragile like a wine glass you cannot get over it breaks nothing good happens if something is plastic cannot get over it doesn't get damaged but it doesn't get better but there are some things that have to be stressed or challenged like immune system if you protect your kids immune system use bacterial wipes you actually hurting
the kid you're preventing the system from getting the information i eat same thing with social life if you protect your kids from being excluded from being insulted from being teased when they grow up like the princess and the p a little tiny thing that they encounter on campus now becomes intolerable painful
but it's not all over the country real is a minute to know if this is something when they talk about elites
who were talking about i think a little more the heartland let's see what the kids do or fuck you mom calm the fuck you mom generation a white male or yeah i mean calling mom a bitch turning their back on with their mothers talking if i did that i will not be sitting here

the constant negotiating with with the kids you know hey buddy
ready to go
kids shirt and authority and pants try to you had to see their friends yeah but but on the point about whether this is everywhere so this is such a new trend we only began to notice these things in the last couple of years but what seems to be the case is that the the anxiety and depression the fragility the mental illness that's across the country across social classes
across races and that's why social media use is beginning early beginning in middle school that seems to be the most likely culprit of several culprits so that's all of the country but the the the shout downs the screening it professors with an app that out that is almost only in the northeast and just the coastal strip of the well
coast and a lube in chicago with that's what gets the headlines and that's what dominates media the see it's the kid who screaming at the professor who then gets a job at the huffington post that's right and provides fodder for that for media to say look how terrible problems with liberals in general is that they let those kids who are hoping to impose
mr whatever writing their insane woke shit
they let them control the debate just like the parents let the kid control when we're leaving a we let the kids take over that's like job one you don't do in civilization that's right there has you respect the elders not it's like every civilization before this one

connected to this point of why we lose i think that's wrong with it i think people in this country don't any more pay attention to policy so much it's more this personal stuff it's anecdotal i don't know about global warming or what causes the recession but you know i saw that mother at the soccer game
or in the supermarket and her five year old was screaming at her and she was apologizing to the five year old i'm not going to let those people take over the country
i think that's the level it works
donald trump is do i think he understands that because he's a guy who thinks that global warming as a chinese hoax but he knows how to attach derogatory nicknames to people and that's a lot of his success in politics
the sanitation of the social media sites
a kid puts beautiful pictures of themselves on the site in a likud looks at it and feels that their life is less than a beautiful sanitation is that affecting them as well and yet reading a lot of the things are getting absolutely and that's probably the main reason why it's affecting the girls so much more than the boys because if you if you imagine all the kids in america
round two thousand and seven to two thousand and nine and you suddenly just drop millions and millions of i phones all over the country and kids pick them up what are the boys going to do oh video games and it turns out actually video games aren't that harmful and actually more
really that's not a lot about his care
oh dark
but just to finish up here
the boys are mostly doing video games that aren't so bad
even if they're running round imaginary worlds killing people as my son does with his friends it's really cooperative this teamwork they're talking
what the girls it
what the girls are doing is putting something out and then waiting anxiously while people comment on it and so it's their social comparison it's the fear of missing out also girls bullying is relational boys bullying is physical social media that doesn't really affected but girls can never get away if they're being bullied so this is why we think
the suicide rate is up twenty five percent for boys but it's up to seventy percent in her girls a couple of mergers before we run at a time we're talking about why they lose i think the report i know is non political but under should have come out by now because it's going to come out after the election with
somehow completely forgotten about the fact that the president collude with russia
roger help him win that's not
his ten days before the election in two thousand and sixteen you know what happened ten days before the election call me call me about hillary's emails somehow they always get the breaks and we don't and it's going to come out after the election and a minutes
one eye color isn't making decisions based on prior now let will again for i i understand that if the opposite if somebody could have somebody good to let them know right
last thing we're sorry about the media you know if the media's liberal i gotta say they're doing donald trump building especially with this stupid
broken caravan
you know it's a lie that this caravan is a problem of that magnitude then why coverage so much on all your networks you are doing
oh yeah
you you said something in your monologue and my wife said to me the other day there's a lot of women and children in the caravan
you have to ask yourself a rhetorical question would a woman bring their babies or their young children hundreds or thousands of miles of the border if they weren't afraid of something that's the mistake the mistake is that you're covering
not covering it down
this is what the president's very very good at he's got people covering it up here at this level that it's a national disgrace we're going to stop when i'm an executive order on it but it's actually a human story and i think the media is doing a disservice to the human sided story you know
what is demagoguing the central american caravan i mean donald trump is really showing that he thinks that his core supporters are native us with memory loss because nobody sees to remember anybody's guess in april we had another caravan this was not hordes of people invading and raping and pillaging america
it was a big nothing basically it was about four hundred people who applied for asylum which they are legally entitled to do they were not breaking the law and doing that just as these people have a legal right to apply for asylum and to pick up and running out that he was saying let's show a little empathy for them let's not demagogue them but it's not demonize them understand these people are suffering and they're trying to get a better life they're not

stand the guy okay he's using that methodology and he's using what you wrote in your books or to get the story appear as opposed to the human side or so getting the in giving the story as low as he can to scare people on his side and then i'll put my hands down here yeah
where it should be me down
i don't know that for down but let me let me he doesn't care about understands what i'm saying they're symbolism and totems hear these using and it's distorted the way the media is reporting it and they could be doing a better job reporting it from the human side of it and obviously not an american people would look at it as a way to our values or that we want to take care of the you're dealing with yeah and that's not that's done
i could answer yes or no
watching from from off stage and we're all trying to figure out how can people believe this how can this be happening
it seems as of the country is completely lost his mind record one thing i can contribute from from social and moral and political psychology is that if you look at how much left and right dislike each other and you go back to the seventies and eighties it wasn't actually all that much data from that american national election survey with been rising steadily since then and as we begin to
hate each other more and more motivated reasoning get stronger and stronger were desperate to believe anything that will make the other side look bad and these tribal processes in which the enemy of my enemy is my friend or any variation of that so partly what's happening is like the temperature is rising turning up our ancient psychological circuits for tribal warfare and
then we say how can those people be like that how can they believe anything and the same conversation is going on on the right about the left or right thank you know it's time

not everything that merely alludes to another culture is racist or cultural appropriation really imagine there's no countries it isn't hard to do
halloween was always fun because it wasn't pc not being pc is almost the whole point of the holiday but now everything has to turn into a federal case of snowflakes versus humor

historians will remember this is the time
changed in america on this this is watershed stuff what's going on with sexual harassment were all the rocks are coming over thing the bug underneath the just see the below riley's settlement that came out this way below riley

buoyed by my calculations seeing below riley's dick is
twenty one thousand words worse than radiation

this growing list of people and you say a movie mogul gone director gone reporter gun corporate ceo gone president united states peace day
what's that all but not everybody is willing to turn a blind in the republican party this week jeff flake the senator for a marriage
like joined the resistance
he announced his retirement in a blistering speech on the senate floor he would denounce trump for all the stands for and says he just can't be a part of this any more he is the rose mcgowan
the republican party
except that instead of the other republican joining in with their me to stories they are continuing to lead truck molester that's the problem
jeff
just like is not a hippie the say hard right winger who vote with trump same thing with other there are other republican of conscience which is bob barker who this week said trump is utterly untruthful and he is debasing the country
that said if you can sign our tax code for the rich debase away
yeah that's the problem you know senators have quit before their party over arguments like this with the president
even switched parties jim jeffords any remember that guy in two thousand and one left the republican voted lincoln j v over disagreement with bush but these were policy differences that said what's going on but trump people quit trump like they met him in a bathrobe any jacked off and do a play
but
maybe add big do art out our president added up your heard but he solved the opie i did epidemic this week yet
yeah he solved this was his quote word for word you said this was an idea that i had
this was an idea i had to young
people not to take drugs it's really really easy not to take them
c
tell people not to take that she does he have to think of everything
and then he made a very moving speech about the whole problem he said yes we've had drug drug epidemics before but never have so many of the victims been so white

but god that's not all the president get done this week oh no he was very excited about releasing the jfk assassination files and just as republican suspected they only raise more questions about hillary's email
and you know jfk he lived in a time when bad man hater
was never reported especially among presidents and that day is gone as george h w bush
i doubt this week yes kids i'm talking about the ninety three year old who apparently is addicted to crack
ass crack
a third ninety three a third woman has got forward to say that he groped her from his wheelchair
and he didn't deny it he just said a hero

i love you didn't just grabbed the as he had an police guys had demos i didn't get any way he is emma was before he grabbed the he would always say to the woman
who is your my favorite magician is david copperfield
and his sculpturing evidence that meant a lot of work his spokesman said the president to put people at age that was to put people
the sweltering to put people at ease the president tells the same joke and on occasion has padded woman's rears and what was intended to be a good natured manner
you know it's bad when w's go and play dead stop embarrassing the

fred got a dr de are is air
an academy award nominee actor who started the no film l b j out in theaters on november third i understand he's very personable what do you than



what did look at the they're yelling at you
what did you do to become so popular
you're such a such a pain
i had nothing to do with everybody wanted to be woody's friend and back in your smoke and days many were
but let's talk about your movie because it's a terrific movie to good pizza work an eggplant lyndon johnson i understand you were reluctant to play it because as many of us we didn't like vietnam yeah we all we could see with johnson but as you grow older
as we both
see people in march
i think i'm more forgiving right and you see the good and the bed together more you think i wanted to work with rob reiner because i think he's one of our greatest directors and the
if you look it's almost like grabs is the tale of two presidents because there's the vietnam had been there is always important legislation that he passed like the voting rights act the civil rights act the head start other than it is he was great yeah
any any pass legislation you had the kid has it because you know helping poor people like the war and ruined so he did a lot of great thing he was very colorful guy
so and i think you caught this needy you know he really wanted people to love him i feel like that is maybe were you in the character
we're able to read his you know like everybody to love you gotta do it
oh i don't give a shiner
plainly i don't give a shit because it would prefer it i would i would prefer we would agree with me

i'm not going to say what i don't think just to make the vagaries with but let's get back to l b j because that's what way
i'm here is gorilla

i'll say there i know you guys
guy i've been we've been lot of i'm every long term very long time who smoked a lot of joints to together
and this guy has been expressing what we've been feeling and sound was afraid to express for so long and i think that's why we appreciated

okay thank you very very reason
jesus
in bed health am i going to hurt
okay
that sort of the vulgar part because we have a vulgar president now and before trump johnson was the standard vulgar and like one of the first change in the movie he's his truck and there's people in the room important people to doing government business and he's on the phone to his taylor talking about and we need more room because you don't want a big is johnson is yeah yeah
how could you were landing hiring or and use long
did you talk too many will have used pain
healers and publicly vogue like a prison income right
he he did use father in private but in our current president aids when you've had dinner with trump or i didn't you have a dinner or did have the day with them learn what was that circumstance well and i that invited by jesse ventura
well you like to two thousand and
new york and so will you come with me
you know term and
fair to get a been his running mate on the two thousand and four ticket democratic ticket
and
as a democrat
he is he does media so
and
as brutal it was good
i never met him more narcissistic me talked about the holder has changed a lot
you could see had the standard he was going to bear
i had to work out like halfway through smoke a joint just just silly

is that would you tell yourself about why is the
interesting
he needed prompting yeah well let's talk about that because it's funny i mean you have given it up for about a year and a half now yeah
and i think that's great when we were in hawaii last year in solidarity i didn't want to tempt jews who i didn't do it around you when when we were together but you were one of the pioneers and i'm not going to try to get you back on the wagon at all but i just want to show you know now i just want to show you some pictures to reminisce i mean that you on our very first show of real time
now we are in my backyard and two thousand and three were doing a sketch remember we did a sketch about smoking yeah we did that sketch yeah
okay but here's my hands my point nobody here is us this last year and hawaii after you had given up pod and there we our jeff ross and you know you're lucky
the like okay but not ecstatic
clearly i the next night at your house your porch the you live on because it has no walls so you live in a poor and it's okay
i mean it's a beautiful view it should be there's no was into point
okay so we look ok there too but here's the year before when we were completely big

can
uncertainty about your happy with don't
again not stoned
stop
stop
but that's a strong case
fire
i heard that
but you haven't given up all your happy ways and that's great and i'm always amused by the great dichotomy that is you because you're seen as such a laid back guy and you are i mean you're laid back is it comes as i know you but you're obviously also a very talented driven ambitious person
none in one not into but you're in three franchises
you're in hunger games you
or in the woods the magician one night
me and you're in the movie
planted it
that now how did the hippie
how did this laid back guy get to be the guy in hollywood who's got a monopoly on being in all the
i mean there's a little bit of
a personality and and beads that i am actually genuinely lazy as shit and i
i mean i can get by noon or they you know you'll see me i didn't really get by when when the last time you were my last time you were always the last time your home
january yeah because mr lazy works his ass off and where the benefits because you're leaving a great body of work in this movie is part of it you should go see it woody harrelson
i gotta

an author of the enlisted new york times best seller beyond the messy truth how we came apart how we come together van jones

politics reporter for the daily beast return to devise yo betsy wonder
for national or via whose name you may recall was floated to be the presidential candidate of the never trump movement oh if it had only been so welcome aboard david french
right so let's talk about the republicans they had a big week and i thought it was kind of a microcosm of everything that's dragging our republic down because just flake this republican conservative republican gets up there and he makes this amazing speech and
this was well written and beautifully delivered in the well of the senate and to all about how we can't continue under this man
it was his have you no decency speech and the republicans said yes you're right you should open investigations and they open to into hillary
i'm not kidding guess they're still after hillary
the gift that keeps on getting republicans will never get tired of talking about hillary clinton and always works for them
but she lost she was voted off the island
why is the tribe meeting every week and skills nothing around and a few things i agree on a watch the health care debacle and they had some trouble with that one watching tax reform having trouble with our when everyone agrees that hillary clinton is terrible brings all family it and i will look i mean
let let me let me offer a partial defense here as talking about hillary clinton some of these issues are actually really important this story about how millions of dollars flowed into the clinton foundation in half a million dollars into bill clinton's pocket and then next thing you know about twenty percent every year he was malarkey
when speaking fee and russia
and nixon you know that twenty percent better because your nerves or and i'm not going to grow ebel that there are some clinton issues
are you saying that they rise to the level of the trump issues now i'm saying we can do both you know and not present now but it's still important how this happened it says you that a little worried as it is important in the way it's pathetic any kind of shelter they don't have
what i the worst the worst everyone says i'm know i am a little concerned that people are so happy place has made this great speak he so courageous when you courageous you say and i'm going to stay and fight
get the heck out of here
he ran scampering out is because of banning ban and has a billion dollar in and pointed at the head of every republican is against donald trump and these guys are giving his great speeches and turning the party over to ban without a shot and that's not courage that i agree with you i agree with you that
she stayed in thought she stood in thought i don't think people are all that afraid to ban and bad got to that well because billion dollars yeah a creature ban and is somebody that everyone talks about in washington and on twitter you go out into actual trunk country nobody knows who this guy
two years vote for his candidate
here's my take away the most against people who go against trump that's what they do okay but who go against trump bank will primary voters republican primary voters vote against people who go against trump it against us the take away from this week that's really important is that this is trumps party now yes this is laura ingram said that she
we're not an element we are the party
is this is kind of important donald trump what we first real laughing at that he was even going to get the nomination and then always the president but he's going to get broad die data for last year it's now his party start to like i said people are cutting and running really fast i talked about how primary voters vote against people who were anti trap when we were actually know that we haven't had her about it
primary i just like has not had a chance to face off against kelly ward who isn't very far right ban and support a candidate we don't know how we do and but on i don't have that on that we don't know we'll say we don't know but but here's the real problem to me is that fox news has become
state tv
it's they were always of course republican it's different now as all things with trump it's worse and this is a very bad axis of evil because data they didn't hear the jeff like speech they didn't know about didn't even it doesn't exist the things that we talk about do not exist because they are not shown on fox t v
this for jeff like speech life for what it's worth they showed it live but they didn't talk about and they ended up going to the same player website so their website
the extra had no like headline it was hillary clinton and and the very bottom they took away from this speech just like i could work with trump on some of them
there it is so but it's which show i mean to hannity is trump prada everybody knows they all are brett bear is a good journalist other folks like dean a primo very high integrity in a hurry new is out in trumps not natural and
actually his personality who doesn't get enough attention for being very close and friendly with trump is lou dobbs i've been told that trump will actually called odds at his shell he loves it when dogs goes after mcconnell and paul ryan wheelchair and nine in a recent interview in a trunk as jobs who he should pick to be to fend chair that's not an aberration
at the kind of relationship they had and it is a fox business house too
gives him his agenda
typical fox viewer is now president an old white guy with anger issues or not sure why
so they're anecdotal falls racist field the country is his view and they know that they have this viewership of one person that's all they have to please they very often do give him his agenda you see him saying they're talking point
bizarre to can see this sort of way
in the morning whatever they say on fox and friends he tweets about whatever it and the braves and them for korea that's weird but i also think it's important for progressive and liberals to actually tune in sometimes we've got to be able to go to the able to get our tolerance level up for this kind of stuff because otherwise what happens is we literally have no idea like our cousins and
we went to school with these people are crazy because we're actually in our own bubble and in certain way because we're not learn what can i
just give you a view republican views from the latest polls sixty eight percent of republicans believe millions of illegal immigrants voted in the last election
so that's over two thirds you believe something crazy and completely untrue this is what i mean about i gave the i can't get illegal people to vote

the have to get millions of people do something that americans won't seventy three percent of republicans thing that voter fraud happens somewhat or very often again something we know is completely not true fifty two percent of republicans because of that last one i read voter fraud being so been
what support postponing the twenty twenty election
until we can fix the problem that doesn't exist
so i think that yeah so again in then conspiracy thinking is not confined to the right like i'm not going to defend any that i mean you you could you could throw a number after number including a large number of republicans who believe in revoking citizenship for flag burners which is an anathema to the first minister but we've seen polls that said a whole bunch
democrats believe george bush was behind nine eleven we got a problem with conspiracy think a whole bunch policy in the bush era six least to fifty percent believing that that bush had something to do with nine eleven and so there is there is a conspiracy theory problem in a lot of it is because of the thing the van mention were and bubbles and when you're in bubbles you think the
absolute worst of your opponent and but rather a tried and millions of people voted friday or way he
why so many republicans there's enough it's not true because the president's but it's not going to fire
oh yes there is a journey know if i'm over here but what about this
it's sort of a mammal there's not there's not there's not two things of equal size you think of you think totally depends on the issue i would agree with you
okay
well
well our move on
if jeff later somebody like the wants to really make a difference you said you should go back and fight with they really should do is run as an independent eighty percent of republicans are with trump that means twenty percent aren't you could get those people you could as a patriotic service
split the republican vote eighty to twenty an elected democrats like teddy roosevelt did in one thousand and twelve

on the tip of my tongue okay
ask about edge because this is what the president was jerking this week he said we must fight back with a really tough really big really great advertising
and it was rather gentle on the people who are the addicts and if while i this is one of the things that i think criminal on the part of trump he and the republican party during the primary went out and actually found out which allow people
didn't know that people are dying all over the country you know one of my close friends parents died of the same opiate crisis at killing people and coal country is a national catastrophe more people are dying of opium painkiller overdoses than they were dying of hiv aids at the height of the crisis so you literally have a catastrophe and you could do something about it right now
now it would take money it would take willpower you have to bring people together instead you do a press conference a tweet and talk about advertising you're not going to say people's lives are not going to the you've got morgues that fill up every weekend in some he's read counties they have to order freezer trucks on friday night because they know the more they're going to stop you're not going to save those lives and
on the other people's arms with an advertising campaign it he is demagoguing his own basis pain and suffering and outrageous it's just our

i'm gonna i'm going to agree with most what she said nothing significant has happened here this is a and that's a crime this is a national crisis and it's one that look we got to face facts here we need to the federal government needs to be involved absolutely but this is not something this is something that in some ways may even be more difficult than the crisis in overcoming
aids because there there was a medicine medicines that can be developed that you could take well hear you're dealing with people who are gonna crawl over broken glass to get that next
let me just say i wrote a book a big part of a book is about stuff that we could actually fix tomorrow if he just came together and this is one of them there are in fact medicines now you have medically assisted treatment where you can get people instead of having the detox and die model where you get people just won't have to go and overdose you could actually fix it but you'd have to bring people together to do it and
doesn't actually want to solve the problem he wants to demagogue about in other words with the idea that there's nothing we can do is false false false and we get on this right now another piece of this problem that's really important and doesn't get enough play is the fact that at first it's a lot of drug or types including our attorney general like to talk about how marijuana as a gateway drug in reality a lot of pro
scripture and b o it's are legitimate gateway drugs to heroin use
exactly
both it
data that shows recently i'm gonna say that most recent cdc day and maybe shows that the opiate overdose deaths that happened about about almost half of them are from drugs that were present legal drive them characters are giving people and thirty as tough as doctors were under pressure to prescribe these things pain became the first violate were under pressure from bed
farmer that was push night
and the other thing is that been donald trump been lies about it and says we're going to have a big wall because the walls going to keep out the opiate you have a wall around cbs what do you talk

david
yeah because our responsibility to bed i mean i'm sorry
no now i get that's about as know i say i wasn't even bigger you were going to go there with it but it was enlightening but listen it's it's halloween time and we make flooded this guy roy more who's going to be the senator
his way the senator and alabama that's really that's how we address is it's like howdy doody
watch fox news and all day
and we thought you know this is interesting because this guy does not need a hollow in costume because
he is a halloween costume
and we found that actually in washington a lot of people fit that description they don't need a costume because they are one for example sarah huckabee sanders does not need one
because she's going as marie osmond after a bad breakup
no and congressmen trade county is going as the last face you see before the car trunk closed
ben carson is going as the guy at the end of the bar who say

joni ernst is going as your high school gym teachers roommate
paul ryan
his coaching as an emotionally damaged former child star
betsy device is going as a woman who just found out her new neighbors are mexican
mike pence is going as the guy you're always tells his barber a little shorter out and want to be mistaken for a beetle
steam bad at you go he's going as that weird shit you see growing on trees

and gone junior and eric remember going as the top of the gay wedding

das a study guide to surviving truck while jive


so great to see never
girl old you always have the same i know you're always talking about being old on his show lately and i'm saying you're afraid to die
death metal was but now it's more like yeah
but i be just because i love do it
make me laugh but also because i feel like i'm also have been argument like almost on a weekly basis with other democrats were you're on my side yeah i keep saying democrats are tonight said to nato and you are my ally they don't go for the jugular your ankles so that when they go low we go high now when they make a lot we should go low exactly
people
goodbye
crazy talk to understand that crazy know you don't deal with white supremacists i'm not talking to himself
you didn't do but but yes i mean what what happened to that gene in the democrat
makeup i mean it wasn't that way with bobby kennedy and bend and john f kennedy they were tough they weren't this kind of to nice democrat but busy get laid
well as
certainly part of that i think the problem is political correctness yeah indeed believe i did a show about from your ago i'm going john kerry was running ice i saw him at something and i said you can't deal with these people need to be tough when you're going to do to deal with these republican he like don't worry i can handle it now he did he didn't
they don't they don't announce on where the genus went research and also you have to speak very simply to people they don't want to hear all this and stuff that here on c n n and m me si go right so the jugular the weight trump to he's his smile that where he is it's an only thing that smile exactly he's a terrific con man yeah
but i mean you play club clone that little i know now i don't mean clubs like when you get into theaters in us
and
it's a little the atmosphere is a little more constrained than it used to why you can't say anything now i mean look ugly you can we can because we're a little grandfathered in
again but the old age
yeah we are grandfathered in my grandmother did it
i don't wife doesn't work anymore as his standup highly because anything you say they write it down they tape us a that tweet about it is and like james coin got in trouble last week whatever rose mcgowan it's like a layoff the comedians okay
that can be we like the philosophers of the toy not socrates and aristotle but we either philosophers right now
you know
we are living thing comedians is that because we can work in the club's we don't care about these jobs like this job on my job we can always work so we will say whatever we want will speak to or so
go back to that oh yeah
but all right so let's talk about men
behavior because
this is a watershed time things will never be the same ryan ryan why do you think now i mean what does harassment a year ago when when the trunk tape came out why not five years ago or ten years ago one of the dawn of the women's liberation movement why is it now that finally admitted it's kind of the main
am a little i don't think that men too optimistic because really a need a hill came out and then we had we have clarence thomas
a commodity a different era with social media and all the women joining in and all these you but they're still most men are in power what did then the ones in power they are the ones to intimidate the women they yeah the one i know that you're not going to get the job unless you let me learn unless unless you look at my penis
that's basically that's what they so my i know when you read about the they they all have it
how do you like at it and on now
they eleven ammo
yeah it's just like be like take some drugs running knock you out
that's true it says or or you know like masturbating
just rubbing an erection
i thought i didn't know women or my life i don't know man

what didn't deal or riley do that that gun that woman thirty two million dollars what what could you pass how vile does it have i now and while i i i wouldn't suck them to thirty two million

he's not worth thirty two million
and i must say
when you look at the list of people it is always married good it's always married yeah just say why is because they have shitty sex life
oh yeah

lloyd at home and about it now now now that's good then there's nothing wrong with my i open is accused of masturbating under the desk wise talking to somebody was that got to do with him being married
let's bring the lion's den
the wives and well welfare
why business while these decks a joke and
my book your book i have a

donald trump

moby dick head

when i wrote it for a trump trump anti trump or as if you're it trumps support it don't buy the book i forbid you to buy the
close the book for her

then i think we have to be a sophisticated there's a problem with trying to solve you gotta you are correct that will have to fight about and i love you for it but you mentioned bobby kennedy bobby kennedy was tough on his opponents but he also went to appalachia any talk to those poor white both and got him on his
all i'm saying is we had a great circle that includes women people of color muslims everybody jewish people list as get the circle bigger to take his base away from them and tell you what you don't go and we don't go the nazis are going to go time i go at that happened my country hundred

ellison the track it can we be honest
one hundred and one hundred and twenty million votes we lost this thing by seventy thousand votes spread out through three states and the rust belt and seventy thousand and some people had voted for obama we just gotta go back and get those folks and we have now as you can adapt and that's what the book is about that and models are bugs work
the topic
true
others in the last control
capitalist
so democrats always say they want to win but i just don't see a lot of soul searching some of the issues that might help them forty eight percent of democrats are concerned about immigration and here's what andrew sullivan said this week he said the democrats current position seems to be that the dreamer parents who broke the law or near heroes and their rhetoric
the democrats rhetoric is very hard to distinguish from a belief and open borders democrats increasingly seemed to suggest that any kind of distinction between citizens and non citizens is somehow racist
and when you see in europe is a rise of these sort of like trump like guys and it's always in countries that were lax on immigration and i think this is an issue democrats have to look in the mirror a little about because i think andrew of it is not wrong about this
here's where i take some exception i agree bad beating people up who have some concerns about lobbying broken and condom the bunch of names and stuff like that is not constructive because it keeps us will have an honest conversation
but as a matter of strategy
i don't think that the democrats should throw away the latino base chasing hardcore it people if you are hardcore anti immigrant you are always going to be able to find a republican you like better than a democrat so i think that we could be more and when he wants but the idea that we should somehow become a party that's tough on immigrants
doesn't you say disney this strikes me as and fighting the last war isn't because right after two thousand and twelve the republicans did this big self diagnosis and they said the path to winning is to be more open to immigrants
and that is exactly the opposite of what happened in two thousand and sixteen and i think what's happening
i think the republicans are shooting themselves in the slit innocence was and said seventy thousand votes i would even married in three cities basically philadelphia milwaukee detroit if you have to press the united states using the bully pulpit to directly attack the most popular african americans not just in the country in the country but in the world
have any nfl player steph curry who attacked steph curry steph curry with invented in a lab by dad's want their kids that get a i don't know why
yeah
turnout seventy thousand more people without changing some of these stances republicans i think are way too cocky politically was such a narrow victory and i and i really think that fighting last war them may not really apply when we get to twenty nine thousand and twenty twenty it's going to be a different landscape any other thing is taking a step back
like that politics here is up here is down piece of as if democrats went to pitch themselves as mean to immigrants they can make that case where obama dramatically expanded the practice of family detention what does the practice or taking women and children or babies and putting them in a literal president we have facilities and tax as in pennsylvania that are full of women and barry
young children right now about three thousand obama dramatically expanded that practice so democrats might their talking points might sound like an open borders immigrants are great blah a lot but in reality there's a lot that obama dead as a lot of the obama legacy that's very troubling to immigration attorney is that i talk to regularly to people who are undocumented doesn't this notion
democrats and a spotless record on it and are really soft on enforcement is just not true within they have the worst of both worlds
they're actually doing bed and their reputation is the opposite also not getting them both
so while i mean that was true another number of things that obama he had the reputation of the peace president but by the time he left office he had boots on the ground in syria boots on the ground in iraq and afghanistan in north africa honey you know we're learning now there's a thousand troops in zero eight hundred ships amnesia the first detachment got there during the obama administration
who knew that so there was a big disconnect i think between what a lot of thought about obama and what
i think you're you're trying to figure out what's the pathway out of this ditch the democratic party as far as fallen and you not think everything should be on the table
for me i want to figure out a way for us to hold on to those you got eleven million people in the country they don't have papers but if you've left tomorrow the economy would collapse and you so you do have a country that's based on the hard work of a lot of undocumented people i want to respect those folks and i don't think that you have to that is almost as false
thing now do you like the immigrants or do you like the a white guys who don't have jobs i think he can like both parties to help both and i just think this false choice of been pushed into now we have to pick among pain we have to pick among funerals we have to listen why don't we just get everybody together who doesn't have anything and go fight the baggage that
yeah
something you said earlier democrats are too nice yeah you know joe biden said about mitt romney he's going to put your back in chains okay that doesn't sound very nice i mean the democrats integrate well come on
i've had to trap
amazing
your ability to jerry good thing
i make it look like it's going to think that as president the united states
i in america that everybody at around to the economy and that's not a who was he saying that about into the lack of was talking to african american on talking about the republican that horrific scary romney ryan ticket that they're going to put it all back and change that oh you know the gaff mr
which i'm sure he regretted oh by the way the guy like reorganized and says something like that well he he's capable of saying you sorry i've seen him do it sure did the guy who's in charge now is not well
this is what we go for you know if it's global warming it comes up you know that like well you know we used to have a cold periods
scientists predicted it would be a cold beer
we had hot weather back in the nineteen hundreds or what
it doesn't lose as fixing problems it doesn't help but if the idea of fixing problems is the democrats need to be nastier that's not going to fix the power as an aids but he hasn't but people do want to realistic that was because you have to be nasty to show was real but you know that's exactly the republican argument that i dealt with four months his eyes
getting slaughtered by republicans for opposing trump we gotta be nasty to when we got to be nasty to witnessing no appeal to people the better angels of people's nature and they tell me know we got to be nasty we got to be nasty and they want and not president
i think so too
i don't make when you're sitting there
your i couldn't get your leisure
i think on the on the substance of what's going to make this country a better place the argument and in listening where the idea that that trunk one simply because he was nasty i think is wrong i think if trumpet wanting a running galleon also a lie or that yes and
but we're saying
i wasn't people are having a very hard time and people want to know that you going to be tough enough and strong enough to deal with their problems and there's some stuff that we should fight about what you want to persecute muslims you want to you want this was back jewish people you want to attack brinkley immigrants you want and you want to going to we should have that by but we can't only fight and still have a country that's all i'm saying beyond the better
graham we can find some come down to it
if only one side is playing with civility that side is always going to lose that's that's called during a knife to a gun that's called
and eight two thousand and twelve i don't know i don't know if that's true
i got to go to neural thank you everybody

want to have down they design though in this photo i should feel more sorry for jimmy carter who kind of got pushed into the background or barack obama was just about to make david copperfield

general now that we know george w bush is go to joke well robbery women as you know my favorite videos is david copperfield david copperfield has to admit that i radically when he grabbed the woman's private party or he says my favorite president
david copperfield really does it was for the point
neural the pc police on twitter have to calm the hell down about l and posting this sexist picture of herself with katie barry allen just think he's battling a little harmless fun and katie think she's meeting justin bieber

no rule if you don't stop taking pictures of your baby's blood painted like a pumpkin i'm quitting this mommy grow
if i wanted to say and orange as

yeah
finally no real or i must tell me why do people who wrap themselves in the flag are always the ones most clueless about what it represents

like the way trump turn day respectful protest about police brutality into a patriotism pissing match the nerve of these young black men kneeling while an american idol runner up sings the bombs bursting in air song
how dare you exercise your freedoms while we're honoring them
we will not stand for not standing
trump literary said that soldiers have died and we need to spend because they were fighting for our national and oh for fucks sake
no one ever died for the and them
some have died trying to sing it
but trump know that for conservatives the anthem is their senior prom theme song
it makes them all misty eyed the way i get when i hear the captain into nails do that to me one more time
remember this guy john boehner so unpopular with his own republicans they booted him out of beings bigger but they never criticize them for doing this i poured my heart and soul in iran in a small village

farms
oh barnes
pictures of we give them a hard on
but a party that things of itself is the tough guys to so susceptible to sentimental isn't that's where they love the paintings of thomas kincaid with his vision of america as one big hobbit village of fairytale cottages
and of course christmas they are so head over heels lady gaga in love with christmas they even imagine liberals have some now banned everyone from talking about it until drug got elected and now the bed has been lifted we could say merry christmas again
they really believe this shit it's like no one ever broken to them that the bearded guy who delivers goodies isn't real


but
but nothing triggers that soft machine part of a right wing or more than the military they love the military the way eight year old girls love horses
wholly and completely with a slight tinge of sexual frustration
they get a tingle in their teens when the
blue angels fly overhead they cry during the president's martian fighting speech and independence day
let's see a guy in uniform at the mall and say thank you for your service and even though the guys thinking i'm a security guard dip shit
last week in his heroic battle against a grieving widow donald trump cent general kelly out to talk to the media and offer us a lesson about honor and when that on or less than included blatantly lying about congresswoman wilson general kelly was
sized which president trumps spokesperson said was highly inappropriate
that's right it is highly inappropriate to ever question a general which it is in north korea
right
this has to tell people not to protest against the police not to question the generals this is not american and that is the problem with all the fetish patriotism it starts with goose bumps
but it ends with two steps
right
i guess

china that big when he was he was a study their wall
he said

but the south korea trump will be in south korea that you'd be fun t m's a medium
and then vietnam
where of course there was a war that trump avoided
with multiple deferments because of his bone spurs and now he gets to go back as president of the united states who says the dodgers didn't win

you're very upset about that sorry about that but julie's to have a good halloween because all holloway what

american passports from going to drain the swamp any hires the creature from the black lagoon

it's a new character will have to build a new evidence wall
george papadopoulos never heard of this guy he was a go getter their meeting with the russians will talk about it but he was he was report into a big up in the campaign am sam clovis
there sam globe
this week get this from picked to be the department of agriculture's chief scientist
then sam withdrew when he remembered he was not a science

they asked mr glove is know what expertise do you have regarding accurate agriculture and he said eating
speaking of eating our seed god let me tell you
publications unveiled finally this week their new tax plan so hang on americans billionaires help is on the way
it's amazing i mean remember the tea party
rubber the tea party back in two thousand and nine two thousand and ten the way they took over congress
based on their bedrock principles that debt is out of control our biggest crisis an existential threat to our way of life
yeah i forget all that
this new tax plan blows a one point five trillion dollar hole in the tent in the debt and someone someone asked paul ryan
they said when when did republicans stop caring about debt and he explained after careful consideration at the current president is white


and of course you know there was another horrible terrorist attack in new york trump immediately started treating stupid when president doesn't keep us safe and then he was like a way that nina
but here's the feel good story of the week
i heard what happened at twitter on the last day at work at play
employee there i got deleted drums twitter account for eleven minutes i don't know this person is but i have one thing to say to them thank you for your service

here and a little later out with these baking author and isis expert graham one first up he's a military analysts for m s n b c and a medal of honor winner
talk about thank you for your service retired us army colonel jack jacobs

so
i'm guessing as a military man you're a student a military history and would think
and remember when caesar crossed the rubicon
that old but
and i mean you are there but that's when in rome when from a republic of course and there were four soon as he go to that phrase means as soon as rise of the rule gun were no longer republic than the army's and charge i wouldn't bring this up in america because we never had these issues before but the toddler a jeep seem to be
constantly being baby sad by generals he's constantly he said just today he was talking about the f the i should go after this i'm very frustrated the justice department that's not with the president should do it's like he's aching to be a dictator how concerned are you about this military thing going
i wouldn't worry too much about it i would be worried about the fact that there seems to be some level of ineptitude and at least one in probably both ends of pennsylvania i'm you
i think if
we're going to see something different probably in the midterm election and one of the reasons the republicans are not doing anything at the moment is because they want to see what the outcome of that it's going to be they don't want to irritate trumps base things might change at the midterm election i'm not worrying about national defense
in in terms of the leadership involved but over the long long term we longer term when think lives a crazy owner
well
that's about a kind of
what an interesting notion well you know everything may blow up the every presidents had the opportunity to do exactly that
every president wasn't a demented man child and clown makeup
this is
worried about these issues at all before i of here a general in the white house i guess you keep the football away from the president if you're concerned about that but that they have to take orders from oh well you know if you're if you're at the bottom of the food chain like i was
you mean among general i mean colonel even yes but any time you you're required to put you to censor in the you get the order in the order as long as the order is not immoral or illegal you have to carry it out but when you get to be at the top of the food chain
responsible for making sure all so that we don't do anything stupid
well that bus has
whether or not the president can order the and destruction of the entire known universe by himself
and not be checked by anybody
yes he cooked are
okay so what about general kelly
we're only a few weeks ago thinking this is the guy thank god he's around and you know he's done some pretty bone headed things lately for going after the war widow and or at least the congress woman who is defending her and and now talking about robert e leland like he's a hero in the civil war good
should have been a compromise and he looks to me like just another version of trump which is an elderly white male fox news viewer well as family candidate for that's dangerous
his responses
i've been something of a shock to a lot of people including those know him and know him well what a great deal of respect for him
who served with them for whom he served and so on
he was viewed to be something of the adult in the room
right and then he came out on the podium and started the this ad hominem argument renting like a fox news viewer that really quite as compared to yours
but but the most significant pair of course was talking about civil war and those of us who went to public school in new york city learn all about the missouri compromise in the kansas nebraska when we were in middle school now you're testing my history
hi i'm fuzzy and then the fact and the fact the matter is lincoln wrote that very famous letter five years or six years before the civil war started in which he said
he wrote
a nation can't survive half slave and have free five years before the war story sure so anybody who articulate that the war was not about slavery
as you don't smoke and too many left and cigarette

i can show you a few of those if you'd like
as a family show i know but it seems to me we have never had more really really disturbing national security issues when i think of them in my top four when they get your see of you think these are the four and in what order north korea
isis islamic terrorism that kind of stuff the environment the pentagon is totally on the page ahead of the head of the politicians and the environment being a national security threat her and russia
to all those four areas are all really like nervous
i think we've been a lot we've got a lot of threats the world is quite fragment the fret threats are fragmented were not organized to cope with the more isis is a problem only to the extent
that isis is getting defeated overseas and as a result they are going back to first principles which is to blow blow up innocent civilians were so that's that is a problem
we're doing a lot of harm to innocent civilians in the territory they conquered as well but they're they're on the way out there and least for the time being the liable to come back again but for the moment they're going back to the kinds of things terrorists always do and there has to go to places like the united states and europe and shoot up the countryside without necessarily taking any territory
so they're off the territory bit now
north korea a particular problem and it seems like it's intractable but if you consider the fact that north korea
is basically a continuing criminal enterprise
and the only thing they want to do is continue killing their own citizens taking forty to fifty percent of the gross domestic product and putting it in their pockets and all that stuff
it comes clear that they do not want to antagonize the united states by setting a nuclear weapon
on guam or any other place because they know they'll they'll get annihilated so
north korea's view is if they have a nuclear weapon then nobody's gonna bother them than they can continue ripping off their own people
north korea i think is less of a problem than a lot of people say precisely because it's a container i'm glad you have such optimism would you ever consider if trump card you tomorrow and so did you come in here and babies with neighbor
like so many other military men at the call because no had of your country i've got to restrain my tennis racket i don't have time for that



she is a los angeles times assistant managing editor of objects her scene of allentown a
yeah
the americans factor her former white house associated with old director under president ronald reagan you remember from c n n free large
l b j with woody harrelson navy is invaders a rob reiner

you're hurting for nice over time zone finance and after the show on youtube all right let's start with russia because you know this cloud has been hanging over the white house and this will get started to rain
i'm just wondering in light of recent developments what someone like you jeffrey would think of show that we have a little montage of donald trump denying he knows anything about russia and anybody who ever worked for him know anything about russia
i have nothing to do with russia
best of my knowledge no person that i deal with that and now now now nobody that i know of now
one
a bold faced lie at this point
the thing is
i can hear the groans
because already spending himself
wow

just say is a friend and ally he said
edit her lobby activities from two thousand and six to two thousand and fourteen you for donald trump ever ran for president oh come on what it forget
yeah i got not the entire group of what we're talking about three different to think tanks and by the way and that rain cloud they just announced a trial for him and for any made seven next year they are going to continue to go on for days
so okay but we do have the information now i mean we had it before but we have they been more that shows that he did know and by the way that the metaphor thing goes up to february twenty six am so it's not quite the way you present it doesn't matter the point is that we have this guy papadopoulos who says he was talking to trump
directly about russia and when he said look i rush you'd told me they have the hacked emails from the democrats and i told trump trump said well we should go directly to the f b i know he didn't because he's a trade
great set up some meetings on let's find out more and the fact is trumped doesn't know anything so he probably wouldn't know that you were supposed to go to the f b i
but
hall matter for when he was in that meeting in june with jared and with john junior he know that that's what you were supposed to go was going to the f b i and my in his was poor man afford installed by russia i mean he that's what poor man for did for a living he longer and that's called the swamp
that's called the swamp right right
bipartisan i have to say which is what the problem is
wow we got the that quickly
this is what they do fox news is already preparing its viewers for the firing of robert smaller because i swear to god korea and ask he said well we should be focusing on earth continued lies in the clinton administration
he's not talking about the bill clinton administration he's talking about the hillary clinton administration you know because she's president now
considering that just think i should i president doesn't mean you get to collude with the russians and break the law which is what does he easy to lose an election
but that's what she did
but my question about poor man for it looks like me because he kind of walked in off the street and said hey i'll work for you for free
it's a little suspicious yeah that a guy who had seventeen million dollar a little to the had been working for russian papa jerry years
seems they're always in the same pills which precinct was turned by this precinct yeah oh so you're going to the we don't know it affected the election it didn't but that's not with no no no no no no that's true you could no intelligence community that has ruled out that it didn't affect the election we don't know if it made the election go one raise the other but it
definitely affected the election otherwise you wouldn't take out ads on facebook this

oh god
that is right that is while the clinton campaign
this is politics folks the clinton campaign without stuff all the time
i mean how are we know how to win and now that wasn't from russia labour busy colluding with russia right
they were getting the russians you know and healthy
love with a straight face he says

the set much
are relaxed after after yang on rom has had a family you know but he but but you know about that bill because he he spoke i mean i don't think what big did to jeff was wrong i mean not always resort to throw him off i'd be out of the made a joke i mean it was clearly a joke eau claire
and but nothing there
is i listen i'm not on either side in terms of the policies but i mean that was a bad deal i think it looks like he's more relaxed is because we were talking about him like he's not here
looks like
liars
the to our side
met her spending two years of eight to one
so we got off on nothing
we got there are so let's talk about this you bring about facebook because the guys from not didn't know they didn't show up but somebody i guess the lawyers from if you strands
mr strachan with my mistrust rich
google and facebook and twitter testified before congress and they said face looks at one hundred and forty million users may have seen this propaganda from russia so to tell me that you know that it didn't affect the election
and of course
they will never admit that because that would be like saying the advertising that you buy here on facebook doesn't work it's one of the arrested he lurks propaganda exists because it works one of the thing i mean i think we have to be careful about getting government intermediate period
but one of the things that i do think we need to think of is when you go to advertise on facebook should you not identify were getting your money from that's what that's what they're trying there's a bill now
that's why when it comes to political advertising and you can't tell me and really spooky add on television that swings a bunch of lies can both sides do it that has a little fine print at the bottom someone's going to go look that up and maybe issue of on irritated press release about it there's not any teeth and that right you might know in a money is coming from but
it's not like there's going to be people digging into that new federal election commission record on facebook and twitter ads right there's a limit and like i was writing about
bet that study that and try to make the american people care about it campaign finance as a whole bores people usually this is pretty absolutely right but it was a red carpet bombed like they used to do in every election and it didn't work because people people see those said over and over they hate the new put the it out and of course they know it's coming from that person the most effective advocate
using his word of mouth that's why facebook is so dangerous that people don't know that they are repeating
the really scary part about this is the russians came in use facebook use twitter and invaded and infected us in a way that propaganda like you say works and now they're here now they're here and not determine who
what's real and what's not and they're gonna do it again they're coming in
they wondering how she's is a wall on this issue let's even forget the past we know they're going to try to do it again and we have a president who denies that they did it before where it doesn't seem to be concerned about that all members sat there for seven minutes on nine eleven
the is go right well you're sitting there trump is like sitting there for like years yeah
like seven minutes times his old right he's just sitting here while we're under attack
to be nice and nobody ever wants to say anything about goes what the chinese the chinese have hash the chinese the chinese have hacked into the white house they hacked into the defense department has a permanent but they have westernized it the way the russians were able to weapon eyes
the these hang on the line and of the security agencies you're a good american right you believe and secure all seventeen said it was the russians so why are you bringing up china will because i think they're probably the greater threat but in a long time but the as you here i think it really also has to be an element of personal responsibility right if you get a craving email from your
crazy uncle that says you know barack obama is a muslim or whatever it's your obligation if you don't believe that and you would like to prove that person wrong to go on snakes and to send them the factual information here to the coffee
it was not that different on but you have a responsibility if you're going to share something maybe google it for smear but you know side
the time
us by the time slots picks up the fact that it is an illegitimate that thing could have gone viral and again
well we've scientists he goes to that rain with kids are like there was actual potential violence bear based on some of these erroneous main thing is she last election
if it wasn't because of the russians well annoyed it was because of her it was only was a potential it was a combination of reasons is every complicated thing you
i'm not going to make
they ask about a original
the tax plan that came out and i was managing and it in the monologue especially about the tea party part of my base for remembering that that the tea party is there solely because of this issue that debt was going to be our downfall and now they have a taxi when adding taxes that i know but
first it was dead
it was a kid got taxes and not increase of debt and let you cut revenue there's not no revenue
but this happens
that's going to hurt people everywhere around public and gets into office they do this they when the democrat is an office they run on the idea that they're running up the dead because we're not just on it and if mitt romney were president this is a very similar tax planning he would have seen radio interact flannel yeah all ryan has one in four
decade and longer and but i had a reality check because it's not law right we're a long way from that they presented a plan you immediately see republicans who are worried about an election that by the way as one year from monday they're concerned about the fact that it blows a hole and the deficit they are concerned about the fact right here in colorado yeah we could disproportionate
the government has to be huge and we have have to be paying for this enormous government where's that winner know i know what you're saying you're saying
this is the starve the beast theory except they never get around to doing that well done this over and over the swap you have been as should be part of the zig overall deal which is the major chunk of money goes to the military and to medicare social security and that big deal that they always talk about unless you're going to look at those big parts of
money than you can't make a tax cut like that
either
and also to amazon
chris christie new jersey is offering them like five billion dollars in tax breaks because there was competition for them to put up their giant warehouse somewhere really they'll go broke without those tax breaks
alright so one of our favorite refill a as we call them i don't know it for a fact i just know it's true and this has been
so when he started before donald trump this idea i was just like you know there are things that i can prove i just know their true and now that's of course how we actually operate in a governor
but i like to make a list every six months or so for example i don't know it for a fact i just know
not for a fact that matter for it will be played by joe perjury in the movie
i just
i don't know for a fact that if you tried to pull out one of donald trump's hairs the whole thing would unravel like and christmas sweater
back i don't know for a fact that all of sarah huckabee sender sweaters are covered in cat hair i just
for a fact that johnny depp cause friends in the middle of the night and says my durning the nicholas cage
i didn't know commerce secretary wilbur ross his name i would guess it was wilbur wrong
i don't know for a fact that when people talk about seeing other people there are already banning someone else
yeah
i don't know for a fact that vibrator thing del those are lazy
i don't know for a fact that column or sometimes takes and they'd just are the people behind them can see
for a fact that your therapist is infinitely more disturbed than you'll ever be
strangers
there's with the islamic state word
ram
so you wrote the book on isis can't be easy and i remember when you wrote in the atlantic about it and the talk this week from somebody who was making no bones about the fact that he was in with his right yep singing the fight song from his hospital bed
okay and you wrote back in the atlantic in two thousand and fifteen the reality is that the islamic state is islamic very islamic the religion preached by most of it's followers derives from coherent and even learned interpretations of islam what do you mean by that will people say isis has nothing to do with islam
what i'm suggesting is that it's part of the islamic tradition you know the islamic tradition is fourteen hundred years long and it is diverse and isis has a piece of that it is a phenomenon that comes from that tradition it's not the only thing that you can you holiday was islamic but it's looking at things like the idea of a counterfeit like the idea that there are particular
laws that were handed down from the beginning and it is implementing them in a way that would be recognizable to muslims from many many centuries before when people say a religion is it's on was a silly thing to say right because
his bright different people in different ways and with some paypal it is isis and of course many more people it is not but just say it is a religion of peace hopefully to all unfortunately enough to all it most muslims do not consider ice is the best represent notion of the religion but we could say that about various christian sects to and
but really used to talking about christianity is having a crazy fringe a mainstream center peaceful christians warlike like christians and isis happens to be one part of that spectrum with the difference with the islamic world is the the there are many more fundamentalists mainstream people yeah or what we would call
fundamentalists i think the best analog within christianity might be the westboro baptist church which is that this group that used to picket the funerals of servicemen and they pay me that they're like video is even if it's a small group with with isis unfortunately there were about forty thousand people who traveled to syria and yeah i'd on their side so that's a that's a much larger
proportion so when people say
a double standard
how trump or yeah know i think we all agreed trumps solutions are horrible wrote okay i would agree that
his reactions yeah
but they said there's a double standard in the reaction to the vegas violence that we saw the las vegas shooter about a month ago and this are you mentioned the westboro baptist church people mentioned ten nick they they mention anders brother been mentioned the ku klux klan
who is there a difference
i mean there is a big you started to say just a numbers yeah oh we don't even know what happened with big as yet but the difference i think is that isis is claiming part of this tradition so it does have a certain way of of justifying itself that's different from other types of violence doesn't mean that those other types of violence
aren't concerning in fact that in many cases claim much larger numbers fifty nine people in las vegas but what isis is able to do that during this year yeah that's one event and that guy was not trying to acquire nuclear weapons
but he was very that's a big does very effective at killing people from from one hotel room of course but with with ryan that's what we get the sense that
any individual muslim can be activated in an isis mold because of the belief that they can speak to this kind of understanding that isis is reviving a tradition that they have some some part of now that's that's something that i think certain other ideologies don't quite have the ability to do is to to try to
you awaken the sense that we've got the right version of something that you're already part of
what do you think is the effect when people mention this has happened to you because you've written realistically about this so your mirrors why phobic
yeah i i have to look at some of these issues with trump in orange tinted lenses and i understand this is not a great time to be a muslim in the united states muslims are targets of bigotry their targets of actual islam a phobia at the same time at some point you have to engage the bullshit detector
and if someone says isis has nothing to do with islam then i think they're really going to misunderstand what's motivating people to kill and its name
and cuts cutoff debate
it absolutely does yeah i my belief has always been that you you're never going to solve the terrorism problem
unless you modernize the religion that until the religion itself has a reformation enlightenment like christianity did this problem is going to persist would you agree with i think it might even be more dispiriting
situation than that isis in some ways is the reformation within islam they're doing what you know five hundred years ago and christianity we have martin luther saying we don't have to listen to the established church we don't have to listen to the pope ice is saying your neighborhood a mom forget it doesn't always talking about we're the ones we can just read the koran and we're going
to have an interpretation that that is extremely violent but it's the right one even know where the minority so
modernization of islam can go both ways can go in and enlightened way or it can go toward that's unfortunately very violent and again one of the differences i think is that there is more support in a general population when we get this pulling back it seems to show like twenty percent of worldwide muslims are what they would call
as long as they're not terrorists they're not taking and violently but most of the things terrorists believe they believe they would say they want sharia to be represented in government but they might mean something so different from isolated they would hate isis i mean they might they might just believe that in some way the constitution in their country should should reflect
islam but death for leaving the religion
is disconcerting the highest levels of support for that that's right things like that which are not liberal principles know they're not compatible with what i would say
know ideas of human rights that i would recognize okay
let me ask the panel about the politics of this because of course trump immediately flew into action and treated that it wasn't his fault
had moments like that i just hate him so much and
and you know his muslim them is a terrible way to handle this right or minutes not affected that's on american it is bigoted but i also don't know what the democratic position is i mean i saw their responses
it was all about how trump handled it badly which is true but it didn't address the issue itself and said this many times i just think the democrats are blaming it on this issue of terrorism is a real concern to people i really don't i don't think as a democrat or republican issue this is a
very complicated issue as you point out and one of the things you talked about his reforming the religion and you saying it's already been reformed but the fact of the matter is until people are of you know
willing to accept piece as part of their religious tenets this is not going to be solved then i don't think there's a public policy that's going to cure what this is this is something that has to be worked out from the ground up and some kind of organic way and i don't what do democratic in her arms and hands of the heart
the democratic party historically it's your head
tough democrats like franklin roosevelt and harry truman lyndon johnson john f kennedy and then you had sort of a soft version the mcgovern carter etc and i i think as long as the public perceives that a party republican or democrat is not addressing a threat that what they see as a threat
they're going to turn on a question is how do you address that i wanted to address but i guess you here it's important to think about that
fight against isis that the government is embarking on is based on a two thousand and one war authorization after that september eleventh terrorist attack right this is sixteen years and i'm making that if congress there are members in a republican party and the democratic party they would like to actually debate going to war with isis to be able to actually saying this is what we're attempting to do
this is what we are attempting to fight rather than a award
that was fat from very different reasons that could go out and opportunity that they die
we don't know exactly what to do i can tell you what not to do what you don't do is send a an armed force into iraq and remove saddam hussein and on leash of and teen hunger year old sectarian
crowd that's a pass
that's not going to win anybody any alliance they even trump believe that right now what how about how about a democratic politicians standing up and saying we find not only the terrorist acts intolerable what the beliefs behind yeah this idea that were infidels were not infidels and of course i'm not saying all muslim
right
says is the political correctness problem it's it is partly that that some of these beliefs are not liberal riots the liberals are defending a liberal tactics problem i find with that is what do we do about it once we find out what their beliefs are we can't police believe what we have a buddy was find out what people are doing well
what what what is most important to me and what's worrying is the forty thousand people who went over there are these people if they come back they won't be just renting a home depot a truck into a bike path they'll know how to kill people moon an industrial scale so i think what we can do is actually look at the military side and probably have more more
productivity more efficiency than if we looked at why don't want get why don't we treat for example the gender apartheid
saudi arabia the way we treated race apartheid in south africa and the yeah
that is
gay people and i don't mind that it's my dad had all day and ten life three when we don't have a president that believes in those kind of human rights we don't have that
a good job due to tear tell you i don't either just going to life of me why so many liberals are hesitant to say these people will push gays off roofs
you know we cannot cannot get allowed was not out most of them push gays or for was but yes a certain do certain percentage a small percentage right and not all know you're right
islamic group that is hundreds of millions of people who wouldn't do it but think yeah gay people right don't have a right to live i and this is a
what's that started in the fifties i think cut but was the first guy to come to america and take a look at men and women a dancing together and went back and started i think the beginnings of what we see is this radical islamic terrorism so it goes away bands we have to understand words coming from
another reason why trumps planet so stupid is because there's no sense keeping people out this guy was here that sign a of brothers were here the guy who shot up the pulse nightclub in orlando was we should just be more careful
about have having people come into the country without examining for instance social media but how do you know you but the people who kind of manhattan and came here in two thousand and ten
where you're going to be able to seven years in advance that and were added to a terrorist group that at that point didn't even exist well i mean you examine where he's from at least designed with and it from listening some of these experts that use pakistan is a particularly hot bed of this kind of thing
that's not that's rather than that's a lotta of some
again
there was this diversity immigrant visa program that's how we got in here also known as the green card lottery and i didn't know about it and apparently it's for people who are from geographic region regions that are underrepresented like australia being one of them right away a really
i'm talking about australians is too many of them
yeah
oh yeah
if anybody in the hands where that
an example of i was trying to set of policy based on an advantage politically convenient for one party or another were you didn't hear live discussion about fifteen a policy after that vegas dating for example we didn't have a conversation that can control because the party they care most about gun control is not the party that had control of the government right now and that's what this is about more than exact
precisely where they're from or being able to filter through old so the lottery that drives me crazy i mean with would harvard say we're going to have a lottery in the first five i mean
what is that i understand being a welcoming nation that appreciates immigration that's who we are gonna we rebuild but later on i like begged them to come here when they're already than thinking about like we don't have enough decks and this
so every time you mention what got you fired so list and people would probably wondering if they don't remember you tweet sig heil wrote a column
i love nazi
it was about a group called media matters which makes a business to run around and and pressure advertisers to take people off the air television radio show
familiar with ben
yeah absolutely and and i had noticed over time alan dershowitz said that they had a anti semitism problem
i noticed this and other places so i mentioned this in the column and speculated how they would rewrite the first amendment and i put it in their borrowed something for mussolini and did it that way that i said at the anti american spectator was unable to come from the last two words in the draft were see higher
so so then we'd have to say leader is insane purity police nonsense that you have to go away because you made a little joke
i mean the thing that got me was i knew that when they set up these pressure taxes i talked to one of the advertisers on on a rush limbaugh show is not political he's jewish and they went after his business threatened him threatened him with his physical safety attack his business i mean this is not that i bring up the political correct
thing that happened last week because the pitcher for the dodgers you darwish game has no future as a pitcher
wow
but we we only got
but he was there was little controversy and he's a little bit my hero this week because the guy in the other team your what's his name your rio okay he had a home run he was excited he gets in the dugout you'd garbage is from japan he did that thing where he held his eyes to look asian which is not cool no one is condoning it but i turned on the t
i mean no one died you would have thing i mean the world got suspended for five games and here's a new dog your statement he said it's not like i was irritated by it
he did something he shouldn't have done that i wasn't angry at all i was told the next day he wanted to speak to me and i committed to hit communicated to him that it was completely unnecessary yes how about that new rules snowflakes
you know
that everything has to be a federal case i mean there have been people that have been reprimanded for doing a lot less less what you fat or when he said and then there's also the people that have faith zero consequence for saying a whole lot worse
i will point to at real donald tramp which has said a lot of things

that umbrage meter that gets cranked up and and ferry part of sand and it's something that let's go have to trump not this guy well aren't i mean he's gotta go away and and unrelated event raining i think he got the message i don't think he was about to march in charlottesville with the nazis next year i just think he's a baseball player he got excited he did something stupid tell him
oh let it go politico i don't want to do that though and that's the problem thank you colonel time for know

survivor survivors or come forward to say they were really touched by paypal name wine stains basie tobacco ratner pair that dick helper and a half men and george h w bush
i want someone to interview this turkey

i know it was years ago but your have to do that to get a pardon
hero he has done online all day to get the new i phone ten and you're setting up the facial recognition make sure one of the faces you make is this one
that were when you drop it into the toilet know it's you
somebody else to tell these young women that's not leicester hold

neural now that the chill women who were lost at sea for five months have admitted that they never turned on their emergency beacon
i don't want to hear any more jokes about how men one asked for directions

milan and must be in charge of setting the white house clogs during this weekend's time change it simply requires taking the small hand and pushing it back and she has experience with that


neural stop acting so shocked that selena gomez his back together with justin bieber everybody didn't reject a good me why would reject an asshole

and finally no role stop making movies where the hero is a guy who can drive a car
something we let sixteen year olds do what does it say about our psyche that hollywood could always count on men to plunk down ten bucks to watch another man make a motor go wrong room

i recently caught up with baby driver because the critics loved it and i had forgotten that critics are stupid
and it turns out is just one more in a long line of movies like the trends porter series and fast and furious parts one to infinity and
the new wheel man and done in sixty seconds and driven and drive and driver and drive angry and ten others all with the exact same plot when there is a tough job or even an impossible mission the cage to it is a guy who possesses the elite mind blowing skill of driving

the baby driver can get us out of this weather's great driving
in traffic
baby driver do this baby driver so it's indispensable to the highest that the rest of the gang actually hates it because they think he's too young to be that great and driver well everybody but kevin spacey thinks he's do yeah

of course the real world is not so glamorous baby driver is really over driver
because driving is not that hard if baby driver is unavailable you know who else can pick you up after you pull a job your mom
driving is so easy that cars can now drive themselves and the same way that vacuum cleaners now vacuum by themselves there's never been a movie about vacuuming
there was a movie called eat my dust but it was a bad driving
now it baby driver was about an actual baby who could drive that that would be impressive but it's not it's about a man driving a car it isn't impressive because i'm a man who drives a car practically every day and rarely as i'm turning left on velocity epic do i think this would make it
terrific movie

so i know what you're thinking bill
make it a big deal about baby it
true but it gets me to the larger point hear me out what bothers me so much about these driving movies is that it's such a lazy way to be a bad ass
she's you get more of a work out doing this
or even fake doing that when someone says hey how was that movie about the really great driver
and yet every day on the street i see some guy in a muscle car waiting at the lights with the chance to peel out and burn rubber and terrorist town the street like we should all be so impressed that he can do this with his foot

let you know who you never see doing that
a woman
probably have noticed in america lately that there's something wrong with dunes the recent stories of sexual harassment or about many things like misogyny and white privilege and old fashioned being a pig but i'm telling you there is
something toxic about this male laziness if harvey weinstein had made even a minimal effort join jenny craig
shaved
listen generally try to not look like a russian cab driver
he could have attracted women the old fashioned way by being rich and not entirely repulsive
you know
oh these creeps
why no dining no game
no effort to be charming or where you just open the bathrobe and say a lot of my little friend
and when they get turned down with this epidemic of i give up your when i'll just masturbate in front of you
cosby didn't even one is women conscious apparently
currently mark halperin and emma was just to rub these erection against a woman in the office like he's some kind of horny spider monkey who dabbles in political analysis
someone needs to write a book called how to behave with the woman like you're not an asshole

chapters like no one caring a resume wants to see your dick
and no one wants to do it in a room where there's a coffee machine
better

yes i have a long history of shady dealings with russia russia and avoiding taxes
now tell me about your ball

matter felt metaphor not guilty
denied everything and he called the whole investigation of wasting tax dollars that he was avoiding bay
and it says this is all fine because it none of it touches him trumps defense is that he had no involvement with the trump campaign
really
today called the new york times for tell them if not angry at the or investigation that is personally not under investigation and a man with a thirty eight percent approval rating said i've got fantastic poll numbers
and then reporter from and time said can you put your father on the phone
trump is so desperate to distract america from the russia investigation that he took a page that or harvey weinstein spoke today it jacked off into a potted plant
and then he realized oh there was jared

yeah well yeah you're right poor jar jar it is very out of favor with the with donald drop by early forgiving very bad political advice
probably a vodka very pissed to a jared begins in bed now and jarrett says read your daddy
about lucas as president donald jake drug
but trump of course did get the distraction and it was looking for this week i'm sure you heard about this and it was back immigrant who loves isis drove a truck through a crowd in new york city and of course our commander in chief immediately rush into an act into action with this
a series of powerful tweets about how it wasn't his fault

welcome to h b a pipe down from h b o maintenance real time
why do you think trip were so provoked by your play okay
your play with it
your guests in your blood
broadway debut with me
i've been on broadway
oh that's right your own
what what trump did really go ape
was trading about it
do i
he waited till it was over
that show discipline
felony tickets for i think i think said a complicated relationship with me
the way that use twitter at me in the past and danced around without trying to get too angry because i am his base i am demographic
and i am an angry middle aged white guy from the midwest
right then i am his your worst enemy because we the battle is to get as many of the people i grew up with to go with me and that with him and we watched michigan by two votes for precinct that's it
vote for eating right and and so i'm on a mission to make sure that doesn't happen again not just in michigan
yeah
i'm making a film about him to right now he knows that and and he he was on fox news during the election year bragging about how he and i had dinner a couple of times and a wall he's a great guy he's a great guy and he's and i'm like and he's doing this because he's he knows that crossover where i live those eight
million obama voters that voted for trump or also people who with me and so we're in this battle for that that group that will probably decide the next election he needs to come after me and i say bring it on

and democrats effectively battle against gerrymandering republican gerrymandering we gotta do what we did on tuesday that is we have to when gubernatorial races
next year they're thirty six gubernatorial races including here in california tenant a tap large estates if we want to have veto power over bad maps that number one number two winning more citizen the legislature
the legislature but remember the governor's can veto that's why i was so important to to that the gubernatorial race so once again we gotta get out there with data vote next year's to keep because if we control statehouses and
two thousand and eighty will be able to read can figure these districts and twenty twenty two the new saying is when they go low we go local

sarah do you think conservative comedian would ever travel around the country and meet people with radically different beliefs like you did
i don't know i haven't met one
you know conservative comedian dennis miller yeah i actually he was on the first people who went to get on my shelf as i interviewed people who have been chain road and i didn't want to only you know and i bet they got gonna hard now i really don't know
it's a huge fan i left as black and white special
bhutto was gonna say something or another

hey you can i try not to hey as sexually i think about him because it why because i don't i like he like hold his breath when he comes and there
tanks
why i will never let you out the house
now i find abhorrent i i don't like people who don't look at the spirit of a thing like when you decide to look at kneeling nfl players and decide to not hear what they're talking about say it's about the military that's bullshit
you got it right for
not breathing during orgasm to nailing for the like combat sexual fantasies center i see appears
life is complicated
we don't know chris did something about the trump era make you want to revisit bobby kennedy's lights and like this is the obvious that he's a man of heart
when empathy for people from can express empathy with a widow he doesn't have a bobby we go to the black community to dr king was killed
show him to the you have to make yourself vulnerable you can't just walk going to be tough with all the armor own kind of got to walk in and let yourself get hurt he walked into it the cops wouldn't come in and he had the old tape the they know you know he has to tell and it were up
power of winning and he basically was in his awkwardness
he was true and he ended up saying things like we have to say a prayer for our country and our people but it was all like my brother was killed by a white guy was awkward and yet here is telling people to the greatest hero in history of their history certainly and he's dead be killed by waco innovations killing and here to tell them that he could do it i knew anybody else could do that in light of all
sex scandals lately what do you say about the kennedys bobby and giant were both i don't know they can only guess the important thing about them
okay up be the important thing but soon as you date on people's lives they didn't they didn't things back then
and will loose me and i'll respond to each point where i think kennedy certainly was fucking a mafia occurred that was a problem

you know how to head over sir bobby
no no i having fun is really important in a language and robin has gone into iraq it's for three years of the rankings could be he's going into the yet now dubbed labour guys you go ahead and got to be nice
meanwhile she eyes years in jail economy good to meanwhile the old bands ask the kind gonna grab you give money in west virginia what else i hard to figure out anything else i mean bobby's working against this against a family on issues were going against the i a good as his brother's girlfriend jack kennedy is having sex with jim kind of girl for
this is a problem and and bobby stop stopped from doing it and mayor you have to see i know where they were july when he was a good marilyn monroe or think they both got in there
i mean that's not the against a big deal
in a night case i mean it is will find a book written about want to read about his public life
i'm going to tell a quick by use lose do it was eleven years old my parents took us the washington so we could see the capital and our government and i was eleven and i got separated from them and the capitol building and i went into the elevator blame mistake and it was a man reading a paper there and the door shirts in the paper comes down and it's bobby can
and i a young man would you watch i said yes i've lost my parents and and when the elevator doors open on the next four he took me to the capitol police so they could put the radio out that there was a child and then he stayed there with me until my parents came talking to me about michelle
the senators from michigan

no it's amazing the big win for diversity across america in fact we have now elected across america seven trans candidates and this is all thanks to a president who has taught us that is okay for men to wear makeup i think about
this was largely they say a vote against donald trump even though he wasn't on the ballot chance for people across the nation to speak up about how they feel about him after a year of living with him in office and it was kind of like that moment in air force one when harrison ford says
get off my play
and the did they say or voters in the suburbs they have had enough of this republicans tried to scare them with immigration rhetoric but mexicans coming here and it totally backfired turns out suburban white people are much more freaked out about the possibility of having to mold their own long
you know this was the new strategy called trump ism without trump and it turns out if you want to win in today's republican party you can't fake being an asshole you have to take all
and we know who the authentic asshole is he's in asia right now
this trump is on his trip to asia he was in japan oh my god talk about as well
he was in japan two days ago he was imploring the japanese to shoot down missiles of korea fire them and he said to the japanese you're a warrior nation you're a country of samurai warriors
he asked what they're going to know about godzilla always taking down the power
warrior
but just summarizes like the japanese present it came over here and said america cowboy bang bang
shoot man for snoring
and that it was on to china he's been there for three days china of course exposes the big differences between our country and china china's can totally embraced globalization
embraced addressing climate change robotics aerospace high speed rail trump on the other hand all in on closed borders and coal
it's like seeing another kid doing long division more yours is in the sand box playing with cat poop
and tomorrow of these are off to vietnam
just the thought of it the bone spurs started acting up again
yeah he's scheduled that's a big thing with the trump this on this trip because in vietnamese scheduled to meet with vladimir put going to find yeah that he's going to get a christmas bonus

right







i gave recovery disk our last show and so i know
we will that january nineteenth talk about all the mass shootings and masturbating accurate
make america the greatest got very the world
yeah you know what i do too
bric a brac about
i think we all a little break right i mean this has been a tough year for america for truth for women
for a potted plants
i don't even know where to start with the harassers i watched entertainment tonight was it was it the half hour of mental odell throwing up into a bucket
but if there's any bright spot in down in alabama where roy moore's
and you'll admit it
from alabama
roy more is running for on the republican ticket his opponent the democrat in alabama doug jones is ahead in the polls while in alabama

political experts are saying that his recent surge is due to not fucking kid
yeah that's where we are in america more has nine accusers now add boer said he would not drop out more had a press conference yesterday judge roy more he said we need these not dropping out because he said we need moral value back in our country
and then o j came up to discuss anger management
guys
you gotta get
yeah i mean all these accusers they're coming forward one girl said that roy more hit on her when she was at the mall
as you do when you're the district attorney in your thirties
so she didn't give me her phone number so roy more called the principle of her school who colder in
you know it is
here it is excuses he said i don't remember dating any girl without the permission of her mother
i'm a shovel risk child molester
that's where it
alabama of course a high school seniors and mills
that

i mean when i think of alabama back that i think of they're horrendous civil rights record but you know forget the police dogs get that the to stop pumping my leg
and you know he was you heard this roy more was banned from the mall
too creepy for an alabama mall
like being too fat for the iowa state fair

too high for a burning man i mean
and then there's another woman who came forward or said she went to see roy more in his office and nine hundred ninety one just signs in custody papers and more grabbed her very heard in the but she was twenty eight but more says in his defense she looked much younger
so you know fox news is not really wanted to talk too much about the sexual harassment when it was roy more or donald trump or everybody at fox news
and then al franken came along yes
very disturbing i was so shaken i called bill cosby to see that the economy

but
as i'm sure you know by now when i was on a us o tour in iraq in two thousand and six whitley and tweet and he released a picture where he is mock groping her while she's sleeping not cool at all and then he wrote a sketch where they were kissing as a pretext to actually force a kiss on her this is what she says so als a friend
but now i gotta tell you if you're right a comedy sketch where you al franken
here's a model and the next line of dialogue isn't get off of me creepy it's not comedy it's science fiction
so
he did a bad thing
become a nation has been universal which he deserves what he doesn't deserve is to be lumped in with roy more for kevin spacey

or donald trump
on time
cause his accusers wires threatening to soon the did long riffs at his rallies we would say that they were too ugly for him to assault
plus with al franken we're talking about one incident trump has sixteen accusers roy more has nine
more spend more time chatting up young girls at the mall santa claus
so how how about another need to campaign where i can tell too unlike things apart me too
i know that different route a man who once acted like a dick and a man who is a dick

i know the difference dream someone who behaved like a high schooler and someone who targeted high schoolers
yeah
in overseas news
but there is some overseas i trump got back from this big twelve day to you see this his speech it to declare his twelve asian trip a huge success
a trip been anybody ever had they love me more than ababa over there and you see this speech yesterday oh my god he was racing like i think of it
nothing
taking a drink some water you just say that he never actually fought in vietnam but he still came home with a drug problem i don't know

everybody made a big deal of him taking the water you know what i don't care if trump drank water during his speech i wanted to see if trunk can keep talking when put put in and takes a drink the water
you got a great
oh he's hilarious chelsea handler is back
environmental activists an author of the novel radio free vermont a fable of resistance bill mckibben

okay so it's better year here on our last show because this has been a year where we saw a terrible things happen with the environmental movement
and i was very dismayed to see last week the paris accords which were so in two years ago none of the industrialized countries or even close to meeting their marks and they're not mandatory
the scariest in a way was what happened in china where they've actually been pretty good about putting in a lot of renewable power last year they're cool cool use when a because they had a we drought california style drought in they couldn't run their hydro electric dams businesses
i think it's starting to happen a vicious feedback cycles are starting to kick in the we had a record rise three parts per million and the amount of carbon in the atmosphere last year and were afraid it's because oceans forest to have been damage to the point where there are no longer absorbing carbon as quickly as they used to
right on the edge it's the moment to be moving fast yeah i've heard that three years were right on the edge we got her start moving fast
a i mean in some ways we're right over the edge i was in yeah center was two nights ago talking with people who come through the fires me this is as close as we get to sort of the definition of the good life in america beautiful place huge vat of wine everywhere there's people
fleeing for their lives and watch them not making it out that kind of thing happens someplace on this planet every day now
and you know there's another conference going on this week in bonn germany and the trunk of administration showed up with a plan
for coal
they're trolling the climate agreement meeting is now they got troll right back all four hundred people who were at the sitting in the room for this call presentation just got up and left and
this or that i mean the rest of the world's like electric cars solar batteries whatever the trump administration's like we've got some great eighteenth century technology that we'd like
yeah rick perry wants to subsidize coal and maybe whale oil after that
when you think about that someone did a study report a few weeks to go there's more people in america who work at our obese roast beef sandwiches than mine call in a rational world will be having oval office summit center of roast beef policy you know
the real jobs
a real thing we should be subsidizing is sun and wind which we desperately need and you ever convince deny or have you ever been able to take some of the side and just talk to them calmly and rationally and have them go well i see your point i must have been wrong all these years this is this is the right question the week before thanksgiving
my advice would be don't wreck dinner sort of trying to argue with your crazy on call the most most people to seventy percent of americans understand what's going on the thirty percent who don't aren't going to be convinced by the next
study of infrared absorption patterns in the stratosphere or whatever
believe what they believe for ideological reasons if you spent the last thirty years marinating in rush limbaugh you'd be impervious to reason to
i think
right responses to say we had to take that seventy percent and get them active and engaged in this fight or at least some part of them if you just can't stand it at thanksgiving you know turn to him and say you may not believe in global warming but
mobile warming believes in you
and i want to get your opinion on the economics of this because i don't think this has brought up enough the economics really we know how it affects the environment
the argument that it's going to ruin jobs which is of course not true but it's also true that the people who are poor
generally don't care about the environment when you cannot blame them because they have the argument as they have more immediate problems and they do i'm just making the plant that income inequality very much impacts environmental progress as long as people are living hand to mouth they kind of can't be i'd always heard this
right
environmentalism is something rich white people do if you didn't know your next meal is coming from you wouldn't be an environmentalist and we started organizing three fifty dot or first thing we did was this global day of action we had fifty two hundred demonstrations in one hundred and eighty one countries people were sending in pictures from every corner of the planet it took me about
half an hour of watching those come in on flicker to realize that pretty much everybody we were working with was poor black brown asian young because that's what the world consists of i think you can make a pretty good argument at this point that rich white people may represent more of the environmental problem on all so
can get away
thanks to the mean you know that rich word prevents self logan
so let me ask you about this elephant thing because i saw a great documentary this year called when giants fall you can get google it and you'll see you can see it on the internet and it's about the elephants in their plight and trump he's kind of hedging on it now you like any was saying yes they were going to undo the obama role because we have to
do everything obama of course that you couldn't take your trophies from killed elephants back here to the states what do you think of that because there actually are some environmental people what this is just done junior protection act you know roaring back to bring back
it goes hand in hand with i mean he's he's saying we're going to take a pause on this one today because there were so much resistance to it maybe he could also perhaps pause the new rule they put into effect earlier this year that lets you let's hunters shoot hibernate needing bears in their dens
hey look i think there's there's sportsmen i think there's a contest in the white house every day what's the coolest thing you can think of and whoever wins gets to wear the red hat for the next day or just
have anyhow
we a lot to him in the hope is in the resistance and i have been a good but it's got to start resort to this well that's right and sign virginia that the resistance starting to elect
hello



there are non resident fellow at the modern incident at west point max broke and back
n political commentator and journalists like icon oh with bob woodward brought down all the president's and carl bernstein
she's a writer at large from eric magazine and author of all the single ladies now in paperback rebecca traced
over time tonight so we're good answer them after the show on youtube
well you
it's not original at all to ask you to compare
for the watergate
it's terrible but i have to i just want to specifically about last week when he was in vietnam trump and he was talking about prudent and he said he said he didn't let i asked the gun you can only are so many times that's a real now you can only ask how many times every time he sees me says i didn't do that and i really
we believe that when he tells me that he means it i think he's very insulted by it
he so protective of pollutants feelings this to me seems like public collusion is there such a thing is that impeachable public collusion i don't think it's impeachable i think that his conduct in terms of his embrace of proven without any thought given to the
actions and to undermine our elections in this country
his extreme and it's a reason we have a special prosecutor trying to get to the bottom of what occurred what drop may have
perhaps enabling helping to enable what the russians did or not we don't know where this is going to go what we do know is there is a cover up going on and the president does not want us to know what to cover up his about whether it's indeed about something that happened with enabling the russians
as to do with his family money what we know as he saw to mean undermine obstruct not necessarily obstruction of justice obstruct these investigations to keep us from knowing what this is really about and that's why we have a special prosecutor we're going to find out presumably what this is all about i hope
i guess what i'm asking is it that's all in the past but it seems like crimes are happening in the present it seems to me first of he's calling our own former cia head and national security head hacks while he goes he's up to put it's like his
his his favorite national foreign policy advisor on russia is potent and on china edgy
that that's to me
part of the problem you've identified it is how do you separate what might be criminal what might be a conspiracy from the merely outrageous and vile and it's very difficult to do in this presidency with an average president and that's what we're trying to sort out that's why the press has been so good
the old fashioned mainstream media has coaxed out these stories about both aspects of possible criminality as well as indeed a present in the united states too many people in the congress republicans believe is unfit to be the president and that's part of the story too
the military people in the highest ranks of the intelligence services republicans in congress their own large number of them who believe he's not fit to be presidents are all these things are coming together with possible conspiracy and yet the outrageous daily
cheese and wine on a scale with never seen by modern presidents and then there's also something we can do as citizens you know it's easy to feel powerless and sort of oh please muller save us but on the homefront as individual citizens we can be more responsible for the information we take in any information that we pass
online
evaluate online information that sort of the way we reevaluated free love in the eighties
you know it's great it's wonderful but there are consequences it's not free you have to be safe and responsible about where you put it
going to get to that
the other thing is that the companies that are profiting from the dissemination of this information could also play a part and being more responsive oh yeah february so that facebook and twitter i think need to take a lot more responsibility for the information
helping to determine the outcome of this election and the fact that we have this vial guy to begin with what about wiki leaks and then we learned this week that wiki leaks is in contact or was during the campaign with don junior among the things they direct messaging each other hi dawn
this is from i assume julian hassan
hi dawn if your father loses loses in quotes
we think it's much more interesting if he does not concede and spends time challenging the media and other types of rigging it's hard to imagine that coming from anybody but a russian agent
and i mean done i guess complete idiocy that he didn't know any be right

whether he will colluding with them are plainly they were colluding with him
and okay so wiki leaks
talk about a fall from grace and where we've seen it with a lot of men lately
i mean wiki leaks is to be a champion of seemingly what they're absolutely not helping with right now what this is where this weird ideological crossover took place and you could feel it a little bit during the election and there was a lot of push back to you know wiki leaks was championed by a segment of the last i think for a very good reason
for a long time and yet we can get aches itself seemed to be already early on champion in championing donald trump and maybe the any logical thing they had in common at least over the past couple years is a shared desire for hillary clinton to lose the presidential election in two thousand and sixteen
oh he landed our right shown a real and demands through ball antipathy to the united states originally when we saw their first releases
well he said the economy
equal opportunity disclosures they've been nothing in the time they've been pawns particularly of the russians they're not an equal opportunity disclosure
infinite
what a good comparison question we live now in the post truth error that wasn't true of watergate worker good wound up being kind of a victory because you intrepid reporters did with the first amendment says you can do and you on earth the truth
but there wasn't what i call state tv which is fox news who are giving this alternative reality and that there are so many people the people who watch fox news
the of thing has just made up that just fake and as you're just saying about twitter and facebook and passing on information that isn't real i don't even know what's real anymore when i read something i think you've got a small piece of it with fox but it's much deeper in there that we now have a culture in which
apple by and large and increasingly are not looking are interested in the best obtainable version of true too many people and this is very different from the time of watergate are looking for information to undergo to underscore and reinforce what they already believe that they're not open and goes for people on the left as well as the right
there's no monopoly here and what happened in watergate and there's not an equivalency know there is not a asymmetrical there's no question it's a metaphor is among the willingness to look at science among other things
but but we do not have a culture open to the best obtainable version of the truth in our citizenry the way we did at the time of of watergate and one of the key differences is what watergate our institutions work not just press the judiciary the congress in the united states supreme court
the republican party which was heroic in barry goldwater the nine hundred and sixty four nominee and his party march into the white house and telling richard nixon he must resign we don't see a republican party now now seems to be interested in principle above party or the best obtainable version of the truth
this is a big difference between watergate and what we're seeing today
yeah
point about this sort of fractured attentions and the ability to burrow into our own ideological home wherever that may be within a new kind is more democratize media and i agree with you about all the ways and it's problematic but it is also true that when media was consolidated in the way that it was in the watergate era and you had three networks and it every
but he was looking in the same direction at the same time response could be better organized and you might be able to sort out your news sources better but at the same time that consolidated power meant that certain stories where it towards you could have the three networks but they didn't necessarily cover shirley chisholm speech at the nineteen seventy two convention and so there was a very it was a very narrow lands bit determined
some of the news that we got so there is a kind of democratizing impact of having social media even though i agree with you about all the ways in which it's problem and have a totally different media configuring night but even then we had other magazines less mainstream news but we're developing stories too but you're right in that that today we've got
a smorgasbord although one thing that has not changed is that at least three times in my lifetime a conservative has won the white house because the left has split wide open
let's not forget nineteen seventy nine that jimmy carter was challenged for the presidency by joe kennedy for being too conservative if you can believe that and the middle left and the far left split apart and through that gap roared a b movie actor named ronald reagan that started a conservative revolution
so reagan didn't when we lost because we turned on each other and didn't know how to compromise and come together okay we're going to get to
gregory
a lot of people do get their news from the show right i in this is smart people are
always see this as a service where we're going off the air for a while we do future add lives because people are not going to know what's going to happen
next generated so we predict their lives for you get your headlights

a host of problems they talk show on that and i was dreaming episodes read second season one of our favorites chelsea handler



i'm going to rather some positive energy and are going to get excited about what happened in virginia would happen in new jersey we had a lot of good news is we had a lot of
as you said earlier it's the resistance but there were women who have that sixteen when in emily's list sponsored thirteen wine and got elected in virginia house of delegates
forest african americans like day we had our first latina selected and that stay we had our first trans gender percent
that had we had our first asian american woman
virginia has a delicate so delicate it's it is it is an important time and in there are things to recognize that are happening the world is getting browner and gay or and everybody needs a hop on
but now i mean it is a devastating circumstance that were and but there are good things happen so we have to kind of hold onto that her by my first question
well i was gonna ask you what's going on with you though
we get all that we have you take it anymore
we care about you not doing yourself any more you're more of an activist now i have to be i feel like to know what i had money i don't have to work spend my time trying to get elected we need women and office we do

i think elizabeth warren really has to run for president that's the
mostly at this
i had somebody emily's was recruited they took her and said you should run for office yes
i mean this is a great organization for anybody who wants to support women to support so nineteen percent of the house is only nineteen percent of
twenty one percent of but women vote why don't they threw themselves
well i think we had i mean this is my personal opinion and i think this is i think we had a thing where women have a trial our problem supporting other women and powerful
situations they don't have a problem electing a predator but they have a problem letting somebody who stayed with a predator mean like with hillary it was like well we can liked her because she's with but they don't have a problem electing the man so it's almost like there's a backlash on women that don't support women and now that we have this maniac in office i think
women are like oh shit
this is not what we planned on i think the backlash that we're seeing now with the sexual harassment and everything is is the reactions it's from being the president of our country but he still one word when right
and that was after the hollywood actors
you think the his child molester with more and more different i feel like that as a litmus test and getting about truth that as a litmus test for whether fox news in the crowd can make something just because lorrie moore's about everything is well she's lying or that yearbook is a forgery or the
news know he's godzilla blaming tokyo
he's literally saying well tokyo was asking what do you expect you know but there's a big difference between somebody and taking accountability and responsibility for for an act and somebody giving blanket denials and then accusing their accusers of lying and then
pretending they're going to see them on what grounds i don't now because i'm a winner
more than one person that comes forward then you take that seriously i agree with you on al franken i'm sorry he's not a predator we all know anybody who's marrying a yes that's not true

also i feel like we've lost our ability to think in this country to tell unlike things
i mean there's a difference between zero tolerance we have zero tolerance of that a maximum punishment does everything have to be i mean we don't have that for murder there are different grades of murder and other crimes not for this i think that the focus on the punishment and on what the repercussion is going to be is where this
conversation goes wrong and i think it's largely steered by a media that immediately after a picture is published says do you think he should resign like within three hours somebody handed out of the concert many has it right the media sets up the conversation it is not the on telling the stories here are coming for these guys jobs directly in fact many they were going i don't know i feel we i don't know what it means but they but the focus
on the what the punishment is going to be is also on some level and easier conversation to have because then we get to fight about it should resign and we are good or a partisan battle seasons than actually looking at the more difficult conversation which is that it is about the whole culture it's about the culture that empowers white men to abuse their power in a million ways from the villa
and his predators to the fact that there is a sense of humor that we all understand in this country that if a woman's asleep it's funny to grab her tits and that a man can gain power and stature in a place in the public sphere my profiting from that from that comedy that doesn't make him the same is harvey weinstein and it's not about him it's about reckoning with the fact that we make that culture we participate in that culture
it's er good politicians it's our friends are
zhao
could be having about this moment not should resign and will a governor
right but i think that conversation we are having i think we're deciding like okay now it's become into you know there's a tipping point happening this is happening everywhere what are we going to do about it what are the repercussions going to sex rehab in arizona at the meadows is that going to fix army right right
i mean now are a larger problem that we have not been able english culture to look at things context
yes she's are going to make distinctions politics
in our views of gender in all kinds of questions the inability to recognize context as we all important as big of the truth taxed on together individually
surely the truth and that's the internet is everything
kelly
talk and say it was known congress had only one troubling as it goes to meet you
goes to the questions were discussing here
it also means indications of beer is a possibility that after these special prosecutor is permitted to finish his investigation
possible he won't find a conspiracy but yet there will be one would hope a report did put everything into context that's what we lack on a daily basis in our culture can i ask just about the pole
but it is kind of important who's in the senate right now i mean that's why they're willing to put up with maybe a child molester to get the vote for the tax cuts that's how they play the game i'm not suggesting we go there or that floor but al franken can't be in this and we don't need his vote because we do
do we do need his vote on things that affect millions and millions of people so we can do two things at once we can i have learned to be okay of course we can my complaint is with the fact that it immediately goes to the and eight
to people just wrote that or said that you just
oh i see the and they said a tramp will he firebomb mahler it's i don't say that don't give him any fucking idea
but it occurred to him
also he needed to put the news what i heard
some people who are making this argument yesterday was well we have to get rid of al franken because otherwise it's a push they're going to say al franken we say lorrie moore and this is what democrats always do they shrink from making the counter argument instead of going there with oh well we can't win this we just going to go away let him resign make the counter i don't
i just the monologues
these not the zodiac killer
same thing

and then had should be able to point out that al franken reaction is to begin an investigation into his behavior and that given not to not to given cookies that's correct that's a good response we should also have an investigation into the sixteen women who have accused donald trump
yeah
that shirt listen this is what i was saying earlier was the reaction to women voted for dallas out the act the reaction of women voting for somebody who admitted on tape that he's a sexual predator he admitted it was bragging about it they went and voted for him and that that after effect i think that pendulum of looking at what they've done
i think has led to this i believe that i think women are sick and tired of being sick and tired not to go of the civil rights movement that women are just like now my god look what we did and better late than never
i want women and stick up for each other and look out for each other i never silicate any hobby wife seem bullshit like that
but this has to be this has to be
because we don't want to find ourselves in the exact same trap we found ourselves after obama because right after obama got elected suddenly everybody was spouting that we were living in a post racial society which is it all the shit at four hundred years to get here and we can't say suddenly we're living in a post sexist society because remember
while all this is happening right now we're talking about this great backlash people are speaking up the number two movie in the country is storing mel gibson all right so let's not pretend this is going to go away overnight this has to start with our kids what we teach them how we teach little girls to fight back and we teach little boys to respect girls this has to be
wrong cultural game that we play for the next generation
okay
one other aspect
say anything i just want to go on the record and say that i'm currently dating mel gibson
as fact that he visited
yeah i forgive you doubt that is hunting for him know
really i almost was going to ask your how's it going
he knows i like older man not battle
yeah

okay
yeah and speaking about that defensive harvey weinstein have about well hey it's not my fault i grew up in the sixties
was that okay
wasn't like that
we're not used to wear got taliban has ever one in the washington post
six years everything has changed ready it was never ok to masturbate in front of a coworker

but even back in the good old days raid oh god
obviously it
three we're in we're in a moment culturally a great reckoning year and it also comes from earlier than what we're seeing his party would continue first wave of feminism
whole idea of violence against women having the kind of currency in our culture today in terms of the way we discuss it
there is it comes from what we've been doing over the past twenty twenty five thirty years this is not or like yours
come out of this moment is what i was going to say
al franken accuse early and britain has forgiven him and said he should her opinion is injured and step down
and i said a couple of weeks ago we were talking about the baseball player who made the objective asian thing with his eyes he was making fun of a putting was just teasing and but it's a big dance and you can't and the baseball player the japanese vapor for boy said that's not a big deal to me i forget i said you can't be more offended than the victim
if his accuser and it's only want to kills are now if we find out tomorrow it's eight more and i don't think it will be but if we do different story but what she says that isn't that game over you can't be more offended than the person
this is happening in a time when people are just so self righteous we have to stop letting fives self righteous millenniums at the huffington post goalie everybody into having opinions that they don't really hold
but we have to be careful because we created those our generation we ride it and it's a well as a parent
her generation to be this way and we have to be careful next time to say listen it's not just about you you gotta take your lumps you have to listen you have to talk you have to have a dire have exactly and people we've had guess to cancelled on this show because they don't want to talk about this subject people don't want to talk that's that's a tear
casualty that this country is facing i was written let me read this quote i don't even know who this is diploma
as i am i ok
okay i'm sure he's very good at what do you guys electronic music i'm reading on a plane reading rolling stone magazine this made me cry reporter your twitter used to be really wild now you've toned it down why diploma whoever he is
every once in awhile he said i'm a political it i just get millions of people attacking me i don't really feel like being a catalyst for arguments on the internet whether it's politics or whatever sarcasm doesn't travel well over the of it especially being a white dude on the internet i don't have any past is aiming sarcastic or funny so he just shuts up and i see that all the time
people just won't talk a not worse
aren't bees it's like a swarm of bees coming at jack that's okay that's it lesson that's kind of somebody who's on ecstasy probably all the time he's a detail
you have to take into account that you're right people get shy they get gun shy especially actors in our industry people don't want to they have a brand that they want to protect they want to protect the midwest and south and if they're selling clothing or whatever luckily there are people that don't give a shit about that
all left this now
julia have a culture a twenty four hour screaming
but it's i genuinely hunters for the laugh because you cannot write aim to love diversity and multiculturalism if you're not willing to have an open and on i love it when you have open and honest dialogue eventually accidentally some people might get offended by what we have to hang in there i respond and so franken is a good example of his first apology
she was kind of crap though like it was guy was trying to be funny that was that was not good right
that defense gets old real quick and goes very quickly to the ladies are just humorless then he gave a second longer statement it was really good and one of the things that we have to get better at in addition to not just shutting out of the people who are going to be overzealous in their criticism is also talking about the people who are criticized giving them the chance to wreck
in with whatever it is they're being criticized for and gave everybody on both sides of the equation a chance to discuss it what happened with franken and his accuser is that he gave a good apology and she accepted it that model can happen more rather than just everybody yelling at he did and why there's still people saying you must go away
we're really in the midst of the cold civil war in this country
in terms of our culture and perhaps trump has brought it to the point of near ignition
but is it possible that we could have a debate in which right and left republicans and democrats is it possible to have a fact based debate no question
it's not as i agree we cannot have a fact those debate in this culture and that but i'm not sure maybe asymmetrical but that lies at the bottom of a lot of what we're talking about so what what about bill clinton show for you to imagine being molested by an older man
then that man denies ever doing it and then goes on and gets elected to united states senate and when either broderick to yeah chelsea handler i can imagine and goes into how she said she was raped bell kind of at but the unlike the the right you then said oh you have a point i say i'm so sorry i
apologize every first of all every victim deserves to be heard anyone who's alleging any sort of assault or this needs to be listened to you can do we look at go clinton well do we have to go back to look at bill clinton and i mean i think this mean isn't the jury out on that we got what bill clinton was okay he had a lot of sex with a lot of people and and yeah
we know we're now we're talking about four stacks which marseille riots right i mean right you're right do we have to go back and look at that yes i'm not going to disbelieve a woman i'm a woman and it is my job right now we're in the area where we have to believe everyone and because we've done such a poor job at believing each other's one of the reason
one of the reasons that i think it is crucial that we go back as part of this conversation and look at bill clinton is because the timing of what happened with bill clinton was really crucial to the development this conversation about sexual harassment it was right after the anita hill hearings in which that term sexual harassment and what it meant to win
as a class of the way that this behavior disadvantage and economically and professional i came into the lexicon and feminist made this point even though clarence thomas's a to the supreme court despite being accused of sexual harassment by anita hill and then immediately after bill clinton is elected president and there is because he is better for feminist policy then the twelve
years as and this is the politics you're talking about it and because there is a right wing attack on him and those things are simultaneously true there is a left feminists defense of bill clinton's power abuse with regard to monica lewinsky and that the rails the clarification of the conversation around sexual harassment
so chronologically before we even get to whether we believe when he broderick there is a derailment have that conversation in the nineties when the left is moved to defend bill clinton right after we've just talked about what sexual harassment means so it's important to go back and talk about it on the other hand we can't just make this about bill clinton and not the guy who's currently in the white house not the guy who wants to be
in the senate that and were aired send it right now frankly the stakes are higher with a trumpet
this guy should i appreciated
now
please tell me that one trump pass these kids hey what's with all the ridiculous face mega one of them said he offers
masturbation has to get back to the basics

as depicted here and bought a chili's masterpiece mary age twelve get to visit from judge drawing board
and since this will be president drugs first christmas in the white house i thought it would be appropriate to take a page out of christmas favorites like a christmas carol and it's a wonderful life where a character is shown an alternative reality to their lives like when an angel then clara
it's chose george bailey what the world wouldn't be like if he never been born her what if donald trump
had never been born

it was that is good for you is it was for me

now and a christmas carol ebenezer scrooge is visited by the ghost of christmas past and since donald trump is truly be ebenezer scrooge of our time angry rich and hard to look at

your father was a strict authoritarian is that where it all started to go wrong because you know you aren't always the wrestling villain you are today you used to say things like
looking to make tremendous amounts of money on looking to enjoy my life
donald trump saying there's more to life than money what happened to this donald trump did you hide him with your russia connections
did you divorce someone to hit men applause
you even used to show humility no matter how great a person may be there was always that element of luck

and when run a barren asked you what was more important work or love you said
i would probably choose love to laugh
not pussy grabbing
casual don it's a slippery slope to compassion because they all trump even used to worry about the poor new york city has been becoming a shitty of the jerry
actually and unfortunately in the middle class and having
here that you would knowledge the existence of poor people i know it's so strange during those words they'll come outta your mouth it's like when the little girl in the exorcist
your mother acts cats and now
