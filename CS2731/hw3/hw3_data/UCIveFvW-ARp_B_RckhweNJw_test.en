Literally every post is someone shitting on Crowder. I feel like this subreddit has been set up purely for the intention of shitting on him as much as possible, comments included.Ever want to have a conversation with like minded people? Come to the discord fan server and talk with us!

https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/80bu6t/video_or_podcast_suggestions_ends_3518/duvem4x?utm_source=reddit-androidFor starters: I am a huge fan of Steven Crowder and I have been following him for a few years on YouTube. He  has fantastic content and I brings up really great conversations. 
I have not become a mug club member (yet) and consume most of his content on YouTube and on his website. 

The question: He sites sources on the video but I would love to looks though the places he pulls his content so that I can get more knowledgeable as well (especially for political discussions with friends/family). 

Does Louder With Crowder have a place where I can see the sources or links to the sources? (Maybe in the bottom of a YouTube video, bottom of a web article, or a page on website that is dedicated to it) Hear me out. He does make some good points, and I like his change my mind series. It’s good, raw, discussion about political topics.

However, I’m not sure how trustworthy he is. I remember in one of his videos where he debunked climate change myths, he mentioned the Antarctic icecaps melting.

He was right when he said that Antarctica is actually still gaining ice as we speak.

This was misleading though, since Greenland is losing ice as well. It’s losing so much, that the planet as a whole is losing ice at a rapid rate. It’s a net loss.

Either he wasn’t doing his research, or he was purposefully trying to mislead his viewers.

This bothered me a lot.I heard that he does post his upcoming locations and subjects on his twitter page, but I honestly can’t find them? he spends so much time with individuals who can’t even accurately define the terms of the conversation. It just makes it frustrating to watch as the only argument he needs to make is that they don’t know the what the words they’re saying actually mean and then he tells them to fuck off. We had to write an essay and argue on some website she gave us. My friend and I chose an article on emotions vs logic (feminism involved) my professor essentially tore it about and gave me a 50% said I had sexist views and said I completely dismiss that we live in a white supremacist society. My friend wrote about the same thing and got a 100% Wtf do I do? So SxSW bans  Crowder and Jared from coming to SxSW so he sends two  employees in his stead to do a troll video. Its funny how all of his previous troll videos never amounted to being removed from youtube or suspended on twitter. Its like there was something different about this one considering. Could it be due to the fact that he was told he was not welcome to SxSW. Crowder sound like he is trying to play the victim card while the situation is not as black and white as he is trying to sell it.Maybe this is just conspiracy theory but has anyone noticed having trouble with accessing YouTube content in general? I have a great deal of trouble accessing a variety of  content for the past few days while logged into my YouTube account but have had no trouble whatsoever with my work pc for the same content. I am curious if YouTube may be throttling accounts that subscribe to conservative/libertarian content. Wasnt able to tune into the livestream while it was happening so I'm trying to watch it now. For some reason it says the video is unavailable now that i try to pull it up, did YouTube remove the live stream after it ended for some reason? I just recently saw his intro to a segment where he judges "everything wrong with Seth Meyers." He starts off claiming that Seth has traded politics for comedy and then says "he isn't funny and no one likes him." Obviously we can't take this literally because it would be very wrong, but how are we supposed to take that statement? I'm pretty simple minded, so I tend to take things as they are said, and that just makes Crowder look like an ass. He isn't the judge of funny. Does this guy even do stand-up comedy? I got some entertainment out of his videos where he is talking calmly to some dick head who thinks they know it all and can't handle even talking about a subject they think is radioactive.
But that one where that young conservative socialist calmly talks about socialism and Crowder loses his cool is a real bummer. 
It's obvious he was on edge that day but far out, the guy was totally playing by the rules.I disagree with him saying climate change isn’t real, and Hitler is a liberal. Just want your opinions. Personally, I feel Joe did get triggered but I feel his outrage was justified. The argument was started when Crowder made a claim about how weed legalization in Colorado affected traffic accidents and Joe's producer, Jamie, then pulled up a couple articles debunking Crowder's claim. Joe was then triggered because Crowder refused to acknowledge the validity of Joe's and Jamie's sources and refused to give Jamie any sources providing evidence for his original claim. Joe may have overreacted but in my opinion the whole argument could've been avoided if only Steven would've just given Jamie his sources to look up and they could've gotten the facts straight. But in typical Crowder fashion, he got defensive and tried changing the subject. He claimed Joe was bullying him which then sparked a reaction from Joe because he was clearly not bullying Steven. But I would love to hear what you guys think so have at it.When I first saw his Change My Mind series, my immediate opinion of Crowder was that he is great at thinking on the spot and appears to be a great debater. I still hold this belief. 
My issue is that he includes interviews with random passersby. While he is prepared for the topic-of-the-day, any given stranger who decides to sit down has stumbled upon his table and thought it'd be fun to debate. Since he or she did not have prior plans to debate that day, their argumentative data may not be gathered on the spot as Steven's is.
He likes to call these little videos "conversations," yet if one were to click on any given part of the video, he is most likely the one talking. Instead of having a conversation, Steven likes to dominate the table and take on the role of an authoritative teacher - one who is both pompous and sanctimonious.
Arguments must always be outlined by definitions for their components. Steven seems to enjoy dodging questions that target is stance on specific topics. Specifically in his gun video, when asked by a woman whose name I am forgetting, Steven ducks when she asks a particular question regarding his position on a certain topic.
Instead of battling position against position, Steven likes to be presented with one's position on a certain argument, and actively disassemble it with every piece of evidence he possesses at his belt. 
You don't have to agree with me, but I'd love to hear your opinions.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEy0XuE0Kyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEy0XuE0Kyo)

I want to be clear, the dude Steven is going after is clearly a dunce. You of course can not threaten to slash someone's tires as that is an act of violence. I also have nothing wrong with Steven going to confront him, and the video itself is entertaining as hell. Don't treat this as a defense of the kid in the video, it really has nothing to do with them. I am talking about the title, not the video.

But the title is Transphobic.

# CROWDER CONFRONTS: Tire Slash Transgender!

Why is it relevant he is confronting a Transgender? This is flat out identity politics. The fact he is transgender has nothing to do with the fact he threatened to slash Steven's tires. Regardless of how you feel about the Gender issue, this title is lame. It signals to people who don't like Transgenders to come watch this kid get rekt (which they did). Compare to:

Crowder Confronts: Tire Slash Jew!

Crowder Confronts: Tire Slash Black!

Such titles are the definition of identity politics. The fact someone is Jewish, Black, White, Transgender, whatever  has nothing to do with whether they slash your tires.

tldr:

\- Video = neat

\-Title = Transphobicwatching "Trump is a fascist, change my mind"...  that first woman you interviewed is a leftist by religion.   to say that Obama had done anything wrong was an insult against one of the pantheon of her gods.Please, come here and "Change My Mind" with these trans people.

https://www.reddit.com/r/corvallis/comments/95sie7/this_seems_like_something_we_should_be_discussing/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=linkHe’s no leftistIt's pretty ironic to use  (triggered) in a title when describing Steven Crowder, after you were so outraged by him that you came to this sub to post it &gt;It's pretty ironic to use (triggered) in a title when describing Steven Crowder, after you were so outraged by him that you came to this sub to post it

Uh, "Triggered" is the name of the show... if you did the bare minimum of research before responding, by *actually clicking the link,* you'd know that. Although I should expect nothing less from a Crowder fan. Who needs work, research, or facts, when you have a snippy response to "win" your argument, right?

Pathetic, as expected &lt;3You sure are upset about being called out, and you've apparently dwelled on this for a while  My Alexa said everything Stevens did. Maybe they are not all the same. “Dwelled”

“Upset”

Sure. Some idiot Crowder fan not understanding that the name of a show is literally “Triggered” is pretty basic retardation. Just what I think the world would expect from Crowder fanboys. Not that I expect you actually followed the conversation here at all, you just know how to call people triggered and hope for reactions.

Of course nobody mentioned how *triggered* you were when you got offended by some speaker calling Jesus fictional because a neckbeard typed it in a wiki somewhere. I think the reason Crowder goes and finds stupid college SJWs is because he and his fans just like feeling smart, but don’t want a real challenge to get that feeling.My Alexa said your mom is dottyHe did a response on the Alexa video, Amazon changed the answers dumbassHis website is still free even if you aren't a mug club member. Most things he cites are from columns on his site with direct links to sources. I don't believe there is anything where he lists sources chronologically through a video but every source I've questioned while listening to his videos I've been able to find on his site usually in the columns:  www.louderwithcrowder.com U mad, bro?/u/rhinologicalthey have a free 30 day trial right now for the mugclub you could always just watch it thereI forgot to mention that my work pc has not been used to login to my YouTube account whereas my personal devices have.Googled it and found the video, for some reason the link that was sent to subscribers through YouTube claims the video is unavailable...https://youtu.be/yTu1s2mMGYI for anybody having the same issue! I think it's more important for us to identify what we don't agree with. I personally disagree with Steven Crowder on guns and I still appreciate his input and debate on it. I cannot say that he is infallible because his team behind him helps with his research. I would say Steven Crowder is trustworthy on the basis that he is trying to get to the truth and that his opinions are still developing.

I'm really glad to hear that you disagree with him on the melting ice. It shows that you're applying the knowledge that you know that Steven Crowder and his team might not know, or has a different set of evidence. I appreciate the thought!That's the best reply to someone raising a reasonable question I have read on Reddit.I only enjoy listening to him when he is a guest on Joe Rogan Experience. He acts a lot less of an ass when he isn't the one running things. Crowder twists words too much for my taste.how do you mean (aside from his usual "all leftists are mentally deficient, etc"yeah, idk youtube takes more time to load when I use an account that's subbed to steven but not when I use another that's only subbed to some airsoft channels (on mobile)explain pls, I require your knowledges /sThe videos he makes of "debunking " are  pretty dumb. Did you see the one he did on "gun show loop holes?" He claimed that they didn't exist and then walked into a gun store demanding he get a gun now because of the loophole. He never went to an actual gun show where, guess what, you can get a gun from a private seller without a background check or a wait. But he was completely oblivious to it.hmmm, interesting, okay then why would you say that someone would sell to you (a complete stranger) a gun when they are risking a potential felony and serious repercussions? Now, obviously if the gun owner knew you, like if he was your distant uncle or something, he'd probably do it low-key, and, even then, it'd still be quite risky because of the potential for a good Samaritan to see and report misuse to the authorities.Of course. That doesn't make the loophole non-existent though and I believe there a number of people who legally can't own a gun that would go about this process to get one. wait, correct me if I'm wrong, but if they can't legally own a gun... aren't there like much more cost-efficient (albeit not exactly safer) ways of getting their hands on a gun (considering the fact that they're doing illegal shit both ways)? 🤔I wouldn't know, but maybe. Again, this does not mean the loophole isn't there.you got any sources tho? considering the fact that I don't really know you or your motivations (srry m8 :/ but iss true)I wasn't challenging the information, I just was making sure that statistics were accurate. I know next to nothing on the subject of abortions. wait... what? lol I was asking 'bout the gun show loophole.... I was really tired when I wrote that, and it was meant for a different sub hahaAs for my motivations, I don't think I really have any. I just don't like his show because he is pretty ignorant. I think he is good for calling out extreme leftist groups, but not much else. Why wokld my motivations matter? Direct quote from Wikipedia:"Under federal law, private-party sellers are not required to perform background checks on buyers; whether at a gun show or other venue. They also are not required to record the sale, or ask for identification."But seriously, fuck leftists 

CROWDER  FOR LIFE

LIVE FREE OR DIE MOTHERFUCKERThat is so sad... D O N T T R E A D N I G G A
Name checks outKid spelled backwards is d-i-k

take that theistsAny links to said video?I am interested in this as well.
What is being referenced with this potholer55 person and Crowder's opinion on Climate change? https://youtu.be/qEylCS6-hBE

https://youtu.be/PrNmq4ouWww

https://youtu.be/VeOZSMrwnYw

I recommend watching all three if you want full context.
The debate never happened, Crowder chickened out. Links posted. Tell me what you think. And none of these videos and articles with false information have been taken down either. I completely agree with youKill yourselfHe's not the judge of funny. It's crowders opinion. Saying "no one likes him" I guess isn't accurate. But if seth meyers thing is just bashing trump, that's old already. 

I think crowder use to do stand up and now instead does live louder with crowder shows.

Crowder has looked like an ass on a few occasions. He's not perfect, but he is entertaining/funny and I think overall has some good ideas and stuff.

I think the change my mind segment on socialism being evil was disappointing.I really dislike it when we use "they aren't perfect" as a justification. Obviously no one is. I don't expect perfection. I do expect him though, as a grown adult, to be able to make more mature statements than the put downs he uses. mhm. I don't want him to use the lefts own tactics against them(Unless in a way to demonstrate how stupid it is). Even If I do like crowder.Exactly. Someone could make a successful YouTube career debunking him. I'm surprised no one has yet.What things has he said that you think could be debunked? I think overall he's pretty spot on.I haven't paying attention to his show as of late. When I did watch it though, one of the driving things that led me to stop was his lack in sources. He takes one thing and then just runs with it, applying his thought or feeling and not much data.he usually puts up an overlay of his source and it gets posted on his website as far as I know. Can always google it yourself too. It's good to be skeptical though.I am going to start watching his show again even though I know I'll be getting a headache from it. I want to have active practice in fact checking and calling out narratives.What narratives? I don't mean that facetiously. 

Like gun rights type stuff? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoEFXuzTa_I what do you think of this one?I don't disagree with this one. Crowder is useful for calling out extreme points of view. However, did you see him talk about when Trump tweeted over banning trans people? He had the audacity first state he doesn't think he could be capable of serving in the military, and then goes and judges every trans person who already does a fine job. How do you do that?Can you link me the video? I don't think I've seen that one.

After work I'll find it. Don't have the time right nowI agree, I thought when I first saw him he was alright even tho I didn't always agree with him, but seeing him lose his cool in that socialism segment and him throwing the toys out of the cot over Michelle wolf made me realize he is almost as sensitive as the people he likes to bait.Wow, hadn't seen this, I haven't finished watching but far out, yea that is a demolishion of Crowder's points so far.It only gets worse. Far out, I got pleasure from Crowder owning idiots, now I'm going to get even more pleasure from smart people owning Crowder.I'm not familiar with the Michelle wolf thing.

As an entertainer I really like him. I reckon there has been a little bit of a shift where his tactics are going a bit....off.. Almost like a loss of humbleness? I really like louder with crowder, the crew is cool. The show is fun and smart-assey. I hope they can pull it back a bit.

That said.... I think it was crowder mocking other comedians for not being funny, but their viewerbase going "Yeah stick it to 'em!" on a political level. 

That's kinda why i like crowder, but there are also genuinely funny parts. It's all a bit hypocritical. He's trying to be too many things, like... he has a message, but he wants to tell it with snarky, smartassey humour. Which then makes it a bit like a political "yeh u tell them!" type of message.

Hard to explain. Still a huge fan though.

edit. but then we're just being bitchy nitpickers. can't be perfect.. meh.I agree, his reaction to the Socialism kid was cringe to the max.   His campus visit teaching students About firearms was one of the of the most enjoyable.Smart rebuttal. How long did it take you to right that?That’s Crowder in a nutshell. If you have even the slightest knowledge of the subject he avoids you like the plague.Abortion for sure.I don't think we can trust this guy at all. He's extremely biased and he doesn't hide that fact. Because of this he can often be very misleading. I don't know if he's purposely misleading people or if his confirmation bias is the culprit, but either way I wouldn't trust him. I don't think anyone should rely on someone so biased for news.Here are the links to both the full podcast and a video that is just the arguement. I recommend listening to the entire podcast, however.

https://youtu.be/gd0oSNjHf1AHey, AxiomaticParadox, just a quick heads-up:  
**arguement** is actually spelled **argument**. You can remember it by **no e after the u**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.Thanks for looking out broThe change my mind series whilst good on paper really doesn't work in practice. He is often debating people who have no appear to be unprepared, caught in a spur of the moment type thing whilst he is sitting there with a stack of notes and a plan. In this regard he does do well on more emotive topics like gender and all the identity politics but on some of the issued like gun control I think he would be completely destroyed if he had to go up against experts who had time to prepare notes and speech like he had.That’s very true Except for euroI understand where you're coming from and looking at it, it doesn't make complete sense to go to unprepared people and debate. But also, when you have a strong enough point of view on topics and choose to sit down and debate about it, you should have enough knowledge to at least coherently explain your side. And that does get hard when his rebuttals are prepared and he refuses to talk if he believes they have no common ground (one of his abortion videos he does this). I enjoy his videos nonethelessYou're right in saying that if you feel strongly about a certain topic you should be able to argue for it. However, I've found it in my case that even if strong beliefs or staunch support are present, the words to articulate them are not all the time. Perhaps my dislike toward Steven is a reflection of my own shortcomings with regards to the art of rhetoric.

Also, yeah in the abortion one he discredits that one woman's argument since her backing came from her own personal experience. Unfortunately, he also does this to take away from the kids from Parkland that adovcate for gun control, saying that their emotions kind of decrease the effectiveness of their argumentative. 

Thanks for your comment.This interview showed more about how Crowder is a whiny little bitch when cornered. 

Couple it with his 'SOCIALISM IS EVIL' change my mind and you see what a disingenuous prick Crowder is. He turns into a bully in that one. THAT is bullying. Not what Rogan did. Climate change, guns (OK about pro-gun rights but he is *obsessed*), government funded healthcare (as long as it isn't mandated, some more lifesaving options that don't bankrupt the relative poor would be good and it *does* actually work in plenty of countries), religion.  I also find him rather arrogantly ignorant and often factually wrong about world history - he has a more mythological idea of America's role in it and how America came about, than a realistic one. He also does get way too tribalistic: saying "I would almost find common ground with [thing we could agree with] but then you all go and [espouse some extreme left wing view]!" as though the fact that some leftists are super unreasonable means he can never find seek an actual truthful fair middle ground, like it's a game. Also why he fawningly interviews Ted Nugent right after a rant about how the #MeToo movement is just Hollywood projecting on the rest of America (I mean... Ted Nugent?). 

I like: his calling out far leftist bullshit and its media and campus dominance, his patriotism, his consistency about not giving Trump a free pass either, much of his stance on socialism, radical feminism,  abortion, free speech, "real" Islam, and his refusal to let people shit on cops or the military. He's also funny and a great actor - I often laugh even when I don't agree with him. Though the rants and sketches all about his internal struggles with YouTube are getting tiresome - I want content, not meta-content. Can you explain *how* he enables unintelligent people to appear more informed? Your post described a flawed and (maybe) dishonest debate technique he uses to drive the conversation in the way he wants it to go, but it didn't address the claim made in your title. Lol I agree, I'm down with Steven Crowder on most of his subjects he covers.  It's a place to discuss him. Most people on Reddit lean left, so naturally most posts will not be pro Crowder. It's a place for discussion. Not simply sycophantic fans on the right who agree with literally everything he says or does or for trolls on the left for who just gratuitously shit on him. It's about "Steven Crowder" and everything he entails and everyone's free to say what they want of him.Every single issue. Change my mind What do you mean by this, can you explainExpired link :( make sure to set it not to expire!isn’t that the point of change my mind? to see how good these people are at debating and seeing if they can work around crowders debating style?I think that is the point of change my mind. It’s showing that if you go into debates with no prior research and knowledge you will get absolute fucking owned and your arguments will be completely ripped apart.Then it should be called "Watch me own you" instead of CMM if he's not genuinely open to having his mind changed.I’d say climate change because I think that we haven’t collected data on climate change long enough to give a solid answer but I agree with him on everything else.I have to agree. I’m a fan of Crowder, and I’ve been for a few years now, but his style is far to aggressive. He comes off as wanting to prove them wrong rather than change their minds, which we all know is the real point of the segment (at least, it should be). He says things that discredit him because they come off as half-cocked or just too aggressive/belittling in the name of comedy. It’s fine, his style is his style, but I feel like he could do better. The episodes I've seen (male privilege and 2 genders), he's been continuously talked over and the guest have had a sever lack of argument skills. 

An example was during the 2 genders episode, the guest said something to the effect of, "multiple genders isn't a new concept, there are other countries that have already practiced it." 

He rebuttaled with, "other countries have also practiced slavery, that's not an argument."

" Wow, I can't believe you just compared being nonbianry with slavery"

**Of course** it's going to seem like he isn't open to his mind being changed when you have people trying to convert him without the ability to actually articulate an argument.

I completely get where you're coming from about the stats, but when you can't even get a basic argument out you shouldn't have sat down.Crowder sees telling people the truth and hard facts aren't going to solely change there mind. Unlike a lot of people, he listens to there argument, understands it, and tries to show them the flaws in their logic so he can present his logic that makes sense with there flaws present. With this method, hopefully, he will change there mind. (Or just find common ground)Can anyone point me towards him chickening out of a debate? I always liked the fact he seems gun ho to debate anyone he even says he would do it with anyone but now he avoids this guy? sources?https://youtu.be/VeOZSMrwnYw

[thread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/6veu8u/steven_crowder_backs_out_of_potholer54_debate/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=comment_list) 

You’ll notice that Crowder has deleted all of his bs responses. Nobody loves you, leave.Gotta love that Ad homI think the intention of the video is to inform viewers rather than actually change the mind of the debaters. He wants the audience to see both sides of the argument and see how his arguments are solid and the other side usually has weak arguments. Where do you get your news from then? (Assuming your source isn't a biased one)I just check multiple sources. I don't really trust anybody. If I see a headline or hear something from someone, I Google it and if multiple sources all say the same thing, then I tend to believe it.Thought the point of the segment was for them to change his mind... not Crowder changing their mind. It’s labeled as that, but based upon how the show is structured and his responses, it usually seems more like the invitation to change his mind is a way to attempt to change their minds without knowing, or at least without initially directly stating, as to appear more approachable. Its over, get outgood for you, some ppl struggle with video games i hope you wont. It's been the bane of my existence for quite some time. When you've been trying to tell your wife it's her duty to fuck you but she still says no. Ben Shapiro has gotten big. Isn’t transphobia the fear of transgender people it has phobia in its name which is a fear. Plus transphobic is too general of a term, people like Gavin McInnes and Ben Shapiro are labeled transphobic so is Steven, need more info on it being transphobia The aforementioned people just refuse to engage and legitimatize a mental illness. Crowder’s colleague, Sven Computer has stated he identifies as a computer to show how absurd it is that just to believe you are something doesn’t make it so. There is no true scientific evidence that shows that just because one feels a certain way that makes them whatever they feel like. (See Crowder’s video on debunking Gender Theory) I know I could be labeled as transphobic and that I hate trans people. Do I hate Rachel Dolezal or WoahVicky for thinking they’re black? (I hate WoahVicky for separate and obvious reasons) No, I just wouldn’t acknowledge that they are black just because they feel like they are. 

Edit: Also, is the person in the video not transgender? How is it transphobic to call someone what they call themselves? It’s simply a descriptor. In response to your edit, would you title it "Crowder confronts straight man" every time he confronted a straight man about anything? Yeah if in some alternate universe Crowder was gay and someone was threatening to slash his tires for being gay and wanting to discuss the threat. All about context.Remember everyone. Steven comes from a political war where they lost. He understands better than the average American the ignorance involved.

Human to human, would it not be incredibly irritating to watch a human try to convince you of a truth that;

a) you've already rebutted successfully this argument, but still have to respectfully listen to them

b) you've already seen the outcome of these arguments, but you still have to respectfully listen to them

Very rarely did Steven experience someone whom gave him a genuine challenge intellectually. Actually wait.. I don't remember any?

Would you not as a human whom is incredibly passionate about keeping a healthy world, attempt to change and open the ignorant person's mind? The point of |Change My Mind| isn't necessarily strictly about people trying to change Steven's mind, it's about him being open to it, yes, but he has made it very clear, it is about having an honest conversation. Forgive me but this isn't true. Inherently, the the right side is silent and shut down. As far as I've been able to tell, most of the internet leans Centrist truly.GTFO from the internet and maybe read up on some feminist literature?Maybe it's labeled 
A: as the person in question identifies
B: to show that the transgender in question (who is coming from a camp desperately seeking approval and acknowledgement) is in fact not tolerant themselves and quite obviously deserved to be pointed out.

Crowder might be an asshole on some people's eyes but he's armed with facts (guns) and isn't calling for violence himself.
Seems to me he's just trying to educate and maybe learn a thing himself.It's pretty frustrating watching these people with catchy headline pseudo facts, who go about blurting nonsense.

I'm surprised he doesn't get more angry.

Dumb people need to read books before teaching others their fucking bullshitYes. Point billsladdyNobody has, that bald leader of the trans movement was incredibly uneducated and likely filling the heads of impressionable kids with utter horseshit.

So frustrating to watch, I admire him for not pointing out the fact that thing was about as repulsive as they come..
My vagina dries up at the site of that thingNot even weak arguments.. They're simply naive and righteous about misinformation.

They base their identities on pseudo facts and Cherry picked articles that simply don't hold up to real Science and reasoning.

Banned for different beliefs..!!!Wait what..This. If he's the conservative in question (Crowder) he is informed.

Lots of those people who debate him appear to be to be righteous supporters (the trans blob with the shaven head and the girl that came on after her boss to argue gender stats)

The problem isn't they aren't prepared, be intellectually honest here, they can't come prepared there are no facts to back up their claims, you can't refute biology. It's just simply true. 

So I think you're wrong here, he doesn't edit the videos and he tries to stay within scientific realm as opposed to the people he talks to being in the (I wish things were this way because my whole identity relies on it) crowdTurned into a bully after that little weak kid was being snyde.

Maybe you're a pussy but when people get rude, get rude.

Fucking whinerSure.. Don't worry about condoms. You can just murder babies later!If women have the right to give life, they should have the right to take that life before the fetus becomes 20 weeks old.They don't have the right to give life, they have the ability.

So if what you're saying holds water.

A man has the ability (right as you called it) to murder another human being.. Should he?Having children is a basic human right. If we can't agree on that then idk how far this conversation can go. 

However, while a man does contribute to the creation of a fetus, the burden of developing the fetus is entirely dependent on the woman. So the decision to abort a fetus or not should be entirely up to the woman. And if she can create the life, she should have the right to end the life. But as soon as the fetus is able to survive without the mother (this is usually around 20 weeks) then the mother should no longer have the right to end the fetus' life.What if the man really wants to raise that kid. She should kill it over enduring pregnancy?

Totally up to her no gray area, just take loads and kill babies that's it?The gray area would be if there was some kind of agreement between the man and woman in which both parties agreed to have a baby. In cases like that, the woman could possibly not be allowed to terminate the pregnancy.

But if no agreements were made prior to conception, it's all up to the woman.The biggest thing Crowder and I agree about is the fact that giving abortion as an option (for any woman who is not raped so don't bring that excuse up) pushes an idea that if you make a big mistake (getting pregnant because sex especially unprotected sex is not a RIGHT!!) you can just pay some money and make it go away. because you should just be able to give the courts $1000 to make that pesky DWI/manslughter charge dissapear, you know FUCK the family of the victim. I mean WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO ACTIONS HAVE FUCKING CONSEQUENCE!!!!Ultimately he is human and makes mistakes that is why he encourages people to double check his sources.
For instance when he had Abby Johnson on to talk about her negetive experience as a planned Parenthood employee, when I did the research she probably made most of it up, but that's not entirely his fault. And of course he even admits his bias so ultimately it is up to you the viewer to do the reaserch yourself. Duh.Abortion isn't murder or manslaughter though. It's not the same as you or I shooting or stabbing someone to death. Yes a fetus is a human life, but the difference between a fetus and another human being is the fact that another human being isn't dependent at all on my body. I have no justification to kill another person unless it's to defend myself or someone else. However, there are at least two justifications for women to kill their fetuses. 1) the fetus is entirely dependent on the woman. It's literally part of the woman's body. If the woman doesn't want the fetus to be part of her body, she should have the right to get rid of it. 2) getting rid of the fetus is kind of like defending herself. Pregnancy can create all sorts of dangers to the woman's life. If a woman doesn't want to face those dangers, she should be able to terminate the pregnancy.I also have a hard time with some of Crowders "labels." I think he's a smart, intelligent and articulate person, who just can't break away from acting and sounding like a "bro" sometimes. I'm honestly on board with some of his politics and have had my mind changed about a few things, but when I hear words like "fag" and "tranny" tumble out of his mouth so easily, I'm left not wanting to hear what he has do say...wether his points are valid or not. 

People that take pride in being a dick are really doing a disservice to themselves and all the work they put into researching, studying and articulating their topics. In defense of his "CROWDER CONFRONTS: Tire Slash Transgender" video label, the whole controversy surrounding the initial threats were within the theme of his "There are only two Genders: Change My Mind" segment. So, I can see why the fact that the person was/is trans was mentioned. That being said, he did take a few shots during the video that were kinda low...like "Owning up to your crimes is part of being a MAN." (parapharsed)

That's the type of language that exposes him of ad hominem and may detract from his mission of having civil discourse. You just can't have civil discourse when mocking someones gender or using slurs. You also can't have civil discourse when people threaten to bomb your van or slash your tires...so there's that. Violent threats are way way worse than being mean to someone with words... Yooo lmao A. Abortion isn't murder in your opinion.

B. So if a fetus is dependent on the mother is one of your arguments, then you would be fine with a mother murdering her handicaped child because he would never be able to support himself without her help?

B2. Here we go the stupidest argument that pro-choicers (a name for a group of people which I find ironic because when a woman CHOOSE to have sex she is then agreeing to any and all negetive consequences ie infections and pregnancy that her CHOICE results in) come up with the whole "my body my choice" argument is idiotic because when a woman chooses to have sex she is agreeing to rent out space in her uterus. Duh.

C. You completely missed the biggest problem I have with abortion (as it is currently) is that it promotes an idea that in some cases actions DON'T have consequences. The hypothetical statement of a drunk driver being able to pay off the courts was meant specifically to point out another situation where someone avoided consequences of their stupid actions  and how that could be a negetive. This hypothetical works because in both situation niether person is going out of their way to make the outcome(pregnancy/drunk driving and manslughter) happen but their choices (having sex/driving drunk) were their choices and they should have to live with that.

P.s. rape and a fetus presenting any true* danger to the mental or physical health to a woman, I agree should be the exception. 

*When I say true danger I don't mean, oh man I don't have the time, money, nor desire to carry a child at this time(which make up the vast majority of aborted pregnancies).&gt;then you would be fine with a mother murdering her handicaped child because he would never be able to support himself without her help?

No. You misunderstood what I meant by "entirely dependent". What I meant was that the fetus is literally feeding off the body of the mother. Anything that happens to the mother will directly affect the fetus in some way. If the mother dies, so does the fetus.

However, this isn't the case with a handicapped child. Yes, the child may never be able to take care of itself properly, but the child isn't entirely dependent on the mother. Hypothetically, anyone who's competant can take care of the child. The mother could put that child up for adoption or something and wouldn't have to be responsible for it. Therefore, the child isn't dependent on the mother and the mother has no right to kill it.

&gt;when a woman chooses to have sex she is agreeing to rent out space in her uterus

No. By that same logic, I can say,"When you go to a restaurant, you're choosing to risk that the cooks might undercook your food, giving you food poisoning. If you get food poisoning, you just have to deal with it and you have nobody to blame but yourself."I'll give you the handicaped child argument, I'm no willing to split hairs about that part of the argument.

And yes if you choose to eat food that you didn't grow, prepare, and cook yourself you are taking the chance that the person who did any of those things for you did them wrong. The difference is if you get food poisoning and you were to go crazy and go and get your stomach pumped you aren't harming a living thing where as if you were to get knocked up and go crazy and get an abortion you ARE murdering a living being. The big difference in those two senario is if you don't use protection, you don't do the pull out method, and both people have perfect reproductive health the chances of getting pregnant are significantly higher than say going to a five star restaurant and getting food poisoning. If a young woman tells her mom "I'm gonna have sex with my boyfriend (for the first time)" her mother will probably say something along the lines of "be carful use protection so you don't get an STD or pregnant". But if she were to tell her mother "mom I'm gonna go eat at hell's kitchen" her mom more than likely will not tell her"bring a vomit bag and a pair of backup underware" no of course not because eating at a restaurant is not synonymous with your gonna get the shits, but having sex IS synonymous with STDs and pregnancy.I almost completely agreeGuns, but I'm british, so get that I might not get it. Nah I think he's fine TBH.But fr what’s his name G. Morgan Jr.  he cool.He jokes are shit tho.
Maybe 1/5 are good. Omg I thought it was just meLoll yea his jokes are so shit
Sometimes I just wish he would have been quiet insteadThe wine Snob Guy?What a fucking cunt. I absolutely agree with you. I’m not a subscriber of this sub, this is actually my first time on it. I’m glad I’m not the only one who thinks this.

Differing opinions are fine, but he’s a 10/10 on the button pusher scale. He clearly has an extremely strong agenda other than exploring logic. He doesn’t seem to understand that one “says” something in ways other than words. He’s a scared child and obviously hurting on the inside. I’m confident the little popularity he has will fade pretty fast.For one, the topic of whether or not it’s acceptable to be a brash asshole to another human being.No, you cannot trust the stranger you met on the internet. Of course he isn't. I thought it was funny though that he is backing down to masses instead of making a stand for who he is as a person. If his character isn't one who cheats on his spouse and remains faithful, then he should embrace that and express that. Nobody cares about your winePresumptuous much?If I remember correctly, Crowder's position on weed is more or less "eh.. Do what you want. It's not hurting anybody." But Joe zeroed in on his one stipulation of a study that showed an increase in traffic accidents involving marijuana. Which (again, if I remember correctly) Crowder couldn't remember the specifics or source of. Then, both Joe and Jamie just started flinging any and all pro marijuana arguments at him. Crowder said several times, in a deescalating tone "I said it's the main right wing point I could care less about"(ish). 

I think Joe was drunk and hopped up on pipe tobaccy, got fired up about a topic that's important to him, and just got drunkenly argumentative. 

Joe was drunk, Crowder brought up a topic he's passionate about, things got a little out of hand. Sounds like a lot of Thanksgiving dinners.You don't get itBeep boop. Thank you for championing for my people. Beep boop beep.Who is Quill and what is IWQuill is the Starlord character ( who's funny mostly but he got emotional and  spoiled the whole master attack on the final boss ) and IW stands for Infinity Wars ( the latest Avengers movie ) 

I'm sorry if I didn't get the sarcasm , but I can't be sure if you genuinely wanted to know or is it just a joke Well I thought it was political or so etching since it was on this subHaha no no it isn't Have you actually seen a change my mind video, it's really mostly him being interrupted by self righteous social justice warriors who complain about the simplest things such as using the wrong pronouns like in the there are only 2 genders video with the girl that was "non binary" who idiotically stated that using the wrong pronouns for someone could raise their chance of murder. Where is her evidence to support this, she described using the wrong pronouns to be an act of violence. Where is the violence.  People who use the wrong pronoun aren't purposefully putting these people in "danger"See, this is why feminists get the bad rap, third waves like you decide to tell people to leave or that their opinion is wrong because they believe "their feelings have been hurt", so suck it up and understand that there are other opinions. Now to leave on a positive note, have a fan-freaking-tastic day with you and your opinionThat video is an exception and I agree 100%And then there's the Male privilege is a lie, he was swearing, yelling, just being overall rude for all the time he was up thereAnd then you come in here with the title pretty much portraying all conservatives as idiots, and misinformed. Both conservatives and liberals have the possibility to be misinformed. I've met my fair share of idiotic liberals, some with conservatives. Your political standpoint does not determine your intelligence, it really only says what kind of person you areWell hey, they worry about labels so much we might as well use them.I doubt Crowder reads this sub.The only people that like her are fat blue haired land whales I can help with thatNot really a phobia thing more of a basic beginner biology thingYou can't speak logic when someone's so damn selfriceous they truly think the world owes them a "special title". You guys mama was wrong... no-one gives a shit what you think, you don't always get a trophy and you actually have to workto obtain success. Big government (contrary to your belief) can't fix everything. You have your opinion, I have mine. And that's OKThis is what college women think? hahahaha I've always thought minorities are more racist, today I was proved right once again.I've watched this debate like 5 times and it still baffles me how densely ignorant those girls areIt doesn't surprise me that he puts words in the wrong peoples' mouths. I see that happen quite a bit with conservatives and their political memes. You should look up the phrase: "confirmation bias" Has he ever actually let someone change his mind? From all the videos I’ve watched he might’ve changed how  he views their opinions but everything I’ve heard him say was trueI don't think he's spoken to anyone articulate or educated enough to actually change his mind.

Not saying "lol evry1 he talks 2 is stoopid" but the people he talks to haven't had the same amount of time he has to think about and defend their beliefs. Not to mention the fact that the purpose of this series isn't *really* to change anyone's mind - it's to exercise speaking with someone you disagree with without devolving into a shrieking animal (much like the first girl.)“True” is a dangerous word in issues that have these extreme polar view points. Not enough people on either side realize these are view points and opinions. Even the statistics for both sides are generally “true”. I don't think he does, for security reasons. He teases the location, but never explicitly states where he's going. Her feeling were true to herself but the facts stated other wise show that rape is not tolerated by our society and therefore rape culture does not exist. Guarantee he doesn't look at this sub. Or reddit for that matter. What does it mater to you? Let them be themselves if they aren’t happy down the toad it’s their fault.Why would you assume that he posts every minute he shoots. We only see the ones that are entertaining. Well for me it doesn’t matter if he does get meaningful content if he doesn’t post it. I wanna see him actually debate someone who knows what they’re talking about. It gets old seeing him annihilate stupid people all the time and by not posting meaningful discussion it sort of negates the whole purpose of his channel. Not entirely. The people he talks to, debates and even destroys in opinion and fact are everyday people who can still vote. These are thousands upon thousands of people who have been (whilst some are deliberately ignorant) misinformed. It makes total sense to chat to these people to debunk their misinformed opinions. It’d be great to see Steven debate somebody who has their points prepared but as he’s proven, they don’t want to or simply can’t articulate their points. Lord knows he’s trying to talk to people. Can’t say the same about people on the far left. Prime example is the false allegation smear campaign from the lefty professor. I’m not trying to attack steven in any way. I don’t think the people he talks to can articulate their own points well enough for him to debunk them, and most of them just get frustrated to a point where they stop communicating effectively at all. I would rather see him debate someone who can at least put up a solid argument for their own beliefs. It's cause Crowder is a shill. what is thatan accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage othersThat’s fair. I would like to see that too. He is very capable. I know what he is trying to do with his current format however. He’s just highlighting the misinformed opinions of many people of the left. Especially kids as they’ve been very heavily led astray. Our common ground is seeing a great debate with someone prepared for Steven crowder. Something like Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson does. Because he's on college campus which is loaded with individuals who don't know what they're talking aboutFrightening, isn't it?I have three letters for you: SEO. This is how he makes a living and might be one of the few videos he can monetize.From my experience the latter. Criticism is healthy and should be encouraged to further progress but I haven't heard a shred of the productive kind here.It's so that he catches people unprepared for any serious in depth discussion while he has binders of hand picked seemingly irrefutable facts on the table next to him. If anyone does start speaking sense he goes for a gotcha question or more often than not plays the victim by saying he's "not being allowed to talk" when HE is one holding the microphone. Completely gay and lame.

You know what the real truth of Steven Crowder is? He shares all the exact same opinions/ideology of the Old Guard conservative Washington insiders, except if THEY were speaking this shit young people would be turned off by it. But because Crowder is a Dudebro he gets a free pass and kids suddenly think he's "woke". He's anti pot, anti gay, abstinence only, anti freedom, all these things and I'm just scratching my head like how does that appeal to anyone? Because the truth is he can't honestly have a "real" discussion with anyone. His entire shtick is having a hard line position and then backing that up with handpicked facts and then he plays the victim the moment those facts are refuted. Add a little "magic of television" and then rinse and repeat.

If Crowder was to debate someone like, let's say, Aron Ra on religion in a formal debate he'd be annihilated. Read my last few comments. Everyone there in the room is there for one reason: to make the drivel pouring from Steven's mouth appear sensible. Notice after Steven says anything It's a quick cut to each individual all nodding their heads as if they just couldn't agree more! That fat neckbeard in particular, I see the sadness in his eyes. He wonders why his life has come to this. Put another way, they refuse to accept human beings that are different from them.Ding ding! We have a winner!I seriously wonder what kinds of conversations him and his wife have. Like, does she enjoy him after hearing the stuff that comes out of him sometimes?i agree but there are some informed individuals on college campuses and you’d think an opportunity to speak in an open forum type conversation would attract them. guess not, it only attracts sjw types who haven’t thought through their own arguments. You are correct, because the informed individuals don't like to here themselves speak as much as these clowns. He usually attracts crowds but the loudest and most obnoxious of the bunch usually make their way into that chair.Same with liberals We live in a society. **BOTTOM TEXT**This bimbo is hilariously ignorant No offence, but do you hear yourself? They are “real” topics with “real” people. He debunks their misconceptions, not with “handpicked facts”, BUT with THE FACTS. Just because you don’t agree with him doesn’t make the “facts” wrong. Remember, there’s his opinion, your opinion and then there’s “fact” which he brings to the table time and time again. As for the “the magic of television”, all his debates and conversations are unedited. You won’t find that on CNN, MSNBC, ABC, FOX and many others. Do you wanna know the biggest difference between figureheads on the central to right versus far left? (Hell, even liberal is the enemy to far left now) the centre to right don’t go into a conversation looking to “annihilate” the opposing view/person. Crowder would more likely have a discussion with Aron with some heated disagreements, but there’d be no attempt to humiliate on Stevens part. The left mostly want to ruin people’s lives because they can’t get their own way, and when they look silly and humiliated, it’s off their own volition, from their own ill informed opinions and misconceptions. 
So maybe think beyond the likes and views on YouTube and look at what Steven is trying to do for the new generation. Bridging the gaps between people. Bringing facts so people can inform themselves to create their own opinions and not ones that were given to them. I would suggest stop giving her limelight. This is exactly what she wants, positive or negative. Well everyone should know how much of an asshole she is Facts are true but can be used to suggest a reality that might not exist.

His "only 1 in 1900 women are raped" only refers to cases where a man has been found convicted of a rape and sent to jail for it. It doesn't account for rapes where the attacker got away. 

So yes, it is true, not a lie, but it's disingenuous. Crowder is a disingenuous guy. He has to be. His narrow ideology forces him to In other words he used a fact to minimize rape as a crime in the name of making young straight men into the REAL victims, see?Well yes, that’s correct. 1 in 1900 for conviction rates. That doesn’t point to a “rape culture”. no western and developed nation condones rape. His video was to debunk the myth that somehow rape is tolerated in the USA, let alone on any campus. He didn’t say it doesn’t occur, he didn’t say he’s for it and he didn’t say doesn’t sympathise with “actual” victims of rape. There’s nothing narrow about his ideology. The sheer fact he’s willing to talk to anyone and confront people in a civil manner, speaks volumes about his ideas, and that is applied by millions of others in Judeo-Christian culture, no matter how strictly devout they are. The presumption of innocence applies to all, unless proven otherwise. That applies to rape or any other action and crime. There aren’t enough hands and faces in the world to facepalm at the preposterousness of that statement. Men are the victim when a WOMAN make a false allegation against a MAN or when a MAN is raped by a WOMAN. The same applies to a woman. This isn’t a sexist issue. His FACTS don’t minimise rape, they minimise the fear mongering that there is a rape culture that is accepted and is happening in epic proportions everyday. That is not true, and evidence backs that up. Those are REAL facts. Everything aside, if someone makes a rape claim, how do you get to the truth of that without some tangential belief or at least benefit of the doubt? If she says "he raped me behind the barn" and the cop says, "well, only 1 in 1900 women get raped, and I'd sure hate to falsely accuse someone of it, I'm not even gonna go look because he's innocent until proven guilty and since no one else saw it my default position must be that you're lying."

That's all of this to it's logical conclusion: ultimately it is better for someone to be raped than falsely accused of it. So the next sob story you hear about getting raped just remember there was someone out there who's life was ruined by an accusation. All that happened to you was a violent sexual assault. &gt;abstinence only,

He said contraceptives are great in his last video...

&gt;anti freedom

Not at all.

&gt;anti pot,

Not like its illegal or anything...

Everything you said is either conjecture or verifiably false.

He doesn't say the location so people don't firebomb him.Well that’s how the system works. If an accusation is brought forward to the proper authorities, then they will investigate. However, when the authorities question the victim, they must bring forward some evidence so the authorities have a lead in which they follow up to correctly identify the perpetrator. If no evidence is presented, then no one can be arrested. 

Evidence is paramount, and this just doesn’t apply to rape cases. It applies to all crimes. You can’t justify the minority to dictate the majority. It seems to me this really only happens to women in the context of rape and sexual assault. If someone robs my house the cops don't ask me what I was wearing or how much I had to drink. The system we have now seems to run on an assumption that the rape was somehow deserved. Crowder has said if he could vote to legalise weed he would vote no which means he's fine with people going to jail for a plant which feels pretty anti freedom to me. In his rape culture is a myth video the kid couldn't articulate rape culture but I can: better to be raped than falsely accused, women as liars by default, an investigation process which puts the woman on trial for her own rape.

It's set up by men to protect men plain and simple. It's a culture that praises sex for men and condemns sex for women. The kid couldn’t articulate rape and by your statement, neither can you. Consensual sex is not rape and agreeing to sex and regretting afterwards is also not rape.

And which women has been on trial?

If a person (man or woman, because rape isn’t a gendered issue) presents no evidence, then authorities must be sceptical of both sides until evidence is given. 

This is why due process exists. People lie. Men and women lie. Evidence is paramount. It’s simple. And just to be clear, in case this was your point. You said you can articulate it better than the kid on Steven Crowder’s show. You made something up to describe “rape culture” then debunked your own definition with this statement. I’ll say it again, consensual sex is not rape. 

Aaaaaaand just to solidify the point, I’ve watched a few chick flicks with the wife. Women praise each other for having sex ALL THE TIME. I think you’ve confused wonderful western nations with the Middle East. It is a drug...Jared was the only good oneMaybe to educate...?They might ask if your door was locked, or how long you were out, or what was taken, you know, things relevant to a burglary investigation. Didn't he upload a video where he argued on the topic of socialism is evil and actually got faced with a guy who knew what he was talking about?

Like 1/4 in he was already switching the topic or asking for more definitions, interrupting or making a big fuss out of something.Ah. So what the woman was wearing is relevant because maybe that's why she was raped? Her victim just couldn't help himself as he fell into her Venus Man-trap? What a slut, right?he made a big fuss about the guy using some term he didn’t like and kicked him outIf you have to pretend I said something before you can argue with me, you're not actually arguing with me.So is ibuprofen.Ibuprofen is a legal over the counter drug. Don't be a smartassYou left the door open my friendo ;PMulticulturalism will never work because cultures will mix? Because extremists exist? Hmm.What do you mean the right side is inherently silent and shut down? You can thank the left for this.

Show them on Nov 6th we wont fuck aroundI wonder why the media doesn’t talk about these types of stories? Ridiculous Go to the dean of students, lay out your case very plainly without acting angry These people are cancer.I’m concerned he’s gonna feel the same way. I just don’t understand how I’m not allowed to have an opinion anymore. Get real familiar with Karen Straughan. Learn how to use their logic against them. That's about all you can do I think. Shapiro talks about how, in his undergrad, he wrote like a liberal just to appease the teacher and get good grades. Fucked that people have to do that.

I wrote a paper laying out how stalin ended up killing more people under his brutal rule than hitler killed people in the holocaust. Teacher gave me a 63% when I wrote it out very well, sited my sources and followed the ruebrick to a T. She said my topic was inappropriate and that I should apply myself in different subjects of writing.

You could try shooting an email over to Shapiro or crowder and ask for their advice, they seem to reply to fans fairly often.Go to the dean and talk to the professor. Ask why you got a 50 just cause your views are different. The beginning of this semester I debated a far left liberal professor I have because he was just spitting so many lies I felt I had to say something. He had no rebuttal and he just shut me down completely. I gave him statistics to refute his point and he said “statistics dont matter.” Like what???? Now I just write/say what I know he wants to hear cause I’m scared of failing. It really sucks that in college classes, a place that’s meant for actually challenging ideas, doesn’t ever want to hear the other side. On another note: You're not meant to have an opinion. Opinions don't belong in essays. You're meant to let your research guide you. You start with an essay question, you research the question and you let the research tell you what the answer is. Similarly, the person marking the paper should do so without bias. All that should matter is that your research meets the standard.Agree with this, however the point of the essay was to give your own opinion against the topics that were chosen for us. So essentially I got baited when one of the topics was feminism. Oh, OK. It's important to remember that feminism isn't altogether wrong. It's the current manifestation of the ideology that is problematic. I'm interested in reading your essay and your professors feedback if you're willing to upload it somewhere and share the link.
